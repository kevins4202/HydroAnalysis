15445,effluents of wastewater treatment plants can impact microbial communities in the receiving streams however little is known about the role of microorganisms in wastewater as opposed to other wastewater constituents such as nutrients and micropollutants we aimed therefore at determining the impact of wastewater microorganisms on the microbial diversity and function of periphyton key microbial communities in streams we used a flow through channel system to grow periphyton upon exposure to a mixture of stream water and unfiltered or ultra filtered wastewater impacts were assessed on periphyton biomass activities and tolerance to micropollutants as well as on microbial diversity our results showed that wastewater microorganisms colonized periphyton and modified its community composition resulting for instance in an increased abundance of chloroflexi and a decreased abundance of diatoms and green algae this led to shifts towards heterotrophy as suggested by the changes in nutrient stoichiometry and the increased mineralization potential of carbon substrates an increased tolerance towards micropollutants was only found for periphyton exposed to unfiltered wastewater but not to ultra filtered wastewater suggesting that wastewater microorganisms were responsible for this increased tolerance overall our results highlight the need to consider the role of wastewater microorganisms when studying potential impacts of wastewater on the receiving water body graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stream biofilm prokaryotes eukaryotes dna metabarcoding micropollutants pollution induced community tolerance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps represent a major source for surface water pollution in urban areas potentially leading to negative consequences for the structural and functional integrity of aquatic communities in the receiving streams gessner and tlili 2016 stamm et al 2016 vörösmarty et al 2010 effluents from wwtps typically contain various constituents such as dissolved organic matter microorganisms and complex mixtures of micropollutants which are not completely retained by the treatment processes due to such chemical and biological complexity disentangling the specific effects of wastewater constituents on the receiving aquatic ecosystem from each other is a key challenge this requires a study design that allows for controlled interventions which cannot be easily achieved in natural environments we therefore constructed a flow through channel system that mimics the complexity of field conditions while allowing for targeted manipulations and used stream periphyton as a biological model to explore the impact of wwtp effluents stream periphyton also referred to as aquatic biofilms is a highly diverse and dynamic community of prokaryotic and micro eukaryotic organisms that are embedded in an extracellular matrix attached to the surface of submerged solid substrata periphyton plays a crucial role in streams as a basis of aquatic food webs and by contributing to important ecological processes such as primary production and nutrient cycling battin et al 2016 with its high biological diversity and important ecological role periphyton is widely used as a biological community model to assess effects of biotic and abiotic environmental factors such as trophic interactions chemical pollution or eutrophication montuelle et al 2010 sabater et al 2007 several studies have reported shifts in the structure of microbial communities in periphyton upon exposure to treated wastewater tlili et al 2020 2017 with an increase of the relative abundance of cyanobacteria and a decrease of diatoms carles et al 2021 romero et al 2019 these shifts could also be linked to the effects of specific micropollutants from the wastewater effluent tamminen et al 2022 tardy et al 2021 overall these studies have also shown that these shifts were accompanied by changes in important functional traits of the communities such as tolerance to micropollutants algal primary production and photosynthesis or bacterial secondary production notwithstanding these findings most of these studies focused either on the overall effluent toxicity or on specific wastewater constituents such as nutrients and micropollutants but not on the microorganisms from the wwtp it has been demonstrated that downstream of the wwtp bacterial community profiles in the water column i e planktonic resembled a mixture of the upstream and the effluent communities mansfeldt et al 2020 price et al 2018 periphyton however has a different microbial lifestyle than planktonic cells species interactions play a major role in determining microbial colonization dynamics and in shaping the final periphyton community structure this means that changes in taxa composition in periphyton cannot be predicted based on hydraulic mixing alone systematic studies focusing on the invasion of stream periphyton by microorganisms from wwtps and the resulting consequences for community structure and function are scarce for instance chonova et al 2019 have shown that 27 of diatom taxa found in the periphyton downstream of urban and hospital wwtps potentially originated from the wastewater effluents in a similar vein mußmann et al 2013 showed that despite the high diversity of bacterial nitrifiers in the wastewater effluents only two taxa colonized the downstream periphyton nevertheless monitoring the taxonomic profiles of these microorganisms alone is insufficient as it does not inform about their contribution to changes in community functions given this background we aimed in this study to understand the specific contribution of the microorganisms that originate from wwtps to the composition and functions of periphyton communities to this end we used a flow through channel system where periphyton was grown in the presence of stream water mixed with various fractions of unfiltered or ultra filtered treated urban wastewater ultrafiltration of the wastewater was intended to remove more than 99 of microorganisms while leaving dissolved nutrients and micropollutants unaffected we measured a large set of structural and functional endpoints targeting the phototrophic and heterotrophic components in periphyton we also carried out acute toxicity assays to determine the sensitivity of periphyton to a micropollutant mixture extracted from passive samplers deployed in the wastewater effluent moreover we used next generation amplicon sequencing to describe the prokaryotic and eukaryotic community composition in periphyton and we quantified micropollutants in periphyton and water samples 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental system and design the experiment was conducted in a flow through channel system called maiandros that mimics natural conditions in freshwater streams initially described by burdon et al 2020 this system was subsequently equipped with a light system to ensure a photoperiod of 12 h light 12 h dark carles et al 2021 as well as with an automated online monitoring system for parameters such as flow rate water conductivity and temperature desiante et al 2022 the detailed description of the channel system and the monitoring system can be found in the supplementary materials in desiante et al 2022 the ultra filtration uf unit added to the system consisted of a membrane module of 50 m2 surface and a nominal pore size of 0 4 µm allowing for the removal of particulates including microorganisms from the effluent with a microorganism removal efficiency of 99 3 desiante et al 2022 the maiandros system consists of 20 independent flow through channels continuously filled with stream water from chriesbach 47 24 16 7 n 8 36 41 4 e dübendorf switzerland a typical second order stream of the swiss plateau and wastewater treated for nitrification and denitrification desiante et al 2022 thereafter called wastewater the detailed results of the 24 physicochemical parameters that were monitored in wastewater are available in the supplementary materials presented in desiante et al 2022 the 20 channels were randomly assigned to five treatments n four independent replicate channels per treatment corresponding to a nominal proportion of 0 control 30 and 80 of either unfiltered ww or ultra filtered uf wastewater 2 2 periphyton colonization and sampling periphyton grown for 28 days on glass slides installed in the channels was retrieved and transported to the laboratory for analyses as described by carles et al 2021 the duration of colonization was selected based on the assessment of periphyton growth total biomass and algal biomass in which we showed that the biofilms reached their maturity after 28 days in our experimental system fig s1 glass substrata are commonly used in periphyton studies since this inert material allows a better reproducibility and comparison among different conditions and studies briefly five colonized glass slides per channel were scraped and periphyton was suspended in 200 ml of evian natural water evian mineral water is a commonly used growth and exposure medium in microbiological and ecotoxicological studies because of its constant quality fresh suspensions were used for the biological analyses see section 2 5 below and the remaining volume was lyophilized prior to micropollutant analysis and carbon nitrogen phosphorus c n p ratio determination 2 3 water sampling organic micropollutants were sampled in the channels by using passive samplers attractspe disks sdb rps 47 mm diameter affinisep france as described by carles et al 2021 additional passive samplers were also deployed in the wastewater effluent and the accumulated micropollutants were extracted and used for the community tolerance bioassays described in section 2 5 2 below tlili et al 2017 in order to characterize the microbial community in all water sources by next generation sequencing three composite water samples were taken weekly from the stream water as well as from the unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater during 24 h with an automated water sampler maxx tp5 c aktiv germany the water samples were automatically taken 50 ml every 30 min kept at 4 c pooled together and immediately filtered on supor polyethersulfone membrane disc filters with 0 2 µm pore size pall corporation usa the filters were stored at 80 c prior to dna extraction see section 2 5 3 below 2 4 micropollutant analyses fifty four substances i e 22 pesticides 25 pharmaceuticals 4 artificial sweeteners 2 corrosion inhibitors and caffeine that we assumed to be potentially present in the wastewater were extracted and analysed from the passive samplers deployed in the channels according to moschet et al 2015 with few modifications carles et al 2021 the selection of the 54 micropollutants was based on a list of priority substances established by munz et al 2018 from a large survey in 24 swiss streams receiving effluents from wwtps extraction of micropollutants used for the tolerance bioassays was carried out according to tlili et al 2017 micropollutant were extracted from periphyton samples as described by munz et al 2018 with some modifications carles et al 2021 micropollutant analysis was performed by hplc ms ms as described by carles et al 2021 the limit of quantification loq with matrix factor correction and relative recovery for each substance in each type of sample are reported in table s1 2 5 biological

nitrogen were determined in lyophilized periphyton samples by using an elemental analyser hekatech euro elemental analyzer hekatech gmbh wegberg germany total phosphorus in freeze dried periphyton was analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 8900 triple quadrupole icp ms agilent after an additional digestion step consisting of mixing 5 mg of each periphyton sample with 3 ml of 65 hno3 and 1 ml of h2o2 and heating at 250 c pressure 120 bars for 5 min in an ultraclave 4 milestone gmbh germany photosynthetic efficiency was determined with an imaging pam pulse amplitude modulated fluorimeter heinz walz gmbh germany primary and secondary productions were measured via the incorporation of 14c carbonate and 14c leucine according to dorigo and leboulanger 2001 and buesing and gessner 2003 respectively with few modifications carles et al 2021 basal heterotrophic respiration was measured by using the microresptm technique as described by tlili et al 2011a the same method was also used to determine the community level physiological profile clpp of the periphyton suspensions from the various treatments this was done by measuring the mineralization potential of 14 different carbon sources corresponding to 3 amino acids glycine l cysteine and l serine 8 carbohydrates d glucose d xylose l arabinose d fructose d galactose d mannose d sorbitol and sucrose 2 carboxylic acids citric acid and d galacturonic acid monohydrate and 1 organosulfonic acid mops 2 5 2 community tolerance bioassays periphyton tolerance to micropollutants was determined via short term assays as described in carles et al 2021 with few modifications briefly a dilution series of the pure micropollutant extract was prepared in evian mineral water dilution factor of 3 16 the optical density of the biofilm suspensions was adjusted at 685 nm to 0 4 then 4 5 ml from each suspension were exposed to 0 5 ml of each of the six dilutions of the extract during four hours two additional controls were also prepared periphyton suspension exposed to 0 5 ml of mineral water chemical free control or to 0 5 ml of 37 formaldehyde i e formaldehyde control subsamples were then taken for photosynthetic efficiency primary production and secondary production measurements as described above the same procedure was applied for substrate induced respiration measurements by using the microresptm technique an aliquot of 0 5 ml of each suspension was exposed in 96 deepwell microplates to 50 µl of each of the six dilutions of the extract for 14 h in addition to the two controls describe above 2 5 3 next generation sequencing for prokaryotic and eukaryotic community compositions total genomic dna extraction library construction and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene for prokaryotes and the 18s rrna gene for eukaryotes were carried out as described in our previous work carles et al 2021 with few modifications briefly total genomic dna was extracted from each biofilm suspension stream water and unfiltered or ultra filtered wastewater membrane disc filters samples by using the dneasy powerbiofilm kit qiagen following the manufacturer s instructions the library construction consisted in two consecutive pcrs the first pcr amplified the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene for prokaryotes and the v4 v5 region of the 18s rrna gene for eukaryotes see table s2 for the detailed sequences of the primers herlemann et al 2011 hugerth et al 2014 multiplexing indices and illumina sequencing adapters were then added via a second pcr the libraries were then normalized pooled and sequenced paired

prjna755072 sequencing data processing amplicon sequence variants asvs binning and taxonomic assignment were done according to carles et al 2021 with few modifications briefly the reads quality was checked with fastqc v0 11 2 andrews 2010 the reads were end trimmed by seqtk https github com lh3 seqtk and then merged using flash v1 2 11 magoč and salzberg 2011 the primers were trimmed with

analysis callahan et al 2017 the sample reads were first denoised into asvs by using unoise3 in the usearch software v 11 0 667 final predicted taxonomic assignments were performed with sintax in the usearch software v 11 0 667 edgar 2016 by using the silva v128 16s rrna and the pr2 v4 14 0 18s rrna sequence databases the total number of reads obtained at each bioinformatics step is reported in table s3 2 6 data analyses significant differences among the treatments for the periphyton descriptors i e afdw chlorophyll a content bacterial biomass photosynthetic efficiency primary production

i e treatment consisted of five modalities 0 ww 30 ww 30 uf 80 ww and 80 uf normality and homogeneity of variance were checked with the kolmogorov smirnov s and levene s tests respectively non normally distributed data were transformed using logarithmic or box cox functions statistical analyses were carried out in r 4 0 4 by using rstudio version 1 4 1717 the effective concentrations causing a 50 decrease of the measured activity ec50 in the short term assays were derived from concentration activity relationships as described in carles et al 2021 sequencing data analyses for each periphyton and water sample were performed with the r package phyloseq version 1 34 0 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 a total of 499 968 and 72 072 reads was obtained after rarefaction for 16s and 18s rrna datasets respectively alpha diversity i e chao1 species richness and shannon diversity index was assessed with the r package phyloseq the analysis of beta diversity was based on bray curtis distances which use the relative abundance of taxa permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova tests were carried out on the bray curtis distances matrix using the r package vegan for prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities separately homogeneity in the dispersion of pro and eukaryotic datasets was first assessed and the adonis function was then used to see if experimental treatments shared similar centroids additional pairwise comparisons were carried out by using the pairwise adonis2 function martinez arbizu 2020 graphical representations were generated by using the r package ggplot2 version 3 3 5 the relative contributions of source communities i e stream water wastewater and uf wastewater were determined for sink communities i e periphyton communities according to the mixture of stream water and wastewater in the channels by using the fast expectation maximization for microbial source tracking feast package in r shenhav et al 2019 for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes the analysis was repeated five times 1000 iterations each to reduce the effect of false predictions with 12 replicates sampling times for each water source and four channel replicates for each sink periphyton community the feast analysis also reports on the potential proportion in the sink community attributed to other origins i e unknown source in order to identify taxa asvs in periphyton responding positively or negatively to wastewater microorganisms microbiome differential abundance testing was carried out for prokaryotes and eukaryotes by using the r package deseq2 version 1 30 1 love et al 2014 this led to the selection of taxa that were assigned to three different groups for prokaryotes and eukaryotes figs 1 and s2 group positive direct contains microorganisms from the wastewater that colonized periphyton group positive indirect corresponds to taxa originating from the stream that were positively impacted by wastewater microorganisms in periphyton group negative contains taxa that were negatively impacted by wastewater microorganisms the differential abundance was tested using the nonrarefied asv counts wald test and adjusted p values were used to determine if each calculated log2 fold change differed significantly from zero in our study we considered differentially abundant taxa with a log2 fold change 2 and benjamini hochberg adjusted p values 0 05 the control 0 ww 30 and 80 uf periphyton as well as the uf wastewater were used as reference correlation among the prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa selected by the microbial differential abundance testing was subsequently assessed based on the relative abundance variance stabilizing transformation vst counts of each taxon in periphyton from all treatments n 20 the correlation matrix was visualized with a heatmap displaying the pearson r correlation coefficient p 0 05 with the r package pheatmap 1 0 12 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutants in water and in periphyton as we expected the measured concentration of each quantifiable substance in the water in the channels increased with wastewater proportion indicating that wastewater constituted the primary source of micropollutants in the channels fig 2 a and table s4 our results also show that these concentrations were similar between the unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater for both 30 and 80 wastewater proportions fig s3 this finding confirms that the ultra filtration which was primarily intended to remove microorganisms from the effluent did not modify the micropollutant composition and concentrations in the wastewater because it is important to link effects to the actual exposure concentrations we also quantified the micropollutants that accumulated in periphyton fig 2b and table s5 we found a positive correlation between micropollutant concentrations in periphyton and in the water fig s4a indicating that micropollutants accumulated in periphyton however accumulation varied depending on the measured substance as illustrated by bioconcentration factors bcfs which were derived by dividing the concentration in the periphyton by the concentration in the water the highest bcf values were found for the pesticides diuron deet and isoproturon as well as for some pharmaceuticals such as clarithromycin and lidocaine fig 2c and table s6 a pattern that we also observed in a previous study using the same experimental system and treated wastewater carles et al 2021 differences in bioaccumulation could be explained by differences in the physicochemical properties of the compounds this was reflected in the positive correlation that we found for the bcfs and log transformed octanol water partition coefficients logkow fig s4b the comparatively high bioaccumulation of psii inhibitors such as the herbicides diuron and isoproturon might be also explained by the presence of specific molecular binding sites such as the protein d1 in the photosynthetic apparatus within phototrophic organisms that dominate periphyton allen et al 1983 morin et al 2018 tlili et al 2011b on the contrary the relatively low bcf values for other substances such as the artificial sweetener acesulfame may be explained by their high biotransformation rates within microbial cells in periphyton desiante et al 2022 2021 3 2 periphyton characterization we found no significant effect of wastewater whether filtered or not on most of the traditional periphyton descriptors namely biomass photosynthetic efficiency or primary and secondary production table 1 as also reported previously carles et al 2021 lebkuecher et al 2018 pereda et al 2019 tlili et al 2017 on the other hand basal respiration in the periphyton exposed to 80 of unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater significantly increased indicating a potential shift towards heterotrophy this conclusion is further supported by the clear effect of wastewater on nutrient stoichiometry regardless of the treatment periphyton exposed to wastewater was characterized by lower c n and c p molar ratios than the control with values closer to those described for bacteria than for algae table 1 for instance heterotrophic bacterial cells were described to have a c p ratio of about 45 goldman et al 1987 while algal c p ratio is more around 106 redfield et al 1963 moreover bacteria have been shown to possess a higher ability to assimilate inorganic phosphorus than algae currie and kalff 1984 the shift towards heterotrophy could therefore also be explained by changes in the nutrient composition of the extracellular matrix of periphyton which could be the result of the nutrient input from the wastewater this was confirmed by the water analyses in the channels which showed higher concentrations of ortho phosphate nitrate and dissolved organic carbon in both 80 unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater treatments 1 6 0 2 7 3 1 7 and 5 7 0 6 mg l 1 respectively than in the control treatment 0 5 0 05 4 9 0 7 and 2 5 0 3 mg l 1 respectively desiante et al 2022 impacts of wastewater on the heterotrophic component of periphyton were also reflected by the changes in the community level physiological profiles clpps that we established based on the capability of heterotrophs to mineralize various carbon sources for respiration fig 3 indeed the respiration profiles of periphyton exposed to unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater differed from each other and from the control communities along both pca 1 and pca 2 axes pca 1 is clearly related to the wastewater proportion in the channels and shows a positive correlation between wastewater increase and a higher mineralisation potential of all tested carbon substrates such results underline again the fact that wastewater exposure favoured the increase of heterotrophic activities in periphyton communities likely due to the organic matter and nutrients in the wastewater effluent aristi et al 2016 2015 proia et al 2016 interestingly the dissimilarity along pca 2 between the communities exposed to the ultra filtered wastewater and the control was less pronounced than for periphyton exposed to the unfiltered wastewater this suggests that microorganisms from the wastewater have contributed to some extent to the observed changes in the respiration profile of periphyton which has never been described so far we hypothesise here that microorganisms originating from wastewater have been exposed to a larger diversity and amounts of carbon sources than those found in the stream water and may therefore have developed a higher potential capability of mineralization for a broader spectrum of substrates 3 3 tolerance of periphyton to micropollutants increased microbial community tolerance in periphyton towards micropollutants from wwtps has been suggested as an indicator to disentangle the specific effects of micropollutants from those of other stressors corcoll et al 2014 tlili et al 2020 2017 we assessed the tolerance of periphyton to a complex mixture of micropollutants that is representative of the micropollutants found in the wastewater effluent fig s5 and table s7 irrespective of the treatment no effect of wastewater was observed on periphyton tolerance based on primary production and respiration and inconclusive results were obtained when measuring secondary production due to the absence of inhibition and the high variability among replicates table 2 and fig s6 in sharp contrast calculated ec50 values based on photosynthetic psii yield measurements were significantly higher for periphyton exposed to 30 and 80 unfiltered wastewater than for the controls this reflects an increased tolerance of the phototrophic communities to the micropollutant mixture as also shown in our previous study carles et al 2021 a potential explanation could be related to the mode of action of psii inhibitor herbicides which bind to the qb binding niche on the d1 protein of the psii complex thus blocking electron transport from qa to qb jansen et al 1993 it has been suggested that upon exposure to such herbicides tolerant phototrophic species can upregulate the expression of the d1 protein leading to an increased abundance of the qb psii inhibitor complex a community dominated by such tolerant species can therefore cope with higher exposure concentrations than a community dominated by sensitive species leading to higher ec50 values tlili et al 2011b this is in agreement with the higher bcfs we found for the herbicide psii inhibitors such as diuron and isoproturon nevertheless as epitomized by the concept of stress induced community sensitivity vinebrooke et al 2004 an increased community tolerance to micropollutants might lead to an enhanced sensitivity towards other stressors and altered ecological functions with negative consequences for the ecosystem functioning regardless of the underlying mechanisms an important insight from our study is that following the ultrafiltration of the wastewater which removed more than 99 of the microorganisms no increased tolerance was observed in periphyton table 2 and fig s6 similarly desiante et al 2022 have reported on a loss of micropollutant biotransformation potential by periphyton one of the mechanisms potentially explaining tolerance following the ultrafiltration of the wastewater collectively such findings point for the first time towards a major role that microorganisms originating from the wwtps play in community tolerance to micropollutants it is conceivable that these microorganisms might have developed a tolerance to micropollutants in the wwtp before being released into the streams understanding whether their contribution occurs directly via the colonization of periphyton by micropollutant tolerant taxa or indirectly by modifying species interactions within the community requires a comprehensive characterization of the microbial diversity not only in periphyton but as well in wastewater and stream water 3 4 microbial diversity and taxonomic abundance in periphyton and water 3 4 1 relative contribution of stream water and wastewater communities to the periphyton community little is known about the relative contribution of wastewater and stream microorganisms i e source communities to periphyton microbial composition i e sink community to address this knowledge gap we used the microbial source tracking tool feast shenhav et al 2019 and analysed the ngs data for prokaryotes and eukaryotes our results clearly indicated that wastewater contributed largely to periphyton communities with a higher proportion for prokaryotes than for eukaryotes fig 4 for instance the relative proportion of wastewater in periphyton exposed to 80 wastewater reached up to 79 and 38 for prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively this is in line with the shift towards heterotrophy that we observed in periphyton exposed to wastewater since prokaryotes in periphyton correspond mainly to heterotrophic bacteria another line of evidence comes from the comparison of periphyton exposed to unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater we observed a strong reduction of the relative proportion of wastewater community for periphyton exposed to ultra filtered wastewater fig 4 this led for instance for eukaryotes to a proportion of wastewater community 5 in periphyton exposed to 30 and 80 ultra filtered wastewater confirming in turn the capacity of wastewater microorganisms to colonize periphyton the proportion of each sink community that did not match the signature of the sources included in our analysis was assigned to unknown sources such analysis is used to identify potential contamination of the sinks by other unidentified microbial sources liang et al 2021 shenhav et al 2019 in our study ultra filtration did not only lead to an increase of the relative proportion of stream communities in periphyton but also to an increased proportion of these unknown sources the relatively high proportion of the unknown sources may be explained by the presence of microorganisms in the maiandros channel system and more specifically for the uf treatment by the colonization of the backside of the membranes by microorganisms forming distinct communities the colonization dynamics per se as well as species interactions in periphyton communities could also lead to different community assemblages compared to the surrounding water column peng et al 2018 and thus potentially contribute to the relatively high proportion of the unknown sources this makes periphyton different from free living microorganisms in the water column in streams for which several field surveys have shown that downstream bacterial community profiles were a mixture between the upstream and the effluent mansfeldt et al 2020 pascual benito et al 2020 price et al 2018 3 4 2 impact of wastewater and wastewater microorganisms on periphyton community structure we further evaluated the impacts of wastewater on periphyton community structure based on the commonly used descriptors alpha i e taxonomic richness and shannon diversity index of a given community and beta diversity i e structural differences among several microbial communities while alpha diversity for eukaryotes was not affected by wastewater both taxonomic richness chao1 and shannon diversity of prokaryotes decreased in periphyton exposed to 80 wastewater compared to the control with no significant difference between unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater treatments fig 5 a in contrast wastewater led to a clear separation in the beta diversity of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities among all treatments permanova p 0 001 fig 5b indeed periphyton communities exposed to unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater were distinct from each other and from the control communities pairwise permanova p 0 05 several field and mesocosm studies have also reported on the effects of wastewater effluents on the structure of periphyton communities carles et al 2021 chonova et al 2019 lebkuecher et al 2018 romero et al 2019 tardy et al 2021 with contrasting results between alpha and beta diversity carles et al 2021 lebkuecher et al 2018 this may be explained by the various wastewater constituents such as nutrients micropollutants and microorganisms while micropollutants can negatively affect the abundance of certain taxa nutrients can favor the growth of others aristi et al 2015 collectively this may result in distinct communities with regard to beta diversity but with similar alpha diversity indices hugerth and andersson 2017 3 4 3 identification of periphyton taxa impacted by wastewater microorganisms by comparing periphyton communities exposed to the unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater as well as with the control communities we were able to examine how and which microorganisms originating from the wastewater potentially affected the final composition of the communities for this we applied the microbial differential abundance testing to identify prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa in periphyton that are positively or negatively impacted by wastewater microorganisms in terms of relative abundance this analysis led to the selection of 129 prokaryotic and 20 eukaryotic taxa table s8 that were all correlated to each other fig s7 and subsequently assigned to three groups the first group named group positive direct was composed of 98 prokaryotic and 8 eukaryotic taxa that were removed by the ultra filtration from the wastewater and directly colonized periphyton exposed to unfiltered wastewater fig 6 all these taxa had a higher abundance in periphyton exposed to unfiltered wastewater than in periphyton exposed to the ultra filtered wastewater and in the control taxa composing this group are therefore potentially major players in periphyton metabolic alterations and increased tolerance that we observed in our study for instance two prokaryotic phyla chlorobi and firmicutes that were only found in this group fig 6a have been frequently detected in the outlet and downstream periphyton of wwtps aubertheau et al 2017 ross et al 2012 thiel et al 2019 ziganshina et al 2016 as well as in biofilters used to treat urban wastewater aguirre sierra et al 2016 several taxa that belong to the prokaryotic phylum chloroflexi were also assigned to this group chloroflexi is a phylum of filamentous bacteria possessing a wide diversity of metabolisms and are also known as photoheterotrophs overmann 2008 this phylum was found to be highly abundant in unfiltered wastewater and periphyton exposed to this wastewater while almost no chloroflexi were detected in ultra filtered wastewater and accordingly in periphyton exposed to ultra filtered wastewater fig s8a this suggests that these phototrophic bacteria could have contributed directly or indirectly to the observed increased tolerance of phototrophs in periphyton to micropollutants the second group named group positive indirect contained 13 prokaryotic and 8 eukaryotic taxa that did not originate from the wwtp but were positively impacted in terms of relative abundance in periphyton by the microorganisms from the wastewater fig 6 among the prokaryotic taxa two families mycobacteriaceae and rhodospirillaceae were specific to this group rhodospirillaceae have been shown to be more abundant in lower and medium order streams chen et al 2018 as it is the case for the stream chriesbach used in our study it has also been shown that mycobacteriaceae can thrive in environments that are influenced by anthropogenic activities such as wwtps amha et al 2017 falkinham 2015 makovcova et al 2014 group positive indirect also contained members of the phylum chloroflexi mainly the family caldilineaceae that was also found in the group positive direct fig 6a caldilineaceae may have contributed to the changes in the respiration profiles of periphyton since it has been shown that this family has different metabolic potentials for substrate utilization compared to other microorganisms involved in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process of wwtps kindaichi et al 2013 microorganisms from the wastewater also had negative impacts on the relative abundance of several taxa in periphyton which were assigned to the third group named group negative this group was composed by 18 prokaryotic and 4 eukaryotic taxa among which several were specific to group negative fig 6 for instance this was the case for several prokaryotic taxa belonging to cyanobacteria deinococcaceae methylobacteriaceae and microbacteriaceae fig 6a cyanobacteria are known to respond differently i e an increase or a decrease of abundance to wastewater effluents carles et al 2021 carles and artigas 2020 corcoll et al 2014 mansfeldt et al 2020 romero et al 2019 however we are not aware of any study that investigated the specific effect of wastewater microorganisms on this phylum deinococcaceae have already been associated to periphyton growing in reference unpolluted sites in a previous study comparing community composition along an urban pollution gradient in a stream pineda mora et al 2020 indicating their potential sensitivity to wastewater constituents the presence of methylobacteriaceae and microbacteriaceae in the group negative may be explained by their association with microalgae levy et al 2009 paddock et al 2020 which seemed to be negatively impacted by wastewater microorganisms in terms of abundance i e class chlorophyceae in fig s7b finally group negative also contained one eukaryotic taxon affiliated to bacillariophyta i e diatoms fig 6b which is consistent with the observed negative impact of wastewater microorganisms on diatom abundance fig s8b these results highlight the need to consider wastewater microbial communities as a stressor per se which can influence the final composition of periphyton communities when examining the potential impacts of wastewater on stream ecosystems for water quality assessment this aspect was poorly described so far as most studies looked either at the overall effluent toxicity liao et al 2019 nega et al 2019 peng et al 2018 romero et al 2019 or at other wastewater constituents such as nutrients lebkuecher et al 2018 and micropollutants carles et al 2021 chonova et al 2019 tamminen et al 2022 tardy et al 2021 tlili et al 2020 our study also points towards the importance of species interactions within periphyton communities as well as between prokaryotes and eukaryotes which occur among co existing species in periphyton gubelit and grossart 2020 for instance studies on diatom bacterial interactions revealed a high species specific interdependence of the algal host and bacteria as each diatom species developed a bacterial community that differed in its composition grossart et al 2005 koedooder et al 2019 stock et al 2019 4 conclusions overall our study provides compelling evidence that microorganisms originating from wastewater strongly affected periphyton communities specifically we show that these microorganisms are able to colonize periphyton and modify its community composition either directly or indirectly via species interactions contributing to changes in respiration profiles being at the basis of the food web in streams such changes in periphyton communities downstream of wwtps bear potential significant environmental costs for higher trophic levels with probable impacts on the overall flow of energy through the food chain in fresh waters furthermore our results also showed that tolerance of periphyton communities to micropollutants was governed by microorganisms released from the wwtp and not by in stream exposure to the micropollutants this finding underlines the fact that the pollution induced community tolerance pict concept which stipulates that increased tolerance is directly caused by the exerted selection pressure of micropollutants should be reconsidered in the context of wwtps instead selection pressures that occur in highly contaminated compartments such as in the wwtp itself have to be taken into account collectively our findings also have important implications for wwtp management microbial communities that are released in the wastewater should be considered as a potential stressor for the receiving streams similarly to other stressors such as nutrients micropollutants or increased temperature this in turn implies that the measures currently implemented in wwtps to reduce the load of released microorganisms are not sufficient to completely reduce the ecological hazard they might represent credit authorship contribution statement louis carles conceptualization data curation formal analysis writing original draft

15445,effluents of wastewater treatment plants can impact microbial communities in the receiving streams however little is known about the role of microorganisms in wastewater as opposed to other wastewater constituents such as nutrients and micropollutants we aimed therefore at determining the impact of wastewater microorganisms on the microbial diversity and function of periphyton key microbial communities in streams we used a flow through channel system to grow periphyton upon exposure to a mixture of stream water and unfiltered or ultra filtered wastewater impacts were assessed on periphyton biomass activities and tolerance to micropollutants as well as on microbial diversity our results showed that wastewater microorganisms colonized periphyton and modified its community composition resulting for instance in an increased abundance of chloroflexi and a decreased abundance of diatoms and green algae this led to shifts towards heterotrophy as suggested by the changes in nutrient stoichiometry and the increased mineralization potential of carbon substrates an increased tolerance towards micropollutants was only found for periphyton exposed to unfiltered wastewater but not to ultra filtered wastewater suggesting that wastewater microorganisms were responsible for this increased tolerance overall our results highlight the need to consider the role of wastewater microorganisms when studying potential impacts of wastewater on the receiving water body graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords stream biofilm prokaryotes eukaryotes dna metabarcoding micropollutants pollution induced community tolerance data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps represent a major source for surface water pollution in urban areas potentially leading to negative consequences for the structural and functional integrity of aquatic communities in the receiving streams gessner and tlili 2016 stamm et al 2016 vörösmarty et al 2010 effluents from wwtps typically contain various constituents such as dissolved organic matter microorganisms and complex mixtures of micropollutants which are not completely retained by the treatment processes due to such chemical and biological complexity disentangling the specific effects of wastewater constituents on the receiving aquatic ecosystem from each other is a key challenge this requires a study design that allows for controlled interventions which cannot be easily achieved in natural environments we therefore constructed a flow through channel system that mimics the complexity of field conditions while allowing for targeted manipulations and used stream periphyton as a biological model to explore the impact of wwtp effluents stream periphyton also referred to as aquatic biofilms is a highly diverse and dynamic community of prokaryotic and micro eukaryotic organisms that are embedded in an extracellular matrix attached to the surface of submerged solid substrata periphyton plays a crucial role in streams as a basis of aquatic food webs and by contributing to important ecological processes such as primary production and nutrient cycling battin et al 2016 with its high biological diversity and important ecological role periphyton is widely used as a biological community model to assess effects of biotic and abiotic environmental factors such as trophic interactions chemical pollution or eutrophication montuelle et al 2010 sabater et al 2007 several studies have reported shifts in the structure of microbial communities in periphyton upon exposure to treated wastewater tlili et al 2020 2017 with an increase of the relative abundance of cyanobacteria and a decrease of diatoms carles et al 2021 romero et al 2019 these shifts could also be linked to the effects of specific micropollutants from the wastewater effluent tamminen et al 2022 tardy et al 2021 overall these studies have also shown that these shifts were accompanied by changes in important functional traits of the communities such as tolerance to micropollutants algal primary production and photosynthesis or bacterial secondary production notwithstanding these findings most of these studies focused either on the overall effluent toxicity or on specific wastewater constituents such as nutrients and micropollutants but not on the microorganisms from the wwtp it has been demonstrated that downstream of the wwtp bacterial community profiles in the water column i e planktonic resembled a mixture of the upstream and the effluent communities mansfeldt et al 2020 price et al 2018 periphyton however has a different microbial lifestyle than planktonic cells species interactions play a major role in determining microbial colonization dynamics and in shaping the final periphyton community structure this means that changes in taxa composition in periphyton cannot be predicted based on hydraulic mixing alone systematic studies focusing on the invasion of stream periphyton by microorganisms from wwtps and the resulting consequences for community structure and function are scarce for instance chonova et al 2019 have shown that 27 of diatom taxa found in the periphyton downstream of urban and hospital wwtps potentially originated from the wastewater effluents in a similar vein mußmann et al 2013 showed that despite the high diversity of bacterial nitrifiers in the wastewater effluents only two taxa colonized the downstream periphyton nevertheless monitoring the taxonomic profiles of these microorganisms alone is insufficient as it does not inform about their contribution to changes in community functions given this background we aimed in this study to understand the specific contribution of the microorganisms that originate from wwtps to the composition and functions of periphyton communities to this end we used a flow through channel system where periphyton was grown in the presence of stream water mixed with various fractions of unfiltered or ultra filtered treated urban wastewater ultrafiltration of the wastewater was intended to remove more than 99 of microorganisms while leaving dissolved nutrients and micropollutants unaffected we measured a large set of structural and functional endpoints targeting the phototrophic and heterotrophic components in periphyton we also carried out acute toxicity assays to determine the sensitivity of periphyton to a micropollutant mixture extracted from passive samplers deployed in the wastewater effluent moreover we used next generation amplicon sequencing to describe the prokaryotic and eukaryotic community composition in periphyton and we quantified micropollutants in periphyton and water samples 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental system and design the experiment was conducted in a flow through channel system called maiandros that mimics natural conditions in freshwater streams initially described by burdon et al 2020 this system was subsequently equipped with a light system to ensure a photoperiod of 12 h light 12 h dark carles et al 2021 as well as with an automated online monitoring system for parameters such as flow rate water conductivity and temperature desiante et al 2022 the detailed description of the channel system and the monitoring system can be found in the supplementary materials in desiante et al 2022 the ultra filtration uf unit added to the system consisted of a membrane module of 50 m2 surface and a nominal pore size of 0 4 µm allowing for the removal of particulates including microorganisms from the effluent with a microorganism removal efficiency of 99 3 desiante et al 2022 the maiandros system consists of 20 independent flow through channels continuously filled with stream water from chriesbach 47 24 16 7 n 8 36 41 4 e dübendorf switzerland a typical second order stream of the swiss plateau and wastewater treated for nitrification and denitrification desiante et al 2022 thereafter called wastewater the detailed results of the 24 physicochemical parameters that were monitored in wastewater are available in the supplementary materials presented in desiante et al 2022 the 20 channels were randomly assigned to five treatments n four independent replicate channels per treatment corresponding to a nominal proportion of 0 control 30 and 80 of either unfiltered ww or ultra filtered uf wastewater 2 2 periphyton colonization and sampling periphyton grown for 28 days on glass slides installed in the channels was retrieved and transported to the laboratory for analyses as described by carles et al 2021 the duration of colonization was selected based on the assessment of periphyton growth total biomass and algal biomass in which we showed that the biofilms reached their maturity after 28 days in our experimental system fig s1 glass substrata are commonly used in periphyton studies since this inert material allows a better reproducibility and comparison among different conditions and studies briefly five colonized glass slides per channel were scraped and periphyton was suspended in 200 ml of evian natural water evian mineral water is a commonly used growth and exposure medium in microbiological and ecotoxicological studies because of its constant quality fresh suspensions were used for the biological analyses see section 2 5 below and the remaining volume was lyophilized prior to micropollutant analysis and carbon nitrogen phosphorus c n p ratio determination 2 3 water sampling organic micropollutants were sampled in the channels by using passive samplers attractspe disks sdb rps 47 mm diameter affinisep france as described by carles et al 2021 additional passive samplers were also deployed in the wastewater effluent and the accumulated micropollutants were extracted and used for the community tolerance bioassays described in section 2 5 2 below tlili et al 2017 in order to characterize the microbial community in all water sources by next generation sequencing three composite water samples were taken weekly from the stream water as well as from the unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater during 24 h with an automated water sampler maxx tp5 c aktiv germany the water samples were automatically taken 50 ml every 30 min kept at 4 c pooled together and immediately filtered on supor polyethersulfone membrane disc filters with 0 2 µm pore size pall corporation usa the filters were stored at 80 c prior to dna extraction see section 2 5 3 below 2 4 micropollutant analyses fifty four substances i e 22 pesticides 25 pharmaceuticals 4 artificial sweeteners 2 corrosion inhibitors and caffeine that we assumed to be potentially present in the wastewater were extracted and analysed from the passive samplers deployed in the channels according to moschet et al 2015 with few modifications carles et al 2021 the selection of the 54 micropollutants was based on a list of priority substances established by munz et al 2018 from a large survey in 24 swiss streams receiving effluents from wwtps extraction of micropollutants used for the tolerance bioassays was carried out according to tlili et al 2017 micropollutant were extracted from periphyton samples as described by munz et al 2018 with some modifications carles et al 2021 micropollutant analysis was performed by hplc ms ms as described by carles et al 2021 the limit of quantification loq with matrix factor correction and relative recovery for each substance in each type of sample are reported in table s1 2 5 biological

nitrogen were determined in lyophilized periphyton samples by using an elemental analyser hekatech euro elemental analyzer hekatech gmbh wegberg germany total phosphorus in freeze dried periphyton was analysed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry 8900 triple quadrupole icp ms agilent after an additional digestion step consisting of mixing 5 mg of each periphyton sample with 3 ml of 65 hno3 and 1 ml of h2o2 and heating at 250 c pressure 120 bars for 5 min in an ultraclave 4 milestone gmbh germany photosynthetic efficiency was determined with an imaging pam pulse amplitude modulated fluorimeter heinz walz gmbh germany primary and secondary productions were measured via the incorporation of 14c carbonate and 14c leucine according to dorigo and leboulanger 2001 and buesing and gessner 2003 respectively with few modifications carles et al 2021 basal heterotrophic respiration was measured by using the microresptm technique as described by tlili et al 2011a the same method was also used to determine the community level physiological profile clpp of the periphyton suspensions from the various treatments this was done by measuring the mineralization potential of 14 different carbon sources corresponding to 3 amino acids glycine l cysteine and l serine 8 carbohydrates d glucose d xylose l arabinose d fructose d galactose d mannose d sorbitol and sucrose 2 carboxylic acids citric acid and d galacturonic acid monohydrate and 1 organosulfonic acid mops 2 5 2 community tolerance bioassays periphyton tolerance to micropollutants was determined via short term assays as described in carles et al 2021 with few modifications briefly a dilution series of the pure micropollutant extract was prepared in evian mineral water dilution factor of 3 16 the optical density of the biofilm suspensions was adjusted at 685 nm to 0 4 then 4 5 ml from each suspension were exposed to 0 5 ml of each of the six dilutions of the extract during four hours two additional controls were also prepared periphyton suspension exposed to 0 5 ml of mineral water chemical free control or to 0 5 ml of 37 formaldehyde i e formaldehyde control subsamples were then taken for photosynthetic efficiency primary production and secondary production measurements as described above the same procedure was applied for substrate induced respiration measurements by using the microresptm technique an aliquot of 0 5 ml of each suspension was exposed in 96 deepwell microplates to 50 µl of each of the six dilutions of the extract for 14 h in addition to the two controls describe above 2 5 3 next generation sequencing for prokaryotic and eukaryotic community compositions total genomic dna extraction library construction and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene for prokaryotes and the 18s rrna gene for eukaryotes were carried out as described in our previous work carles et al 2021 with few modifications briefly total genomic dna was extracted from each biofilm suspension stream water and unfiltered or ultra filtered wastewater membrane disc filters samples by using the dneasy powerbiofilm kit qiagen following the manufacturer s instructions the library construction consisted in two consecutive pcrs the first pcr amplified the v3 v4 region of the 16s rrna gene for prokaryotes and the v4 v5 region of the 18s rrna gene for eukaryotes see table s2 for the detailed sequences of the primers herlemann et al 2011 hugerth et al 2014 multiplexing indices and illumina sequencing adapters were then added via a second pcr the libraries were then normalized pooled and sequenced paired

prjna755072 sequencing data processing amplicon sequence variants asvs binning and taxonomic assignment were done according to carles et al 2021 with few modifications briefly the reads quality was checked with fastqc v0 11 2 andrews 2010 the reads were end trimmed by seqtk https github com lh3 seqtk and then merged using flash v1 2 11 magoč and salzberg 2011 the primers were trimmed with

table s3 2 6 data analyses significant differences among the treatments for the periphyton descriptors i e afdw chlorophyll a content bacterial biomass photosynthetic efficiency primary production

i e treatment consisted of five modalities 0 ww 30 ww 30 uf 80 ww and 80 uf normality and homogeneity of variance were checked with the kolmogorov smirnov s and levene s tests respectively non normally distributed data were transformed using logarithmic or box cox functions statistical analyses were carried out in r 4 0 4 by using rstudio version 1 4 1717 the effective concentrations causing a 50 decrease of the measured activity ec50 in the short term assays were derived from concentration activity relationships as described in carles et al 2021 sequencing data analyses for each periphyton and water sample were performed with the r package phyloseq version 1 34 0 mcmurdie and holmes 2013 a total of 499 968 and 72 072 reads was obtained after rarefaction for 16s and 18s rrna datasets respectively alpha diversity i e chao1 species richness and shannon diversity index was assessed with the r package phyloseq the analysis of beta diversity was based on bray curtis distances which use the relative abundance of taxa permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova tests were carried out on the bray curtis distances matrix using the r package vegan for prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities separately homogeneity in the dispersion of pro and eukaryotic datasets was first assessed and the adonis function was then used to see if experimental treatments shared similar centroids additional pairwise comparisons were carried out by using the pairwise adonis2 function martinez arbizu 2020 graphical representations were generated by using the r package ggplot2 version 3 3 5 the relative contributions of source communities i e stream water wastewater and uf wastewater were determined for sink communities i e periphyton communities according to the mixture of stream water and wastewater in the channels by using the fast expectation maximization for microbial source tracking feast package in r shenhav et al 2019 for both prokaryotes and eukaryotes the analysis was repeated five times 1000 iterations each to reduce the effect of false predictions with 12 replicates sampling times for each water source and four channel replicates for each sink periphyton community the feast analysis also reports on the potential proportion in the sink community attributed to other origins i e unknown source in order to identify taxa asvs in periphyton responding positively or negatively to wastewater microorganisms microbiome differential abundance testing was carried out for prokaryotes and eukaryotes by using the r package deseq2 version 1 30 1 love et al 2014 this led to the selection of taxa that were assigned to three different groups for prokaryotes and eukaryotes figs 1 and s2 group positive direct contains microorganisms from the wastewater that colonized periphyton group positive indirect corresponds to taxa originating from the stream that were positively impacted by wastewater microorganisms in periphyton group negative contains taxa that were negatively impacted by wastewater microorganisms the differential abundance was tested using the nonrarefied asv counts wald test and adjusted p values were used to determine if each calculated log2 fold change differed significantly from zero in our study we considered differentially abundant taxa with a log2 fold change 2 and benjamini hochberg adjusted p values 0 05 the control 0 ww 30 and 80 uf periphyton as well as the uf wastewater were used as reference correlation among the prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa selected by the microbial differential abundance testing was subsequently assessed based on the relative abundance variance stabilizing transformation vst counts of each taxon in periphyton from all treatments n 20 the correlation matrix was visualized with a heatmap displaying the pearson r correlation coefficient p 0 05 with the r package pheatmap 1 0 12 3 results and discussion 3 1 micropollutants in water and in periphyton as we expected the measured concentration of each quantifiable substance in the water in the channels increased with wastewater proportion indicating that wastewater constituted the primary source of micropollutants in the channels fig 2 a and table s4 our results also show that these concentrations were similar between the unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater for both 30 and 80 wastewater proportions fig s3 this finding confirms that the ultra filtration which was primarily intended to remove microorganisms from the effluent did not modify the micropollutant composition and concentrations in the wastewater because it is important to link effects to the actual exposure concentrations we also quantified the micropollutants that accumulated in periphyton fig 2b and table s5 we found a positive correlation between micropollutant concentrations in periphyton and in the water fig s4a indicating that micropollutants accumulated in periphyton however accumulation varied depending on the measured substance as illustrated by bioconcentration factors bcfs which were derived by dividing the concentration in the periphyton by the concentration in the water the highest bcf values were found for the pesticides diuron deet and isoproturon as well as for some pharmaceuticals such as clarithromycin and lidocaine fig 2c and table s6 a pattern that we also observed in a previous study using the same experimental system and treated wastewater carles et al 2021 differences in bioaccumulation could be explained by differences in the physicochemical properties of the compounds this was reflected in the positive correlation that we found for the bcfs and log transformed octanol water partition coefficients logkow fig s4b the comparatively high bioaccumulation of psii inhibitors such as the herbicides diuron and isoproturon might be also explained by the presence of specific molecular binding sites such as the protein d1 in the photosynthetic apparatus within phototrophic organisms that dominate periphyton allen et al 1983 morin et al 2018 tlili et al 2011b on the contrary the relatively low bcf values for other substances such as the artificial sweetener acesulfame may be explained by their high biotransformation rates within microbial cells in periphyton desiante et al 2022 2021 3 2 periphyton characterization we found no significant effect of wastewater whether filtered or not on most of the traditional periphyton descriptors namely biomass photosynthetic efficiency or primary and secondary production table 1 as also reported previously carles et al 2021 lebkuecher et al 2018 pereda et al 2019 tlili et al 2017 on the other hand basal respiration in the periphyton exposed to 80 of unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater significantly increased indicating a potential shift towards heterotrophy this conclusion is further supported by the clear effect of wastewater on nutrient stoichiometry regardless of the treatment periphyton exposed to wastewater was characterized by lower c n and c p molar ratios than the control with values closer to those described for bacteria than for algae table 1 for instance heterotrophic bacterial cells were described to have a c p ratio of about 45 goldman et al 1987 while algal c p ratio is more around 106 redfield et al 1963 moreover bacteria have been shown to possess a higher ability to assimilate inorganic phosphorus than algae currie and kalff 1984 the shift towards heterotrophy could therefore also be explained by changes in the nutrient composition of the extracellular matrix of periphyton which could be the result of the nutrient input from the wastewater this was confirmed by the water analyses in the channels which showed higher concentrations of ortho phosphate nitrate and dissolved organic carbon in both 80 unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater treatments 1 6 0 2 7 3 1 7 and 5 7 0 6 mg l 1 respectively than in the control treatment 0 5 0 05 4 9 0 7 and 2 5 0 3 mg l 1 respectively desiante et al 2022 impacts of wastewater on the heterotrophic component of periphyton were also reflected by the changes in the community level physiological profiles clpps that we established based on the capability of heterotrophs to mineralize various carbon sources for respiration fig 3 indeed the respiration profiles of periphyton exposed to unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater differed from each other and from the control communities along both pca 1 and pca 2 axes pca 1 is clearly related to the wastewater proportion in the channels and shows a positive correlation between wastewater increase and a higher mineralisation potential of all tested carbon substrates such results underline again the fact that wastewater exposure favoured the increase of heterotrophic activities in periphyton communities likely due to the organic matter and nutrients in the wastewater effluent aristi et al 2016 2015 proia et al 2016 interestingly the dissimilarity along pca 2 between the communities exposed to the ultra filtered wastewater and the control was less pronounced than for periphyton exposed to the unfiltered wastewater this suggests that microorganisms from the wastewater have contributed to some extent to the observed changes in the respiration profile of periphyton which has never been described so far we hypothesise here that microorganisms originating from wastewater have been exposed to a larger diversity and amounts of carbon sources than those found in the stream water and may therefore have developed a higher potential capability of mineralization for a broader spectrum of substrates 3 3 tolerance of periphyton to micropollutants increased microbial community tolerance in periphyton towards micropollutants from wwtps has been suggested as an indicator to disentangle the specific effects of micropollutants from those of other stressors corcoll et al 2014 tlili et al 2020 2017 we assessed the tolerance of periphyton to a complex mixture of micropollutants that is representative of the micropollutants found in the wastewater effluent fig s5 and table s7 irrespective of the treatment no effect of wastewater was observed on periphyton tolerance based on primary production and respiration and inconclusive results were obtained when measuring secondary production due to the absence of inhibition and the high variability among replicates table 2 and fig s6 in sharp contrast calculated ec50 values based on photosynthetic psii yield measurements were significantly higher for periphyton exposed to 30 and 80 unfiltered wastewater than for the controls this reflects an increased tolerance of the phototrophic communities to the micropollutant mixture as also shown in our previous study carles et al 2021 a potential explanation could be related to the mode of action of psii inhibitor herbicides which bind to the qb binding niche on the d1 protein of the psii complex thus blocking electron transport from qa to qb jansen et al 1993 it has been suggested that upon exposure to such herbicides tolerant phototrophic species can upregulate the expression of the d1 protein leading to an increased abundance of the qb psii inhibitor complex a community dominated by such tolerant species can therefore cope with higher exposure concentrations than a community dominated by sensitive species leading to higher ec50 values tlili et al 2011b this is in agreement with the higher bcfs we found for the herbicide psii inhibitors such as diuron and isoproturon nevertheless as epitomized by the concept of stress induced community sensitivity vinebrooke et al 2004 an increased community tolerance to micropollutants might lead to an enhanced sensitivity towards other stressors and altered ecological functions with negative consequences for the ecosystem functioning regardless of the underlying mechanisms an important insight from our study is that following the ultrafiltration of the wastewater which removed more than 99 of the microorganisms no increased tolerance was observed in periphyton table 2 and fig s6 similarly desiante et al 2022 have reported on a loss of micropollutant biotransformation potential by periphyton one of the mechanisms potentially explaining tolerance following the ultrafiltration of the wastewater collectively such findings point for the first time towards a major role that microorganisms originating from the wwtps play in community tolerance to micropollutants it is conceivable that these microorganisms might have developed a tolerance to micropollutants in the wwtp before being released into the streams understanding whether their contribution occurs directly via the colonization of periphyton by micropollutant tolerant taxa or indirectly by modifying species interactions within the community requires a comprehensive characterization of the microbial diversity not only in periphyton but as well in wastewater and stream water 3 4 microbial diversity and taxonomic abundance in periphyton and water 3 4 1 relative contribution of stream water and wastewater communities to the periphyton community little is known about the relative contribution of wastewater and stream microorganisms i e source communities to periphyton microbial composition i e sink community to address this knowledge gap we used the microbial source tracking tool feast shenhav et al 2019 and analysed the ngs data for prokaryotes and eukaryotes our results clearly indicated that wastewater contributed largely to periphyton communities with a higher proportion for prokaryotes than for eukaryotes fig 4 for instance the relative proportion of wastewater in periphyton exposed to 80 wastewater reached up to 79 and 38 for prokaryotes and eukaryotes respectively this is in line with the shift towards heterotrophy that we observed in periphyton exposed to wastewater since prokaryotes in periphyton correspond mainly to heterotrophic bacteria another line of evidence comes from the comparison of periphyton exposed to unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater we observed a strong reduction of the relative proportion of wastewater community for periphyton exposed to ultra filtered wastewater fig 4 this led for instance for eukaryotes to a proportion of wastewater community 5 in periphyton exposed to 30 and 80 ultra filtered wastewater confirming in turn the capacity of wastewater microorganisms to colonize periphyton the proportion of each sink community that did not match the signature of the sources included in our analysis was assigned to unknown sources such analysis is used to identify potential contamination of the sinks by other unidentified microbial sources liang et al 2021 shenhav et al 2019 in our study ultra filtration did not only lead to an increase of the relative proportion of stream communities in periphyton but also to an increased proportion of these unknown sources the relatively high proportion of the unknown sources may be explained by the presence of microorganisms in the maiandros channel system and more specifically for the uf treatment by the colonization of the backside of the membranes by microorganisms forming distinct communities the colonization dynamics per se as well as species interactions in periphyton communities could also lead to different community assemblages compared to the surrounding water column peng et al 2018 and thus potentially contribute to the relatively high proportion of the unknown sources this makes periphyton different from free living microorganisms in the water column in streams for which several field surveys have shown that downstream bacterial community profiles were a mixture between the upstream and the effluent mansfeldt et al 2020 pascual benito et al 2020 price et al 2018 3 4 2 impact of wastewater and wastewater microorganisms on periphyton community structure we further evaluated the impacts of wastewater on periphyton community structure based on the commonly used descriptors alpha i e taxonomic richness and shannon diversity index of a given community and beta diversity i e structural differences among several microbial communities while alpha diversity for eukaryotes was not affected by wastewater both taxonomic richness chao1 and shannon diversity of prokaryotes decreased in periphyton exposed to 80 wastewater compared to the control with no significant difference between unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater treatments fig 5 a in contrast wastewater led to a clear separation in the beta diversity of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic communities among all treatments permanova p 0 001 fig 5b indeed periphyton communities exposed to unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater were distinct from each other and from the control communities pairwise permanova p 0 05 several field and mesocosm studies have also reported on the effects of wastewater effluents on the structure of periphyton communities carles et al 2021 chonova et al 2019 lebkuecher et al 2018 romero et al 2019 tardy et al 2021 with contrasting results between alpha and beta diversity carles et al 2021 lebkuecher et al 2018 this may be explained by the various wastewater constituents such as nutrients micropollutants and microorganisms while micropollutants can negatively affect the abundance of certain taxa nutrients can favor the growth of others aristi et al 2015 collectively this may result in distinct communities with regard to beta diversity but with similar alpha diversity indices hugerth and andersson 2017 3 4 3 identification of periphyton taxa impacted by wastewater microorganisms by comparing periphyton communities exposed to the unfiltered and ultra filtered wastewater as well as with the control communities we were able to examine how and which microorganisms originating from the wastewater potentially affected the final composition of the communities for this we applied the microbial differential abundance testing to identify prokaryotic and eukaryotic taxa in periphyton that are positively or negatively impacted by wastewater microorganisms in terms of relative abundance this analysis led to the selection of 129 prokaryotic and 20 eukaryotic taxa table s8 that were all correlated to each other fig s7 and subsequently assigned to three groups the first group named group positive direct was composed of 98 prokaryotic and 8 eukaryotic taxa that were removed by the ultra filtration from the wastewater and directly colonized periphyton exposed to unfiltered wastewater fig 6 all these taxa had a higher abundance in periphyton exposed to unfiltered wastewater than in periphyton exposed to the ultra filtered wastewater and in the control taxa composing this group are therefore potentially major players in periphyton metabolic alterations and increased tolerance that we observed in our study for instance two prokaryotic phyla chlorobi and firmicutes that were only found in this group fig 6a have been frequently detected in the outlet and downstream periphyton of wwtps aubertheau et al 2017 ross et al 2012 thiel et al 2019 ziganshina et al 2016 as well as in biofilters used to treat urban wastewater aguirre sierra et al 2016 several taxa that belong to the prokaryotic phylum chloroflexi were also assigned to this group chloroflexi is a phylum of filamentous bacteria possessing a wide diversity of metabolisms and are also known as photoheterotrophs overmann 2008 this phylum was found to be highly abundant in unfiltered wastewater and periphyton exposed to this wastewater while almost no chloroflexi were detected in ultra filtered wastewater and accordingly in periphyton exposed to ultra filtered wastewater fig s8a this suggests that these phototrophic bacteria could have contributed directly or indirectly to the observed increased tolerance of phototrophs in periphyton to micropollutants the second group named group positive indirect contained 13 prokaryotic and 8 eukaryotic taxa that did not originate from the wwtp but were positively impacted in terms of relative abundance in periphyton by the microorganisms from the wastewater fig 6 among the prokaryotic taxa two families mycobacteriaceae and rhodospirillaceae were specific to this group rhodospirillaceae have been shown to be more abundant in lower and medium order streams chen et al 2018 as it is the case for the stream chriesbach used in our study it has also been shown that mycobacteriaceae can thrive in environments that are influenced by anthropogenic activities such as wwtps amha et al 2017 falkinham 2015 makovcova et al 2014 group positive indirect also contained members of the phylum chloroflexi mainly the family caldilineaceae that was also found in the group positive direct fig 6a caldilineaceae may have contributed to the changes in the respiration profiles of periphyton since it has been shown that this family has different metabolic potentials for substrate utilization compared to other microorganisms involved in the enhanced biological phosphorus removal process of wwtps kindaichi et al 2013 microorganisms from the wastewater also had negative impacts on the relative abundance of several taxa in periphyton which were assigned to the third group named group negative this group was composed by 18 prokaryotic and 4 eukaryotic taxa among which several were specific to group negative fig 6 for instance this was the case for several prokaryotic taxa belonging to cyanobacteria deinococcaceae methylobacteriaceae and microbacteriaceae fig 6a cyanobacteria are known to respond differently i e an increase or a decrease of abundance to wastewater effluents carles et al 2021 carles and artigas 2020 corcoll et al 2014 mansfeldt et al 2020 romero et al 2019 however we are not aware of any study that investigated the specific effect of wastewater microorganisms on this phylum deinococcaceae have already been associated to periphyton growing in reference unpolluted sites in a previous study comparing community composition along an urban pollution gradient in a stream pineda mora et al 2020 indicating their potential sensitivity to wastewater constituents the presence of methylobacteriaceae and microbacteriaceae in the group negative may be explained by their association with microalgae levy et al 2009 paddock et al 2020 which seemed to be negatively impacted by wastewater microorganisms in terms of abundance i e class chlorophyceae in fig s7b finally group negative also contained one eukaryotic taxon affiliated to bacillariophyta i e diatoms fig 6b which is consistent with the observed negative impact of wastewater microorganisms on diatom abundance fig s8b these results highlight the need to consider wastewater microbial communities as a stressor per se which can influence the final composition of periphyton communities when examining the potential impacts of wastewater on stream ecosystems for water quality assessment this aspect was poorly described so far as most studies looked either at the overall effluent toxicity liao et al 2019 nega et al 2019 peng et al 2018 romero et al 2019 or at other wastewater constituents such as nutrients lebkuecher et al 2018 and micropollutants carles et al 2021 chonova et al 2019 tamminen et al 2022 tardy et al 2021 tlili et al 2020 our study also points towards the importance of species interactions within periphyton communities as well as between prokaryotes and eukaryotes which occur among co existing species in periphyton gubelit and grossart 2020 for instance studies on diatom bacterial interactions revealed a high species specific interdependence of the algal host and bacteria as each diatom species developed a bacterial community that differed in its composition grossart et al 2005 koedooder et al 2019 stock et al 2019 4 conclusions overall our study provides compelling evidence that microorganisms originating from wastewater strongly affected periphyton communities specifically we show that these microorganisms are able to colonize periphyton and modify its community composition either directly or indirectly via species interactions contributing to changes in respiration profiles being at the basis of the food web in streams such changes in periphyton communities downstream of wwtps bear potential significant environmental costs for higher trophic levels with probable impacts on the overall flow of energy through the food chain in fresh waters furthermore our results also showed that tolerance of periphyton communities to micropollutants was governed by microorganisms released from the wwtp and not by in stream exposure to the micropollutants this finding underlines the fact that the pollution induced community tolerance pict concept which stipulates that increased tolerance is directly caused by the exerted selection pressure of micropollutants should be reconsidered in the context of wwtps instead selection pressures that occur in highly contaminated compartments such as in the wwtp itself have to be taken into account collectively our findings also have important implications for wwtp management microbial communities that are released in the wastewater should be considered as a potential stressor for the receiving streams similarly to other stressors such as nutrients micropollutants or increased temperature this in turn implies that the measures currently implemented in wwtps to reduce the load of released microorganisms are not sufficient to completely reduce the ecological hazard they might represent credit authorship contribution statement louis carles conceptualization data curation formal analysis writing original draft

tarongers s n valencia spain corresponding author at institute of sustainable processes university of valladolid c dr mergelina valladolid spain institute of sustainable processes university of valladolid c dr mergelina valladolid spain understanding water energy nexus in the provision of drinking water services is a challenge which has outstanding relevance in the current climatic emergency environmental efficiency and eco efficiency assessment of water companies are two useful tools to address this challenge in this study we estimated hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions to compute the potential reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions and energy costs in the provision of drinking water the empirical application focused on the english and welsh water companies over 2011 2019 average environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores were 0 920 and 0 962 respectively which indicates that water companies performed well but there is room for improvement moreover due to the economies of scale the cost of reducing ghg emissions was higher for water and sewerage companies than for water only companies the results and conclusions of this study allow better understanding of the relationship between the provision of drinking water energy costs and ghg emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water energy nexus stochastic frontier analysis greenhouse gas emissions environmental efficiency water utilities eco efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there has been growing interest from policy makers and researchers to understand the relationship between water and energy i e water energy nexus as they are two primary sources for life environment and economy emrouznejad and yang 2016 the energy used by the water companies in many cases is derived from traditional fossil fuel sources and therefore involves indirect greenhouse gas ghg emissions moreover water utilities produce a significant amount of direct ghg emissions ananda and hampf 2015 saidan et al 2019 wakeel et al 2018 chen et al 2018 and liao et al 2020 showed that energy demand will increase in the urban water cycle at country and city level due to climate change and population growth these previous studies focused on assessing the energy intensity of water utilities which is defined as the level of energy required per unit of drinking water supplied kwh m3 therefore they did not consider either the cost of abstracting treating and distributing water or the ghg emissions produced in these activities by contrast the concept of efficiency is a broader metric which integrates additional variables to energy use and water supplied it is a synthetic index that integrates multiple inputs and outputs molinos senante and sala garrido 2018 in this context ananda 2019 evidenced that operational and maintenance costs and operational characteristics had a significant role in water companies ghg emissions levels and efficiency understanding energy costs and ghg performance in the urban water cycle would be of great importance to policy makers to provide water services in a sustainable manner this can be done by evaluating the economic and environmental efficiency i e eco efficiency of water companies to improve eco efficiency water companies should reduce costs and ghg emissions in the provision of drinking water services ananda 2018 mocholi arce et al 2021 this issue is even more relevant for the english and welsh water companies because the united kingdom government is committed that the water industry should cut down its ghg emissions by 80 by 2050 parliament of the uk 2008 for this reason the english and welsh water companies monitor and report their ghg emissions according to the united kingdom government environmental reporting guidelines hm government 2019 ghg emissions are categorized in four groups i scope 1 which are direct emissions ii scope 2 which correspond to indirect emissions iii regulated scope 3 indirect emissions accounted and iv non regulated scope 3 indirect emissions not regulated ofwat 2010a given the relevance of better understanding of the water energy nexus there were several studies in the past devoted to assessing eco efficiency of water companies and their facilities i e wastewater treatment plants wwtps and drinking water treatment plants dwtps in doing so the most widely methodological approach employed is data envelopment analysis dea which compares each company s performance relative to the best industry s frontier ananda 2019 mocholi arce et al 2020 2021 sala garrido et al 2021a 2021b this method has also been applied to estimate eco efficiency of wwtps dong et al 2017 gómez et al 2018 ramirez melgarejo et al 2021 however the main limitation of dea is its deterministic nature which means that any deviations from the efficient frontier are due to inefficiency only thus it does not take into account the measurement of error moreover being non parametric linear programming it does not assume a functional form for the underlying technology so the statistical significance of parameters cannot be evaluated to overcome this limitation cuesta and zofio 2005 and cuesta et al 2009 proposed a hyperbolic distance function for the underlying technology which is both parametric and stochastic in particular the authors measured environmental efficiency by estimating a translog hyperbolic distance function using stochastic frontier analysis sfa techniques this is an econometric technique that allows us to take into account both noise and inefficiency in performance assessment lv et al 2021 in other words the authors developed an alternative approach to dea and sfa which is both parametric and stochastic overcoming the limitations of both methods this approach has been used in assessing ghg performance in the energy sector at regional and country level see for instance cuesta et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 duman and kasman 2018 however to the best of our knowledge it has not been used to study the water energy ghg nexus in the water industry our study aims to fill this gap in literature the objective of this study is to assess the environmental efficiency and eco efficiency of water companies using advanced techniques which provide reliable and robust estimations avoiding biased results moreover the estimation of both hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions allows us to discuss interesting technological characteristics of the water industry which could have affected environmental performance and eco efficiency these included economies of scale substitutability between inputs and the opportunity cost of reducing ghg emissions taking into account the goal of the english and welsh water industry of reducing ghg emissions by 80 by 2050 parliament of the uk 2008 environmental efficiency refers to simultaneously minimize ghg emissions and maximize the volume of drinking water delivered with the current economic costs whereas eco efficiency involves the reduction of ghg emissions and energy and other costs and expanding drinking water delivered at the same time both indexes could be part of a more holistic sustainability assessment of water companies since they are smart e g specific measurable achievable relevant and time bound which is a basic requirement about the quality of an indicator chambers et al 2022 we contribute to the existing trend of literature in the following ways first the environmental efficiency and eco efficiency of water companies embracing direct and indirect ghg emissions has not been estimated before using parametric and stochastic methods second we used for the first time hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions to evaluate the performance of water companies which allows analyzing the substitutability between inputs and estimating the opportunity cost of reducing ghg emissions the empirical application focused on the english and welsh water industry because it is one of the few industries where data on ghg emissions at water company level is available hence the findings of this study can help researchers and policy makers to get a better understanding on the water energy ghg emissions nexus in the provision of drinking water services 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology to assess environmental efficiency the hyperbolic distance function was used where water companies simultaneously expand desirable outputs water delivered and contract undesirable outputs ghg emissions for a given level of inputs costs to integrate inputs costs in the assessment i e to evaluate eco efficiency an enhanced hyperbolic distance function was employed where companies reduce ghg energy and other costs and expand drinking water delivered at the same time adenuga et al 2020 hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions were estimated using sfa techniques which allows us to distinguish between noise and inefficiency the hyperbolic distance functions were introduced by fare et al 1985 1989 and further developed by cuesta and zofio 2005 and cuesta et al 2009 these distance functions allow for the simultaneous proportional expansion of desirable outputs and contraction of undesirable outputs and inputs we first describe how we used these distance functions to represent the production technology and then the techniques to estimate the underlying technology we assumed that there are j total water companies in our study that use a set of inputs m to generate a set of r desirable outputs and a set of s undesirable outputs the production technology t is defined as follows 1 t x y g y b k m s p x c a n p r o d u c e y g a n d y b where x x 1 x m k m y g y g 1 y g r k r y b y b 1 y b s k s denote the vector of total inputs desirable and undesirable outputs respectively that belong to the input set k which shows the different combinations of inputs used for a given level of desirable and undesirable outputs the production technology can be represented by the hyperbolic distance function which measures the proportion by which desirable outputs can be expanded and undesirable outputs can be contracted at the same time for a given level of inputs the hyperbolic distance function is defined as follows 2 d h x y g y b i n f ω 0 x y g ω y b ω t where ω denotes the scalar the proportion by which desirable outputs need to be expanded and undesirable outputs to be reduced at the same time the hyperbolic distance function fulfils the properties of homogeneity non decreasing in desirable outputs and non increasing in undesirable outputs and inputs cuesta et al 2009 an alternative representation of the production technology is with the use of an enhanced hyperbolic distance function in which inputs and undesirable outputs are contracted and desirable outputs are expanded at the same time the enhanced hyperbolic distance function is defined as follows 3 d e h x y g y b i n f θ 0 x θ y g θ y b θ t where θ is the scalar the proportion by which inputs and undesirable outputs are contracted and desirable outputs are expanded at the same time the enhanced hyperbolic distance function also fulfils the properties of homogeneity non decreasing in desirable outputs and non increasing in undesirable outputs and inputs pham and zelenyuk 2018 the estimation of the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions using parametric econometric techniques requires the specification of a functional form for the underlying production technology we used a translog specification because it allows for estimating changes in economies of scale over time it is also flexible easy to estimate appropriate for the imposition of homogeneity and widely applied in the literature of efficiency analysis morrison paul et al 2000 saal et al 2007 molinos senante et al 2017 after imposing the homogeneity assumption in desirable outputs and symmetry conditions the translog hyperbolic output distance takes the following form 4 ln d h y g r j t a j m 1 m a m ln x m j t r 1 r 1 s 1 s 1 β s ln y b s j t 1 2 m 1 m m 1 m a l m ln x l j t ln x m j t 1 2 r 1 r 1 p 1 r 1 β r p ln y g r j t ln y g p j t 1 1 q 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 β q s ln y b q j t ln y b s j t m 1 m r 1 r 1 γ m r ln x m j t ln y g r

g r j t y b s j t y b s j t y g r j t and r t h is the desirable output for normalizing purposes as part of the homogeneity condition cuesta et al 2009 in eq 4 j denotes water company t is time ε j t is the standard error term that follows the normal distribution the term u j t is the technical inefficiency of each water company j at any time t and follows the half normal distribution moreover the term z j t denotes the set of operational characteristics that might impact water companies efficiency and are related to source of raw water treatment complexity and population density sala garrido et al 2021b the intercept a j captures unobserved water company heterogeneity which is fixed time invariant and separated from inefficiency this is based on the true fixed effects model proposed by greene 2005 and is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation techniques saal et al 2007 molinos senante et al 2017 2018 the environmental efficiency of any water company j at any time t is calculated as follows 5 e e j t exp l n d h j t x m j t y g j t y b j t exp u j t in analogous manner the translog enhanced hyperbolic output distance function is defined as follows 6 l n d e h y g r

b s j t t π 1 t 1 2 π 2 t 2 s 1 z η z z j t ε j t u j t where x m j t x m j t y g r j t and r t h is the desirable output which is used for normalizing purposes based on the homogeneity condition cuesta et al 2009 like eq 4 the enhanced hyperbolic model includes operational characteristics that might influence water companies efficiency and firm specific fixed unobserved heterogeneity the eco efficiency of any water company j at any time t from the enhanced hyperbolic model is calculated as follows 7 t e j t exp l n d e h j t x m j t y g j t y b j t exp u j t the estimated parameters of the distance functions in eqs 4 and 6 allowed us to measure several characteristics of the underlying technology these include the following i the elasticity of desirable output regarding inputs ii the degree of substitutability or complementarity among inputs and iii the rate of transformation between desirable and undesirable outputs grosskopf et al 1995 morrison paul et al 2000 in particular the elasticities for each input m for the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions can be derived as follows respectively 8 ε y g x m h ϑ l n y g ϑ l n x m a m m 1 m a l m l n x l j t s 1 s γ m s l n y b s j t m 1 m δ m t 9 ε y g x m e h ϑ l n y g ϑ l n x m a m m 1 m a l m l n x l j t s 1 s γ m s l n y b s j t m 1 m δ m t the elasticity of the output distance with respect to an input m shows the percentage increase in the desirable output when there is an increase in input m we note that the negative of the sum of the input elasticities gives a measure of scale elasticity cuesta and zofio 2005 if scale elasticity takes a value greater than 1 then increasing returns to scale prevail this means that on average costs increase less than an expansion in outputs if scale elasticity is lower than 1 then decreasing economies of scale exist if scale elasticity is equal to one then constant returns to scale are present in eqs 8 and 9 input elasticities have a second order term between inputs a lm which indicates if inputs are substitutes or complements morrison paul et al 2000 for instance in the case of the hyperbolic distance function let s denote a lm a lm ln x ljt then if a lm is negative positive the contribution of x l to production expands contracts when x m increases suggesting that both inputs are complements substitutes cuesta et al 2009 the rate of transformation between desirable outputs and undesirable outputs for each distance function can be derived from the output elasticities the undesirable output elasticity for each distance function are derived as follows 10 ɛ y g y b h ϑ ln y g ϑ lny bs β s q 1 s 1 β qs lny bqjt m 1 m γ ms ln x mjt s 1 s 1 μ s t 11 ɛ y g y b e h ϑ l n y g ϑ l n y b s β s q 1 s 1 β q s l n y b q j t m 1 m γ m s l n x m j t s 1 s 1 μ s t the desirable output elasticity for each distance function is derived through the homogeneity condition as follows cuesta et al 2009 12 ε y g h 1 ε y g y b h 13 ε y g e h 1 ε y g y b e h the ratio of these output elasticities give a degree of substitutability between desirable and undesirable output which is denoted as follows 14 s u b s y g y b h ε y g h ε y g y b h 15 s u b s y g y b e h ε y g e h ε y g y b e h if negative values of s u b s y g y b are greater than unity then it means that the opportunity cost of desirable output in terms of undesirable output is high this suggests that the cost of reducing undesirable output is high moreover there is a high degree of complementarity between these outputs which suggests that in order to reduce the undesirable output requires a reduction in the production of desirable output cuesta et al 2009 in spite of the positive features of the methodological approach applied to compute environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores it has two potential shortfalls first it provides a static performance assessment since efficiency scores are estimated for a given time i e year this is not an issue if we are generally interested in comparing the efficiency among water companies however we could evaluate ghg productivity change by conducting dynamic efficiency analysis second it does not distinguish between persistent and transient efficiency the distinction between persistent and transient efficiency is of great interest from a policy point of view because they have different policy implications minviel and sipiläinen 2021 2 2 case study our empirical study focuses on the water services that are provided by several water utilities in england and wales over the 2011 2019 period water and sewerage companies wascs and water only companies wocs are the two types of companies that were formed after the privatization of the water industry in 1989 wascs provide water and sanitation services whereas wocs only provide water services i e both types of water companies provide water services according to the net zero 2030 roadmap water uk 2022 english and welsh water companies monitor and report ghg emissions separately for water and sanitation services considering the objectives of this study environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores in the provision of water services for both wascs and wocs were computed the water services regulation authority ofwat monitors the economic and environmental performance of the water companies by approving their business plans every five years in these business plans the allowed tariffs that the companies would recover in the future is determined price reviews more information about the regulation model applied is provided by ofwat 2022a inputs desirable outputs and undesirable outputs were selected based on data availability and studies that evaluated companies performance in water industry e g berg and marques 2011 pinto et al 2017 cetrulo et al 2019 walker et al 2019 goh and see 2021 the first input was the energy expenditure cost of water services measured in millions of pounds every year the second input was the other expenditure cost which is defined as the difference between operating expenditure and energy expenditure other expenditure was also expressed in millions of pounds every year the desirable output was defined as the volume of drinking water delivered measured in cubic metres per year the undesirable output was defined as the ghg emissions from the provision of drinking water which is expressed in tonnes of co2 equivalent co2eq per year molinos senante et al 2015 ananda and hampf 2015 molinos senante and guzman 2018 sala garrido et al 2021a ghg emissions are associated with companies activities to abstract treat and supply water to its customers ofwat 2010a 2010b and were measured based on the united kingdom government environmental reporting guidelines hm goverment 2019 according to ofwat 2010a ghg emissions are categorized in four groups i scope 1 ii scope 2 iii regulated scope 3 and iv non regulated scope 3 scope 1 involves emissions from transport owned or leased emissions from the companies own fossil fuel use and methane and nitrous oxide from sewage treatment scope 2 involves grid electricity used for pumping and treatment of water and sewage and grid electricity used in owned buildings regulated scope 3 involves emissions from contractors and outsource services and business associated transport on public transport or in private vehicles finally nonregulated scope 3 involves chemical manufacture embedded emissions from construction and manufacturing activity customers energy use to heat water and release of methane and nitrous oxide from sludge disposed to landfill and agriculture ofwat 2010a thus our study involves scope 1 scope 2 and regulated scope 3 emissions related to water services and does not include scope 3 emissions that are not regulated by ofwat and ghg emissions associated to sanitation wastewater collection and treatment activities the adoption of renewable energy by water companies in england and wales is heterogeneous which means that the contribution of scope 2 emissions to the total ghg emissions of water companies varies environment agency 2009 and therefore ghg emissions and energy costs are not related variables for english and welsh water companies the selection of operational characteristics was also based on data availability and past research on this topic ofwat 2019 d inverno et al 2021 in particular we included several operational characteristics to reflect the raw water abstraction process and treatment complexity of water production process the raw water abstraction process was captured by the percentage of water taken from rivers and average pumping head it is expected that the abstraction of more water requiring high pumping could lead to higher carbon emissions and therefore impacting on the eco efficiency of water companies the water treatment complexity was captured by the number of treatment works for water coming from groundwater and surface water resources we also used the percentage of water that receives advanced level of water treatment for more details please see ofwat 2018 it is expected that when the water requires high levels of treatment before it is distributed to customers the higher the level of ghg emissions and inefficiency could be data about input desirable outputs undesirable outputs and operational characteristics were collected from ofwat and water companies webpages and therefore variables are at water company level no specific procedures were applied to the data before computing the equations described in section 2 1 methodology the descriptive statistics of the variables used in the study are reported in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 water energy nexus through environmental efficiency and eco efficiency assessment according to the methodology previously discussed to estimate environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores for each water company the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions were estimated table 2 before the estimation of the distance functions all variables were normalized around the mean and therefore the estimated coefficients are interpreted as elasticities molinos senante et al 2017 we first look at the coefficients of hyperbolic distance function which were negative and statistically significant from zero for both the undesirable output and inputs this means that the distance function is non increasing in undesirable outputs and inputs and the monotonicity condition is fulfilled results indicate that an increase in ghg emissions would increase the distance to the frontier the coefficients of each parameter embracing eq 4 are shown in table 2 and allow concluding that technically speaking and keeping other variables equal a 1 increase in ghg emissions would increase drinking water supplied by 0 36 both energy costs and other costs played a major role in the production of water output it is found that ceteris paribus a 1 increase in energy costs and other costs could lead to an increase in drinking water by 0 492 and 0 445 respectively summing up the negative of these input elasticities gives a measure of scale elasticity of 0 937 which means that on average the industry operates under decreasing economies of scale thus an increase in costs by 1 leads to an increase in drinking water supplied by less than 1 i e 0 937 focusing on performance change over time the negative sign of time and time squared indicates that there was upward shift in the production frontier which means that the english and welsh water industry experienced technical progress at a rate of 1 4 over the period of study the statistically significant and positive coefficient of the interaction term between energy costs and other costs suggests that they could be complementary adhikari and bjorndal 2012 the results from the operational characteristics reveal that all variables are statistically significant from zero and have a positive coefficient it is found that advanced levels of water treatment water taken from rivers and average pumping head had the major contribution to eco efficiency the more advanced the level of water treatment is the higher the inefficiency as it might increase energy costs and ghg emissions keeping other variables constant a 1 increase in water treatment complexity might increase inefficiency by 0 386 as it is shown in table 2 higher pumping requirements to abstract treat and distribute water to customers might lead to higher ghg emissions and lower inefficiency as well we next discuss the results from the enhanced hyperbolic model which are similar to the ones obtained with the hyperbolic model however the values of the coefficients of the eq 6 and shown in table 2 are smaller because the enhanced hyperbolic model expands the desirable output volume of water supplied and contracts ghg emissions and inputs costs more particularly it is shown that a 1 increase in ghg emissions increased water output by 0 039 keeping other variables the same lower values for energy costs and other costs are reported as well both types of costs are significant contributors to output expansion a 1 increase in energy costs and other costs could increase the volume of water delivered by 0 384 and 0 399 respectively like the hyperbolic model this model showed that at the sample mean decreasing returns to scale for the industry prevail the need to simultaneously expand output and contract ghg emissions and costs made it difficult for the production frontier to shift upwards the rate of technical change was immaterial and at the level of 0 1 which was considerably lower than the hyperbolic model all operational characteristics were statistically significant from zero treatment complexity and average pumping head had the major impact on eco efficiency technically speaking and other variables being equal a 1 increase in water treatment complexity and average pumping head could reduce eco efficiency by 0 255 and 0 355 respectively this is attributed to the fact that higher energy costs are involved to pump water into treatment plants and then treat water before delivered to customers this could lead to higher ghg emissions and lower eco efficiency this is also evident when higher treatment works are required when water is taken from surface and groundwater resources figs 1 and 2 present the average environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores from the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic models respectively which have been estimated by solving eqs 5 and 7 in terms of environmental efficiency the results shown in fig 1 suggest that on average the water companies performed well in particular it was found that on average the english and welsh water companies could increase the volume of drinking water delivered by 8 75 1 0 920 1 0875 and at the same time reduce ghg emissions by 8 1 0 920 0 080 over the whole period of study both wascs and wocs reported the same levels of environmental efficiency which was 0 920 when the companies need to reduce costs along with ghg emissions then they became even more efficient therefore the results from the enhanced hyperbolic distance function fig 2 suggest that on average the companies could increase the volume of water delivered by 3 95 1 0 962 1 0395 and at the same time contract ghg emissions and costs energy and other costs by 3 8 1 0 962 0 038 thus adopting energy efficient practices involves cost savings and lower levels of carbon emissions and eventually lower inefficiency in order to discuss the trend in water companies efficiency over time we split the period of study 2011 19 into two sub periods the first sub period 2011 15 refers to the 2009 price review where the regulator ofwat introduced several schemes to boost companies efficiency these included a rolling incentive mechanism where the companies could keep any savings in operating expenditure regardless of the year occurred villegas et al 2019 moreover to ensure environmental sustainability such as reduction in water leakage and unplanned interruptions the regulator introduced several financial rewards when the companies met their targets the results from the hyperbolic model fig 1 indicated that during the period 2011 15 average woc s environmental efficiency fluctuated but it was increasing at a rate of 0 28 per year it finally increased from 0 917 in 2011 to 0 928 in 2015 in contrast average wasc s environmental efficiency remained stable at the end of the sub period this finding suggests that both wocs and wascs performed well in delivering water to customers and reducing ghg emissions at the same time for a given level of inputs we note that wascs could be more efficient and catch up with wocs by further reducing their carbon emissions the results from the enhanced hyperbolic model i e eco efficiency fig 2 reveal a different pattern in particular average woc s eco efficiency followed a downward trend over time which was interrupted in 2014 its eco efficiency in 2015 was at the same level with the one reported in 2011 during the sub period 2011 15 average woc s eco efficiency was 0 963 which means that desirable output could be expanded by 3 9 and at the same time carbon emissions and costs could be reduced by 3 7 in contrast average wasc s eco efficiency was slightly increasing at a rate of 0 06 per year eco efficiency increased from 0 961 in 2011 to 0 964 in 2015 like the environmental efficiency during the years 2011 15 average wascs were slightly more eco efficient than wocs the findings suggest that both wascs and wocs might have experienced difficulties in achieving further savings in costs over time however their efficiency remained at high levels we then analyze the efficiency estimates from the second sub period 2016 19 which refers to the 2014 price review the regulator introduced further financial incentives to promote economic and environmental efficiency it introduced a set of common performance indicators for the whole water industry to monitor cost and environmental performance these indicators such as water leakage flooding and pollution incidents carbon emissions had the form of financial or reputation rewards when companies met their targets villegas et al 2019 the results from the hyperbolic model fig 1 suggest that during the years 2016 19 average woc s environmental efficiency followed a downward and considerably decreased from 0 929 in 2016 to 0 903 in 2019 this is attributed to the fact that the company did not manage to reduce its ghg emissions for a given level of inputs wocs are smaller than wascs in terms of volume of drinking water delivered and therefore as small water utilities face other problems and challenges than wascs although there is no direct scientific evidence the results from our study suggest that wocs have not prioritized the reduction of ghg emissions as wascs have done in contrast during the same period wascs seemed to have performed slightly better than wocs their mean environmental efficiency was increasing at rate of 0 22 per year and eventually increased compared to the previous sub period in 2019 average wascs needed to further reduce their ghg emissions by 7 8 whereas wocs needed to reduce their carbon emissions by 10 the findings suggest that during the years 2016 19 wascs managed to catch up and exceed woc s efficiency levels whereas wocs did not continue to improve their efficiency this is attributed to the fact that their ghg emissions performance was not satisfactory the results from the enhanced hyperbolic model reveal a similar trend during the second sub period 2016 19 woc s eco efficiency followed a downward trend with the exception being the last year of the sample in contrast average wasc performed slightly better than woc over that period and its eco efficiency remained at high levels 0 965 wasc could become more environmentally efficient by further reducing costs and ghg emissions by 3 5 because of the smaller size of wocs relative to wascs sometimes it may be difficult to implement innovations to reduce ghg emissions and energetic costs on these small water companies previous research portela et al 2011 molinos senante et al 2015 molinos senante and maziotis 2020 also concluded that wascs performed slightly better than wocs from an economic perspective the authors suggested that wocs were more affected than wascs due to the rise in electricity prices and reduction in the levels of leakage imposed by the 2009 and 2014 price reviews in terms of environmental efficiency wocs improved their performance during the first period evaluated 2011 15 whereas in the second period the improvement was mainly achieved by wascs in the case of eco efficiency the same trend is observed for the two periods evaluated wocs suffered a regression on eco efficiency scores whereas wascs improved their performance hence according to the results shown on figs 1 and 2 it can be concluded that the measures adopted by ofwat during the 2009 and 2014 price reviews favored improvements in the performance of wascs however negative effects except for environmental efficiency in the first period were reported for wocs as part of the strategy to achieve the goal of reducing ghg emissions by 80 by 2050 the english and welsh water companies have individual strategies to reduce ghg emissions or even achieve net zero emissions the environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores estimated for each water company could be used to feed into and update these plans it should be noted that both synthetic indicators developed take into account the impact of exogenous variables e g source of raw water level of treatment pumping head etc on the performance of water companies hence in addition to the national policy landscape the specific results at water company level are useful to identify specific operational requirements and local decarbonization opportunities moreover the approach applied in this study would be also used by the water regulator in january 2022 ofwat published a position paper on the net zero 2030 routemap on carbon by water uk ofwat 2022b among other issues ofwat emphasized the importance of integrating the net zero strategies developed by the water companies with the pr24 and beyond creating tomorrow together which is the framework for price review in 2024 and future price reviews in the english and welsh water industry in particular ofwat stated that future price controls should support water companies to meet the challenge of net zero ofwat recognizes that transition to net zero may increase costs of service considering the regulatory approach employed by ofwat to set water tariffs i e price cap regulation where tariffs are adjusted considering inflation and expected efficiency improvements the methodology proposed in our study might be very useful for the regulator to integrate ghg emissions on efficiency assessment moreover it has been evidenced that environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores estimated using the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions are robust avoiding any misleading conclusions 3 2 characteristics of the water industry we now turn our discussion in the results from the derivation of the average inputs and output elasticities for the whole period of study table 3 it is found that in the hyperbolic distance function a 1 increase in industry s energy costs and other costs could lead to an increase in the volume of drinking water delivered by 0 871 this result suggests that the industry operated below its optimal scale however a different situation is evident when looking at the results for each company type during the period of study average woc operated under decreasing economies of scale whereas wasc seemed to function under small increasing economies of scale a 1 increase in energy and other costs could result in a higher output expansion by 1 142 this means that adjustments in wasc s scale of operations could lead to lower costs and higher efficiency however we note that wascs could further improve efficiency by reducing energy costs as this factor plays a major role in providing water services in contrast wocs should focus on reducing energy and other costs before producing more output the negative sign of a e c o c and a o c e c suggest that energy costs and other costs are complements this exists for both wocs and wascs this means that the path to eco efficiency requires reductions in both energy and other costs the adoption of energy efficient practices when abstracting and treating water could lead to lower levels of ghg emissions and higher environmental efficiency when companies aim to simultaneously expand output and reduce carbon emissions for a given level of inputs then the opportunity cost of reducing carbon emissions s u b s c o 2 y is relatively costly for wascs s u b s c o 2 y takes a value which is slightly higher than unity whereas for wocs the value of s u b s c o 2 y is almost unity this means that it is not relatively expensive for wocs to reduce carbon emissions whereas for wascs it may be this is explained by the fact that wascs have more customers to serve than wocs and thus higher overall costs the results from the enhanced hyperbolic model reveal several interesting conclusions first during the years 2011 19 both wascs and wocs operated under decreasing economies of scale a 1 increase in costs would lead to a lower increase in outputs by 0 789 water companies should put efforts into achieving cost savings in water production processes rather than expanding their size by producing more output like the hyperbolic model there is a degree of complementarity between energy costs and other costs this means that if the companies want to become more environmentally efficient they should reduce both energy costs and other costs unlike the hyperbolic model the opportunity cost of reducing carbon emissions is now considerably high for both wocs and wascs this is attributed to the fact that the companies need to reduce carbon emissions and inputs and deliver more water at the same time considering that ghg emissions involve both direct and indirect emissions associated with electricity use it appears that for wocs high energy requirements to abstract treat and supply water to customers could explain the high cost of reducing carbon emissions for wascs the use of other costs such as labour and chemicals when treating more water might explain the high cost of curtailing carbon emissions as s u b s c o 2 y takes a value beyond unit the reduction of both carbon emissions and water delivered is the right way for a sustainable urban water cycle 4 conclusions water companies are faced with several challenges in the light of climate change and population growth such as providing enough drinking water and at the same time reducing ghg emissions in this study we used the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions to evaluate the environmental efficiency and eco efficiency of several water companies in england and wales over the years 2011 2019 moreover it was assessed the substitutability between costs and between water delivered and carbon emissions the empirical application conducted focused on the english and welsh water industry because is one of the of the most advanced in the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions at water company level in addition the water regulator considers the need for and importance of reducing ghg emissions in the processes to set water tariffs however the methodology proposed in this study could be applied to water companies operating in other countries and could also be extended to wastewater collection and treatment services we finally note that the methodology of this study could be used to quantify the environmental impact of any other undesirable product in water industry such as water leakage or any other industry such as supply interruptions in energy sector the case study evidenced that the english and welsh water industry performed well in terms of environmental efficiency on average it could expand the volume of drinking water delivered by 8 75 and at the same time curtail ghg emissions by 8 higher level of performance was reported when eco efficiency was assessed in particular the results showed that water companies could increase their volume of drinking water delivered by 3 95 and at the same time contract ghg emissions and costs energy costs and other costs by 3 8 after splitting the study period into two sub periods to reflect the regulator s price reviews it can be concluded that the measures adopted by ofwat during the 2009 and 2014 price reviews favored improvements in both environmental efficiency and eco efficiency of wascs our study demonstrated that the more complex the treatment of water is the higher the costs and level of carbon emissions could be finally it is evidenced that both energy costs and other costs need to reduce to improve eco efficiency as these inputs are complements the findings of our study are of great significance for policy makers for the following reasons first water managers can evaluate how efficient companies are when expanding the volume of drinking water delivered and curtailing ghg emissions at the same time for a given level of costs they can also determine how efficiency changes when companies want to reduce costs as well moreover our study showed that both energy costs and other costs are the major cost drivers of companies efficiency however managers could identify additional factors that could impact overall costs and inefficiency such as pumping requirements and complexity of water treatment process these factors should also be included in the decision making process our methodology also showed that the path to an environmentally sustainable industry requires improvements in energy efficiency reduction in carbon emissions and abstraction of less water this could be achieved by the constructive collaboration of water managers and regulator via the form of financial rewards when companies adopt practices that help them to become more eco efficient declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper

valladolid c dr mergelina valladolid spain understanding water energy nexus in the provision of drinking water services is a challenge which has outstanding relevance in the current climatic emergency environmental efficiency and eco efficiency assessment of water companies are two useful tools to address this challenge in this study we estimated hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions to compute the potential reduction in greenhouse gas ghg emissions and energy costs in the provision of drinking water the empirical application focused on the english and welsh water companies over 2011 2019 average environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores were 0 920 and 0 962 respectively which indicates that water companies performed well but there is room for improvement moreover due to the economies of scale the cost of reducing ghg emissions was higher for water and sewerage companies than for water only companies the results and conclusions of this study allow better understanding of the relationship between the provision of drinking water energy costs and ghg emissions graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water energy nexus stochastic frontier analysis greenhouse gas emissions environmental efficiency water utilities eco efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction there has been growing interest from policy makers and researchers to understand the relationship between water and energy i e water energy nexus as they are two primary sources for life environment and economy emrouznejad and yang 2016 the energy used by the water companies in many cases is derived from traditional fossil fuel sources and therefore involves indirect greenhouse gas ghg emissions moreover water utilities produce a significant amount of direct ghg emissions ananda and hampf 2015 saidan et al 2019 wakeel et al 2018 chen et al 2018 and liao et al 2020 showed that energy demand will increase in the urban water cycle at country and city level due to climate change and population growth these previous studies focused on assessing the energy intensity of water utilities which is defined as the level of energy required per unit of drinking water supplied kwh m3 therefore they did not consider either the cost of abstracting treating and distributing water or the ghg emissions produced in these activities by contrast the concept of efficiency is a broader metric which integrates additional variables to energy use and water supplied it is a synthetic index that integrates multiple inputs and outputs molinos senante and sala garrido 2018 in this context ananda 2019 evidenced that operational and maintenance costs and operational characteristics had a significant role in water companies ghg emissions levels and efficiency understanding energy costs and ghg performance in the urban water cycle would be of great importance to policy makers to provide water services in a sustainable manner this can be done by evaluating the economic and environmental efficiency i e eco efficiency of water companies to improve eco efficiency water companies should reduce costs and ghg emissions in the provision of drinking water services ananda 2018 mocholi arce et al 2021 this issue is even more relevant for the english and welsh water companies because the united kingdom government is committed that the water industry should cut down its ghg emissions by 80 by 2050 parliament of the uk 2008 for this reason the english and welsh water companies monitor and report their ghg emissions according to the united kingdom government environmental reporting guidelines hm government 2019 ghg emissions are categorized in four groups i scope 1 which are direct emissions ii scope 2 which correspond to indirect emissions iii regulated scope 3 indirect emissions accounted and iv non regulated scope 3 indirect emissions not regulated ofwat 2010a given the relevance of better understanding of the water energy nexus there were several studies in the past devoted to assessing eco efficiency of water companies and their facilities i e wastewater treatment plants wwtps and drinking water treatment plants dwtps in doing so the most widely methodological approach employed is data envelopment analysis dea which compares each company s performance relative to the best industry s frontier ananda 2019 mocholi arce et al 2020 2021 sala garrido et al 2021a 2021b this method has also been applied to estimate eco efficiency of wwtps dong et al 2017 gómez et al 2018 ramirez melgarejo et al 2021 however the main limitation of dea is its deterministic nature which means that any deviations from the efficient frontier are due to inefficiency only thus it does not take into account the measurement of error moreover being non parametric linear programming it does not assume a functional form for the underlying technology so the statistical significance of parameters cannot be evaluated to overcome this limitation cuesta and zofio 2005 and cuesta et al 2009 proposed a hyperbolic distance function for the underlying technology which is both parametric and stochastic in particular the authors measured environmental efficiency by estimating a translog hyperbolic distance function using stochastic frontier analysis sfa techniques this is an econometric technique that allows us to take into account both noise and inefficiency in performance assessment lv et al 2021 in other words the authors developed an alternative approach to dea and sfa which is both parametric and stochastic overcoming the limitations of both methods this approach has been used in assessing ghg performance in the energy sector at regional and country level see for instance cuesta et al 2009 zhang et al 2015 duman and kasman 2018 however to the best of our knowledge it has not been used to study the water energy ghg nexus in the water industry our study aims to fill this gap in literature the objective of this study is to assess the environmental efficiency and eco efficiency of water companies using advanced techniques which provide reliable and robust estimations avoiding biased results moreover the estimation of both hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions allows us to discuss interesting technological characteristics of the water industry which could have affected environmental performance and eco efficiency these included economies of scale substitutability between inputs and the opportunity cost of reducing ghg emissions taking into account the goal of the english and welsh water industry of reducing ghg emissions by 80 by 2050 parliament of the uk 2008 environmental efficiency refers to simultaneously minimize ghg emissions and maximize the volume of drinking water delivered with the current economic costs whereas eco efficiency involves the reduction of ghg emissions and energy and other costs and expanding drinking water delivered at the same time both indexes could be part of a more holistic sustainability assessment of water companies since they are smart e g specific measurable achievable relevant and time bound which is a basic requirement about the quality of an indicator chambers et al 2022 we contribute to the existing trend of literature in the following ways first the environmental efficiency and eco efficiency of water companies embracing direct and indirect ghg emissions has not been estimated before using parametric and stochastic methods second we used for the first time hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions to evaluate the performance of water companies which allows analyzing the substitutability between inputs and estimating the opportunity cost of reducing ghg emissions the empirical application focused on the english and welsh water industry because it is one of the few industries where data on ghg emissions at water company level is available hence the findings of this study can help researchers and policy makers to get a better understanding on the water energy ghg emissions nexus in the provision of drinking water services 2 materials and methods 2 1 methodology to assess environmental efficiency the hyperbolic distance function was used where water companies simultaneously expand desirable outputs water delivered and contract undesirable outputs ghg emissions for a given level of inputs costs to integrate inputs costs in the assessment i e to evaluate eco efficiency an enhanced hyperbolic distance function was employed where companies reduce ghg energy and other costs and expand drinking water delivered at the same time adenuga et al 2020 hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions were estimated using sfa techniques which allows us to distinguish between noise and inefficiency the hyperbolic distance functions were introduced by fare et al 1985 1989 and further developed by cuesta and zofio 2005 and cuesta et al 2009 these distance functions allow for the simultaneous proportional expansion of desirable outputs and contraction of undesirable outputs and inputs we first describe how we used these distance functions to represent the production technology and then the techniques to estimate the underlying technology we assumed that there are j total water companies in our study that use a set of inputs m to generate a set of r desirable outputs and a set of s undesirable outputs the production technology t is defined as follows 1 t x y g y b k m s p x c a n p r o d u c e y g a n d y b where x x 1 x m k m y g y g 1 y g r k r y b y b 1 y b s k s denote the vector of total inputs desirable and undesirable outputs respectively that belong to the input set k which shows the different combinations of inputs used for a given level of desirable and undesirable outputs the production technology can be represented by the hyperbolic distance function which measures the proportion by which desirable outputs can be expanded and undesirable outputs can be contracted at the same time for a given level of inputs the hyperbolic distance function is defined as follows 2 d h x y g y b i n f ω 0 x y g ω y b ω t where ω denotes the scalar the proportion by which desirable outputs need to be expanded and undesirable outputs to be reduced at the same time the hyperbolic distance function fulfils the properties of homogeneity non decreasing in desirable outputs and non increasing in undesirable outputs and inputs cuesta et al 2009 an alternative representation of the production technology is with the use of an enhanced hyperbolic distance function in which inputs and undesirable outputs are contracted and desirable outputs are expanded at the same time the enhanced hyperbolic distance function is defined as follows 3 d e h x y g y b i n f θ 0 x θ y g θ y b θ t where θ is the scalar the proportion by which inputs and undesirable outputs are contracted and desirable outputs are expanded at the same time the enhanced hyperbolic distance function also fulfils the properties of homogeneity non decreasing in desirable outputs and non increasing in undesirable outputs and inputs pham and zelenyuk 2018 the estimation of the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions using parametric econometric techniques requires the specification of a functional form for the underlying production technology we used a translog specification because it allows for estimating changes in economies of scale over time it is also flexible easy to estimate appropriate for the imposition of homogeneity and widely applied in the literature of efficiency analysis morrison paul et al 2000 saal et al 2007 molinos senante et al 2017 after imposing the homogeneity assumption in desirable outputs and symmetry conditions the translog hyperbolic output distance takes the following form 4 ln d h y g r j t a j m 1 m a m ln x m j t r 1 r 1 s 1 s 1 β s ln y b s j t 1 2 m 1 m m 1 m a l m ln x l j t ln x m j t 1 2 r 1 r 1 p 1 r 1 β r p ln y g r j t ln y g p j t 1 1 q 1 s 1 s 1 s 1 β q s ln y b q j t ln y b s j t m 1 m r 1 r 1 γ m r ln x m j t ln y g r

g r j t y b s j t y b s j t y g r j t and r t h is the desirable output for normalizing purposes as part of the homogeneity condition cuesta et al 2009 in eq 4 j denotes water company t is time ε j t is the standard error term that follows the normal distribution the term u j t is the technical inefficiency of each water company j at any time t and follows the half normal distribution moreover the term z j t denotes the set of operational characteristics that might impact water companies efficiency and are related to source of raw water treatment complexity and population density sala garrido et al 2021b the intercept a j captures unobserved water company heterogeneity which is fixed time invariant and separated from inefficiency this is based on the true fixed effects model proposed by greene 2005 and is estimated using maximum likelihood estimation techniques saal et al 2007 molinos senante et al 2017 2018 the environmental efficiency of any water company j at any time t is calculated as follows 5 e e j t exp l n d h j t x m j t y g j t y b j t exp u j t in analogous manner the translog enhanced hyperbolic output distance function is defined as follows 6 l n d e h y g r

cuesta et al 2009 like eq 4 the enhanced hyperbolic model includes operational characteristics that might influence water companies efficiency and firm specific fixed unobserved heterogeneity the eco efficiency of any water company j at any time t from the enhanced hyperbolic model is calculated as follows 7 t e j t exp l n d e h j t x m j t y g j t y b j t exp u j t the estimated parameters of the distance functions in eqs 4 and 6 allowed us to measure several characteristics of the underlying technology these include the following i the elasticity of desirable output regarding inputs ii the degree of substitutability or complementarity among inputs and iii the rate of transformation between desirable and undesirable outputs grosskopf et al 1995 morrison paul et al 2000 in particular the elasticities for each input m for the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions can be derived as follows respectively 8 ε y g x m h ϑ l n y g ϑ l n x m a m m 1 m a l m l n x l j t s 1 s γ m s l n y b s j t m 1 m δ m t 9 ε y g x m e h ϑ l n y g ϑ l n x m a m m 1 m a l m l n x l j t s 1 s γ m s l n y b s j t m 1 m δ m t the elasticity of the output distance with respect to an input m shows the percentage increase in the desirable output when there is an increase in input m we note that the negative of the sum of the input elasticities gives a measure of scale elasticity cuesta and zofio 2005 if scale elasticity takes a value greater than 1 then increasing returns to scale prevail this means that on average costs increase less than an expansion in outputs if scale elasticity is lower than 1 then decreasing economies of scale exist if scale elasticity is equal to one then constant returns to scale are present in eqs 8 and 9 input elasticities have a second order term between inputs a lm which indicates if inputs are substitutes or complements morrison paul et al 2000 for instance in the case of the hyperbolic distance function let s denote a lm a lm ln x ljt then if a lm is negative positive the contribution of x l to production expands contracts when x m increases suggesting that both inputs are complements substitutes cuesta et al 2009 the rate of transformation between desirable outputs and undesirable outputs for each distance function can be derived from the output elasticities the undesirable output elasticity for each distance function are derived as follows 10 ɛ y g y b h ϑ ln y g ϑ lny bs β s q 1 s 1 β qs lny bqjt m 1 m γ ms ln x mjt s 1 s 1 μ s t 11 ɛ y g y b e h ϑ l n y g ϑ l n y b s β s q 1 s 1 β q s l n y b q j t m 1 m γ m s l n x m j t s 1 s 1 μ s t the desirable output elasticity for each distance function is derived through the homogeneity condition as follows cuesta et al 2009 12 ε y g h 1 ε y g y b h 13 ε y g e h 1 ε y g y b e h the ratio of these output elasticities give a degree of substitutability between desirable and undesirable output which is denoted as follows 14 s u b s y g y b h ε y g h ε y g y b h 15 s u b s y g y b e h ε y g e h ε y g y b e h if negative values of s u b s y g y b are greater than unity then it means that the opportunity cost of desirable output in terms of undesirable output is high this suggests that the cost of reducing undesirable output is high moreover there is a high degree of complementarity between these outputs which suggests that in order to reduce the undesirable output requires a reduction in the production of desirable output cuesta et al 2009 in spite of the positive features of the methodological approach applied to compute environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores it has two potential shortfalls first it provides a static performance assessment since efficiency scores are estimated for a given time i e year this is not an issue if we are generally interested in comparing the efficiency among water companies however we could evaluate ghg productivity change by conducting dynamic efficiency analysis second it does not distinguish between persistent and transient efficiency the distinction between persistent and transient efficiency is of great interest from a policy point of view because they have different policy implications minviel and sipiläinen 2021 2 2 case study our empirical study focuses on the water services that are provided by several water utilities in england and wales over the 2011 2019 period water and sewerage companies wascs and water only companies wocs are the two types of companies that were formed after the privatization of the water industry in 1989 wascs provide water and sanitation services whereas wocs only provide water services i e both types of water companies provide water services according to the net zero 2030 roadmap water uk 2022 english and welsh water companies monitor and report ghg emissions separately for water and sanitation services considering the objectives of this study environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores in the provision of water services for both wascs and wocs were computed the water services regulation authority ofwat monitors the economic and environmental performance of the water companies by approving their business plans every five years in these business plans the allowed tariffs that the companies would recover in the future is determined price reviews more information about the regulation model applied is provided by ofwat 2022a inputs desirable outputs and undesirable outputs were selected based on data availability and studies that evaluated companies performance in water industry e g berg and marques 2011 pinto et al 2017 cetrulo et al 2019 walker et al 2019 goh and see 2021 the first input was the energy expenditure cost of water services measured in millions of pounds every year the second input was the other expenditure cost which is defined as the difference between operating expenditure and energy expenditure other expenditure was also expressed in millions of pounds every year the desirable output was defined as the volume of drinking water delivered measured in cubic metres per year the undesirable output was defined as the ghg emissions from the provision of drinking water which is expressed in tonnes of co2 equivalent co2eq per year molinos senante et al 2015 ananda and hampf 2015 molinos senante and guzman 2018 sala garrido et al 2021a ghg emissions are associated with companies activities to abstract treat and supply water to its customers ofwat 2010a 2010b and were measured based on the united kingdom government environmental reporting guidelines hm goverment 2019 according to ofwat 2010a ghg emissions are categorized in four groups i scope 1 ii scope 2 iii regulated scope 3 and iv non regulated scope 3 scope 1 involves emissions from transport owned or leased emissions from the companies own fossil fuel use and methane and nitrous oxide from sewage treatment scope 2 involves grid electricity used for pumping and treatment of water and sewage and grid electricity used in owned buildings regulated scope 3 involves emissions from contractors and outsource services and business associated transport on public transport or in private vehicles finally nonregulated scope 3 involves chemical manufacture embedded emissions from construction and manufacturing activity customers energy use to heat water and release of methane and nitrous oxide from sludge disposed to landfill and agriculture ofwat 2010a thus our study involves scope 1 scope 2 and regulated scope 3 emissions related to water services and does not include scope 3 emissions that are not regulated by ofwat and ghg emissions associated to sanitation wastewater collection and treatment activities the adoption of renewable energy by water companies in england and wales is heterogeneous which means that the contribution of scope 2 emissions to the total ghg emissions of water companies varies environment agency 2009 and therefore ghg emissions and energy costs are not related variables for english and welsh water companies the selection of operational characteristics was also based on data availability and past research on this topic ofwat 2019 d inverno et al 2021 in particular we included several operational characteristics to reflect the raw water abstraction process and treatment complexity of water production process the raw water abstraction process was captured by the percentage of water taken from rivers and average pumping head it is expected that the abstraction of more water requiring high pumping could lead to higher carbon emissions and therefore impacting on the eco efficiency of water companies the water treatment complexity was captured by the number of treatment works for water coming from groundwater and surface water resources we also used the percentage of water that receives advanced level of water treatment for more details please see ofwat 2018 it is expected that when the water requires high levels of treatment before it is distributed to customers the higher the level of ghg emissions and inefficiency could be data about input desirable outputs undesirable outputs and operational characteristics were collected from ofwat and water companies webpages and therefore variables are at water company level no specific procedures were applied to the data before computing the equations described in section 2 1 methodology the descriptive statistics of the variables used in the study are reported in table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 water energy nexus through environmental efficiency and eco efficiency assessment according to the methodology previously discussed to estimate environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores for each water company the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions were estimated table 2 before the estimation of the distance functions all variables were normalized around the mean and therefore the estimated coefficients are interpreted as elasticities molinos senante et al 2017 we first look at the coefficients of hyperbolic distance function which were negative and statistically significant from zero for both the undesirable output and inputs this means that the distance function is non increasing in undesirable outputs and inputs and the monotonicity condition is fulfilled results indicate that an increase in ghg emissions would increase the distance to the frontier the coefficients of each parameter embracing eq 4 are shown in table 2 and allow concluding that technically speaking and keeping other variables equal a 1 increase in ghg emissions would increase drinking water supplied by 0 36 both energy costs and other costs played a major role in the production of water output it is found that ceteris paribus a 1 increase in energy costs and other costs could lead to an increase in drinking water by 0 492 and 0 445 respectively summing up the negative of these input elasticities gives a measure of scale elasticity of 0 937 which means that on average the industry operates under decreasing economies of scale thus an increase in costs by 1 leads to an increase in drinking water supplied by less than 1 i e 0 937 focusing on performance change over time the negative sign of time and time squared indicates that there was upward shift in the production frontier which means that the english and welsh water industry experienced technical progress at a rate of 1 4 over the period of study the statistically significant and positive coefficient of the interaction term between energy costs and other costs suggests that they could be complementary adhikari and bjorndal 2012 the results from the operational characteristics reveal that all variables are statistically significant from zero and have a positive coefficient it is found that advanced levels of water treatment water taken from rivers and average pumping head had the major contribution to eco efficiency the more advanced the level of water treatment is the higher the inefficiency as it might increase energy costs and ghg emissions keeping other variables constant a 1 increase in water treatment complexity might increase inefficiency by 0 386 as it is shown in table 2 higher pumping requirements to abstract treat and distribute water to customers might lead to higher ghg emissions and lower inefficiency as well we next discuss the results from the enhanced hyperbolic model which are similar to the ones obtained with the hyperbolic model however the values of the coefficients of the eq 6 and shown in table 2 are smaller because the enhanced hyperbolic model expands the desirable output volume of water supplied and contracts ghg emissions and inputs costs more particularly it is shown that a 1 increase in ghg emissions increased water output by 0 039 keeping other variables the same lower values for energy costs and other costs are reported as well both types of costs are significant contributors to output expansion a 1 increase in energy costs and other costs could increase the volume of water delivered by 0 384 and 0 399 respectively like the hyperbolic model this model showed that at the sample mean decreasing returns to scale for the industry prevail the need to simultaneously expand output and contract ghg emissions and costs made it difficult for the production frontier to shift upwards the rate of technical change was immaterial and at the level of 0 1 which was considerably lower than the hyperbolic model all operational characteristics were statistically significant from zero treatment complexity and average pumping head had the major impact on eco efficiency technically speaking and other variables being equal a 1 increase in water treatment complexity and average pumping head could reduce eco efficiency by 0 255 and 0 355 respectively this is attributed to the fact that higher energy costs are involved to pump water into treatment plants and then treat water before delivered to customers this could lead to higher ghg emissions and lower eco efficiency this is also evident when higher treatment works are required when water is taken from surface and groundwater resources figs 1 and 2 present the average environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores from the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic models respectively which have been estimated by solving eqs 5 and 7 in terms of environmental efficiency the results shown in fig 1 suggest that on average the water companies performed well in particular it was found that on average the english and welsh water companies could increase the volume of drinking water delivered by 8 75 1 0 920 1 0875 and at the same time reduce ghg emissions by 8 1 0 920 0 080 over the whole period of study both wascs and wocs reported the same levels of environmental efficiency which was 0 920 when the companies need to reduce costs along with ghg emissions then they became even more efficient therefore the results from the enhanced hyperbolic distance function fig 2 suggest that on average the companies could increase the volume of water delivered by 3 95 1 0 962 1 0395 and at the same time contract ghg emissions and costs energy and other costs by 3 8 1 0 962 0 038 thus adopting energy efficient practices involves cost savings and lower levels of carbon emissions and eventually lower inefficiency in order to discuss the trend in water companies efficiency over time we split the period of study 2011 19 into two sub periods the first sub period 2011 15 refers to the 2009 price review where the regulator ofwat introduced several schemes to boost companies efficiency these included a rolling incentive mechanism where the companies could keep any savings in operating expenditure regardless of the year occurred villegas et al 2019 moreover to ensure environmental sustainability such as reduction in water leakage and unplanned interruptions the regulator introduced several financial rewards when the companies met their targets the results from the hyperbolic model fig 1 indicated that during the period 2011 15 average woc s environmental efficiency fluctuated but it was increasing at a rate of 0 28 per year it finally increased from 0 917 in 2011 to 0 928 in 2015 in contrast average wasc s environmental efficiency remained stable at the end of the sub period this finding suggests that both wocs and wascs performed well in delivering water to customers and reducing ghg emissions at the same time for a given level of inputs we note that wascs could be more efficient and catch up with wocs by further reducing their carbon emissions the results from the enhanced hyperbolic model i e eco efficiency fig 2 reveal a different pattern in particular average woc s eco efficiency followed a downward trend over time which was interrupted in 2014 its eco efficiency in 2015 was at the same level with the one reported in 2011 during the sub period 2011 15 average woc s eco efficiency was 0 963 which means that desirable output could be expanded by 3 9 and at the same time carbon emissions and costs could be reduced by 3 7 in contrast average wasc s eco efficiency was slightly increasing at a rate of 0 06 per year eco efficiency increased from 0 961 in 2011 to 0 964 in 2015 like the environmental efficiency during the years 2011 15 average wascs were slightly more eco efficient than wocs the findings suggest that both wascs and wocs might have experienced difficulties in achieving further savings in costs over time however their efficiency remained at high levels we then analyze the efficiency estimates from the second sub period 2016 19 which refers to the 2014 price review the regulator introduced further financial incentives to promote economic and environmental efficiency it introduced a set of common performance indicators for the whole water industry to monitor cost and environmental performance these indicators such as water leakage flooding and pollution incidents carbon emissions had the form of financial or reputation rewards when companies met their targets villegas et al 2019 the results from the hyperbolic model fig 1 suggest that during the years 2016 19 average woc s environmental efficiency followed a downward and considerably decreased from 0 929 in 2016 to 0 903 in 2019 this is attributed to the fact that the company did not manage to reduce its ghg emissions for a given level of inputs wocs are smaller than wascs in terms of volume of drinking water delivered and therefore as small water utilities face other problems and challenges than wascs although there is no direct scientific evidence the results from our study suggest that wocs have not prioritized the reduction of ghg emissions as wascs have done in contrast during the same period wascs seemed to have performed slightly better than wocs their mean environmental efficiency was increasing at rate of 0 22 per year and eventually increased compared to the previous sub period in 2019 average wascs needed to further reduce their ghg emissions by 7 8 whereas wocs needed to reduce their carbon emissions by 10 the findings suggest that during the years 2016 19 wascs managed to catch up and exceed woc s efficiency levels whereas wocs did not continue to improve their efficiency this is attributed to the fact that their ghg emissions performance was not satisfactory the results from the enhanced hyperbolic model reveal a similar trend during the second sub period 2016 19 woc s eco efficiency followed a downward trend with the exception being the last year of the sample in contrast average wasc performed slightly better than woc over that period and its eco efficiency remained at high levels 0 965 wasc could become more environmentally efficient by further reducing costs and ghg emissions by 3 5 because of the smaller size of wocs relative to wascs sometimes it may be difficult to implement innovations to reduce ghg emissions and energetic costs on these small water companies previous research portela et al 2011 molinos senante et al 2015 molinos senante and maziotis 2020 also concluded that wascs performed slightly better than wocs from an economic perspective the authors suggested that wocs were more affected than wascs due to the rise in electricity prices and reduction in the levels of leakage imposed by the 2009 and 2014 price reviews in terms of environmental efficiency wocs improved their performance during the first period evaluated 2011 15 whereas in the second period the improvement was mainly achieved by wascs in the case of eco efficiency the same trend is observed for the two periods evaluated wocs suffered a regression on eco efficiency scores whereas wascs improved their performance hence according to the results shown on figs 1 and 2 it can be concluded that the measures adopted by ofwat during the 2009 and 2014 price reviews favored improvements in the performance of wascs however negative effects except for environmental efficiency in the first period were reported for wocs as part of the strategy to achieve the goal of reducing ghg emissions by 80 by 2050 the english and welsh water companies have individual strategies to reduce ghg emissions or even achieve net zero emissions the environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores estimated for each water company could be used to feed into and update these plans it should be noted that both synthetic indicators developed take into account the impact of exogenous variables e g source of raw water level of treatment pumping head etc on the performance of water companies hence in addition to the national policy landscape the specific results at water company level are useful to identify specific operational requirements and local decarbonization opportunities moreover the approach applied in this study would be also used by the water regulator in january 2022 ofwat published a position paper on the net zero 2030 routemap on carbon by water uk ofwat 2022b among other issues ofwat emphasized the importance of integrating the net zero strategies developed by the water companies with the pr24 and beyond creating tomorrow together which is the framework for price review in 2024 and future price reviews in the english and welsh water industry in particular ofwat stated that future price controls should support water companies to meet the challenge of net zero ofwat recognizes that transition to net zero may increase costs of service considering the regulatory approach employed by ofwat to set water tariffs i e price cap regulation where tariffs are adjusted considering inflation and expected efficiency improvements the methodology proposed in our study might be very useful for the regulator to integrate ghg emissions on efficiency assessment moreover it has been evidenced that environmental efficiency and eco efficiency scores estimated using the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions are robust avoiding any misleading conclusions 3 2 characteristics of the water industry we now turn our discussion in the results from the derivation of the average inputs and output elasticities for the whole period of study table 3 it is found that in the hyperbolic distance function a 1 increase in industry s energy costs and other costs could lead to an increase in the volume of drinking water delivered by 0 871 this result suggests that the industry operated below its optimal scale however a different situation is evident when looking at the results for each company type during the period of study average woc operated under decreasing economies of scale whereas wasc seemed to function under small increasing economies of scale a 1 increase in energy and other costs could result in a higher output expansion by 1 142 this means that adjustments in wasc s scale of operations could lead to lower costs and higher efficiency however we note that wascs could further improve efficiency by reducing energy costs as this factor plays a major role in providing water services in contrast wocs should focus on reducing energy and other costs before producing more output the negative sign of a e c o c and a o c e c suggest that energy costs and other costs are complements this exists for both wocs and wascs this means that the path to eco efficiency requires reductions in both energy and other costs the adoption of energy efficient practices when abstracting and treating water could lead to lower levels of ghg emissions and higher environmental efficiency when companies aim to simultaneously expand output and reduce carbon emissions for a given level of inputs then the opportunity cost of reducing carbon emissions s u b s c o 2 y is relatively costly for wascs s u b s c o 2 y takes a value which is slightly higher than unity whereas for wocs the value of s u b s c o 2 y is almost unity this means that it is not relatively expensive for wocs to reduce carbon emissions whereas for wascs it may be this is explained by the fact that wascs have more customers to serve than wocs and thus higher overall costs the results from the enhanced hyperbolic model reveal several interesting conclusions first during the years 2011 19 both wascs and wocs operated under decreasing economies of scale a 1 increase in costs would lead to a lower increase in outputs by 0 789 water companies should put efforts into achieving cost savings in water production processes rather than expanding their size by producing more output like the hyperbolic model there is a degree of complementarity between energy costs and other costs this means that if the companies want to become more environmentally efficient they should reduce both energy costs and other costs unlike the hyperbolic model the opportunity cost of reducing carbon emissions is now considerably high for both wocs and wascs this is attributed to the fact that the companies need to reduce carbon emissions and inputs and deliver more water at the same time considering that ghg emissions involve both direct and indirect emissions associated with electricity use it appears that for wocs high energy requirements to abstract treat and supply water to customers could explain the high cost of reducing carbon emissions for wascs the use of other costs such as labour and chemicals when treating more water might explain the high cost of curtailing carbon emissions as s u b s c o 2 y takes a value beyond unit the reduction of both carbon emissions and water delivered is the right way for a sustainable urban water cycle 4 conclusions water companies are faced with several challenges in the light of climate change and population growth such as providing enough drinking water and at the same time reducing ghg emissions in this study we used the hyperbolic and enhanced hyperbolic distance functions to evaluate the environmental efficiency and eco efficiency of several water companies in england and wales over the years 2011 2019 moreover it was assessed the substitutability between costs and between water delivered and carbon emissions the empirical application conducted focused on the english and welsh water industry because is one of the of the most advanced in the monitoring and reporting of ghg emissions at water company level in addition the water regulator considers the need for and importance of reducing ghg emissions in the processes to set water tariffs however the methodology proposed in this study could be applied to water companies operating in other countries and could also be extended to wastewater collection and treatment services we finally note that the methodology of this study could be used to quantify the environmental impact of any other undesirable product in water industry such as water leakage or any other industry such as supply interruptions in energy sector the case study evidenced that the english and welsh water industry performed well in terms of environmental efficiency on average it could expand the volume of drinking water delivered by 8 75 and at the same time curtail ghg emissions by 8 higher level of performance was reported when eco efficiency was assessed in particular the results showed that water companies could increase their volume of drinking water delivered by 3 95 and at the same time contract ghg emissions and costs energy costs and other costs by 3 8 after splitting the study period into two sub periods to reflect the regulator s price reviews it can be concluded that the measures adopted by ofwat during the 2009 and 2014 price reviews favored improvements in both environmental efficiency and eco efficiency of wascs our study demonstrated that the more complex the treatment of water is the higher the costs and level of carbon emissions could be finally it is evidenced that both energy costs and other costs need to reduce to improve eco efficiency as these inputs are complements the findings of our study are of great significance for policy makers for the following reasons first water managers can evaluate how efficient companies are when expanding the volume of drinking water delivered and curtailing ghg emissions at the same time for a given level of costs they can also determine how efficiency changes when companies want to reduce costs as well moreover our study showed that both energy costs and other costs are the major cost drivers of companies efficiency however managers could identify additional factors that could impact overall costs and inefficiency such as pumping requirements and complexity of water treatment process these factors should also be included in the decision making process our methodology also showed that the path to an environmentally sustainable industry requires improvements in energy efficiency reduction in carbon emissions and abstraction of less water this could be achieved by the constructive collaboration of water managers and regulator via the form of financial rewards when companies adopt practices that help them to become more eco efficient declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
15447,public concerns on microplastic mp pollution and its prevalence in urban runoff have grown exponentially huge amounts of mps are transported from urban environments via surface runoff to different environment compartments including rivers lakes reservoirs estuaries and oceans the global concentrations of mps in urban runoff range from 0 to 8580 particles l understanding the sources abundance composition and characteristics of mps in urban runoff on a global scale is a critical challenge because of the existence of multiple sources and spatiotemporal heterogeneity additionally dynamic processes in the mobilization aging fragmentation transport and retention of mps in urban runoff have been largely overlooked furthermore the mp flux through urban runoff into rivers lakes and even oceans is largely unknown which is very important for better understanding the fate and transport of mps in urban environments here we provide a critical review of the global occurrence transport retention process and sinks of mps in urban runoff relevant policies regulations and measures are put forward future global investigations and mitigation efforts will require us to address this issue cautiously cooperating globally nationally and regionally and acting locally graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics urban runoff global occurrence pollution sink data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction plastic pieces less than 5 mm in size have become a global environmental concern these pieces known as microplastics mps have great potential to be found in large quantities across different compartments of the natural environments numerous studies have been conducted on their diversified sources widespread occurrence environmental persistence and deleterious effects on the natural environment ahmed et al 2022 thompson et al 2004 the potential damage these materials can inflict on marine ecosystems is a particular concern bakaraki turan et al 2021 perumal and muthuramalingam 2022 with research showing that more than 100 marine species from zooplankton to seabirds are affected by mp pollution cole et al 2011 gesamp 2016 in 2011 the declaration of the global plastics associations for solutions on marine litter was announced and the signatories included plastics organizations and allied industry associations in 40 countries around the world global plastics alliance 2019 as the terrestrial environment is the major source 80 of marine mp pollution hajiouni et al 2022 pinon colin et al 2020 yonkos et al 2014 curtailing mp migration from land to sea is the highest priority action amongst global efforts to tackle global mp pollution in this plastic age baho et al 2021 rillig and lehmann 2020 key pathways in the transfer of mp pollution to aquatic environments include atmospheric deposition wastewater effluent discharge and urban runoff it is the latter involving overland flow of water from natural rainfall snow meltwater excess stormwater or other sources in urban environments that has been suggested to be the greatest conduit for mp transfer to the aquatic environment fang et al 2021 muller et al 2020 shruti et al 2021 as it is attributed to the mobilization and transport of large quantities of land based mps and other pollutants fahrenfeld et al 2019 shruti et al 2021 werbowski et al 2021 several recently published articles have further elucidated our understanding of the concentration characteristics and distribution of mps in urban runoff and these findings are among the most interesting we now know that there are large variances in mp concentrations complex and diverse sources of mps and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of mp pollution in urban runoff table 1 strikingly samples collected in new jersey usa alerted us that mp levels in urban stormwater runoff are much higher than those released in wastewater effluents or blown in the atmosphere bailey et al 2021 and that the annual load of mps discharged in combined stormwater sewer systems was six times that of discharge via wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent chen et al 2020 because majority of mps up to 97 98 entered wwtps are trapped or removed in sludge lv et al 2019 zhang and chen 2020 such findings suggest that urban runoff constitutes a major mp transport route which demands much greater research attention if we are to stem the migration of mps other recent studies have estimated local flux levels of mps transferred from urban to aquatic environments reporting that urban runoff contributed a significant amount of the mp pollution detected in water courses and bodies for example 42 of mps in european rivers are tire and road wear particles trwps carried by urban runoff siegfried et al 2017 43 of mps in the warnow estuary germany originate from stormwater systems piehl et al 2021 and 62 of mps in the baltic sea arrived via urban stormwater runoff including sewer overflow schernewski et al 2021 there remain however vast knowledge gaps regarding the occurrence distribution aging fragmentation transport flux fate and sinks of mps in urban runoff from a global perspective existing reviews within the field have mainly focused on methodology for sample collection pretreatment quantification and identification of mps in urban runoff e g shruti et al 2021 sources environmental behavior and fate of mps in urban runoff have also been considered e g xu et al 2020 however a comprehensive critical assessment of the global abundance of mps in urban runoff and their environmental behavior at this scale has been lacking here we provide a critical literature review that considers 1 the global occurrence potential sources and characteristics of mps in urban runoff around the world 2 dynamic changes of mps in urban runoff during mobilization aging transport and retention processes 3 the fate and sinks for mps in urban runoff the critical review concludes with implications for policy making and future research directions 2 global occurrence and potential sources urban runoff has been identified as an important land to sea pathway for mp migration supported by the emergence of a number of studies around the world that provide robust quantitative evidence the studies used in our review were collected from web of science core collections on february 5th 2022 we have searched under the advanced research mode with topic as the field tag and the search string was defined as ts microplastic and ts runoff or urban or rain or stormwater or rainfall or precipitation or drain or flux or transport or migration a total of 1893 results were preliminarily retrieved from the database ranging from 2000 to 2022 and 957 records remained after excluding some unrelated records these records were further screened according to the following criteria 1 these studies should be from peer reviewed journals 2 the content is mainly to investigate the concentration polymer types and other characteristics of microplastics in urban runoff finally a total of 23 studies were identified we used these published studies to harvest pertinent data from the text figures tables or supplementary materials on the abundance compositions and characteristics of mps in urban runoff systems including the ground surface runoff stormwater drainage systems and stormwater retention structures in our review the ground surface runoff refers to the water flowing on the urban surface due to rainfall snow storm etc including catchment runoff hajiouni et al 2022 and road runoff pinon colin et al 2020 stormwater drainage system is an important facility for urban runoff discharge fuchte et al 2022 and urban runoff can be sampled at the entrance inside and outlet of the stormwater drainage systems furthermore stormwater retention structures such as bioretention systems stormwater retention ponds and constructed wetlands can sustain urban runoff for a period of time and capture some mps in urban runoff lange et al 2022 liu et al 2019 tan et al 2022 therefore it is very essential to investigate the abundance and characteristics at the entrance inside and outlet of stormwater retention structures thus further understanding the removal performance of stormwater retention structures for mps in urban runoff boni et al 2022 the extracted data is compiled in table 1 detailed information of the sampling time sampling locations and methods of sampling pretreatment quantification and identification of mps in urban runoff are shown in table s1 2 1 occurrence and concentration concentrations of mps in urban runoff can vary greatly boni et al 2022 shruti et al 2021 among the studies compiled in table 1 the concentration varied by three orders of magnitude the maximum reported concentration was 8580 particles l size range from 20 to 100 μm collected at the entrance to a stormwater treatment process in sundsvall sweden lange et al 2022 the lowest values were less than 1 particle l size range from 25 to 5000 μm the distribution of mps had spatial heterogeneity which was reflected in the great difference in concentrations in different countries or regions high levels of mp pollution were found in some regions of europe north america and east asia 1500 6000 particles l size range from 20 to 5000 μm of both tire and bitumen microplastics tbmps in gothenburg sweden jarlskog et al 2020 289 particles l size range from 25 to 5000 μm in tijuana mexico pinon colin et al 2020 270 particles l size range from 10 to 500 μm in viborg denmark olesen et al 2019 and 186 particles l size range from 106 to 5000 μm in vaughan ontario canada smyth et al 2021 81 292 particles l size range from 10 to 5000 μm in tokyo japan sugiura et al 2021 the low abundance of mps was found in bushehr iran 1 2 3 particles l 5000 μm hajiouni et al 2022 hong kong china 1 4 6 8 particles l 37 5000 μm mak et al 2020 and north of jutland denmark median 1 41 particles l 10 2000 μm liu et al 2019 the prevalence and concentration differences of mps in urban runoff might be affected by sampling locations sampling seasons sampling and analytical methodology and human activities gonzalez ortegon et al 2022 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2022b currently our database of mps in urban runoff is not sufficient for a complete understanding of global concentrations of mps in urban runoff as too few researchers have conducted quantitative surveys for example the data of mps in urban runoff in africa and south america have yet been reported a global map is urgently needed especially to estimate fluxes of mps into freshwater and marine environments to inform potential management measures therefore we urge more attention to measuring the concentration and distribution of mps in urban runoff around the world 2 2 spatiotemporal variability temporal changes in mp levels in urban runoff are highly correlated to precipitation events rainfall is a key environmental factor in the formation of urban runoff which washes away loose mps deposited on the ground surface hitchcock 2020 xia et al 2020 increasing rainfall intensity also promotes the mobilization of lodged mps accumulated on land thus increasing the amount of mps transported by urban runoff sang et al 2021 on the other hand higher intensity rainfall events reduce mp concentrations in urban runoff due to dilution effects for example a recent study documented that the concentration of mps in the stormwater outfall at kwun tong ferry pier hong kong was higher at the end of dry season than at the beginning mak et al 2020 another recent study reported a significant negative correlation between mp concentrations in urban stormwater runoff and cumulative rainfall in the range 1 5 4 5 mm boni et al 2022 similarly sugiura et al 2021 found that higher abundance of mps in runoff at first flush stage than transitional and steady state stage during the continuous rainfall event different land use in urban catchments is linked to different sources of mp pollution spatial variability of mps and an important factor in the emergence of mps in urban runoff chen et al 2020 fang et al 2021 several studies have established relationships between mp concentrations in urban stormwater runoff and land use fig 2a typically runoff samples collected from highly disturbed residential commercial and industrial areas tend to contain more mps than those collected from less disturbed areas such as university campuses or open land large variation in mp concentration among different residential and commercial areas has been observed fig 2a concentrations of mps in urban stormwater drainage in different locations are also strikingly different fig 1 and table 1 these data indicate high heterogeneity and thus uncertainty in estimating mp levels in urban runoff morphotype also influences mobilization patterns with time treilles et al 2021 collected stormwater runoff samples in paris france at four different sampling times fig 2 b the observed changes in fiber mp concentrations were quite different from those in particulate mps e g spherical mps with a reduction in rainfall intensity from march to may leading to a sharp increase in fiber mp concentration and a decrease in particle mp concentration suggesting a different mobilization mechanism fig 2b 2 3 sources unknown and diversified sources of mps render the concentrations compositions and characteristics of mps in urban runoff complex and changeable hitchcock 2020 sang et al 2021 shruti et al 2021 which makes the implementation of management measures more difficult fahrenfeld et al 2019 grbic et al 2020 therefore it is important to trace the source of mps in urban runoff of all plastic ever created geyer et al 2017 calculated this number to be 8 3 billion metric tons more than 70 has reached its end of life but little has been recycled 9 geyer et al 2017 in urban areas a large amount of plastic waste is poorly managed and released as litter fan et al 2022 with high potential to degrade and become a source of mps in urban runoff clayer et al 2021 shruti et al 2021 in particular low income countries rely primarily on open dumping 93 to dispose of their plastic waste kaza et al 2018 representing a potentially huge source of mps to the urban runoff road dust is another potentially huge source of mps in urban areas horton and dixon 2017 yukioka et al 2020 and a major reservoir aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 campanale et al 2022 monira et al 2021b fig 3 mps associated with road dust are mainly derived from tire wear particles karbalaei et al 2018 monira et al 2021b which are formed due to friction effects at the interface between vehicle tires and road surface campanale et al 2022 abrasion of road markings may also contribute significant mps to the urban environment niphe 2016 tire and road wear particles typically consist of 25 synthetic polymers by mass kreider et al 2010 unice et al 2019 and are considered mps because their physicochemical properties and size range meet the definition of mps campanale et al 2022 in the eu tire and road wear particles are reported to form at a rate of 1 kg per person per year kole et al 2017 the impact of tire and road wear particles trwps remains an underexplored area of research one study stated that they could account for 5 10 of all plastic entering the ocean globally kole et al 2017 a study of road stormwater runoff in gothenburg sweden reported that 220 particles l 20 μm originated from tire wear while mps designated to plastic waste 69 particles l and road marking paints 14 particles l were much lower jarlskog et al 2021 another study reported a concentration of tire and road wear particles of 5900 particles l 20 μm in road stormwater runoff suggesting an important source of mps in urban stormwater runoff jarlskog et al 2020 other sources of mps in urban runoff include industrial activities grbic et al 2020 construction shruti et al 2021 landfill leachate golwala et al 2021 sulistyowati et al 2022 laundry of synthetic textile fabrics qian et al 2021 fragments of polymer based paints coatings as well as mps suspended in the atmosphere that transfer to surface runoff during rainfall events chen et al 2022 dong et al 2021 fig 3 furthermore the use of plastic rainwater facilities can increase the release of mps through aging and hydraulic scouring during the collection transportation and discharge of urban stormwater runoff zhang et al 2022a 3 characteristics and dynamic processes several studies have investigated the characteristics of mps in urban runoff tables 1 and s1 this section provides a detailed analysis of the characteristics and dynamic processes of mps in urban runoff 3 1 characteristics various mp polymer types i e polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyvinyl chloride pvc have been identified in urban runoff table 1 these polymers contribute global plastic products in 2020 as pe 30 3 pp 19 7 pvc 9 6 pet 8 4 and polyurethane pu 7 8 ps 6 1 plasticseurope 2021 the large amount of mps formed from pp and pe polymers is consistent with these being the most produced plastic polymers worldwide plasticseurope 2021 sang et al 2021 reported that pe 41 7 and pp 31 3 were the main polymer types in rainwater drainage in wuhan china in paris france treilles et al 2021 found most 85 mps were composed of pe pp and ps in finland the total proportion of pe and pp mps was 99 in urban stormwater runoff pankkonen 2020 however these studies mentioned above did not investigated trwps due to the limitations of mp analytical techniques e g raman spectroscopy sang et al 2021 smyth et al 2021 and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir pankkonen 2020 treilles et al 2021 in order to both investigate the commercial mps e g pe pp pvc etc and trwps in urban runoff some studies have adopted micro ftir as the identification method of commercial mps and attenuated total reflection atr ftir as the identification method of rubber particles lange et al 2022 sugiura et al 2021 lange et al 2022 found that black ethylene propylene diene rubber epdm and pp particles were the most abundant polymer types of 20 100 μm sized mps in the highway runoff sugiura et al 2021 documented that polyethylene polypropylene copolymer pep 34 9 might derived from ethylene propylene rubber was very common in urban road runoff at first flush stage by rainfall second only to pe 48 6 furthermore several technologies e g pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms and thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms are used to specifically detect trwps in environment samples e g road dust sediments road runoff eisentraut et al 2018 goßmann et al 2021 however only a few studies have reported the characteristics of trwps in urban runoff by using these techniques a novel study reported that styrene butadiene rubber sbr was found in ranges of 3 9 9 3 mg g in a street runoff grab sample and a sediment sample collected in halensee berlin by using ted gc ms which was much higher than pe pp and ps another recent study documented that the trwps in untreated road tunnel wash water 55 3 15 2 mg l quantifying by py gc ms was comparable to those in road runoff rødland et al 2022 although trwps are very abundant in urban runoff their characteristics in urban runoff are largely unknown the four most common mp morphologies in urban runoff are fragments fibers films and granules monira et al 2021b paul pont et al 2018 table 1 for instance the dominant morphology identified at the inlet of a bioretention rain garden in the san francisco bay area was identified as fibers 58 by gilbreath et al 2019 similarly most mps were considered to be fibers in urban runoff in ontario canada grbic et al 2020 in vaughan canada smyth et al 2021 and in bushehr iran hajiouni et al 2022 the dominance of fibers might be linked to the use of synthetic textile materials and building materials carr 2017 monira et al 2021b different mp colors have also observed which may indicate the potential sources of mps monira et al 2021b for example a recent study reported that the most common color in urban runoff in bushehr iran was black 40 2 which was related to a local fishery plastic hajiouni et al 2022 martin et al 2017 another study identified black mps specifically as tire and road wear particles grbic et al 2020 however the polymer types and exact sources of mps need to be further identified by some analytical techniques e g ftir and raman spectroscopy table s1 distinct mp sizes in urban runoff have been observed among different studies fig 2c generally speaking the size range of untreated urban runoff tends to be larger than that of treated or retained ones fig 2c due to filtration pankkonen 2020 and settlement semcesen and wells 2021 several studies that evaluated the effectiveness of stormwater management facilities report a similar phenomenon section 4 5 furthermore polymer density can affect the distribution of mps a recent study reported that the fraction of pet and pvc in pipe sediment was larger than in water sang et al 2021 this was attributed to a high rate of deposition due to the relatively high density of pet and pvc the retention of mps during their transportation process across different environmental compartments via urban runoff fig 4 is affected by mp characteristics e g density size and shape as well as climatic topographic and hydrological conditions and human activities horton et al 2017b liu et al 2019 nizzetto et al 2016 further examination of retention mechanisms and the influence mp characteristics is needed to more accurately model mps emissions through urban runoff 3 2 aging and fragmentation after being released into the environment plastic debris undergoes a series of physicochemical and biological processes such as mechanical abrasion photodegradation hydrolysis thermal oxidation chemical oxidation and biodegradation resulting in further aging and fragmentation of secondary mps aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 hanun et al 2021 during the migration and mobilization of mps in urban runoff the interactions between runoff water and mps e g mechanical breakdown duan et al 2021 hydrolysis sarno et al 2020 uv exposure alimi et al 2022 and biodegradation hanun et al 2021 can accelerate the aging process of mps in urban runoff mechanical breakdown is caused by abrasion and disintegration force which may be the result of the action of water shear force on mps and the interaction of mps with sediments stones and pebbles in urban runoff duan et al 2021 a recent study simulated the mechanical interactions between synthetic stormwater and mps and found that aging processes were related to the transport of mps from urban environment to water resources aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 another study documented that water shear stress could promote the formation of nanoplastics by crack propagation and crushing mechanism enfrin et al 2020 hydrolysis is more plausible in some polymers with water sensitive groups in the polymer backbone such as polyesters including pet polyamides polycarbonates polyanhydrides and polyethers sarno et al 2020 therefore mps with sensitive groups are easily hydrolyzed in urban runoff which further accelerates the aging process of mps furthermore the retention time of mps in urban runoff may affect the degree of hydrolysis of mps a recent study reported that the hydrolysis of poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat first occurred on the ester group between the terephthalate and adipate groups resulting in a decrease in the molar mass deshoulles et al 2022 the subsequent hydrolysis occurred on the ester group within the adipate ester group under longer aging durations deshoulles et al 2022 in drainage system fragmentation of plastics and mps in runoff water likely occurs but lacks quantitative studies in addition urban runoff mixes a variety of pollutants from different sources muller et al 2020 making it one of the main sources of water quality damage to aquatic ecosystems zhao et al 2010 changes in mps characteristics e g functional groups and hydrophobicity induced by aging processes can affect their tendency to adsorb other pollutants e g heavy metals and organic contaminants in urban runoff aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 hanun et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a further exacerbating ecological risks jemec kokalj et al 2019 meides et al 2021 degradation and biodegradation of mps in environments prior to entry of runoff may occur but no research has been reported on the fate of mps before and after entry of runoff in environment mps can be generated from plastic waste and or further degraded via various abiotic e g photodegradation by uv thermal degradation by sunlight chemical catalyzed degradation as well as mechanical degradation and biotic degradation zhang et al 2021 photodegradation induced by uv radiation or photooxidation is the most important abiotic aging pathway of mps in the environment alimi et al 2022 wang et al 2021f found that functional groups i e oh c o and ch appeared on the surface of pe mps during aging by uv light and found that the carbonyl index increased from 0 07 to 0 62 another study involving a 13 week rooftop weathering experiment reported the occurrence of substantial aging suggesting that solar radiation and rainwater were urban environmental stressors for mps miranda et al 2021 biodegradation plays a significant role in the decomposition of mps in aquatic and terrestrial environments luo et al 2022 ren et al 2021 to date plastics degrading microorganisms bacteria fungi have been found in soils sludge plastic dumping site sewage landfill etc ru et al 2020 in particular mps in urban runoff can carry microorganisms including plastics degrading microorganisms and pathogens constituting the microecosystem called plastisphere junaid et al 2022 wang et al 2022 however the degradation potential of plastisphere to mps and ecological risk of disease transmission of plastisphere in urban runoff are largely unknown in addition soil invertebrates like earth worms snails etc also ingest defragment and transport plastics and mps huerta lwanga et al 2018 rillig et al 2017 song et al 2020 especially the land snails also biodegrade ps via gut microbial activities song et al 2020 the larvae of several insects e g tenebrio moliutor or mealworms which belong to darkling beetles are capable of biodegradation of ps pe pp pvc etc via gut microbial activities wu and criddle 2021 yang et al 2015 the impact of microbial and invertebrate based biodegradation on mps in runoff remains further investigation 3 3 transport urban runoff is a major vector for the movement of mps in urban environments auta et al 2017 fahrenfeld et al 2019 which is often discharged into nearby water bodies directly or through stormwater drainage and stormwater retention structures shruti et al 2021 fig 4 rainfall intensity is an important factor in the formation of urban runoff and a driving force for the migration of mps in urban environments fan et al 2022 xia et al 2020 and a recent study inferred that the mobilization of mp occurs when rainfall intensity 2 5 mm h for more than 2 h treilles et al 2021 in general the greatest delivery of mps to rivers occurs during the first flush at the beginning of a rainfall event and as the storm continues the input will decrease barrows et al 2018 lee et al 2002 wang et al 2017 it was reported that the abundance of mps in an urban river in hong kong decreased sharply from 14 015 to 1 298 pieces m3 within 2 h due to rainfall induced runoff cheung et al 2018 the size of mps affects their mobility in urban runoff with smaller sizes 50 μm preferentially transported to receiving waters through urban road runoff klockner et al 2020 another study reported that high density mps e g pvc pet tend to be deposited in sediment rather than transported sang et al 2021 nevertheless the mechanisms and influencing factors in the migration of mps in urban runoff are largely unknown estimating the contribution of mp migration from land to water bodies via urban runoff is crucial siegfried et al 2017 calculated that tire and road wear particles transported by urban runoff were the largest source of mps in european rivers accounting for 42 another study indicated that the discharge of mps from separated city stormwater system accounted for 43 of mps in the warnow estuary germany piehl et al 2021 several studies have attempted to estimate the flux of mps in urban runoff at different temporal and spatial scales through the combination of sample data and mathematical modeling bondelind et al 2020 clayer et al 2021 bondelind et al 2020 simulated the distribution of traffic associated mps in the göta river using a three dimensional hydrodynamic model finding that mp concentrations were correlated to the number of nearby number of rainwater discharge points and the local traffic load a recent study estimated that the amount of mps released from road runoff in the mjøsa catchment norway is 5 5 tonnes year by socio economic modeling of mp fluxes on a catchment scale clayer et al 2021 in shanghai china chen et al 2020 estimated that the annual load of mps discharged via drainage systems at the catchment scale is up to 850 trillion particles year however it should be noted that owing to the wide range of sources of mps in urban areas the spatiotemporal variation of mps in urban runoff and sampling errors it remains difficult to fully quantify flux levels bai et al 2022 clayer et al 2021 therefore the urban runoff component of the global mp budget is not well understood 3 4 co contaminants in addition to mps many other contaminants including heavy metals and organic pollutants can also exist in urban runoff jarlskog et al 2021 muller et al 2020 which is considered a main non point source of pollution into receiving waters bjorklund et al 2018 hajiouni et al 2022 due to the physicochemical properties of some mps e g large specific surface area and strong hydrophobicity they can have high affinity for hazardous pollutants elgarahy et al 2021 wang and wang 2018 and act as a vector to transfer contaminants to different environmental compartments gao et al 2022 pramanik et al 2020 wang et al 2022 the transport of mps with adsorbed pollutants in urban runoff can cause serious environmental problems ren et al 2021 and increase the pollution risk of receiving water bodies furthermore some aging processes section 3 2 can increase the adsorption capacity of mps towards other pollutants thus elevating the risk of co transport hanun et al 2021 liu et al 2022 a recent study explored the effects of polymer type and weathering of low density pe mps on adsorption of pb2 in stormwater revealing significant physio chemistry changes which increased pb2 uptake aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 moreover mps can consist of polymers with harmful organic and inorganic additives that are applied as stabilizers plasticizers and flame retardants gonzalez ortegon et al 2022 teuten et al 2009 a recent study found that the average concentration of phthalate acid esters detected in urban runoff along the bushehr coast was 53 57 μg l which suggests that plastic additives in mps pose an environment threat hajiouni et al 2022 styrene oligomers leached from ps were found to transport from land to the tokyo bay via rainfall induced runoff amamiya et al 2019 n 1 3 dimethylbutyl n phenyl p phenylenediamine 6pdd is widely used as antioxidant agent for automobile tire and it can be oxidized to 6pdd quinone which shows acute toxicity to some species of fishes e g coho salmon hiki et al 2021 tian et al 2021 nowadays 6pdd quinone has been detected in street dust hiki and yamamoto 2022 and urban runoff rauert et al 2022 however a wealth of information on the subject exists in published literature and further investigations are needed to better understand the interactions between mps and other pollutants in urban runoff in different parts of the world 4 sinks there are various sinks for mp in urban runoff on the one hand mps can transfer to water bodies such as streams rivers lakes reservoirs estuaries and oceans lin et al 2021 shruti et al 2021 where they may migrate in the flowing water phase to the ocean fang et al 2021 fig 4 on the other hand they can be deposited in water body sediments or retained in soils stormwater retention structures or other compartments shruti et al 2021 it is important to review the features of these sinks in order to understand the fate of mps in urban runoff 4 1 rivers rivers are not only a sink for mps from various sources but also a key conduit of mp transfer from land to ocean wang et al 2020a xiong et al 2019 xu et al 2021 additionally as interactive and complex dynamic systems rivers can deposit retain and remobilize mps on different spatiotemporal scales bai et al 2022 eppehimer et al 2021 fig 4 discharge of urban runoff affects the dynamics and spatiotemporal distributions of mps in rivers with mp abundance showing significant temporal change related to precipitation patterns skalska et al 2020 wong et al 2020 moreover river sediment acts as the sink for mps for example mps derived from road marking paints in urban runoff have been detected in sediments of tributaries of the river thames uk at an order of magnitude higher abundance than the water column horton et al 2017a furthermore the input of a large amount of urban runoff can change the abundance distribution of mps between the water column and sediment thus increasing the migration of mps downstream xia et al 2021 for instance samples of one riverbed before and after flooding suggested that nearly 70 of deposited mps 43 billion particles were washed away after a flooding event hurley et al 2018 fig s1 there may exist a balance between deposition of newly introduced mps during rainfall induced runoff and the remobilization of old deposited mps from the sediment as a result of elevated water flow a recent study assessed the retention and efflux of mps in riverbed sediment on a watershed scale and indicated that mps entering headwater and mainstream were retained in riverbed sediments at an average rate of 8 and 3 per kilometer respectively fig s2 drummond et al 2022 the variation of retention time of mps in rivers with different classification levels might be affected by river velocity drummond et al 2022 another study indicated that the retention factors particle retention km could affect the total mp load of the river on the baltic sea for example a retention factor of 2 km would reduce the total mp load to 3 2 schernewski et al 2021 4 2 lakes and ponds lakes and ponds in urban areas act as mp sinks fig 4 and several studies report that large amounts of mps are transported to them in municipal wastewater laju et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 and urban runoff clayer et al 2021 grbic et al 2020 li et al 2022 as investigated by clayer et al 2021 three major sources of mps in lake mjøsa were attributed to mismanaged waste 24 5 t yr 1 wastewater treatment plant 6 9 t yr 1 and road runoff 5 5 t yr 1 indicating that the contribution of urban runoff to mps in lakes cannot be ignored moreover clayer et al 2021 also calculated the budget of mps in the mjøsa catchment and found that large amounts estimated between 7 and 120 tonnes of mps were annually released from land to lake mjøsa of this mass only 1 to 9 tonnes remained in the sediment indicating that most mps were transported to the ocean through connected water systems another study quantified the concentration of mps in lake ontario canada to 0 8 particles l the source waters were determined to be urban stormwater runoff 15 4 particles l treated wastewater effluent 13 3 particles l and agricultural runoff 0 9 particles l revealing that urban runoff was a significant contributor of mps in lake ontario grbic et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to comprehensively investigate the sources of mps in lakes especially urban lakes to determine the specific contribution of each source in order to model mp fluxes and develop management measures additionally urban lakes receive mps not only from urban runoff but also from atmospheric deposition allen et al 2021 dusaucy et al 2021 yang et al 2022 in this context rainfall is not only an important driving force for mps to enter lakes through urban runoff but also a potent driver accelerating the entry of mps into lakes via wet deposition klein and fischer 2019 xia et al 2020 however the specific contribution of mps from urban runoff and the atmosphere remains unclear furthermore similar to river system hydrodynamic changes caused by rainfall might lead to the remobilization and resuspension of mps in lake sediments which increases mp concentrations in lake water xia et al 2020 besides temporal variation of mp characteristics in lakes is related to temporal variation of those in urban runoff lin et al 2021 for instance the dominant mps collected in an ox bow lake in yenagoa nigeria were mostly pet 72 63 in the dry season and pvc 81 5 in the wet season oni et al 2020 moreover the flow of lake water and the renewal speed of lake water are slower than that of rivers which means that mps might retain in the lake environment for a long period yan et al 2021 yang et al 2022 4 3 oceans and beaches urban runoff is a major pathway for the dispersion of mps from the land to marine environments castro et al 2020 da silva et al 2022 exposito et al 2021 firstly land based mps in urban runoff can be transported to the estuary after being transferred to inland water systems e g rivers and lakes and finally to the ocean auta et al 2017 piehl et al 2021 fig 4 meijer et al 2021 calculated plastic emissions across the processes of mobilization by runoff and wind the transportation of plastic in rivers and the transfer of plastic from rivers to the ocean they reported that rivers account for 80 of the annual global emissions of plastics into the ocean discharging about 0 8 2 7 million tonnes of plastics into the ocean every year the discharge of mps from storm drain systems receiving urban runoff along coastline is also one of the most important routes of mp transfer to the ocean balthazar silva et al 2020 ory et al 2020 a recent study suggested that more mps entered the port of durban south africa from storm water drains than from river sources preston whyte et al 2021 secondly mps accumulated on land during dry periods are seasonally remobilized and flushed to coastal waters by rainfall which can be regarded as a pulse input event balthazar silva et al 2020 rios mendoza et al 2021 for example the discharge of mps in july and august to the southeastern baltic sea accounts for half of the annual input from sewer overflow systems including urban stormwater runoff schernewski et al 2020 differences between pulse events and the steady transfer of mps from land to ocean balthazar silva et al 2020 must be taken into account when modeling mp fluxes mps carried in runoff that reaches the coast can either enter the ocean jaubet et al 2021 or deposit on beaches kumar and varghese 2021 yaranal et al 2021 local scale variability in the distribution of mps on beaches will depend on tidal cycles and beach hydrodynamics balthazar silva et al 2020 substances leached from mps have been discovered on beaches for example amamiya et al 2019 found that styrene oligomers leached from ps were much higher in beach sand 171 times than in seawater in summary tens of thousands of mps distributed around the world are collected by runoff every year and finally input into the marine environment mps with higher density than seawater or mps biofouling by microorganisms can settle in seawater and eventually accumulate in marine sediments auta et al 2017 a recent study about mps in mediterranean sea found that mean abundance of mps in marine sediments 32 4 items kg was much higher than in sandy beaches 10 7 items kg exposito et al 2021 additionally a novel study reported that at least 66 7 of plastics in ocean are difficult to monitor under the observation framework currently adopted worldwide isobe and iwasaki 2022 therefore it is very important to investigated the flux of mps in runoff conveyed to ocean thus better monitoring the accumulation of marine mps 4 4 soils soils can intercept and retain mps from urban runoff nizzetto et al 2016 rivers et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 a recent study suggested that road and tire derived mps could be mobilized by urban runoff and then deposited to soil cao et al 2021 another study documented that surface runoff affects the accumulation of mps in urban and industrial soils nematollahi et al 2022 additionally a recent study investigated the vertical migration potential of mps retained in soil media of stormwater control measures scm and found that most of retained mps were located below the subsurface of scm indicating that retained mps might have the potential to further migrate downwards and pollute groundwater koutnik et al 2022 o connor et al 2019 reported that downward migration of mps in sandy soil is accelerated by wet dry cycles the mps entering into soils may affect their chemical properties and microbial community dissanayake et al 2022 palansooriya et al 2022 thus posing a threat to biodiversity and soil productivity hou 2022a 2022b because the mps and co contaminants like heavy metals can accumulate in soil over a large time span this may pose a big challenge for future practitioners who need to remediate the contaminated soil with sustainable means hou 2021a 2021b jin et al 2021 wang et al 2021d 4 5 stormwater drainage systems and stormwater retention structures mps can be retained in stormwater drainage systems and stormwater retention structures due to reduced flow velocity boni et al 2022 thus capturing and intercepting mps from urban runoff before it enters a receiving water body monira et al 2021b fig 4 a recent study demonstrated that the abundance of mps in the sediment of rainwater pipelines ranged from 44 to 320 particles kg sang et al 2021 liu et al 2019 reported that in industrial areas retained mps in the sediments of retention ponds can range from 1511 to 127 986 particles kg with the hydraulic load positively correlated with the amount of mps in sediments the retention phenomenon can be applied in stormwater retention ponds and bioretention systems to reduce downstream mp pollution koutnik et al 2022 liu et al 2019 vijayaraghavan et al 2021 there are many kinds of stormwater retention structures available for mp removal including infiltration trenches yano et al 2021 gross pollutant traps lange et al 2021 2022 bioretention systems including rain gardens and biofiltration boni et al 2022 gilbreath et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 vijayaraghavan et al 2021 constructed wetlands including stormwater floating treatment wetlands and stormwater retention ponds liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020b ziajahromi et al 2020 other techniques involving coagulation processes dissolved air flotation and membrane separation can also be applied to remove mps from urban runoff monira et al 2021a monira et al 2021b the properties of mps including morphotype and particle size can affect retention system removal performance several studies have demonstrated that fibrous mps are the most difficult mp morphotype to remove table s2 smyth et al 2021 werbowski et al 2021 another study documented that the mp concentration in urban runoff was reduced by 84 in the size fraction of 160 μm to 5 mm treated by bioretention systems indicating effective interception of relatively large mps in urban runoff smyth et al 2021 another study reported that the dominant mp size fraction was 190 5000 μm 83 7 in inlet water samples and 25 100 μm 96 5 in outlet water samples table s1 ziajahromi et al 2020 again showing effective removal of larger mps rather than smaller ones among retention systems bioretention cells and vegetated biofilters have performed best for mp removal while those that rely on physical separation processes including gross pollutant traps and sand filters often perform poorly fig 5 bioretention system is a stormwater treatment facility that combines physical interception chemical adsorption and bioremediation and it can improve runoff quality and be integrated into the urban landscape vijayaraghavan et al 2021 due to its multiple advantages it has high removal performance of mps 83 96 table s2 gross pollutant traps are regarded as the main primary treatment level for physically screening or capturing garbage and coarse sediments monira et al 2021b it can often be combined with other stormwater treatment facilities to improve the efficiency of mp removal and minimize sediment load of combined facilities lange et al 2022 furthermore different filter media in the stormwater treatment system have different mp removal performance a recent study reported that the removal efficiency of 20 100 μm mps by vegetated biofilters 88 was significantly better than that by non vegetated sand filters 47 table s2 lange et al 2022 the reasons might be due to the interception of plant roots and the small mps easier to penetrate deeper into the filter media lange et al 2022 o connor et al 2019 another novel study found that biochar particle size 5 50 mm and sand particle size 0 8 1 2 mm filtration systems had high removal performance 90 for microplastics 90 5000 μm in stormwater runoff pankkonen 2020 the removal mechanism of the former was mainly electrostatic attraction and adsorption and the latter is mainly interception by small filtration pores and adhesion on the sand surface pankkonen 2020 in nature based solutions nbs for urban runoff treatment settlement coagulation and biosorption can occur simultaneously thus leading to excellent or even complete removal rates chen et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 5 implications with the emergence of urbanization mp pollution associated with urban runoff has become a global environmental problem it is necessary to formulate policies regulations and measures to comprehensively and systematically manage the risks associated with this route of mp migration from land to water bodies first of all source prevention is a crucial step for which source identification is a prerequisite current research on mps in urban runoff has mainly focused on the concentration size distribution morphotype and polymer identification rather than quantitative analyzes of the contributions of different sources e g road dust and waste plastic dumping only when specific sources are identified can the risks be mitigated via source control however unlike toxic metals and organic contaminants whose sources can be precisely identified in environmental investigations by studying stable isotope compositions wang et al 2021b source identification for mp often relies on basic fingerprint features that can be applied in a cost effective manner for example wang et al 2021c proposed that size distribution clusters are important as they form via conditional probability induced aging processes therefore the cumulative size distribution function of mps in urban runoff can be regarded as a mixture of various size distribution functions derived from different source materials the applicability of this method for source identification purposes may be further explored in some urban areas not only are there separate stormwater drainage systems but also combined sewer systems which can discharge untreated mixed stormwater and wastewater during storm events bollmann et al 2019 shruti et al 2021 fig 4 this adds to the difficulty for source control several studies have reported that urban runoff discharged by combined sewer overflow systems could be considered as an important pathway for mps in water environments chen et al 2020 schernewski et al 2021 schernewski et al 2020 more attention must be paid to the impact of separate stormwater drainage systems and combined sewer systems on the discharge of mps in urban runoff establishing climate resilient infrastructure to limit urban runoff while simultaneously removing mps is desirable to prevent mp mobilization and migration global climate change adds uncertainty to future storm events shaw et al 2016 nature inspired low impact development of sponge cities is a promising way to alleviate urban waterlogging and flooding by restoring the natural water cycle and its ecological functions combined with green and gray infrastructure cheng et al 2022 qiao et al 2020 wang et al 2021a current stormwater treatment techniques are mainly used to remove total suspended solids heavy metals organic matter and nutrients in stormwater al ameri et al 2018 boni et al 2022 valenca et al 2021 a limited number of works have explored the utilization of stormwater retention structures e g bioretention systems to specifically remove mps in urban runoff gilbreath et al 2019 lange et al 2021 it has been reported that large mps can be effectively removed by stormwater retention structures pankkonen 2020 smyth et al 2021 which could efficiently reduce the risk of plastic additives being released into the water environment by mps allan et al 2022 do et al 2022 however smaller ones especially nanoplastics nps may escape from these systems and pose the highest environmental risks due to their greater toxicity to aquatic organisms and faster diffusive release rate of plastic additives gigault et al 2021 wang et al 2021e therefore stormwater treatment techniques should be redesigned and developed so that they can effectively remove as many mps with different particle sizes and other pollutants as possible in the urban stormwater runoff simultaneously boni et al 2022 furthermore it is essential to evaluate the removal performance of different stormwater retention structures for mps in urban runoff and to provide practical guidance for selecting stormwater retention structures to treat urban runoff containing different mp components from diverse land sources monira et al 2021b 6 knowledge gaps and future research directions migration of mps in urban runoff from land to freshwater and marine environments further exacerbates mp pollution in aquatic ecosystems despite this investigation on mps in urban runoff on a global scale is largely inadequate more detailed and comprehensive research is needed to shed light on the global occurrence and fate of mps in urban runoff and their impact here we recommend the following research priorities 1 quantitative calculation of distribution concentration and spatiotemporal characteristics of mps in urban runoff in particular experimental and modeling works on a regional or global scale will help us reach a better understanding on the fluxes environmental behavior and fate of mps thus providing a valuable context for policy making and global collaboration 2 the complexity of mp transport among land rivers lakes and oceans should be further taken into account the pulse release of mps in river or lake sediments related to the intensity of urban runoff processes adds much uncertainty to the flux of mps to the ocean furthermore other indirect inputs in particular atmospheric wet deposition to lakes and ponds should be assessed simultaneously with land based sources 3 fingerprint characteristics of mps in urban runoff should be further explored to assist in source identification for effective source prevention measures 4 standardized methods for sampling extraction separation identification and quantification of mps in urban runoff should be established obtaining high quality comparable data is a prerequisite for aforementioned quantitative estimation the different methods currently applied in different studies table 1 may cause bias that may lead to erroneous conclusions 5 more holistic research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of dynamic processes in a quantitative manner such as the role of land use associated human disturbances on spatial distribution effect of rainfall intensity on re mobilization of mps in urban runoff and aging associated changes in mp migration 6 further study on abiotic and biotic reactions for aging fragmentation and biodegradation of mps in contamination sources and drainage system to understand formation of mps in relation to their physical chemical and biological properties and develop management strategies for mp reduction and prevention 7 further exploration of the interaction between mps and co contaminants in urban runoff should be conducted we do not yet know whether metals and organic contaminants are preferentially adsorbed to suspended mp surfaces or retained in the runoff liquid phase basic parameters such as partition coefficients should be obtained 8 more relevant policies regulations and measures need to be implemented to systematically manage mps in urban runoff which requires us to cooperate globally nationally and regionally and take action locally declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15447,public concerns on microplastic mp pollution and its prevalence in urban runoff have grown exponentially huge amounts of mps are transported from urban environments via surface runoff to different environment compartments including rivers lakes reservoirs estuaries and oceans the global concentrations of mps in urban runoff range from 0 to 8580 particles l understanding the sources abundance composition and characteristics of mps in urban runoff on a global scale is a critical challenge because of the existence of multiple sources and spatiotemporal heterogeneity additionally dynamic processes in the mobilization aging fragmentation transport and retention of mps in urban runoff have been largely overlooked furthermore the mp flux through urban runoff into rivers lakes and even oceans is largely unknown which is very important for better understanding the fate and transport of mps in urban environments here we provide a critical review of the global occurrence transport retention process and sinks of mps in urban runoff relevant policies regulations and measures are put forward future global investigations and mitigation efforts will require us to address this issue cautiously cooperating globally nationally and regionally and acting locally graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords microplastics urban runoff global occurrence pollution sink data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction plastic pieces less than 5 mm in size have become a global environmental concern these pieces known as microplastics mps have great potential to be found in large quantities across different compartments of the natural environments numerous studies have been conducted on their diversified sources widespread occurrence environmental persistence and deleterious effects on the natural environment ahmed et al 2022 thompson et al 2004 the potential damage these materials can inflict on marine ecosystems is a particular concern bakaraki turan et al 2021 perumal and muthuramalingam 2022 with research showing that more than 100 marine species from zooplankton to seabirds are affected by mp pollution cole et al 2011 gesamp 2016 in 2011 the declaration of the global plastics associations for solutions on marine litter was announced and the signatories included plastics organizations and allied industry associations in 40 countries around the world global plastics alliance 2019 as the terrestrial environment is the major source 80 of marine mp pollution hajiouni et al 2022 pinon colin et al 2020 yonkos et al 2014 curtailing mp migration from land to sea is the highest priority action amongst global efforts to tackle global mp pollution in this plastic age baho et al 2021 rillig and lehmann 2020 key pathways in the transfer of mp pollution to aquatic environments include atmospheric deposition wastewater effluent discharge and urban runoff it is the latter involving overland flow of water from natural rainfall snow meltwater excess stormwater or other sources in urban environments that has been suggested to be the greatest conduit for mp transfer to the aquatic environment fang et al 2021 muller et al 2020 shruti et al 2021 as it is attributed to the mobilization and transport of large quantities of land based mps and other pollutants fahrenfeld et al 2019 shruti et al 2021 werbowski et al 2021 several recently published articles have further elucidated our understanding of the concentration characteristics and distribution of mps in urban runoff and these findings are among the most interesting we now know that there are large variances in mp concentrations complex and diverse sources of mps and spatiotemporal heterogeneity of mp pollution in urban runoff table 1 strikingly samples collected in new jersey usa alerted us that mp levels in urban stormwater runoff are much higher than those released in wastewater effluents or blown in the atmosphere bailey et al 2021 and that the annual load of mps discharged in combined stormwater sewer systems was six times that of discharge via wastewater treatment plant wwtp effluent chen et al 2020 because majority of mps up to 97 98 entered wwtps are trapped or removed in sludge lv et al 2019 zhang and chen 2020 such findings suggest that urban runoff constitutes a major mp transport route which demands much greater research attention if we are to stem the migration of mps other recent studies have estimated local flux levels of mps transferred from urban to aquatic environments reporting that urban runoff contributed a significant amount of the mp pollution detected in water courses and bodies for example 42 of mps in european rivers are tire and road wear particles trwps carried by urban runoff siegfried et al 2017 43 of mps in the warnow estuary germany originate from stormwater systems piehl et al 2021 and 62 of mps in the baltic sea arrived via urban stormwater runoff including sewer overflow schernewski et al 2021 there remain however vast knowledge gaps regarding the occurrence distribution aging fragmentation transport flux fate and sinks of mps in urban runoff from a global perspective existing reviews within the field have mainly focused on methodology for sample collection pretreatment quantification and identification of mps in urban runoff e g shruti et al 2021 sources environmental behavior and fate of mps in urban runoff have also been considered e g xu et al 2020 however a comprehensive critical assessment of the global abundance of mps in urban runoff and their environmental behavior at this scale has been lacking here we provide a critical literature review that considers 1 the global occurrence potential sources and characteristics of mps in urban runoff around the world 2 dynamic changes of mps in urban runoff during mobilization aging transport and retention processes 3 the fate and sinks for mps in urban runoff the critical review concludes with implications for policy making and future research directions 2 global occurrence and potential sources urban runoff has been identified as an important land to sea pathway for mp migration supported by the emergence of a number of studies around the world that provide robust quantitative evidence the studies used in our review were collected from web of science core collections on february 5th 2022 we have searched under the advanced research mode with topic as the field tag and the search string was defined as ts microplastic and ts runoff or urban or rain or stormwater or rainfall or precipitation or drain or flux or transport or migration a total of 1893 results were preliminarily retrieved from the database ranging from 2000 to 2022 and 957 records remained after excluding some unrelated records these records were further screened according to the following criteria 1 these studies should be from peer reviewed journals 2 the content is mainly to investigate the concentration polymer types and other characteristics of microplastics in urban runoff finally a total of 23 studies were identified we used these published studies to harvest pertinent data from the text figures tables or supplementary materials on the abundance compositions and characteristics of mps in urban runoff systems including the ground surface runoff stormwater drainage systems and stormwater retention structures in our review the ground surface runoff refers to the water flowing on the urban surface due to rainfall snow storm etc including catchment runoff hajiouni et al 2022 and road runoff pinon colin et al 2020 stormwater drainage system is an important facility for urban runoff discharge fuchte et al 2022 and urban runoff can be sampled at the entrance inside and outlet of the stormwater drainage systems furthermore stormwater retention structures such as bioretention systems stormwater retention ponds and constructed wetlands can sustain urban runoff for a period of time and capture some mps in urban runoff lange et al 2022 liu et al 2019 tan et al 2022 therefore it is very essential to investigate the abundance and characteristics at the entrance inside and outlet of stormwater retention structures thus further understanding the removal performance of stormwater retention structures for mps in urban runoff boni et al 2022 the extracted data is compiled in table 1 detailed information of the sampling time sampling locations and methods of sampling pretreatment quantification and identification of mps in urban runoff are shown in table s1 2 1 occurrence and concentration concentrations of mps in urban runoff can vary greatly boni et al 2022 shruti et al 2021 among the studies compiled in table 1 the concentration varied by three orders of magnitude the maximum reported concentration was 8580 particles l size range from 20 to 100 μm collected at the entrance to a stormwater treatment process in sundsvall sweden lange et al 2022 the lowest values were less than 1 particle l size range from 25 to 5000 μm the distribution of mps had spatial heterogeneity which was reflected in the great difference in concentrations in different countries or regions high levels of mp pollution were found in some regions of europe north america and east asia 1500 6000 particles l size range from 20 to 5000 μm of both tire and bitumen microplastics tbmps in gothenburg sweden jarlskog et al 2020 289 particles l size range from 25 to 5000 μm in tijuana mexico pinon colin et al 2020 270 particles l size range from 10 to 500 μm in viborg denmark olesen et al 2019 and 186 particles l size range from 106 to 5000 μm in vaughan ontario canada smyth et al 2021 81 292 particles l size range from 10 to 5000 μm in tokyo japan sugiura et al 2021 the low abundance of mps was found in bushehr iran 1 2 3 particles l 5000 μm hajiouni et al 2022 hong kong china 1 4 6 8 particles l 37 5000 μm mak et al 2020 and north of jutland denmark median 1 41 particles l 10 2000 μm liu et al 2019 the prevalence and concentration differences of mps in urban runoff might be affected by sampling locations sampling seasons sampling and analytical methodology and human activities gonzalez ortegon et al 2022 li et al 2018 zhang et al 2022b currently our database of mps in urban runoff is not sufficient for a complete understanding of global concentrations of mps in urban runoff as too few researchers have conducted quantitative surveys for example the data of mps in urban runoff in africa and south america have yet been reported a global map is urgently needed especially to estimate fluxes of mps into freshwater and marine environments to inform potential management measures therefore we urge more attention to measuring the concentration and distribution of mps in urban runoff around the world 2 2 spatiotemporal variability temporal changes in mp levels in urban runoff are highly correlated to precipitation events rainfall is a key environmental factor in the formation of urban runoff which washes away loose mps deposited on the ground surface hitchcock 2020 xia et al 2020 increasing rainfall intensity also promotes the mobilization of lodged mps accumulated on land thus increasing the amount of mps transported by urban runoff sang et al 2021 on the other hand higher intensity rainfall events reduce mp concentrations in urban runoff due to dilution effects for example a recent study documented that the concentration of mps in the stormwater outfall at kwun tong ferry pier hong kong was higher at the end of dry season than at the beginning mak et al 2020 another recent study reported a significant negative correlation between mp concentrations in urban stormwater runoff and cumulative rainfall in the range 1 5 4 5 mm boni et al 2022 similarly sugiura et al 2021 found that higher abundance of mps in runoff at first flush stage than transitional and steady state stage during the continuous rainfall event different land use in urban catchments is linked to different sources of mp pollution spatial variability of mps and an important factor in the emergence of mps in urban runoff chen et al 2020 fang et al 2021 several studies have established relationships between mp concentrations in urban stormwater runoff and land use fig 2a typically runoff samples collected from highly disturbed residential commercial and industrial areas tend to contain more mps than those collected from less disturbed areas such as university campuses or open land large variation in mp concentration among different residential and commercial areas has been observed fig 2a concentrations of mps in urban stormwater drainage in different locations are also strikingly different fig 1 and table 1 these data indicate high heterogeneity and thus uncertainty in estimating mp levels in urban runoff morphotype also influences mobilization patterns with time treilles et al 2021 collected stormwater runoff samples in paris france at four different sampling times fig 2 b the observed changes in fiber mp concentrations were quite different from those in particulate mps e g spherical mps with a reduction in rainfall intensity from march to may leading to a sharp increase in fiber mp concentration and a decrease in particle mp concentration suggesting a different mobilization mechanism fig 2b 2 3 sources unknown and diversified sources of mps render the concentrations compositions and characteristics of mps in urban runoff complex and changeable hitchcock 2020 sang et al 2021 shruti et al 2021 which makes the implementation of management measures more difficult fahrenfeld et al 2019 grbic et al 2020 therefore it is important to trace the source of mps in urban runoff of all plastic ever created geyer et al 2017 calculated this number to be 8 3 billion metric tons more than 70 has reached its end of life but little has been recycled 9 geyer et al 2017 in urban areas a large amount of plastic waste is poorly managed and released as litter fan et al 2022 with high potential to degrade and become a source of mps in urban runoff clayer et al 2021 shruti et al 2021 in particular low income countries rely primarily on open dumping 93 to dispose of their plastic waste kaza et al 2018 representing a potentially huge source of mps to the urban runoff road dust is another potentially huge source of mps in urban areas horton and dixon 2017 yukioka et al 2020 and a major reservoir aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 campanale et al 2022 monira et al 2021b fig 3 mps associated with road dust are mainly derived from tire wear particles karbalaei et al 2018 monira et al 2021b which are formed due to friction effects at the interface between vehicle tires and road surface campanale et al 2022 abrasion of road markings may also contribute significant mps to the urban environment niphe 2016 tire and road wear particles typically consist of 25 synthetic polymers by mass kreider et al 2010 unice et al 2019 and are considered mps because their physicochemical properties and size range meet the definition of mps campanale et al 2022 in the eu tire and road wear particles are reported to form at a rate of 1 kg per person per year kole et al 2017 the impact of tire and road wear particles trwps remains an underexplored area of research one study stated that they could account for 5 10 of all plastic entering the ocean globally kole et al 2017 a study of road stormwater runoff in gothenburg sweden reported that 220 particles l 20 μm originated from tire wear while mps designated to plastic waste 69 particles l and road marking paints 14 particles l were much lower jarlskog et al 2021 another study reported a concentration of tire and road wear particles of 5900 particles l 20 μm in road stormwater runoff suggesting an important source of mps in urban stormwater runoff jarlskog et al 2020 other sources of mps in urban runoff include industrial activities grbic et al 2020 construction shruti et al 2021 landfill leachate golwala et al 2021 sulistyowati et al 2022 laundry of synthetic textile fabrics qian et al 2021 fragments of polymer based paints coatings as well as mps suspended in the atmosphere that transfer to surface runoff during rainfall events chen et al 2022 dong et al 2021 fig 3 furthermore the use of plastic rainwater facilities can increase the release of mps through aging and hydraulic scouring during the collection transportation and discharge of urban stormwater runoff zhang et al 2022a 3 characteristics and dynamic processes several studies have investigated the characteristics of mps in urban runoff tables 1 and s1 this section provides a detailed analysis of the characteristics and dynamic processes of mps in urban runoff 3 1 characteristics various mp polymer types i e polyethylene pe polypropylene pp polystyrene ps polyethylene terephthalate pet and polyvinyl chloride pvc have been identified in urban runoff table 1 these polymers contribute global plastic products in 2020 as pe 30 3 pp 19 7 pvc 9 6 pet 8 4 and polyurethane pu 7 8 ps 6 1 plasticseurope 2021 the large amount of mps formed from pp and pe polymers is consistent with these being the most produced plastic polymers worldwide plasticseurope 2021 sang et al 2021 reported that pe 41 7 and pp 31 3 were the main polymer types in rainwater drainage in wuhan china in paris france treilles et al 2021 found most 85 mps were composed of pe pp and ps in finland the total proportion of pe and pp mps was 99 in urban stormwater runoff pankkonen 2020 however these studies mentioned above did not investigated trwps due to the limitations of mp analytical techniques e g raman spectroscopy sang et al 2021 smyth et al 2021 and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir pankkonen 2020 treilles et al 2021 in order to both investigate the commercial mps e g pe pp pvc etc and trwps in urban runoff some studies have adopted micro ftir as the identification method of commercial mps and attenuated total reflection atr ftir as the identification method of rubber particles lange et al 2022 sugiura et al 2021 lange et al 2022 found that black ethylene propylene diene rubber epdm and pp particles were the most abundant polymer types of 20 100 μm sized mps in the highway runoff sugiura et al 2021 documented that polyethylene polypropylene copolymer pep 34 9 might derived from ethylene propylene rubber was very common in urban road runoff at first flush stage by rainfall second only to pe 48 6 furthermore several technologies e g pyrolysis gas chromatography mass spectrometry py gc ms and thermal extraction desorption gas chromatography mass spectrometry ted gc ms are used to specifically detect trwps in environment samples e g road dust sediments road runoff eisentraut et al 2018 goßmann et al 2021 however only a few studies have reported the characteristics of trwps in urban runoff by using these techniques a novel study reported that styrene butadiene rubber sbr was found in ranges of 3 9 9 3 mg g in a street runoff grab sample and a sediment sample collected in halensee berlin by using ted gc ms which was much higher than pe pp and ps another recent study documented that the trwps in untreated road tunnel wash water 55 3 15 2 mg l quantifying by py gc ms was comparable to those in road runoff rødland et al 2022 although trwps are very abundant in urban runoff their characteristics in urban runoff are largely unknown the four most common mp morphologies in urban runoff are fragments fibers films and granules monira et al 2021b paul pont et al 2018 table 1 for instance the dominant morphology identified at the inlet of a bioretention rain garden in the san francisco bay area was identified as fibers 58 by gilbreath et al 2019 similarly most mps were considered to be fibers in urban runoff in ontario canada grbic et al 2020 in vaughan canada smyth et al 2021 and in bushehr iran hajiouni et al 2022 the dominance of fibers might be linked to the use of synthetic textile materials and building materials carr 2017 monira et al 2021b different mp colors have also observed which may indicate the potential sources of mps monira et al 2021b for example a recent study reported that the most common color in urban runoff in bushehr iran was black 40 2 which was related to a local fishery plastic hajiouni et al 2022 martin et al 2017 another study identified black mps specifically as tire and road wear particles grbic et al 2020 however the polymer types and exact sources of mps need to be further identified by some analytical techniques e g ftir and raman spectroscopy table s1 distinct mp sizes in urban runoff have been observed among different studies fig 2c generally speaking the size range of untreated urban runoff tends to be larger than that of treated or retained ones fig 2c due to filtration pankkonen 2020 and settlement semcesen and wells 2021 several studies that evaluated the effectiveness of stormwater management facilities report a similar phenomenon section 4 5 furthermore polymer density can affect the distribution of mps a recent study reported that the fraction of pet and pvc in pipe sediment was larger than in water sang et al 2021 this was attributed to a high rate of deposition due to the relatively high density of pet and pvc the retention of mps during their transportation process across different environmental compartments via urban runoff fig 4 is affected by mp characteristics e g density size and shape as well as climatic topographic and hydrological conditions and human activities horton et al 2017b liu et al 2019 nizzetto et al 2016 further examination of retention mechanisms and the influence mp characteristics is needed to more accurately model mps emissions through urban runoff 3 2 aging and fragmentation after being released into the environment plastic debris undergoes a series of physicochemical and biological processes such as mechanical abrasion photodegradation hydrolysis thermal oxidation chemical oxidation and biodegradation resulting in further aging and fragmentation of secondary mps aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 hanun et al 2021 during the migration and mobilization of mps in urban runoff the interactions between runoff water and mps e g mechanical breakdown duan et al 2021 hydrolysis sarno et al 2020 uv exposure alimi et al 2022 and biodegradation hanun et al 2021 can accelerate the aging process of mps in urban runoff mechanical breakdown is caused by abrasion and disintegration force which may be the result of the action of water shear force on mps and the interaction of mps with sediments stones and pebbles in urban runoff duan et al 2021 a recent study simulated the mechanical interactions between synthetic stormwater and mps and found that aging processes were related to the transport of mps from urban environment to water resources aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 another study documented that water shear stress could promote the formation of nanoplastics by crack propagation and crushing mechanism enfrin et al 2020 hydrolysis is more plausible in some polymers with water sensitive groups in the polymer backbone such as polyesters including pet polyamides polycarbonates polyanhydrides and polyethers sarno et al 2020 therefore mps with sensitive groups are easily hydrolyzed in urban runoff which further accelerates the aging process of mps furthermore the retention time of mps in urban runoff may affect the degree of hydrolysis of mps a recent study reported that the hydrolysis of poly butylene adipate co terephthalate pbat first occurred on the ester group between the terephthalate and adipate groups resulting in a decrease in the molar mass deshoulles et al 2022 the subsequent hydrolysis occurred on the ester group within the adipate ester group under longer aging durations deshoulles et al 2022 in drainage system fragmentation of plastics and mps in runoff water likely occurs but lacks quantitative studies in addition urban runoff mixes a variety of pollutants from different sources muller et al 2020 making it one of the main sources of water quality damage to aquatic ecosystems zhao et al 2010 changes in mps characteristics e g functional groups and hydrophobicity induced by aging processes can affect their tendency to adsorb other pollutants e g heavy metals and organic contaminants in urban runoff aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 hanun et al 2021 zhang et al 2022a further exacerbating ecological risks jemec kokalj et al 2019 meides et al 2021 degradation and biodegradation of mps in environments prior to entry of runoff may occur but no research has been reported on the fate of mps before and after entry of runoff in environment mps can be generated from plastic waste and or further degraded via various abiotic e g photodegradation by uv thermal degradation by sunlight chemical catalyzed degradation as well as mechanical degradation and biotic degradation zhang et al 2021 photodegradation induced by uv radiation or photooxidation is the most important abiotic aging pathway of mps in the environment alimi et al 2022 wang et al 2021f found that functional groups i e oh c o and ch appeared on the surface of pe mps during aging by uv light and found that the carbonyl index increased from 0 07 to 0 62 another study involving a 13 week rooftop weathering experiment reported the occurrence of substantial aging suggesting that solar radiation and rainwater were urban environmental stressors for mps miranda et al 2021 biodegradation plays a significant role in the decomposition of mps in aquatic and terrestrial environments luo et al 2022 ren et al 2021 to date plastics degrading microorganisms bacteria fungi have been found in soils sludge plastic dumping site sewage landfill etc ru et al 2020 in particular mps in urban runoff can carry microorganisms including plastics degrading microorganisms and pathogens constituting the microecosystem called plastisphere junaid et al 2022 wang et al 2022 however the degradation potential of plastisphere to mps and ecological risk of disease transmission of plastisphere in urban runoff are largely unknown in addition soil invertebrates like earth worms snails etc also ingest defragment and transport plastics and mps huerta lwanga et al 2018 rillig et al 2017 song et al 2020 especially the land snails also biodegrade ps via gut microbial activities song et al 2020 the larvae of several insects e g tenebrio moliutor or mealworms which belong to darkling beetles are capable of biodegradation of ps pe pp pvc etc via gut microbial activities wu and criddle 2021 yang et al 2015 the impact of microbial and invertebrate based biodegradation on mps in runoff remains further investigation 3 3 transport urban runoff is a major vector for the movement of mps in urban environments auta et al 2017 fahrenfeld et al 2019 which is often discharged into nearby water bodies directly or through stormwater drainage and stormwater retention structures shruti et al 2021 fig 4 rainfall intensity is an important factor in the formation of urban runoff and a driving force for the migration of mps in urban environments fan et al 2022 xia et al 2020 and a recent study inferred that the mobilization of mp occurs when rainfall intensity 2 5 mm h for more than 2 h treilles et al 2021 in general the greatest delivery of mps to rivers occurs during the first flush at the beginning of a rainfall event and as the storm continues the input will decrease barrows et al 2018 lee et al 2002 wang et al 2017 it was reported that the abundance of mps in an urban river in hong kong decreased sharply from 14 015 to 1 298 pieces m3 within 2 h due to rainfall induced runoff cheung et al 2018 the size of mps affects their mobility in urban runoff with smaller sizes 50 μm preferentially transported to receiving waters through urban road runoff klockner et al 2020 another study reported that high density mps e g pvc pet tend to be deposited in sediment rather than transported sang et al 2021 nevertheless the mechanisms and influencing factors in the migration of mps in urban runoff are largely unknown estimating the contribution of mp migration from land to water bodies via urban runoff is crucial siegfried et al 2017 calculated that tire and road wear particles transported by urban runoff were the largest source of mps in european rivers accounting for 42 another study indicated that the discharge of mps from separated city stormwater system accounted for 43 of mps in the warnow estuary germany piehl et al 2021 several studies have attempted to estimate the flux of mps in urban runoff at different temporal and spatial scales through the combination of sample data and mathematical modeling bondelind et al 2020 clayer et al 2021 bondelind et al 2020 simulated the distribution of traffic associated mps in the göta river using a three dimensional hydrodynamic model finding that mp concentrations were correlated to the number of nearby number of rainwater discharge points and the local traffic load a recent study estimated that the amount of mps released from road runoff in the mjøsa catchment norway is 5 5 tonnes year by socio economic modeling of mp fluxes on a catchment scale clayer et al 2021 in shanghai china chen et al 2020 estimated that the annual load of mps discharged via drainage systems at the catchment scale is up to 850 trillion particles year however it should be noted that owing to the wide range of sources of mps in urban areas the spatiotemporal variation of mps in urban runoff and sampling errors it remains difficult to fully quantify flux levels bai et al 2022 clayer et al 2021 therefore the urban runoff component of the global mp budget is not well understood 3 4 co contaminants in addition to mps many other contaminants including heavy metals and organic pollutants can also exist in urban runoff jarlskog et al 2021 muller et al 2020 which is considered a main non point source of pollution into receiving waters bjorklund et al 2018 hajiouni et al 2022 due to the physicochemical properties of some mps e g large specific surface area and strong hydrophobicity they can have high affinity for hazardous pollutants elgarahy et al 2021 wang and wang 2018 and act as a vector to transfer contaminants to different environmental compartments gao et al 2022 pramanik et al 2020 wang et al 2022 the transport of mps with adsorbed pollutants in urban runoff can cause serious environmental problems ren et al 2021 and increase the pollution risk of receiving water bodies furthermore some aging processes section 3 2 can increase the adsorption capacity of mps towards other pollutants thus elevating the risk of co transport hanun et al 2021 liu et al 2022 a recent study explored the effects of polymer type and weathering of low density pe mps on adsorption of pb2 in stormwater revealing significant physio chemistry changes which increased pb2 uptake aghilinasrollahabadi et al 2021 moreover mps can consist of polymers with harmful organic and inorganic additives that are applied as stabilizers plasticizers and flame retardants gonzalez ortegon et al 2022 teuten et al 2009 a recent study found that the average concentration of phthalate acid esters detected in urban runoff along the bushehr coast was 53 57 μg l which suggests that plastic additives in mps pose an environment threat hajiouni et al 2022 styrene oligomers leached from ps were found to transport from land to the tokyo bay via rainfall induced runoff amamiya et al 2019 n 1 3 dimethylbutyl n phenyl p phenylenediamine 6pdd is widely used as antioxidant agent for automobile tire and it can be oxidized to 6pdd quinone which shows acute toxicity to some species of fishes e g coho salmon hiki et al 2021 tian et al 2021 nowadays 6pdd quinone has been detected in street dust hiki and yamamoto 2022 and urban runoff rauert et al 2022 however a wealth of information on the subject exists in published literature and further investigations are needed to better understand the interactions between mps and other pollutants in urban runoff in different parts of the world 4 sinks there are various sinks for mp in urban runoff on the one hand mps can transfer to water bodies such as streams rivers lakes reservoirs estuaries and oceans lin et al 2021 shruti et al 2021 where they may migrate in the flowing water phase to the ocean fang et al 2021 fig 4 on the other hand they can be deposited in water body sediments or retained in soils stormwater retention structures or other compartments shruti et al 2021 it is important to review the features of these sinks in order to understand the fate of mps in urban runoff 4 1 rivers rivers are not only a sink for mps from various sources but also a key conduit of mp transfer from land to ocean wang et al 2020a xiong et al 2019 xu et al 2021 additionally as interactive and complex dynamic systems rivers can deposit retain and remobilize mps on different spatiotemporal scales bai et al 2022 eppehimer et al 2021 fig 4 discharge of urban runoff affects the dynamics and spatiotemporal distributions of mps in rivers with mp abundance showing significant temporal change related to precipitation patterns skalska et al 2020 wong et al 2020 moreover river sediment acts as the sink for mps for example mps derived from road marking paints in urban runoff have been detected in sediments of tributaries of the river thames uk at an order of magnitude higher abundance than the water column horton et al 2017a furthermore the input of a large amount of urban runoff can change the abundance distribution of mps between the water column and sediment thus increasing the migration of mps downstream xia et al 2021 for instance samples of one riverbed before and after flooding suggested that nearly 70 of deposited mps 43 billion particles were washed away after a flooding event hurley et al 2018 fig s1 there may exist a balance between deposition of newly introduced mps during rainfall induced runoff and the remobilization of old deposited mps from the sediment as a result of elevated water flow a recent study assessed the retention and efflux of mps in riverbed sediment on a watershed scale and indicated that mps entering headwater and mainstream were retained in riverbed sediments at an average rate of 8 and 3 per kilometer respectively fig s2 drummond et al 2022 the variation of retention time of mps in rivers with different classification levels might be affected by river velocity drummond et al 2022 another study indicated that the retention factors particle retention km could affect the total mp load of the river on the baltic sea for example a retention factor of 2 km would reduce the total mp load to 3 2 schernewski et al 2021 4 2 lakes and ponds lakes and ponds in urban areas act as mp sinks fig 4 and several studies report that large amounts of mps are transported to them in municipal wastewater laju et al 2022 zhao et al 2022 and urban runoff clayer et al 2021 grbic et al 2020 li et al 2022 as investigated by clayer et al 2021 three major sources of mps in lake mjøsa were attributed to mismanaged waste 24 5 t yr 1 wastewater treatment plant 6 9 t yr 1 and road runoff 5 5 t yr 1 indicating that the contribution of urban runoff to mps in lakes cannot be ignored moreover clayer et al 2021 also calculated the budget of mps in the mjøsa catchment and found that large amounts estimated between 7 and 120 tonnes of mps were annually released from land to lake mjøsa of this mass only 1 to 9 tonnes remained in the sediment indicating that most mps were transported to the ocean through connected water systems another study quantified the concentration of mps in lake ontario canada to 0 8 particles l the source waters were determined to be urban stormwater runoff 15 4 particles l treated wastewater effluent 13 3 particles l and agricultural runoff 0 9 particles l revealing that urban runoff was a significant contributor of mps in lake ontario grbic et al 2020 therefore it is necessary to comprehensively investigate the sources of mps in lakes especially urban lakes to determine the specific contribution of each source in order to model mp fluxes and develop management measures additionally urban lakes receive mps not only from urban runoff but also from atmospheric deposition allen et al 2021 dusaucy et al 2021 yang et al 2022 in this context rainfall is not only an important driving force for mps to enter lakes through urban runoff but also a potent driver accelerating the entry of mps into lakes via wet deposition klein and fischer 2019 xia et al 2020 however the specific contribution of mps from urban runoff and the atmosphere remains unclear furthermore similar to river system hydrodynamic changes caused by rainfall might lead to the remobilization and resuspension of mps in lake sediments which increases mp concentrations in lake water xia et al 2020 besides temporal variation of mp characteristics in lakes is related to temporal variation of those in urban runoff lin et al 2021 for instance the dominant mps collected in an ox bow lake in yenagoa nigeria were mostly pet 72 63 in the dry season and pvc 81 5 in the wet season oni et al 2020 moreover the flow of lake water and the renewal speed of lake water are slower than that of rivers which means that mps might retain in the lake environment for a long period yan et al 2021 yang et al 2022 4 3 oceans and beaches urban runoff is a major pathway for the dispersion of mps from the land to marine environments castro et al 2020 da silva et al 2022 exposito et al 2021 firstly land based mps in urban runoff can be transported to the estuary after being transferred to inland water systems e g rivers and lakes and finally to the ocean auta et al 2017 piehl et al 2021 fig 4 meijer et al 2021 calculated plastic emissions across the processes of mobilization by runoff and wind the transportation of plastic in rivers and the transfer of plastic from rivers to the ocean they reported that rivers account for 80 of the annual global emissions of plastics into the ocean discharging about 0 8 2 7 million tonnes of plastics into the ocean every year the discharge of mps from storm drain systems receiving urban runoff along coastline is also one of the most important routes of mp transfer to the ocean balthazar silva et al 2020 ory et al 2020 a recent study suggested that more mps entered the port of durban south africa from storm water drains than from river sources preston whyte et al 2021 secondly mps accumulated on land during dry periods are seasonally remobilized and flushed to coastal waters by rainfall which can be regarded as a pulse input event balthazar silva et al 2020 rios mendoza et al 2021 for example the discharge of mps in july and august to the southeastern baltic sea accounts for half of the annual input from sewer overflow systems including urban stormwater runoff schernewski et al 2020 differences between pulse events and the steady transfer of mps from land to ocean balthazar silva et al 2020 must be taken into account when modeling mp fluxes mps carried in runoff that reaches the coast can either enter the ocean jaubet et al 2021 or deposit on beaches kumar and varghese 2021 yaranal et al 2021 local scale variability in the distribution of mps on beaches will depend on tidal cycles and beach hydrodynamics balthazar silva et al 2020 substances leached from mps have been discovered on beaches for example amamiya et al 2019 found that styrene oligomers leached from ps were much higher in beach sand 171 times than in seawater in summary tens of thousands of mps distributed around the world are collected by runoff every year and finally input into the marine environment mps with higher density than seawater or mps biofouling by microorganisms can settle in seawater and eventually accumulate in marine sediments auta et al 2017 a recent study about mps in mediterranean sea found that mean abundance of mps in marine sediments 32 4 items kg was much higher than in sandy beaches 10 7 items kg exposito et al 2021 additionally a novel study reported that at least 66 7 of plastics in ocean are difficult to monitor under the observation framework currently adopted worldwide isobe and iwasaki 2022 therefore it is very important to investigated the flux of mps in runoff conveyed to ocean thus better monitoring the accumulation of marine mps 4 4 soils soils can intercept and retain mps from urban runoff nizzetto et al 2016 rivers et al 2021 yuan et al 2021 a recent study suggested that road and tire derived mps could be mobilized by urban runoff and then deposited to soil cao et al 2021 another study documented that surface runoff affects the accumulation of mps in urban and industrial soils nematollahi et al 2022 additionally a recent study investigated the vertical migration potential of mps retained in soil media of stormwater control measures scm and found that most of retained mps were located below the subsurface of scm indicating that retained mps might have the potential to further migrate downwards and pollute groundwater koutnik et al 2022 o connor et al 2019 reported that downward migration of mps in sandy soil is accelerated by wet dry cycles the mps entering into soils may affect their chemical properties and microbial community dissanayake et al 2022 palansooriya et al 2022 thus posing a threat to biodiversity and soil productivity hou 2022a 2022b because the mps and co contaminants like heavy metals can accumulate in soil over a large time span this may pose a big challenge for future practitioners who need to remediate the contaminated soil with sustainable means hou 2021a 2021b jin et al 2021 wang et al 2021d 4 5 stormwater drainage systems and stormwater retention structures mps can be retained in stormwater drainage systems and stormwater retention structures due to reduced flow velocity boni et al 2022 thus capturing and intercepting mps from urban runoff before it enters a receiving water body monira et al 2021b fig 4 a recent study demonstrated that the abundance of mps in the sediment of rainwater pipelines ranged from 44 to 320 particles kg sang et al 2021 liu et al 2019 reported that in industrial areas retained mps in the sediments of retention ponds can range from 1511 to 127 986 particles kg with the hydraulic load positively correlated with the amount of mps in sediments the retention phenomenon can be applied in stormwater retention ponds and bioretention systems to reduce downstream mp pollution koutnik et al 2022 liu et al 2019 vijayaraghavan et al 2021 there are many kinds of stormwater retention structures available for mp removal including infiltration trenches yano et al 2021 gross pollutant traps lange et al 2021 2022 bioretention systems including rain gardens and biofiltration boni et al 2022 gilbreath et al 2019 smyth et al 2021 vijayaraghavan et al 2021 constructed wetlands including stormwater floating treatment wetlands and stormwater retention ponds liu et al 2019 wang et al 2020b ziajahromi et al 2020 other techniques involving coagulation processes dissolved air flotation and membrane separation can also be applied to remove mps from urban runoff monira et al 2021a monira et al 2021b the properties of mps including morphotype and particle size can affect retention system removal performance several studies have demonstrated that fibrous mps are the most difficult mp morphotype to remove table s2 smyth et al 2021 werbowski et al 2021 another study documented that the mp concentration in urban runoff was reduced by 84 in the size fraction of 160 μm to 5 mm treated by bioretention systems indicating effective interception of relatively large mps in urban runoff smyth et al 2021 another study reported that the dominant mp size fraction was 190 5000 μm 83 7 in inlet water samples and 25 100 μm 96 5 in outlet water samples table s1 ziajahromi et al 2020 again showing effective removal of larger mps rather than smaller ones among retention systems bioretention cells and vegetated biofilters have performed best for mp removal while those that rely on physical separation processes including gross pollutant traps and sand filters often perform poorly fig 5 bioretention system is a stormwater treatment facility that combines physical interception chemical adsorption and bioremediation and it can improve runoff quality and be integrated into the urban landscape vijayaraghavan et al 2021 due to its multiple advantages it has high removal performance of mps 83 96 table s2 gross pollutant traps are regarded as the main primary treatment level for physically screening or capturing garbage and coarse sediments monira et al 2021b it can often be combined with other stormwater treatment facilities to improve the efficiency of mp removal and minimize sediment load of combined facilities lange et al 2022 furthermore different filter media in the stormwater treatment system have different mp removal performance a recent study reported that the removal efficiency of 20 100 μm mps by vegetated biofilters 88 was significantly better than that by non vegetated sand filters 47 table s2 lange et al 2022 the reasons might be due to the interception of plant roots and the small mps easier to penetrate deeper into the filter media lange et al 2022 o connor et al 2019 another novel study found that biochar particle size 5 50 mm and sand particle size 0 8 1 2 mm filtration systems had high removal performance 90 for microplastics 90 5000 μm in stormwater runoff pankkonen 2020 the removal mechanism of the former was mainly electrostatic attraction and adsorption and the latter is mainly interception by small filtration pores and adhesion on the sand surface pankkonen 2020 in nature based solutions nbs for urban runoff treatment settlement coagulation and biosorption can occur simultaneously thus leading to excellent or even complete removal rates chen et al 2021 zhou et al 2022 5 implications with the emergence of urbanization mp pollution associated with urban runoff has become a global environmental problem it is necessary to formulate policies regulations and measures to comprehensively and systematically manage the risks associated with this route of mp migration from land to water bodies first of all source prevention is a crucial step for which source identification is a prerequisite current research on mps in urban runoff has mainly focused on the concentration size distribution morphotype and polymer identification rather than quantitative analyzes of the contributions of different sources e g road dust and waste plastic dumping only when specific sources are identified can the risks be mitigated via source control however unlike toxic metals and organic contaminants whose sources can be precisely identified in environmental investigations by studying stable isotope compositions wang et al 2021b source identification for mp often relies on basic fingerprint features that can be applied in a cost effective manner for example wang et al 2021c proposed that size distribution clusters are important as they form via conditional probability induced aging processes therefore the cumulative size distribution function of mps in urban runoff can be regarded as a mixture of various size distribution functions derived from different source materials the applicability of this method for source identification purposes may be further explored in some urban areas not only are there separate stormwater drainage systems but also combined sewer systems which can discharge untreated mixed stormwater and wastewater during storm events bollmann et al 2019 shruti et al 2021 fig 4 this adds to the difficulty for source control several studies have reported that urban runoff discharged by combined sewer overflow systems could be considered as an important pathway for mps in water environments chen et al 2020 schernewski et al 2021 schernewski et al 2020 more attention must be paid to the impact of separate stormwater drainage systems and combined sewer systems on the discharge of mps in urban runoff establishing climate resilient infrastructure to limit urban runoff while simultaneously removing mps is desirable to prevent mp mobilization and migration global climate change adds uncertainty to future storm events shaw et al 2016 nature inspired low impact development of sponge cities is a promising way to alleviate urban waterlogging and flooding by restoring the natural water cycle and its ecological functions combined with green and gray infrastructure cheng et al 2022 qiao et al 2020 wang et al 2021a current stormwater treatment techniques are mainly used to remove total suspended solids heavy metals organic matter and nutrients in stormwater al ameri et al 2018 boni et al 2022 valenca et al 2021 a limited number of works have explored the utilization of stormwater retention structures e g bioretention systems to specifically remove mps in urban runoff gilbreath et al 2019 lange et al 2021 it has been reported that large mps can be effectively removed by stormwater retention structures pankkonen 2020 smyth et al 2021 which could efficiently reduce the risk of plastic additives being released into the water environment by mps allan et al 2022 do et al 2022 however smaller ones especially nanoplastics nps may escape from these systems and pose the highest environmental risks due to their greater toxicity to aquatic organisms and faster diffusive release rate of plastic additives gigault et al 2021 wang et al 2021e therefore stormwater treatment techniques should be redesigned and developed so that they can effectively remove as many mps with different particle sizes and other pollutants as possible in the urban stormwater runoff simultaneously boni et al 2022 furthermore it is essential to evaluate the removal performance of different stormwater retention structures for mps in urban runoff and to provide practical guidance for selecting stormwater retention structures to treat urban runoff containing different mp components from diverse land sources monira et al 2021b 6 knowledge gaps and future research directions migration of mps in urban runoff from land to freshwater and marine environments further exacerbates mp pollution in aquatic ecosystems despite this investigation on mps in urban runoff on a global scale is largely inadequate more detailed and comprehensive research is needed to shed light on the global occurrence and fate of mps in urban runoff and their impact here we recommend the following research priorities 1 quantitative calculation of distribution concentration and spatiotemporal characteristics of mps in urban runoff in particular experimental and modeling works on a regional or global scale will help us reach a better understanding on the fluxes environmental behavior and fate of mps thus providing a valuable context for policy making and global collaboration 2 the complexity of mp transport among land rivers lakes and oceans should be further taken into account the pulse release of mps in river or lake sediments related to the intensity of urban runoff processes adds much uncertainty to the flux of mps to the ocean furthermore other indirect inputs in particular atmospheric wet deposition to lakes and ponds should be assessed simultaneously with land based sources 3 fingerprint characteristics of mps in urban runoff should be further explored to assist in source identification for effective source prevention measures 4 standardized methods for sampling extraction separation identification and quantification of mps in urban runoff should be established obtaining high quality comparable data is a prerequisite for aforementioned quantitative estimation the different methods currently applied in different studies table 1 may cause bias that may lead to erroneous conclusions 5 more holistic research is required to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of dynamic processes in a quantitative manner such as the role of land use associated human disturbances on spatial distribution effect of rainfall intensity on re mobilization of mps in urban runoff and aging associated changes in mp migration 6 further study on abiotic and biotic reactions for aging fragmentation and biodegradation of mps in contamination sources and drainage system to understand formation of mps in relation to their physical chemical and biological properties and develop management strategies for mp reduction and prevention 7 further exploration of the interaction between mps and co contaminants in urban runoff should be conducted we do not yet know whether metals and organic contaminants are preferentially adsorbed to suspended mp surfaces or retained in the runoff liquid phase basic parameters such as partition coefficients should be obtained 8 more relevant policies regulations and measures need to be implemented to systematically manage mps in urban runoff which requires us to cooperate globally nationally and regionally and take action locally declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have

15448,the proper water chemical composition of aquaculture water is very important for fish farming in reservoirs or fish multiplication stations gas bubble disease gbd is mainly caused by total dissolved gas supersaturation tdgs in water and is a common problem that affects the healthy growth of fish extensive measures have been taken to mitigate tdgs levels in water where fish live while methods for quantitatively evaluating the mitigation effect of the proposed measures on fish exposed to tdgs are still lacking in this paper an activated carbon ac adsorption experiment for supersaturated total dissolved gas tdg dissipation was conducted and the experimental results indicated that ac addition could effectively accelerate supersaturated tdg dissipation based on fish tolerance experiments conducted by huang 2010 two models including a mortality risk degree evaluation model and a mortality rate calculation model were developed to quantitatively evaluate the mortality risk mitigation effect of ac addiction on fish exposed to unsteady tdgs levels application of the results of the mortality risk degree evaluation model has shown that ac addition can help alleviate the mortality risk of fish suffering from tdgs application of the results of the mortality rate calculation model has also demonstrated that the final mortality rate of the fish group in the case with ac addition was lower than that of the case without added ac and the final mortality rate decreased as the specific surface area and dosage of ac increased furthermore an equation that related the required ac mass and a given harvested fish mass was established this paper provides a reference for evaluating the effects of various mitigation measures to alleviate the risk posed to fish by tdgs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords total dissolved gas supersaturation mitigation measures mortality risk evaluation activated carbon data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fish farming requires high standards for water temperature ph hardness transparency nutrient conditions and dissolved gas conditions to ensure healthy water environments roberts 2012 maintaining a favourable water environment is extremely important for aquaculture production in this paper we focus on a common problem in aquaculture gas bubble disease gbd gbd is a non infectious environmental disease weitkamp 2008 that occurs when the pressure of total dissolved gas tdg including n2 o2 and co2 in water exceeds the local atmospheric pressure which is called total dissolved gas supersaturation tdgs tdgs can be caused by various mechanisms both natural and anthropogenic including the following saturations 1 during dam discharge or in a waterfall a large amount of air can be entrained by the jet and then dissolved in the water under the high pressure of the plunge pool causing tdgs weitkamp et al 2003 2 excessive aeration in rearing ponds espmark et al 2010 larsen et al 2019 and 3 using naturally supersaturated well or spring water as a water source for fish rearing harvey 1975 have the same effect 4 during a warm winter heavy photosynthetic activities occur under clear ice and then produce excess gas that cannot escape into the atmosphere renfro 1963 5 warm water discharged from cooling facilities such as nuclear and fossil fuel powered generating plants produces tdgs in water that is initially saturated canadian council of ministers of the environment 1999 when tdgs occurs the excess dissolved gases precipitate in the form of bubbles these bubbles attach to the body surfaces fins and gill fillets of fish as shown in fig 1 causing the fish to lose their body balance and behave abnormally when performing predation migration clustering and defence activities furthermore the excess dissolved gas enters the blood vessels of fish and undergoes gas embolization resulting in the blockage of the blood vessels and heart and even death agostinho et al 2021 there have been many reports on gbd related fish deaths around the world among which dam discharge accounts for the most extensive research for instance the fish death that occurred below grand coulee dam beeman et al 2003 barkley and kentucky lake dams garth 2014 xiluodu dam wu 2014 and brookfield hydroelectric dam succi 2019 were all attributed to the occurrence of tdgs during the dams discharge in addition fish suffering from gbd have been reported on some fish farms machova et al 2017 reported a case of farmed trout death caused by gbd in a local trout farm in the czech republic morey et al 2019 reported that a large farmed arapaima gigas specimen from the peruvian amazon was diagnosed with gbd in view of the issues with gbd caused by tdgs scholars have carried out extensive research to mitigate this negative effect from a precautionary point of view some scholars have proposed ways to pre treat the water supply spotte et al 1992 suggested trickling the supplied water over a packed column and recommended introducing aeration to the base of the column boyd 2012 also wrote in the global aquaculture advocate that supersaturated gases can be removed from the water supply using degassing towers other studies have considered accelerating the dissipation of supersaturated tdg to alleviate the risk of fish suffering from gbd including by enhancing the turbulence intensity in water li et al 2013 increasing the wind speed above the water surface huang et al 2016 aeration in water ou et al 2016 and adding adsorbing media to the water niu et al 2015 yuan et al 2020 furthermore scholars have conducted many experiments to explore the tolerance swimming and avoidance abilities of different fish species exposed to different tdgs levels counihan et al 1998 antcliffe et al 2003 cao et al 2016 ji et al 2021 stenberg et al 2022 and tdgs thresholds have been determined for different species however methods for quantitatively evaluating the mitigation effects of the abovementioned measures on the exposure risk of fish to tdgs are still lacking according to niu et al 2015 the addition of activated carbon ac to water is considered an effective way to accelerate the dissipation of supersaturated tdg because of ac s characteristics of a porous structure and large specific surface area these characteristics allow ac to effectively absorb dissolved gases in water in addition ac can simultaneously purify rearing water and can be recycled yuan et al 2022 in this paper experiments on the adsorption effect of ac on the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg were conducted an ac adsorption experiment for short combined with existing experiments huang 2010 on the effects of tdgs on lethality in juvenile rock carp and the experimental data from an ac adsorption experiment two models involving mortality risk degree evaluation and mortality rate calculation under unsteady tdgs levels were established these two models can be used to quantitatively evaluate the mitigation effect of the proposed measures on the exposure risk of fish to tdgs 2 material and methods 2 1 ac adsorption experiment 2 1 1 experimental device and materials the experimental device was a series of identical plexiglass water tanks the length width and height of which were 1 0 m 0 5 m and 0 4 m respectively six commercially available forms of ac pingdingshan xinzhiyuan ac co ltd china were used in the experiment coconut shell based ac nut shell based ac tar based ac coal based ac wood based ac and mixed ac produced with high quality coal coconut shell and wood as raw materials hereinafter these ac types are abbreviated as cs ac ns ac t ac c ac w ac and m ac the specific surface areas of the analyzed ac types were characterised using a full automatic specific surface area and porosity analyser rise 1010 type which was produced by jinan runzhi technology co ltd china and has a specific surface area s measurement range of 0 01 m2 g to no limit the analysis results obtained for cs ac ns ac t ac c ac w ac and m ac were 837 94 m2 g 532 02 m2 g 458 55 m2 g 149 60 m2 g 62 72 m2 g and 22 36 m2 g respectively prior to use all ac types were dried in a 101 e electric heat drum wind drying oven beijing ever bright medical treatment instrument co ltd china the supersaturated tdg water used in the experiment was derived from a supersaturated tdg generation system developed by sichuan university china li et al 2012 fig 2 shows a sketch of the supersaturated tdg generating system high speed air and water were pumped into the reactor vessel and fully mixed through s shaped pipes at high pressure and a supersaturated tdg outflow was then generated the maximum outflow rate of the supersaturated tdg generation system was designed as 15 l s 1 and was measured using a flowmeter the generated tdg saturation can reach 180 water with different tdg saturation levels was produced by mixing the outflow with fresh water tdg saturation equal to 100 2 1 2 experimental methods an ac adsorption experiment was conducted in a laboratory with a constant temperature and humidity at the state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering sklh of sichuan university the ambient temperature was maintained at 20 0 0 2 c a total of 150 l configured supersaturated tdg water was introduced into the experiment tank and dried ac was then submerged into the water point four total gas pressure tgp trackers pentair california u s which have a tdg saturation measurement range of 0 200 and an accuracy of 2 were used to repeatedly measure the tdg saturation level at regular intervals until it dropped below120 six initial tdg saturation levels 125 130 135 140 145 and 150 six ac types cs ac ns ac t ac c ac w ac and m ac and six ac dosages 1 0 kg 1 5 kg 2 0 kg 3 0 kg 4 0 kg and 6 0 kg were set in the experiments all experimental cases are listed in table 1 2 2 data from other research rock carp endemic to china and distributed in the tributaries of the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river is an edible economic fish previous studies have proven that rock carp have the worst tolerance to tdgs among the tested species wang et al 2020 therefore here we adopted existing experimental data on the adverse effects of tdgs on juvenile rock carp as a reference huang 2010 investigated the effects of tdgs on acute lethality and avoidance responses in juvenile rock carp the body lengths of which were 3 9 5 0 cm with body weights of 0 26 0 53 g the juvenile rock carp were exposed to water at different tdg saturation levels 100 115 120 125 130 135 140 and 145 and with a depth of 0 20 m at 25 c the experiments showed that juvenile rock carp mortality occurred only at tdg saturation levels equal to or greater than 120 the mortality rates of juvenile rock carp exposed to different tdg saturation levels over time are shown in fig 3 the median lethal time lt 50 which refers to the time at which fish mortality reaches 50 at a specific tdgs level is often used to describe the tolerance of fish to tdgs in huang s 2010 experiment the lt 50 values of juvenile rock carp at 120 125 130 135 140 and 145 tdg saturation levels were 14 h 9 9 h 4 8 h 3 2 h 1 2 h and 0 8 h respectively 2 3 theoretical analysis 2 3 1 mortality risk degree assessment model of fish exposed to unsteady tdgs generally the lt 50 index is used to evaluate the tolerance of fish to steady tdgs conditions fish species with longer lt 50 values are considered to have higher tolerances taking lt 50 as a reference a mortality risk degree evaluation model of fish exposed to unsteady tdgs levels was developed to preliminarily evaluate the mortality risk degree of fish when exposed to unsteady tdgs conditions it was assumed that if the duration over which the tdg saturation dropped from an initial level to a certain level was shorter than the lt 50 value at a given saturation level the fish group was safe under these conditions otherwise the conditions were dangerous when tdg saturation changes with time it is difficult to determine the exact state of the fish group analyzed herein the risk probability and risk index were defined to describe the mortality risk degree of fish damaged by tdgs risk probability the ratio between the duration over which tdg drops from initial saturation to a certain saturation t g h and the lt 50 g at this tdg saturation is defined as the risk probability rp as shown in eq 1 1 r p t g l t 50 g when 0 rp 0 5 it indicates a low mortality risk state 0 5 rp 1 indicates a medium mortality risk state and rp 1 indicates a high mortality risk state risk index based on existing studies most fish are expected to suffer from gbd or even death when the tdg saturation level is above 120 we assume that when the state of a fish group reaches the medium risk level or above the exposure time after that is considered the risk time for a given condition the proportion of the risk time to the total dissipation time the time over which tdg saturation drops from its initial state to 120 is defined as the risk index as shown in eq 2 2 r i t r i s k t t o t a l the risk index can be used to represent the mortality risk degree of fish when exposed to tdgs the higher the risk index the more dangerous the conditions risk index values equal to 0 and 1 indicate safety and danger for the fish groups respectively 2 3 2 mortality rate calculation model under unsteady tdgs levels through statistical analyses of a large number of experimental data xue 2020 studied the relation between the mortality rate and damage degree of fish subjected to steady tdgs here combined with a supersaturated tdg dissipation model we extended xue s research 2020 to the situation in which the tdg saturation level in water gradually decreases over time supersaturated tdg dissipation model pickett et al 2004 proposed that the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg follows first order kinetics existing field observation data feng et al 2014 kamal et al 2016 and experimental data shen et al 2014 ou et al 2016 have also proven the rationality of utilizing first order kinetics to fit the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg the first order kinetic equation can be expressed as follows 3 g g e q g 0 g e q e k t where t h represents the dissipation time g represents the tdg saturation level at time t g 0 represents the initial tdg saturation level g eq represents the equilibrium tdg saturation level generally equal to 100 and k h 1 represents the dissipation coefficient development of the mortality rate calculation model based on the graphic method described by miller and tainter according to shetty and alwar 2007 and according to a probit table table 2 the mortality rate was converted into a probability unit taking the logarithm of the exposure time as the independent variable and the probability unit as the dependent variable a fitting linear expression was obtained as shown in eq 4 4 p r g l o g 10 t j g where p is the probability unit t is the exposure time h r g is the slope of the regression line j g is the intercept of the regression line and g is the tdg saturation level eq 4 can be converted into the following expression 5 p l o g 10 t r g 10 j g d t r 10 j is defined as representing the damage degree to fish subjected to tdgs this means that the mortality rate is related to the damage degree namely when the damage degree reaches d the probability unit reaches p at the end of the first stage of exposure i e at t 1 the damage degree is represented as follows 6 d 1 t 1 r g 1 10 j g 1 during the second stage of exposure i e from t 1 to t 2 the initial damage degree is d 1 and the end damage degree is d 2 we assume that the initial damage degree d 1 is equivalent to the damage degree after following the exposure time of t e 2 to the second stage environment conditions 7 d 1 t 1 r g 1 10 j g 1 t e 2 r g 2 10 j g 2 8 t e 2 d 1 10 j g 2 1 r g 2 at the end of the second exposure stage the cumulative damage degree is equivalent to the damage degree after exposure time of t e 2 t 2 t 1 to the second stage environmental conditions therefore at the moment of t 2 the damage degree is calculated as follows 9 d 2 t e t 2 t 1 r g 2 10 j g 2 at the moment of ti i 1 the damage degree is calculated as follows 10 d i t e i t i t i 1 r g i 10 j g i 11 t e i d i 1 10 j g i 1 r g i when t is equal to 0 the following expression is satisfied 12 d 0 0 according to eq 3 when the tdg saturation level drops to gi 1 the exposure time is calculated as follows 13 t i 1 ln g 0 100 g i 1 100 k when the tdg saturation level drops to gi the exposure time is calculated as follows 14 t i ln g 0 100 g i 100 k we assume that if δ g g i g i 1 is small during this period the damage degree is approximately equivalent to that of fish exposed to a tdg saturation level of g i 1 g i 2 for a period of t i t i 1 according to eq 10 at the moment of t i the damage degree is calculated as follows 15 d i t e i t i t i 1 r g i 1 g i 2 10 j g i 1 g i 2 the probability unit is represented as follows 16 p i l o g 10 d i according to table 2 the mortality rate can be obtained at the moment of t i 3 results and discussion 3 1 ac adsorption experiment results for supersaturated tdg dissipation the supersaturated tdg dissipation processes for all experimental cases are presented in fig 4 the tdg saturation level gradually decreased over time comparisons between cases without and with added ac indicated that adding ac to water could effectively promote the dissipation of supersaturated tdg the promotion effects increased with increasing specific surface area and dosage of the added ac as previous research has shown in water without added ac supersaturated tdg was mainly dissipated through gas liquid mass transfer and inner dissipation while in water with added ac ac adsorption occurred and also contributed to supersaturated tdg dissipation therefore in our view for the same initial tdg saturation the reduction in tdg saturation caused by the adsorption effect of ac was the tdg saturation difference δg between the case without added ac and the case with added ac the variations in δg over time are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that δg increased gradually over time in all cases indicating that ac kept absorbing tdg during the whole process and then promoted the supersaturated tdg dissipation process to quantitatively analyse the dissipation rate of supersaturated tdg under different situations the first order kinetic equation eq 3 was adopted to fit the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg under different situations and the coefficients of determination r2 of all experimental cases were greater than 0 96 indicating a high goodness of fit between the first order kinetic equation and the experimental data the obtained dissipation coefficients are shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows the relations among the dissipation coefficient initial tdg saturation level ac specific surface area and ac dosage for the cases without added ac fig 6 a the dissipation coefficient showed a slight upward trend with an increasing initial tdg saturation level for the cases with added ac fig 6 b the relation curve between the dissipation coefficient and the initial tdg saturation level completely changed and showed a downward trend with an increasing initial tdg saturation level compared with the cases under the same initial tdg saturation condition the dissipation coefficients of case 7 to case 12 increased by 387 0 314 4 265 8 240 4 212 0 and 182 1 respectively after 4 0 kg of coconut shell based ac was added these results indicate that adding ac to water can promote the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg as shown in fig 6 c d it is apparent that this promotion effect increased along with the specific surface area and dosage of the added ac 3 2 application of the mortality risk degree assessment model the lt 50 values of juvenile rock carp in huang s 2010 experiment were combined with the supersaturated tdg dissipation results of the ac adsorption experiment and eq 1 was used to calculate the results of the rps derived for different cases under different experimental periods as shown in fig 7 for cases without added ac especially in case 5 g 0 145 0 without added ac and case 6 g 0 150 0 without added ac rock carp were almost always at high mortality risks the maximum rp reached 3 11 which occurred when the tdg saturation level dropped from 150 to 140 in case 6 when ac was added the rps were significantly reduced comparing case 6 and case 12 g 0 150 0 4 0 kg cs ac the rp dropped from 1 09 to 0 39 1 17 to 0 42 1 78 to 0 63 1 86 to 0 66 3 11 to 1 10 and 2 20 to 0 78 during the periods when the tdg saturation level dropped from 150 to 120 125 130 135 140 and 145 respectively the maximum rp reduction degree reached approximately 80 in case 7 g 0 125 0 4 0 kg cs ac by comparing cases with initial tdg saturation levels of 140 case 4 case 10 and case 13 to case 22 it can be seen that the rps decreased as the specific surface area and dosage of the added ac increased especially in case 10 case 13 to case 15 and case 19 to case 22 in which the rock carp were in low mortality risk states at all times based on the results of the rps the risk index results of all cases were calculated using eq 2 and are shown in fig 7 for cases without added ac the risk index values were relatively high especially for cases in which the initial tdg saturation level was greater than or equal to 135 under these conditions the risk indices were all equal to 1 meaning that the rock carp group was in danger after adding ac the risk index values were significantly reduced by comparing case 3 with case 9 case 4 with case 10 case 13 with case 15 and case 19 with case 22 it can be seen that the state of the rock carp changed from dangerous danger to safe the above analyses indicate that the addition of ac can help alleviate the mortality risk degree of the fish groups suffering from tdgs conditions 3 3 application of the mortality rate calculation model combining the mortality rate calculation model developed in section 2 3 2 and the data obtained from huang s 2010 experiments the mortality rates of juvenile rock carp under the experimental conditions described in this paper were predicted according to fig 3 and eq 4 the probability unit and exposure time equations at different tdg saturation levels were obtained as shown in table 3 by comparing and analysing the relations among g r and j it can be seen that the relationship between r and g and the relationship between j and g can be fitted by polynomials two equations can be obtained 17 r 0 0057 g 100 2 0 45 g 100 10 68 18 j 0 0059 g 100 2 0 57 g 100 8 60 by combining eq 13 to eq 16 and table 2 and taking the value of δ g as 0 1 the mortality rate process for juvenile rock carp exposed to the different conditions described in the ac adsorption experiment can be obtained as shown in fig 8 the mortality rate gradually increased with exposure time as shown in fig 8 a the mortality rate increased faster with increasing initial tdg saturation levels the final mortality rate showed a monotonically increasing trend with the initial tdg saturation level with the addition of 4 0 kg of cs ac the mortality exposure time curves in fig 8 b showed the same trend as those in fig 8 a while the final mortality rate was greatly reduced for the same initial tdg saturation comparing case 1 to case 6 the final mortality rates obtained under case 7 to case 12 were reduced by 6 2 39 9 51 3 38 1 26 9 and 17 4 respectively these results suggest that the addition of ac is effective in reducing fish mortality and that this mitigation effect increases with the specific surface area fig 8 c and dosage of the added ac fig 8 d 3 4 analysis of the required ac mass according to the calculation results of the final mortality rate m f it can be concluded that both the addition of more ac and the use of ac with a larger specific surface area can lower the final mortality rate additionally the initial tdg saturation can also affect the final mortality rate thus the following discussion established the quantitative relations among the final mortality rate m f specific surface area s m2 g dosage of ac m kg and initial tdg saturation g 0 the ac specific surface area and dosage were combined into a comprehensive index as shown in eq 19 this factor was defined as the areal content of ac per unit volume of water 19 a a c m s v 1000 where a ac is the areal content of ac per unit volume of water m 1 m is the ac dosage kg s is the ac specific surface area m2 g and v is the water volume m3 by analysing the experimental data it is clear that m f is exponentially related to a ac and follows a power function with g 0 considering all these results the following expression can be obtained 20 m f α g 0 g e q β e λ a a c where α β and λ are constants and can be determined through optimal fitting utilizing the experimental data to carry out optimal fitting the fitting results of α β and λ were found to be 0 0008 3 117 and 3 24 10 8 respectively and the multiple correction coefficient r was 0 93 fig 9 shows a comparison of m f between the values calculated using eq 20 and the experiment values it is clear that most of the calculated values are very close to the experimental values meaning that eq 20 can be used to estimate the final mortality thus the harvested mass of fish can be estimated as follows 21 m h 1 m f 100 m 1 0 0008 g 0 g e q 3 117 e 3 24 10 8 a a c 100 m thus the required ac mass can be estimated as follows 22 m ln 1 m h m 100 0 0008 g 0 g 3 117 3 24 s v 10 5 where m h is the harvested mass of the fish kg and m is the feeding mass of the fish kg 4 conclusion in this paper an activated adsorption experiment for supersaturated tdg was carried out combined with huang s 2010 experimental data methods for quantitatively evaluating the mitigation effect of the proposed supersaturated tdg dissipation promotion measures on the exposure risk of the fish to tdgs were established the main conclusions can be summarised as follows adding ac to water effectively accelerated the dissipation of supersaturated tdg and the dissipation coefficient increased by a maximum of 387 0 in case 7 g 0 120 0 using 4 0 kg coconut shell based ac the dissipation coefficient increased with the specific surface area and dosage of the added ac and decreased as the initial tdg saturation level decreased a mortality risk degree evaluation model of fish exposed to unsteady tdgs levels was developed the results of the model application indicated that the addition of ac could help alleviate the mortality risk of fish groups suffering from tdgs in comparison with cases without added ac the maximum risk probability reduction degree reached 79 5 in case 7 g 0 125 0 4 0 kg cs ac the risk index which represents the damage induced by tdgs to the fish group decreased as the specific surface area and dosage of the added ac increased a mortality rate calculation model was developed under the condition that tdg saturation gradually decreased the mortality rate of the fish group with added ac was demonstrated to be lower than that of the fish group without added ac and the final mortality rate was reduced by a maximum of 51 3 in case 9 g 0 135 0 4 0 kg cs ac the final mortality rate decreased as the specific surface area and dosage of the added ac increased an equation for the required ac mass was established and could be used to preliminarily calculate the required ac mass for a given harvested mass of fish credit

15448,the proper water chemical composition of aquaculture water is very important for fish farming in reservoirs or fish multiplication stations gas bubble disease gbd is mainly caused by total dissolved gas supersaturation tdgs in water and is a common problem that affects the healthy growth of fish extensive measures have been taken to mitigate tdgs levels in water where fish live while methods for quantitatively evaluating the mitigation effect of the proposed measures on fish exposed to tdgs are still lacking in this paper an activated carbon ac adsorption experiment for supersaturated total dissolved gas tdg dissipation was conducted and the experimental results indicated that ac addition could effectively accelerate supersaturated tdg dissipation based on fish tolerance experiments conducted by huang 2010 two models including a mortality risk degree evaluation model and a mortality rate calculation model were developed to quantitatively evaluate the mortality risk mitigation effect of ac addiction on fish exposed to unsteady tdgs levels application of the results of the mortality risk degree evaluation model has shown that ac addition can help alleviate the mortality risk of fish suffering from tdgs application of the results of the mortality rate calculation model has also demonstrated that the final mortality rate of the fish group in the case with ac addition was lower than that of the case without added ac and the final mortality rate decreased as the specific surface area and dosage of ac increased furthermore an equation that related the required ac mass and a given harvested fish mass was established this paper provides a reference for evaluating the effects of various mitigation measures to alleviate the risk posed to fish by tdgs graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords total dissolved gas supersaturation mitigation measures mortality risk evaluation activated carbon data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction fish farming requires high standards for water temperature ph hardness transparency nutrient conditions and dissolved gas conditions to ensure healthy water environments roberts 2012 maintaining a favourable water environment is extremely important for aquaculture production in this paper we focus on a common problem in aquaculture gas bubble disease gbd gbd is a non infectious environmental disease weitkamp 2008 that occurs when the pressure of total dissolved gas tdg including n2 o2 and co2 in water exceeds the local atmospheric pressure which is called total dissolved gas supersaturation tdgs tdgs can be caused by various mechanisms both natural and anthropogenic including the following saturations 1 during dam discharge or in a waterfall a large amount of air can be entrained by the jet and then dissolved in the water under the high pressure of the plunge pool causing tdgs weitkamp et al 2003 2 excessive aeration in rearing ponds espmark et al 2010 larsen et al 2019 and 3 using naturally supersaturated well or spring water as a water source for fish rearing harvey 1975 have the same effect 4 during a warm winter heavy photosynthetic activities occur under clear ice and then produce excess gas that cannot escape into the atmosphere renfro 1963 5 warm water discharged from cooling facilities such as nuclear and fossil fuel powered generating plants produces tdgs in water that is initially saturated canadian council of ministers of the environment 1999 when tdgs occurs the excess dissolved gases precipitate in the form of bubbles these bubbles attach to the body surfaces fins and gill fillets of fish as shown in fig 1 causing the fish to lose their body balance and behave abnormally when performing predation migration clustering and defence activities furthermore the excess dissolved gas enters the blood vessels of fish and undergoes gas embolization resulting in the blockage of the blood vessels and heart and even death agostinho et al 2021 there have been many reports on gbd related fish deaths around the world among which dam discharge accounts for the most extensive research for instance the fish death that occurred below grand coulee dam beeman et al 2003 barkley and kentucky lake dams garth 2014 xiluodu dam wu 2014 and brookfield hydroelectric dam succi 2019 were all attributed to the occurrence of tdgs during the dams discharge in addition fish suffering from gbd have been reported on some fish farms machova et al 2017 reported a case of farmed trout death caused by gbd in a local trout farm in the czech republic morey et al 2019 reported that a large farmed arapaima gigas specimen from the peruvian amazon was diagnosed with gbd in view of the issues with gbd caused by tdgs scholars have carried out extensive research to mitigate this negative effect from a precautionary point of view some scholars have proposed ways to pre treat the water supply spotte et al 1992 suggested trickling the supplied water over a packed column and recommended introducing aeration to the base of the column boyd 2012 also wrote in the global aquaculture advocate that supersaturated gases can be removed from the water supply using degassing towers other studies have considered accelerating the dissipation of supersaturated tdg to alleviate the risk of fish suffering from gbd including by enhancing the turbulence intensity in water li et al 2013 increasing the wind speed above the water surface huang et al 2016 aeration in water ou et al 2016 and adding adsorbing media to the water niu et al 2015 yuan et al 2020 furthermore scholars have conducted many experiments to explore the tolerance swimming and avoidance abilities of different fish species exposed to different tdgs levels counihan et al 1998 antcliffe et al 2003 cao et al 2016 ji et al 2021 stenberg et al 2022 and tdgs thresholds have been determined for different species however methods for quantitatively evaluating the mitigation effects of the abovementioned measures on the exposure risk of fish to tdgs are still lacking according to niu et al 2015 the addition of activated carbon ac to water is considered an effective way to accelerate the dissipation of supersaturated tdg because of ac s characteristics of a porous structure and large specific surface area these characteristics allow ac to effectively absorb dissolved gases in water in addition ac can simultaneously purify rearing water and can be recycled yuan et al 2022 in this paper experiments on the adsorption effect of ac on the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg were conducted an ac adsorption experiment for short combined with existing experiments huang 2010 on the effects of tdgs on lethality in juvenile rock carp and the experimental data from an ac adsorption experiment two models involving mortality risk degree evaluation and mortality rate calculation under unsteady tdgs levels were established these two models can be used to quantitatively evaluate the mitigation effect of the proposed measures on the exposure risk of fish to tdgs 2 material and methods 2 1 ac adsorption experiment 2 1 1 experimental device and materials the experimental device was a series of identical plexiglass water tanks the length width and height of which were 1 0 m 0 5 m and 0 4 m respectively six commercially available forms of ac pingdingshan xinzhiyuan ac co ltd china were used in the experiment coconut shell based ac nut shell based ac tar based ac coal based ac wood based ac and mixed ac produced with high quality coal coconut shell and wood as raw materials hereinafter these ac types are abbreviated as cs ac ns ac t ac c ac w ac and m ac the specific surface areas of the analyzed ac types were characterised using a full automatic specific surface area and porosity analyser rise 1010 type which was produced by jinan runzhi technology co ltd china and has a specific surface area s measurement range of 0 01 m2 g to no limit the analysis results obtained for cs ac ns ac t ac c ac w ac and m ac were 837 94 m2 g 532 02 m2 g 458 55 m2 g 149 60 m2 g 62 72 m2 g and 22 36 m2 g respectively prior to use all ac types were dried in a 101 e electric heat drum wind drying oven beijing ever bright medical treatment instrument co ltd china the supersaturated tdg water used in the experiment was derived from a supersaturated tdg generation system developed by sichuan university china li et al 2012 fig 2 shows a sketch of the supersaturated tdg generating system high speed air and water were pumped into the reactor vessel and fully mixed through s shaped pipes at high pressure and a supersaturated tdg outflow was then generated the maximum outflow rate of the supersaturated tdg generation system was designed as 15 l s 1 and was measured using a flowmeter the generated tdg saturation can reach 180 water with different tdg saturation levels was produced by mixing the outflow with fresh water tdg saturation equal to 100 2 1 2 experimental methods an ac adsorption experiment was conducted in a laboratory with a constant temperature and humidity at the state key laboratory of hydraulics and mountain river engineering sklh of sichuan university the ambient temperature was maintained at 20 0 0 2 c a total of 150 l configured supersaturated tdg water was introduced into the experiment tank and dried ac was then submerged into the water point four total gas pressure tgp trackers pentair california u s which have a tdg saturation measurement range of 0 200 and an accuracy of 2 were used to repeatedly measure the tdg saturation level at regular intervals until it dropped below120 six initial tdg saturation levels 125 130 135 140 145 and 150 six ac types cs ac ns ac t ac c ac w ac and m ac and six ac dosages 1 0 kg 1 5 kg 2 0 kg 3 0 kg 4 0 kg and 6 0 kg were set in the experiments all experimental cases are listed in table 1 2 2 data from other research rock carp endemic to china and distributed in the tributaries of the upper and middle reaches of the yangtze river is an edible economic fish previous studies have proven that rock carp have the worst tolerance to tdgs among the tested species wang et al 2020 therefore here we adopted existing experimental data on the adverse effects of tdgs on juvenile rock carp as a reference huang 2010 investigated the effects of tdgs on acute lethality and avoidance responses in juvenile rock carp the body lengths of which were 3 9 5 0 cm with body weights of 0 26 0 53 g the juvenile rock carp were exposed to water at different tdg saturation levels 100 115 120 125 130 135 140 and 145 and with a depth of 0 20 m at 25 c the experiments showed that juvenile rock carp mortality occurred only at tdg saturation levels equal to or greater than 120 the mortality rates of juvenile rock carp exposed to different tdg saturation levels over time are shown in fig 3 the median lethal time lt 50 which refers to the time at which fish mortality reaches 50 at a specific tdgs level is often used to describe the tolerance of fish to tdgs in huang s 2010 experiment the lt 50 values of juvenile rock carp at 120 125 130 135 140 and 145 tdg saturation levels were 14 h 9 9 h 4 8 h 3 2 h 1 2 h and 0 8 h respectively 2 3 theoretical analysis 2 3 1 mortality risk degree assessment model of fish exposed to unsteady tdgs generally the lt 50 index is used to evaluate the tolerance of fish to steady tdgs conditions fish species with longer lt 50 values are considered to have higher tolerances taking lt 50 as a reference a mortality risk degree evaluation model of fish exposed to unsteady tdgs levels was developed to preliminarily evaluate the mortality risk degree of fish when exposed to unsteady tdgs conditions it was assumed that if the duration over which the tdg saturation dropped from an initial level to a certain level was shorter than the lt 50 value at a given saturation level the fish group was safe under these conditions otherwise the conditions were dangerous when tdg saturation changes with time it is difficult to determine the exact state of the fish group analyzed herein the risk probability and risk index were defined to describe the mortality risk degree of fish damaged by tdgs risk probability the ratio between the duration over which tdg drops from initial saturation to a certain saturation t g h and the lt 50 g at this tdg saturation is defined as the risk probability rp as shown in eq 1 1 r p t g l t 50 g when 0 rp 0 5 it indicates a low mortality risk state 0 5 rp 1 indicates a medium mortality risk state and rp 1 indicates a high mortality risk state risk index based on existing studies most fish are expected to suffer from gbd or even death when the tdg saturation level is above 120 we assume that when the state of a fish group reaches the medium risk level or above the exposure time after that is considered the risk time for a given condition the proportion of the risk time to the total dissipation time the time over which tdg saturation drops from its initial state to 120 is defined as the risk index as shown in eq 2 2 r i t r i s k t t o t a l the risk index can be used to represent the mortality risk degree of fish when exposed to tdgs the higher the risk index the more dangerous the conditions risk index values equal to 0 and 1 indicate safety and danger for the fish groups respectively 2 3 2 mortality rate calculation model under unsteady tdgs levels through statistical analyses of a large number of experimental data xue 2020 studied the relation between the mortality rate and damage degree of fish subjected to steady tdgs here combined with a supersaturated tdg dissipation model we extended xue s research 2020 to the situation in which the tdg saturation level in water gradually decreases over time supersaturated tdg dissipation model pickett et al 2004 proposed that the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg follows first order kinetics existing field observation data feng et al 2014 kamal et al 2016 and experimental data shen et al 2014 ou et al 2016 have also proven the rationality of utilizing first order kinetics to fit the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg the first order kinetic equation can be expressed as follows 3 g g e q g 0 g e q e k t where t h represents the dissipation time g represents the tdg saturation level at time t g 0 represents the initial tdg saturation level g eq represents the equilibrium tdg saturation level generally equal to 100 and k h 1 represents the dissipation coefficient development of the mortality rate calculation model based on the graphic method described by miller and tainter according to shetty and alwar 2007 and according to a probit table table 2 the mortality rate was converted into a probability unit taking the logarithm of the exposure time as the independent variable and the probability unit as the dependent variable a fitting linear expression was obtained as shown in eq 4 4 p r g l o g 10 t j g where p is the probability unit t is the exposure time h r g is the slope of the regression line j g is the intercept of the regression line and g is the tdg saturation level eq 4 can be converted into the following expression 5 p l o g 10 t r g 10 j g d t r 10 j is defined as representing the damage degree to fish subjected to tdgs this means that the mortality rate is related to the damage degree namely when the damage degree reaches d the probability unit reaches p at the end of the first stage of exposure i e at t 1 the damage degree is represented as follows 6 d 1 t 1 r g 1 10 j g 1 during the second stage of exposure i e from t 1 to t 2 the initial damage degree is d 1 and the end damage degree is d 2 we assume that the initial damage degree d 1 is equivalent to the damage degree after following the exposure time of t e 2 to the second stage environment conditions 7 d 1 t 1 r g 1 10 j g 1 t e 2 r g 2 10 j g 2 8 t e 2 d 1 10 j g 2 1 r g 2 at the end of the second exposure stage the cumulative damage degree is equivalent to the damage degree after exposure time of t e 2 t 2 t 1 to the second stage environmental conditions therefore at the moment of t 2 the damage degree is calculated as follows 9 d 2 t e t 2 t 1 r g 2 10 j g 2 at the moment of ti i 1 the damage degree is calculated as follows 10 d i t e i t i t i 1 r g i 10 j g i 11 t e i d i 1 10 j g i 1 r g i when t is equal to 0 the following expression is satisfied 12 d 0 0 according to eq 3 when the tdg saturation level drops to gi 1 the exposure time is calculated as follows 13 t i 1 ln g 0 100 g i 1 100 k when the tdg saturation level drops to gi the exposure time is calculated as follows 14 t i ln g 0 100 g i 100 k we assume that if δ g g i g i 1 is small during this period the damage degree is approximately equivalent to that of fish exposed to a tdg saturation level of g i 1 g i 2 for a period of t i t i 1 according to eq 10 at the moment of t i the damage degree is calculated as follows 15 d i t e i t i t i 1 r g i 1 g i 2 10 j g i 1 g i 2 the probability unit is represented as follows 16 p i l o g 10 d i according to table 2 the mortality rate can be obtained at the moment of t i 3 results and discussion 3 1 ac adsorption experiment results for supersaturated tdg dissipation the supersaturated tdg dissipation processes for all experimental cases are presented in fig 4 the tdg saturation level gradually decreased over time comparisons between cases without and with added ac indicated that adding ac to water could effectively promote the dissipation of supersaturated tdg the promotion effects increased with increasing specific surface area and dosage of the added ac as previous research has shown in water without added ac supersaturated tdg was mainly dissipated through gas liquid mass transfer and inner dissipation while in water with added ac ac adsorption occurred and also contributed to supersaturated tdg dissipation therefore in our view for the same initial tdg saturation the reduction in tdg saturation caused by the adsorption effect of ac was the tdg saturation difference δg between the case without added ac and the case with added ac the variations in δg over time are shown in fig 5 it can be seen that δg increased gradually over time in all cases indicating that ac kept absorbing tdg during the whole process and then promoted the supersaturated tdg dissipation process to quantitatively analyse the dissipation rate of supersaturated tdg under different situations the first order kinetic equation eq 3 was adopted to fit the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg under different situations and the coefficients of determination r2 of all experimental cases were greater than 0 96 indicating a high goodness of fit between the first order kinetic equation and the experimental data the obtained dissipation coefficients are shown in fig 6 fig 6 shows the relations among the dissipation coefficient initial tdg saturation level ac specific surface area and ac dosage for the cases without added ac fig 6 a the dissipation coefficient showed a slight upward trend with an increasing initial tdg saturation level for the cases with added ac fig 6 b the relation curve between the dissipation coefficient and the initial tdg saturation level completely changed and showed a downward trend with an increasing initial tdg saturation level compared with the cases under the same initial tdg saturation condition the dissipation coefficients of case 7 to case 12 increased by 387 0 314 4 265 8 240 4 212 0 and 182 1 respectively after 4 0 kg of coconut shell based ac was added these results indicate that adding ac to water can promote the dissipation process of supersaturated tdg as shown in fig 6 c d it is apparent that this promotion effect increased along with the specific surface area and dosage of the added ac 3 2 application of the mortality risk degree assessment model the lt 50 values of juvenile rock carp in huang s 2010 experiment were combined with the supersaturated tdg dissipation results of the ac adsorption experiment and eq 1 was used to calculate the results of the rps derived for different cases under different experimental periods as shown in fig 7 for cases without added ac especially in case 5 g 0 145 0 without added ac and case 6 g 0 150 0 without added ac rock carp were almost always at high mortality risks the maximum rp reached 3 11 which occurred when the tdg saturation level dropped from 150 to 140 in case 6 when ac was added the rps were significantly reduced comparing case 6 and case 12 g 0 150 0 4 0 kg cs ac the rp dropped from 1 09 to 0 39 1 17 to 0 42 1 78 to 0 63 1 86 to 0 66 3 11 to 1 10 and 2 20 to 0 78 during the periods when the tdg saturation level dropped from 150 to 120 125 130 135 140 and 145 respectively the maximum rp reduction degree reached approximately 80 in case 7 g 0 125 0 4 0 kg cs ac by comparing cases with initial tdg saturation levels of 140 case 4 case 10 and case 13 to case 22 it can be seen that the rps decreased as the specific surface area and dosage of the added ac increased especially in case 10 case 13 to case 15 and case 19 to case 22 in which the rock carp were in low mortality risk states at all times based on the results of the rps the risk index results of all cases were calculated using eq 2 and are shown in fig 7 for cases without added ac the risk index values were relatively high especially for cases in which the initial tdg saturation level was greater than or equal to 135 under these conditions the risk indices were all equal to 1 meaning that the rock carp group was in danger after adding ac the risk index values were significantly reduced by comparing case 3 with case 9 case 4 with case 10 case 13 with case 15 and case 19 with case 22 it can be seen that the state of the rock carp changed from dangerous danger to safe the above analyses indicate that the addition of ac can help alleviate the mortality risk degree of the fish groups suffering from tdgs conditions 3 3 application of the mortality rate calculation model combining the mortality rate calculation model developed in section 2 3 2 and the data obtained from huang s 2010 experiments the mortality rates of juvenile rock carp under the experimental conditions described in this paper were predicted according to fig 3 and eq 4 the probability unit and exposure time equations at different tdg saturation levels were obtained as shown in table 3 by comparing and analysing the relations among g r and j it can be seen that the relationship between r and g and the relationship between j and g can be fitted by polynomials two equations can be obtained 17 r 0 0057 g 100 2 0 45 g 100 10 68 18 j 0 0059 g 100 2 0 57 g 100 8 60 by combining eq 13 to eq 16 and table 2 and taking the value of δ g as 0 1 the mortality rate process for juvenile rock carp exposed to the different conditions described in the ac adsorption experiment can be obtained as shown in fig 8 the mortality rate gradually increased with exposure time as shown in fig 8 a the mortality rate increased faster with increasing initial tdg saturation levels the final mortality rate showed a monotonically increasing trend with the initial tdg saturation level with the addition of 4 0 kg of cs ac the mortality exposure time curves in fig 8 b showed the same trend as those in fig 8 a while the final mortality rate was greatly reduced for the same initial tdg saturation comparing case 1 to case 6 the final mortality rates obtained under case 7 to case 12 were reduced by 6 2 39 9 51 3 38 1 26 9 and 17 4 respectively these results suggest that the addition of ac is effective in reducing fish mortality and that this mitigation effect increases with the specific surface area fig 8 c and dosage of the added ac fig 8 d 3 4 analysis of the required ac mass according to the calculation results of the final mortality rate m f it can be concluded that both the addition of more ac and the use of ac with a larger specific surface area can lower the final mortality rate additionally the initial tdg saturation can also affect the final mortality rate thus the following discussion established the quantitative relations among the final mortality rate m f specific surface area s m2 g dosage of ac m kg and initial tdg saturation g 0 the ac specific surface area and dosage were combined into a comprehensive index as shown in eq 19 this factor was defined as the areal content of ac per unit volume of water 19 a a c m s v 1000 where a ac is the areal content of ac per unit volume of water m 1 m is the ac dosage kg s is the ac specific surface area m2 g and v is the water volume m3 by analysing the experimental data it is clear that m f is exponentially related to a ac and follows a power function with g 0 considering all these results the following expression can be obtained 20 m f α g 0 g e q β e λ a a c where α β and λ are constants and can be determined through optimal fitting utilizing the experimental data to carry out optimal fitting the fitting results of α β and λ were found to be 0 0008 3 117 and 3 24 10 8 respectively and the multiple correction coefficient r was 0 93 fig 9 shows a comparison of m f between the values calculated using eq 20 and the experiment values it is clear that most of the calculated values are very close to the experimental values meaning that eq 20 can be used to estimate the final mortality thus the harvested mass of fish can be estimated as follows 21 m h 1 m f 100 m 1 0 0008 g 0 g e q 3 117 e 3 24 10 8 a a c 100 m thus the required ac mass can be estimated as follows 22 m ln 1 m h m 100 0 0008 g 0 g 3 117 3 24 s v 10 5 where m h is the harvested mass of the fish kg and m is the feeding mass of the fish kg 4 conclusion in this paper an activated adsorption experiment for supersaturated tdg was carried out combined with huang s 2010 experimental data methods for quantitatively evaluating the mitigation effect of the proposed supersaturated tdg dissipation promotion measures on the exposure risk of the fish to tdgs were established the main conclusions can be summarised as follows adding ac to water effectively accelerated the dissipation of supersaturated tdg and the dissipation coefficient increased by a maximum of 387 0 in case 7 g 0 120 0 using 4 0 kg coconut shell based ac the dissipation coefficient increased with the specific surface area and dosage of the added ac and decreased as the initial tdg saturation level decreased a mortality risk degree evaluation model of fish exposed to unsteady tdgs levels was developed the results of the model application indicated that the addition of ac could help alleviate the mortality risk of fish groups suffering from tdgs in comparison with cases without added ac the maximum risk probability reduction degree reached 79 5 in case 7 g 0 125 0 4 0 kg cs ac the risk index which represents the damage induced by tdgs to the fish group decreased as the specific surface area and dosage of the added ac increased a mortality rate calculation model was developed under the condition that tdg saturation gradually decreased the mortality rate of the fish group with added ac was demonstrated to be lower than that of the fish group without added ac and the final mortality rate was reduced by a maximum of 51 3 in case 9 g 0 135 0 4 0 kg cs ac the final mortality rate decreased as the specific surface area and dosage of the added ac increased an equation for the required ac mass was established and could be used to preliminarily calculate the required ac mass for a given harvested mass of fish credit

calculation u was set as 3 74 ev 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli polishes the surface oxides of pyrite pyrite samples have coatings of fe oxides on their surfaces and microbes may polish this oxidative layer of pyrite in aquatic environments fig 1 a as shown in figs 1b 1c and s1 fe s and o were present in o pyrite with a lattice spacing of 0 229 nm which is ascribed to fe2o3 the od600 values representing the bacterial density of e coli with and without pyrite were 1 08 and 1 12 at 10 h respectively which implies that the effects of pyrite on the viability and growth of e coli were not obvious after the e coli treatment interlayer spacings of 0 221 and 0 196 nm were observed in the bp pyrite fig 1d 1e which were attributed to the 211 and 220 facets of fes2 respectively bp pyrite mainly showed 2p fes2 instead of fe oxides indicating that the fe oxides were reduced by e coli compared with o pyrite the fe oxide content in bp pyrite was lower lu et al 2018 which confirms that the oxidative layer was reduced by e coli in bp pyrite fig 2 a b and table s1 the two peaks of the raman spectra that were attributed to the fe2o3 in o pyrite were blueshifted to 210 and 270 cm 1 which indicates that o pyrite was covered with fe oxides and had holes or vacancy defects fig 2c however the main peaks at 335 and 365 cm 1 ascribed to fes2 alone were observed in bp pyrite which confirms the disappearance of fe2o3 after polishing by e coli xas was used to detect the local structures of heavy metals in complex solid samples xas spectroscopy is very sensitive to the oxidation states and electronic structures of selected atoms and to the coordination species and geometries around them the lcf technique of xanes was applied to discriminate and quantify the main components of o pyrite and bp pyrite the fitting results of the first derivative are shown in figs 2d and s2 the main components in o pyrite were fes2 82 60 and fe oxides e g feo fe2o3 and fe3o4 accounting for 6 00 8 70 and 2 70 respectively the r factor was 0 02 in bp pyrite the r factor was 0 18 the fe oxides contained feo 10 20 and fe2o3 0 20 fig s2 although bp pyrite had a basically consistent principal fe xanes spectrum signal with o pyrite table s2 bp pyrite had a weaker fe s peak than o pyrite fig 2e these results indicate that fe atoms possessed a smaller coordination number in bp pyrite on average moreover the signal in the vertical coordinate range of o pyrite was slightly shifted to the left of the signal corresponding to bp pyrite denoting the less coordinated elements e g fe o because the ratio of fe o on the sample was much smaller than that of fe s fig 2f bia et al 2017 the present work emphasized that the presence of e coli removed the widespread oxidative layer of pyrite in the aquatic environment which provides the chemical foundation for the following studies 3 2 reducibility of the extracellular polymeric substance polishes the pyrite the redox reaction usually occurs in eps xiao et al 2017 and may be responsible for the oxidative layer polishing of o pyrite eps pyrite has noticeably fewer o atoms which indicates the reduction of fe oxides due to the presence of eps figs 3 a and s3 to acquire more details about the characterization of eps and p eps eem and parafac analyses were conducted fig 3b and c as shown in fig s4 c1 was related to soluble microbial by product like c2 to protein like and c3 to humic like chen et al 2003 yu et al 2019 the fmax of components 1 and 2 decreased significantly after the biopolishing of pyrite table s3 implying that these components participated in the biopolishing of pyrite eps pyrite resulted in esr spectra similar to those of bp pyrite which indicates the role of eps in the biological polishing of o pyrite fig 3d f the band of the ftir spectra at 1150 1280 cm 1 was related to the stretching of oh in phenols and the bands at 1000 1100 and 1120 cm 1 were associated with the stretching of c oh and c o c in saccharides respectively fig 3g these bands weakened after the reaction of eps with o pyrite orange line supporting that reducing saccharide and phenolic structures were involved in the reaction furthermore the saccharide contents were quantified and the contents in eps and p eps were 133 32 and 70 39 mg g 1 respectively fig 3h these results suggested that the saccharides in the eps participated in the reduction of fe oxides because the electron donor or acceptor between bacteria and minerals is exchangeable the removal of the pyrite oxidative layer is determined by the system conditions kato et al 2012 shi et al 2016 furthermore shewanella oneidensis mr 1 s oneidensis mr 1 staphylococcus aureus s aureus and thiobacillus ferrooxidans t ferrooxidans were selected for the pyrite polishing experiments under the same conditions as e coli the elemental distributions of s and fe were enriched on the surface and the oxidized portion of the surface was not obvious after the polishing of s oneidensis mr 1 s aureus and t ferrooxidans confirming that different bacteria similarly polished the pyrite figs s5 s7 the occurrence of the three peaks attributed to fes2 in tf pyrite reaction of pyrite by t ferrooxidans in the raman spectrum agreed with the disappearance of fe oxides after polishing by t ferrooxidans fig s8a esr spectra of tf pyrite were measured and compared with o pyrite and bp pyrite in fig s8b d tf pyrite exhibited similar esr spectra to those of bp pyrite confirming biopolishing it is well known that t ferrooxidans catalyzes the oxidation of ferrous sulfate to regenerate ferric sulfate here the eps of bacteria participated in the reduction of pyrite as evidenced in fig 3 rather than the bacteria given the ubiquitous distribution of eps in natural environments eps deserve much attention because they polish mineral oxides moreover the polishing of oxidized pyrite may significantly affect the photochemical activity due to the removal of fe oxides as verified below 3 3 disappearance of oxygen vacancies decreases photochemical activity the element vacancies and photochemical reactions of pyrite were studied to explore the effect of mineral transformation as shown in fig 4 a o pyrite showed a strong xps band of oxygen adjacent to the vacancies at 531 1 ev and the strong esr spectral signal at a g factor of 2 003 confirmed the oxygen vacancies in contrast bp pyrite presented a signal at a g factor of 2 002 as sulfur vacancies the oxygen vacancies regulated the atomic arrangement and charge density distribution of transition metal compounds and were recognized as the active sites in various catalytic reactions tang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 although sulfur vacancy defects presented adsorption and catalysis capacities nguyen et al 2014 the oxygen vacancies in o pyrite presented noticeably stronger esr signals than the sulfide vacancies fig 4a and b the presence of oxygen vacancies obviously enhanced the density of states dos at the conduction band cb edge fig 4c and s9 and made o pyrite have a narrower band gap than bp pyrite the measured band gaps of o pyrite and bp pyrite were 0 84 and 0 90 ev respectively fig 4d o pyrite had a much higher photocurrent than bp pyrite fig 4e thus fewer charge carriers can be generated in bp pyrite the exact band edge positions of o pyrite and bp pyrite were investigated by mott schottky plots the flat band potentials of o pyrite and bp pyrite were determined by extrapolating to c 2 0 at frequencies of 1000 hz the c 2 in vertical coordinates was a function of electrochemical potentials where the capacitance c was obtained from the impedance measurement as shown in fig 4f the positive slopes of both o pyrite and bp pyrite in the mott schottky curve all indicated n type semiconductor characteristics yi et al 2019 the flat band potentials of o pyrite and bp pyrite were 0 23 v and 0 42 v versus ag agcl which were equal to 0 38 v and 0 19 v versus the normal hydrogen electrode nhe respectively the value of the flat potentials was approximately that of cb li et al 2017 thus the cb edge potentials of o pyrite and bp pyrite were 0 38 ev and 0 19 ev respectively the valence band vb edge potentials of o pyrite and bp pyrite were obtained from the equation e v b e c b e g thus the vb edge potentials of o pyrite and bp pyrite were 1 24 ev and 1 09 ev respectively in addition the calculated carrier densities were approximately 12 95 1022 and 7 60 1022 cm 3 for o pyrite and bp pyrite respectively these findings demonstrate the reduced photochemical activity of bp pyrite due to the disappearance of oxygen vacancies caused by biopolishing the roles of vacancies in the chemical activity of pyrite have been ignored zhang et al 2018 biopolishing may affect the decomposition of organic matter in water due to the removal of oxygen vacancies and a decrease in photochemical activity in various biological and photochemical processes hansel et al 2021 natural minerals can produce ros including h2o2 and oh georgiou et al 2015 xu et al 2019 ros are reactive toward carbon functional groups and react with a wide range of organic compounds including carbohydrates and aliphatic compounds waggoner et al 2017 the interaction between organic matter and ros may form low molecular weight organic acids that completely oxidize to co2 as shown in table s4 the initiation of dissolved oxygen do was approximately 6 50 mg l 1 in water stable do concentration values were observed under aerobic conditions maintained above 6 00 mg l 1 during 21 days of degradation in contrast the do in the water was nearly exhausted after degradation under anaerobic conditions indicating that photodegradation consumed oxygen in the water o pyrite generated more electrons than bp pyrite under 20 min of xe lamp irradiation fig 5 a and s10a as shown in fig 5b oh in bp pyrite accounted for only 19 3 of those in o pyrite and no superoxide radical signal was observed in the spectrum of bp pyrite fig 5c according to the results of esr spectra and lcf fitting results of fe k edge xafs fe oxides played an important role in the production of oh in this work for oxidized pyrite oh may generate from the processes mediated by surface adsorbed ferrous ions sulfur deficient sites and iron containing coating on the pyrite surface borda et al 2003 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2022 as in the previous studies zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2022 the surface absorbed fe ii was the main source of oh in neutral environment and fe oxides on pyrite mediated an electron transfer process and contributed to oh generation the conduction band potential of o pyrite was more positive than the potential for single electron reduction of o2 0 33 v which cannot generate superoxide radicals nosaka et al 2017 in addition o pyrite showed an feso4 peak in the xps spectra indicating the presence of fe2 in solution fe2 can capture o2 and then convert to o2 and fe3 leading to the production of pyrite superoxide radicals ji et al 2021 no signals corresponding to singlet oxygen radicals 1o2 were observed for either pyrite sample figs s10 and s11 in the cv scans of o pyrite and bp pyrite the corresponding peaks occurred at 0 240 and 0 113 ma fig 5d and e respectively which confirms the decreased electron accepting capacity of bp pyrite as indicated by the eis results bp pyrite had a higher electrochemical impedance and a lower electron transport capacity than o pyrite fig 5f plas spectrometry is a technique for studying the defects of solids and measuring the lifetime of the positron which can provide information about the types and relative concentrations of defects or vacancies even at the ppm level the pals of o pyrite and bp pyrite yield three lifetime components table s5 τ1 and τ2 significantly decreased from 127 1 and 323 3 ps for o pyrite to 133 5 and 349 3 ps for bp pyrite respectively τ1 was relative to annihilate in a single vacancy and nondefective place which confirms fewer defects after reaction by e coli τ2 was captured by the vacancy group and grain boundary defects moreover the τ2 relative intensities i2 decreased from 39 50 to 36 49 which indicates that grain boundary defects played an important role in o pyrite fig 5g describes the changes in chemical properties between o pyrite and bp pyrite bp pyrite showed lower chemical activity than o pyrite due to fewer oxygen vacancies grain boundary defects and hydroxyl radicals mineral derived ros are undeniably key reactants in the oxidation and transformation of organic matter kleber et al 2021 and the passivated chemical activity and ros of pyrite may inhibit the decomposition of organic matter in water as proven below 3 4 biopolishing suppresses the decomposition of organic matters the decomposition of reed leaf and pseudorasbora parva tissue as typical plant and animal organic matter were investigated in aquatic environments respectively reed leaf and pseudorasbora parva had similar initial dry weight before degradation table s6 after 21 days of degradation the final dry weight was different for each group the o pyrite group exhibited a lower final quality and higher degradation rate than the bp pyrite group for both reed leaf and pseudorasbora parva demonstrating that biopolishing suppressed dom degradation van krevelen diagrams were generated from the characteristic element ratios to help distinguish major compound classes in samples xu et al 2020 based on the o c and h c element ratios the molecules were grouped into seven compound classes lipids aliphatic proteins carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons lignins cram like structures tannins and aromatic structures fig 6 a f as shown in fig 6g we found that samples mainly contained cho chno chos and chons compounds indicating that they were the major dom subcategories in all samples the abundances of the major subcategories of samples were similar cho chno chos chons ft icr ms is a semiquantitative technique in dom ionization efficiency because of sample matrix effects xu et al 2020 the molecular composition differences between samples are illustrated more clearly in fig 6h the largest proportions of substances in reed leaf group and pseudorasbora parva group were lignins cram like structures and lipids respectively for the reed leaf samples the lignin cram like structures showed the highest proportion o pyrite 57 19 bp pyrite 55 58 and the proportions of lipids compounds were 2 06 and 3 19 in the o pyrite and bp pyrite groups respectively for the pseudorasbora parva samples the lipids showed the highest proportion o pyrite 53 63 bp pyrite 65 38 and the proportions of lignin cram like structures were 26 31 and 20 20 in the o pyrite and bp pyrite groups respectively to further visualize dom quality differences the inter sample ranking was calculated and visualized in fig s13 the first ranks of reed leaf and pseudorasbora parva dom were dominated by lignins cram like structures and lipids aliphatic components respectively for the control group of reed leaf the first rank mainly in cho and chno were dominated by lignins cram like structures in contrast the first ranks in cho and chos for o pyrite and bp pyrite groups were dominated by lipids aliphatic components for the control group of pseudorasbora parva the first rank was mainly chno and chnos in contrast the first ranks in o pyrite and bp pyrite groups were cho and chos the inter sample rankings analysis put insight to the dom change indicating that lignin cram like compounds and dissolved organic nitrogen compounds were facile to degradation due to the mineral photochemical reactions the abundances of the subcategories can be clearly seen in each group but the abundances of subcategories among different groups cannot be clearly distinguished especially in reed leaf groups fig 6g furthermore the inter sample ranking of reed leaf was calculated and ranks were merged as follows rank 1 red rank 2 green and rank 3 black in van krevelen diagrams the chos and chnos components in o pyrite were more than that in control and bp pyrite groups fig s14 in addition the double bond equivalent dbe refers to the total number of double bonds and aliphatic rings that exist in a molecule and a higher dbe indicates less saturation d andrilli et al 2013 the mineral added groups had a higher h c and lower dbe which implied that the dom of the mineral added group was mainly composed of more saturated compounds the sorption of dom components and mineral surface chemistry contribute to the distribution and fate of organic matter chen et al 2022 organic matter can form strong chemical bonds with minerals and is physically protected in microaggregates or coprecipitates in the soil therefore stearic acid and condensed tannins were used as model organic matter compounds that represented lipids compounds and lignin cram like substances to explore organic matter interactions with pyrite using dft calculations the sorption of dom components and mineral surface chemistry can explain the distribution and fate of organic matter chen et al 2022 stearic acid and condensed tannins were adsorbed on the surface of pyrite though fe o bonding figs s12 and such enhanced adsorption is a prerequisite for degradation lin et al 2020 as shown in fig 6i condensed tannins had the highest adsorption capacity with bp pyrite and the adsorption of stearic acid on o pyrite was approximately 1 4 fold higher than that on bp pyrite for aromatic compounds photodegradation is the most important process that affects the dom aromaticity since oxidized aromatic compounds were preferentially removed moreover mineral groups dom had lower aromatic properties than control group due to the mineral photochemical properties unsaturated hydrogens are vulnerable to photodegradation xu et al 2020 and their proportions were low in each sample carbohydrates was not sensitive to photodegradation yang et al 2022 and their proportions in mineral groups were consistent with control group previous researchers proposed that lignin cram like compounds were chemically stable but could be photochemically degraded song et al 2020 and lipids and aliphatic proteins tend to persist in the presence of light without microbes song et al 2019 and their decomposition is attributed to mineral adsorption whereas both mineral adsorption and photochemical reactions were important in the present work in addition eem and parafac analyses were used to acquire more details about the contributions of oh and o2 to degradation as shown in fig s15 c1 and c4 were related to humic like c2 to protein like and c3 to fulvic like chen et al 2003 fulvic acid is a kind of organic acid with a small molecular weight after oh was captured the proportion of fulvic like c3 decreased slightly while the proportion of humic like c1 c4 and protein like c2 increased indicating that oh was important for the degradation of humic like and protein like compounds after capturing o2 there was no effect on the degradation of protein like but the proportion of humic like increased indicating that o2 had an effect on the degradation of humic like ros capture experiments showed that oh was more effective for degradation than o2 table s7 uv visible absorption spectra extracted information about dom properties the spectral slope ratio sr 275 295 nm slope 350 400 nm slope presented a negative relationship with the dom molecular weight helms et al 2008 the smallest sr was observed under dark conditions reflecting the role of light in dom degradation moreover c1 and c4 were related to humic like c2 to protein like and c3 to fulvic like chen et al 2003 fig s13 the proportion of humic like was higher under both anaerobic and dark conditions than under aerobic conditions indicating that light and aerobic conditions were more conducive to degradation of humic like in this work in addition anaerobic conditions had a more obvious degradation than dark conditions due to the do in water table s8 the decomposition of organic matter is a major determinant of carbon and nutrient cycling in ecosystems du et al 2020 stone et al 2021 biopolishing inhibited the decomposition of organic matter which indicates that adsorption and photochemical properties are two important factors that alter dom compositions in aquatic environments 4 conclusion eps widely exists in aquatic environments and is crucial to the fate of minerals and organic matter in waters our results provide direct evidence at the nano to atom nanoscale that saccharides and phenolic compounds in extracellular polymeric substances help biopolish the surface oxidation of pyrite via electron transfer biopolishing influenced adsorption and ros production and resulted in low photochemical reactivity fig 7 there was evidence to suggest that adsorption and photochemical properties are important for the decomposition of tannins aliphatic compounds and lignin cram like substances therefore the interaction between minerals and microbes affected the fate of carbon inhibited the decomposition of organic matter and altered the dom composition the interactions among dom mineral transformation and microbes provide an in depth understanding of carbon fate in waters author

15449,photochemical reactions that widely occur in aquatic environments play important roles in carbon fate e g carbon conversion and storage from organic matter in ecosystems aquatic microbes and natural minerals further regulate carbon fate but the processes and mechanisms remain largely unknown herein the interaction between escherichia coli and pyrite and its influence on the fate of carbon in water were investigated at the microscopic scale and molecular level the results showed that saccharides and phenolic compounds in microbial extracellular polymeric substances helped remove pyrite surface oxides via electron transfer after the removal of surface oxides on pyrite the photochemical properties under visible light irradiation were significantly decreased such as reactive oxygen species and electron transfer capacity unlike the well accepted theory of minerals protecting organic matter in the soil the organic matter adsorbed on minerals preferred degradation due to the enhanced photochemical reactions in water in contrast the minerals transformed by microbes suppressed the decomposition of organic matter due to the passivation of the chemical structure and activity these results highlight the significance of mineral chemical activity on organic matter regulated by microbes and provide insights into organic matter conversion in water graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords extracellular polymeric substance organic matter photochemical activity dom microbe data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction photochemical reactions widely occur in aquatic environments and they play an important role in matter circulation in ecosystems due to their excellent photoelectronic conversion capacity the oxidation of natural minerals can generate many reactive oxide species ros such as hydroxyl radicals oh and superoxide anions o2 which are active in advanced oxidation reactions in aqueous solution feng et al 2019 pan et

liu et al 2021 wu et al 2016 pyrite oxidation is widely accepted in both subaqueous conditions and mine surfaces it drives the transformation of sulfur iron and oxygen gu et al 2020 for photochemical

0 88 pg ch4 yr 1 delsontro et al 2018 rosentreter et al 2021 however the roles of the oxidation of natural minerals e g pyrite and photochemical activity in the transformation of organic matter remain largely unknown in aquatic environments microbes with minerals present a high capacity to mediate element cycles by electron transfer bryce et al 2018 kemeny et al 2021 electrons can be transferred from microbes to minerals and vice versa the electronic interplay between microbes and minerals links the redox transformation of metal ions in minerals and the oxidation of organic carbon compounds doetterl et al 2018 kracher et al 2016 shi et al 2016 xiao et al 2017 extracellular polymeric substances eps which are coated on the surfaces of microbes are ubiquitous in aquatic environments and are composed of polysaccharides proteins lipids and other small molecules vo et al 2020 eps can store electrochemically active substances and assist in direct electron transfer borole et al 2011 xiao et al 2017 eps may transfer electrons to the mineral surface and then affect mineral chemistry dissolved organic matter dom is considered a large pool of organic matter in a variety of waters mostofa et al 2013 some dom comes into contact with minerals and undergoes transformations in the carbon cycle kleber et al 2021 consequently the interactions between dom and mineral phases have attracted much attention for example studies on soil organic matter sediment organic matter and particulate organic matter have been performed on minerals chen et al 2020 du et al 2021 walch et al 2022 in addition minerals make up a pivotal and sensitive fraction of the organic matter input and output qin et al 2021 samson et al 2020 due to the influence of microbes changes in the physical and chemical properties of minerals also significantly affect the fate of carbon e g dom in aquatic environments ma et al 2020 in the present work it is hypothesized that microbes may affect the photochemical properties of minerals and the fate e g the stability of dom and carbon emissions of carbon in aquatic environments widely distributed escherichia coli e coli plays a crucial role in ecosystems especially in material cycling gu et al 2021 kallenbach et al 2016 weathering of pyrite a reactive sulfide mineral can produce iron redox cycling and organic and inorganic radicals and decarboxylation can occur kleber et al 2021 its surface is mostly oxidized and it influences the iron sulfur oxygen and carbon cycles in the natural environment gu et al 2020 konhauser et al 2011 rickard et al 2007 here the system of e coli and pyrite was used as an example to study the microbial effects on mineral photochemical properties in aquatic ecosystems electron microscopy was used to observe the changes

oxygen and biopolished pyrite bp pyrite a biotransformation of pyrite by e coli given the complex molecular composition of dom fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms was used to investigate the change in organic matter at the molecular level due to the sorption and oxidation of o pyrite and bp pyrite the present work provides insights into the carbon cycles in water via reactions among microbes minerals and organic matter 2 materials and methods 2 1 pyrite preparation gram negative e coli atcc 25922 miaoling china was cultured on lysogeny broth lb medium

approximately 500 mg dry weight for follow up experiments the intestinal canal of pseudorasbora parva was removed to eliminate the effects of intestinal flora subsequently reed leaf and pseudorasbora parva were soaked in 75 alcohol for 5 min and washed using sterile water and this step was repeated three times o pyrite or bp pyrite 100 mg l 1 was added to conical flasks and anaerobic flasks with plant or animal tissues no minerals were added to the flasks as a control group the anaerobic flasks were purged with nitrogen for 60 s to remove the air each experiment contained triplicate samples for the analysis of the contribution of oh and o2 to degradation 20 mm tertiary butyl alcohol tba and 0 5 mm p benzoquinone p bzq were added to the experiments respectively refill every 7 days ling et al 2022 the prepared flasks were placed in an incubator for the degradation experiment at 25 c for 21 days 2 10 ft icr ms analysis the decomposed organic matter was filtered and collected using 0 45 μm glass fiber membranes these samples were acidified with hydrochloric acid to ph 2 the bond elut ppl solid phase extraction cartridges 500 mg 5 ml agilent usa were rinsed with 5 ml of methanol and milli q water before use dittmar et al 2008 for dom adsorption the samples were passed through cartridges at a flow rate of 1 ml min 1 the cartridges were rinsed using 0 01 m hcl to remove salts the residual chloride ions in the cartridges were eluted with milli q water and dried by a nitrogen stream dom samples were eluted with chromatographic grade methanol and stored at 20 c before ms analysis the dom samples were analyzed using a solarix 2xr ft icr ms instrument bruker daltonik gmbh bremen germany equipped with a 7 0 t refrigerated actively shielded superconducting magnet and an electrospray ionization esi source under negative ion mode with a 200 μl h 1 flow rate in the negative ion mode acidic functional groups that are preferentially ionized such as carboxylic acids are easily deprotonated compared with nitrogen containing compounds kujawinski 2002 therefore dom analysis was conducted using o c mapping the sampling concentrations during the ft icr ms analysis were kept the same for all dom samples by adding methanol the spectra were acquired over 256 scans with an ion flight time into the icr cell of 0 000750 s and an m z range of 150 1000 peak intensities were normalized to the sum of all signal intensities in each sample before applying a dataset detection limit where normalized intensities less than the smallest peak in the worst sample were not considered after the acquisition of ft icr ms measurements the raw datasets were analyzed using dataanalysis 5 0 software bruker daltonik gmbh germany composer sierra analytics usa software was used to assign the elemental compositions for all recalibrated peaks with a signal to noise ratio s n 4 using a mass allowance of 1 0 ppm the molecular formula limits were set to atom numbers of 12c 1 50

for a given data set from different samples herzsprung et al 2012 to calculate the inter sample ranks the dataset was sorted using the increasing molecular mass of the element components zhang et al 2019 according to the descriptions of previous researches herzsprung et al 2017 herzsprung et al 2012 kamjunke et al 2017 the ranks of the mass peak intensities were calculated for each sample in supplementary material 2 the ranks that the highest value received the first rank and the lowest value received the last rank were calculated then ranks were merged as follows rank 1 red rank 2 orange rank 3 green rank 4 blue rank 5 gray and rank 6 black in van krevelen diagrams 2 11 density functional theory calculations first principles were employed to perform all spin polarization density functional theory dft calculations within the generalized gradient approximation gga using the perdew burke ernzerhof pbe formulation the projected augmented wave paw potentials were chosen to describe the ionic cores and valence electrons were considered using a plane wave basis set with a kinetic energy cutoff of 400 ev partial occupancies of the kohn sham orbitals were allowed using the gaussian smearing method and a width of 0 05 ev the electronic energy was considered self consistent when the energy change was smaller than 10 5 ev a geometry optimization was considered convergent when the energy change was smaller than 0 06 ev å 1 the vacuum spacing in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the structure was 18 å brillouin zone integration was performed using 2 2 1 monkhorst pack k point sampling for a structure the interaction energies e were calculated as e e a d s u b e a d e s u b where e a d s u b e a d and e s u b are the total energies of the optimized adsorbate substrate system the adsorbate in the structure and the clean substrate respectively the fes2 110 surface and fe2o3 fes2 interface were established from the bulk structures for the fe 3d calculation u was set as 3 74 ev 3 results and discussion 3 1 e coli polishes the surface oxides of pyrite pyrite samples have coatings of fe oxides on their surfaces and microbes may polish this oxidative layer of pyrite in aquatic environments fig 1 a as shown in figs 1b 1c and s1 fe s and o were present in o pyrite with a lattice spacing of 0 229 nm which is ascribed to fe2o3 the od600 values representing the bacterial density of e coli with and without pyrite were 1 08 and 1 12 at 10 h respectively which implies that the effects of pyrite on the viability and growth of e coli were not obvious after the e coli treatment interlayer spacings of 0 221 and 0 196 nm were observed in the bp pyrite fig 1d 1e which were attributed to the 211 and 220 facets of fes2 respectively bp pyrite mainly showed 2p fes2 instead of fe oxides indicating that the fe oxides were reduced by e coli compared with o pyrite the fe oxide content in bp pyrite was lower lu et al 2018 which confirms that the oxidative layer was reduced by e coli in bp pyrite fig 2 a b and table s1 the two peaks of the raman spectra that were attributed to the fe2o3 in o pyrite were blueshifted to 210 and 270 cm 1 which indicates that o pyrite was covered with fe oxides and had holes or vacancy defects fig 2c however the main peaks at 335 and 365 cm 1 ascribed to fes2 alone were observed in bp pyrite which confirms the disappearance of fe2o3 after polishing by e coli xas was used to detect the local structures of heavy metals in complex solid samples xas spectroscopy is very sensitive to the oxidation states and electronic structures of selected atoms and to the coordination species and geometries around them the lcf technique of xanes was applied to discriminate and quantify the main components of o pyrite and bp pyrite the fitting results of the first derivative are shown in figs 2d and s2 the main components in o pyrite were fes2 82 60 and fe oxides e g feo fe2o3 and fe3o4 accounting for 6 00 8 70 and 2 70 respectively the r factor was 0 02 in bp pyrite the r factor was 0 18 the fe oxides contained feo 10 20 and fe2o3 0 20 fig s2 although bp pyrite had a basically consistent principal fe xanes spectrum signal with o pyrite table s2 bp pyrite had a weaker fe s peak than o pyrite fig 2e these results indicate that fe atoms possessed a smaller coordination number in bp pyrite on average moreover the signal in the vertical coordinate range of o pyrite was slightly shifted to the left of the signal corresponding to bp pyrite denoting the less coordinated elements e g fe o because the ratio of fe o on the sample was much smaller than that of fe s fig 2f bia et al 2017 the present work emphasized that the presence of e coli removed the widespread oxidative layer of pyrite in the aquatic environment which provides the chemical foundation for the following studies 3 2 reducibility of the extracellular polymeric substance polishes the pyrite the redox reaction usually occurs in eps xiao et al 2017 and may be responsible for the oxidative layer polishing of o pyrite eps pyrite has noticeably fewer o atoms which indicates the reduction of fe oxides due to the presence of eps figs 3 a and s3 to acquire more details about the characterization of eps and p eps eem and parafac analyses were conducted fig 3b and c as shown in fig s4 c1 was related to soluble microbial by product like c2 to protein like and c3 to humic like chen et al 2003 yu et al 2019 the fmax of components 1 and 2 decreased significantly after the biopolishing of pyrite table s3 implying that these components participated in the biopolishing of pyrite eps pyrite resulted in esr spectra similar to those of bp pyrite which indicates the role of eps in the biological polishing of o pyrite fig 3d f the band of the ftir spectra at 1150 1280 cm 1 was related to the stretching of oh in phenols and the bands at 1000 1100 and 1120 cm 1 were associated with the stretching of c oh and c o c in saccharides respectively fig 3g these bands weakened after the reaction of eps with o pyrite orange line supporting that reducing saccharide and phenolic structures were involved in the reaction furthermore the saccharide contents were quantified and the contents in eps and p eps were 133 32 and 70 39 mg g 1 respectively fig 3h these results suggested that the saccharides in the eps participated in the reduction of fe oxides because the electron donor or acceptor between bacteria and minerals is exchangeable the removal of the pyrite oxidative layer is determined by the system conditions kato et al 2012 shi et al 2016 furthermore shewanella oneidensis mr 1 s oneidensis mr 1 staphylococcus aureus s aureus and thiobacillus ferrooxidans t ferrooxidans were selected for the pyrite polishing experiments under the same conditions as e coli the elemental distributions of s and fe were enriched on the surface and the oxidized portion of the surface was not obvious after the polishing of s oneidensis mr 1 s aureus and t ferrooxidans confirming that different bacteria similarly polished the pyrite figs s5 s7 the occurrence of the three peaks attributed to fes2 in tf pyrite reaction of pyrite by t ferrooxidans in the raman spectrum agreed with the disappearance of fe oxides after polishing by t ferrooxidans fig s8a esr spectra of tf pyrite were measured and compared with o pyrite and bp pyrite in fig s8b d tf pyrite exhibited similar esr spectra to those of bp pyrite confirming biopolishing it is well known that t ferrooxidans catalyzes the oxidation of ferrous sulfate to regenerate ferric sulfate here the eps of bacteria participated in the reduction of pyrite as evidenced in fig 3 rather than the bacteria given the ubiquitous distribution of eps in natural environments eps deserve much attention because they polish mineral oxides moreover the polishing of oxidized pyrite may significantly affect the photochemical activity due to the removal of fe oxides as verified below 3 3 disappearance of oxygen vacancies decreases photochemical activity the element vacancies and photochemical reactions of pyrite were studied to explore the effect of mineral transformation as shown in fig 4 a o pyrite showed a strong xps band of oxygen adjacent to the vacancies at 531 1 ev and the strong esr spectral signal at a g factor of 2 003 confirmed the oxygen vacancies in contrast bp pyrite presented a signal at a g factor of 2 002 as sulfur vacancies the oxygen vacancies regulated the atomic arrangement and charge density distribution of transition metal compounds and were recognized as the active sites in various catalytic reactions tang et al 2020 wu et al 2020 although sulfur vacancy defects presented adsorption and catalysis capacities nguyen et al 2014 the oxygen vacancies in o pyrite presented noticeably stronger esr signals than the sulfide vacancies fig 4a and b the presence of oxygen vacancies obviously enhanced the density of states dos at the conduction band cb edge fig 4c and s9 and made o pyrite have a narrower band gap than bp pyrite the measured band gaps of o pyrite and bp pyrite were 0 84 and 0 90 ev respectively fig 4d o pyrite had a much higher photocurrent than bp pyrite fig 4e thus fewer charge carriers can be generated in bp pyrite the exact band edge positions of o pyrite and bp pyrite were investigated by mott schottky plots the flat band potentials of o pyrite and bp pyrite were determined by extrapolating to c 2 0 at frequencies of 1000 hz the c 2 in vertical coordinates was a function of electrochemical potentials where the capacitance c was obtained from the impedance measurement as shown in fig 4f the positive slopes of both o pyrite and bp pyrite in the mott schottky curve all indicated n type semiconductor characteristics yi et al 2019 the flat band potentials of o pyrite and bp pyrite were 0 23 v and 0 42 v versus ag agcl which were equal to 0 38 v and 0 19 v versus the normal hydrogen electrode nhe respectively the value of the flat potentials was approximately that of cb li et al 2017 thus the cb edge potentials of o pyrite and bp pyrite were 0 38 ev and 0 19 ev respectively the valence band vb edge potentials of o pyrite and bp pyrite were obtained from the equation e v b e c b e g thus the vb edge potentials of o pyrite and bp pyrite were 1 24 ev and 1 09 ev respectively in addition the calculated carrier densities were approximately 12 95 1022 and 7 60 1022 cm 3 for o pyrite and bp pyrite respectively these findings demonstrate the reduced photochemical activity of bp pyrite due to the disappearance of oxygen vacancies caused by biopolishing the roles of vacancies in the chemical activity of pyrite have been ignored zhang et al 2018 biopolishing may affect the decomposition of organic matter in water due to the removal of oxygen vacancies and a decrease in photochemical activity in various biological and photochemical processes hansel et al 2021 natural minerals can produce ros including h2o2 and oh georgiou et al 2015 xu et al 2019 ros are reactive toward carbon functional groups and react with a wide range of organic compounds including carbohydrates and aliphatic compounds waggoner et al 2017 the interaction between organic matter and ros may form low molecular weight organic acids that completely oxidize to co2 as shown in table s4 the initiation of dissolved oxygen do was approximately 6 50 mg l 1 in water stable do concentration values were observed under aerobic conditions maintained above 6 00 mg l 1 during 21 days of degradation in contrast the do in the water was nearly exhausted after degradation under anaerobic conditions indicating that photodegradation consumed oxygen in the water o pyrite generated more electrons than bp pyrite under 20 min of xe lamp irradiation fig 5 a and s10a as shown in fig 5b oh in bp pyrite accounted for only 19 3 of those in o pyrite and no superoxide radical signal was observed in the spectrum of bp pyrite fig 5c according to the results of esr spectra and lcf fitting results of fe k edge xafs fe oxides played an important role in the production of oh in this work for oxidized pyrite oh may generate from the processes mediated by surface adsorbed ferrous ions sulfur deficient sites and iron containing coating on the pyrite surface borda et al 2003 liu et al 2021 zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2022 as in the previous studies zhang et al 2017 zhao et al 2022 the surface absorbed fe ii was the main source of oh in neutral environment and fe oxides on pyrite mediated an electron transfer process and contributed to oh generation the conduction band potential of o pyrite was more positive than the potential for single electron reduction of o2 0 33 v which cannot generate superoxide radicals nosaka et al 2017 in addition o pyrite showed an feso4 peak in the xps spectra indicating the presence of fe2 in solution fe2 can capture o2 and then convert to o2 and fe3 leading to the production of pyrite superoxide radicals ji et al 2021 no signals corresponding to singlet oxygen radicals 1o2 were observed for either pyrite sample figs s10 and s11 in the cv scans of o pyrite and bp pyrite the corresponding peaks occurred at 0 240 and 0 113 ma fig 5d and e respectively which confirms the decreased electron accepting capacity of bp pyrite as indicated by the eis results bp pyrite had a higher electrochemical impedance and a lower electron transport capacity than o pyrite fig 5f plas spectrometry is a technique for studying the defects of solids and measuring the lifetime of the positron which can provide information about the types and relative concentrations of defects or vacancies even at the ppm level the pals of o pyrite and bp pyrite yield three lifetime components table s5 τ1 and τ2 significantly decreased from 127 1 and 323 3 ps for o pyrite to 133 5 and 349 3 ps for bp pyrite respectively τ1 was relative to annihilate in a single vacancy and nondefective place which confirms fewer defects after reaction by e coli τ2 was captured by the vacancy group and grain boundary defects moreover the τ2 relative intensities i2 decreased from 39 50 to 36 49 which indicates that grain boundary defects played an important role in o pyrite fig 5g describes the changes in chemical properties between o pyrite and bp pyrite bp pyrite showed lower chemical activity than o pyrite due to fewer oxygen vacancies grain boundary defects and hydroxyl radicals mineral derived ros are undeniably key reactants in the oxidation and transformation of organic matter kleber et al 2021 and the passivated chemical activity and ros of pyrite may inhibit the decomposition of organic matter in water as proven below 3 4 biopolishing suppresses the decomposition of organic matters the decomposition of reed leaf and pseudorasbora parva tissue as typical plant and animal organic matter were investigated in aquatic environments respectively reed leaf and pseudorasbora parva had similar initial dry weight before degradation table s6 after 21 days of degradation the final dry weight was different for each group the o pyrite group exhibited a lower final quality and higher degradation rate than the bp pyrite group for both reed leaf and pseudorasbora parva demonstrating that biopolishing suppressed dom degradation van krevelen diagrams were generated from the characteristic element ratios to help distinguish major compound classes in samples xu et al 2020 based on the o c and h c element ratios the molecules were grouped into seven compound classes lipids aliphatic proteins carbohydrates unsaturated hydrocarbons lignins cram like structures tannins and aromatic structures fig 6 a f as shown in fig 6g we found that samples mainly contained cho chno chos and chons compounds indicating that they were the major dom subcategories in all samples the abundances of the major subcategories of samples were similar cho chno chos chons ft icr ms is a semiquantitative technique in dom ionization efficiency because of sample matrix effects xu et al 2020 the molecular composition differences between samples are illustrated more clearly in fig 6h the largest proportions of substances in reed leaf group and pseudorasbora parva group were lignins cram like structures and lipids respectively for the reed leaf samples the lignin cram like structures showed the highest proportion o pyrite 57 19 bp pyrite 55 58 and the proportions of lipids compounds were 2 06 and 3 19 in the o pyrite and bp pyrite groups respectively for the pseudorasbora parva samples the lipids showed the highest proportion o pyrite 53 63 bp pyrite 65 38 and the proportions of lignin cram like structures were 26 31 and 20 20 in the o pyrite and bp pyrite groups respectively to further visualize dom quality differences the inter sample ranking was calculated and visualized in fig s13 the first ranks of reed leaf and pseudorasbora parva dom were dominated by lignins cram like structures and lipids aliphatic components respectively for the control group of reed leaf the first rank mainly in cho and chno were dominated by lignins cram like structures in contrast the first ranks in cho and chos for o pyrite and bp pyrite groups were dominated by lipids aliphatic components for the control group of pseudorasbora parva the first rank was mainly chno and chnos in contrast the first ranks in o pyrite and bp pyrite groups were cho and chos the inter sample rankings analysis put insight to the dom change indicating that lignin cram like compounds and dissolved organic nitrogen compounds were facile to degradation due to the mineral photochemical reactions the abundances of the subcategories can be clearly seen in each group but the abundances of subcategories among different groups cannot be clearly distinguished especially in reed leaf groups fig 6g furthermore the inter sample ranking of reed leaf was calculated and ranks were merged as follows rank 1 red rank 2 green and rank 3 black in van krevelen diagrams the chos and chnos components in o pyrite were more than that in control and bp pyrite groups fig s14 in addition the double bond equivalent dbe refers to the total number of double bonds and aliphatic rings that exist in a molecule and a higher dbe indicates less saturation d andrilli et al 2013 the mineral added groups had a higher h c and lower dbe which implied that the dom of the mineral added group was mainly composed of more saturated compounds the sorption of dom components and mineral surface chemistry contribute to the distribution and fate of organic matter chen et al 2022 organic matter can form strong chemical bonds with minerals and is physically protected in microaggregates or coprecipitates in the soil therefore stearic acid and condensed tannins were used as model organic matter compounds that represented lipids compounds and lignin cram like substances to explore organic matter interactions with pyrite using dft calculations the sorption of dom components and mineral surface chemistry can explain the distribution and fate of organic matter chen et al 2022 stearic acid and condensed tannins were adsorbed on the surface of pyrite though fe o bonding figs s12 and such enhanced adsorption is a prerequisite for degradation lin et al 2020 as shown in fig 6i condensed tannins had the highest adsorption capacity with bp pyrite and the adsorption of stearic acid on o pyrite was approximately 1 4 fold higher than that on bp pyrite for aromatic compounds photodegradation is the most important process that affects the dom aromaticity since oxidized aromatic compounds were preferentially removed moreover mineral groups dom had lower aromatic properties than control group due to the mineral photochemical properties unsaturated hydrogens are vulnerable to photodegradation xu et al 2020 and their proportions were low in each sample carbohydrates was not sensitive to photodegradation yang et al 2022 and their proportions in mineral groups were consistent with control group previous researchers proposed that lignin cram like compounds were chemically stable but could be photochemically degraded song et al 2020 and lipids and aliphatic proteins tend to persist in the presence of light without microbes song et al 2019 and their decomposition is attributed to mineral adsorption whereas both mineral adsorption and photochemical reactions were important in the present work in addition eem and parafac analyses were used to acquire more details about the contributions of oh and o2 to degradation as shown in fig s15 c1 and c4 were related to humic like c2 to protein like and c3 to fulvic like chen et al 2003 fulvic acid is a kind of organic acid with a small molecular weight after oh was captured the proportion of fulvic like c3 decreased slightly while the proportion of humic like c1 c4 and protein like c2 increased indicating that oh was important for the degradation of humic like and protein like compounds after capturing o2 there was no effect on the degradation of protein like but the proportion of humic like increased indicating that o2 had an effect on the degradation of humic like ros capture experiments showed that oh was more effective for degradation than o2 table s7 uv visible absorption spectra extracted information about dom properties the spectral slope ratio sr 275 295 nm slope 350 400 nm slope presented a negative relationship with the dom molecular weight helms et al 2008 the smallest sr was observed under dark conditions reflecting the role of light in dom degradation moreover c1 and c4 were related to humic like c2 to protein like and c3 to fulvic like chen et al 2003 fig s13 the proportion of humic like was higher under both anaerobic and dark conditions than under aerobic conditions indicating that light and aerobic conditions were more conducive to degradation of humic like in this work in addition anaerobic conditions had a more obvious degradation than dark conditions due to the do in water table s8 the decomposition of organic matter is a major determinant of carbon and nutrient cycling in ecosystems du et al 2020 stone et al 2021 biopolishing inhibited the decomposition of organic matter which indicates that adsorption and photochemical properties are two important factors that alter dom compositions in aquatic environments 4 conclusion eps widely exists in aquatic environments and is crucial to the fate of minerals and organic matter in waters our results provide direct evidence at the nano to atom nanoscale that saccharides and phenolic compounds in extracellular polymeric substances help biopolish the surface oxidation of pyrite via electron transfer biopolishing influenced adsorption and ros production and resulted in low photochemical reactivity fig 7 there was evidence to suggest that adsorption and photochemical properties are important for the decomposition of tannins aliphatic compounds and lignin cram like substances therefore the interaction between minerals and microbes affected the fate of carbon inhibited the decomposition of organic matter and altered the dom composition the interactions among dom mineral transformation and microbes provide an in depth understanding of carbon fate in waters author
