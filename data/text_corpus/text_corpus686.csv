3430,fecal contamination of water used for irrigation is assessed through the measurement of e coli concentrations the concentrations of this fecal indicator bacteria have been shown to vary highly in both space and time which may affect the results of microbial monitoring surveys determining if stable patterns of e coli can exist in irrigation sources will improve our ability to design effective monitoring campaigns the objective of this work was to research spatial and temporal variability of e coli concentrations in two working irrigation ponds using an empirical orthogonal function eof analysis e coli ph specific conductance dissolved oxygen and temperature were measured biweekly at 23 and 34 locations at ponds p1 and p2 respectively from 2016 to 2018 the first three spatial patterns eofs of e coli concentrations accounted for 80 of the total variance in the original dataset each year at both ponds in a given year eof1 explained from 34 to 54 and from 45 to 60 of the total variance in ponds p1 and p2 respectively examination of eof1 revealed distinct zones of relatively high and low e coli concentrations related to known microorganism sources and transport conditions the spatial patterns of e coli showed a significant negative correlation with spatial patterns of temperature rs 0 706 and 0 321 for p1 and p2 respectively ph rs 0 491 and 0 403 and do rs 0 591 and 0 460 in both ponds overall the eof analysis provided substantial information about the temporally stable spatial patterns of e coli by examining the deviations from the spatial averages across the ponds the eof analysis holds the promise to be a valuable tool for effective microbial water quality monitoring design keywords microbial water quality e coli irrigation water quality empirical orthogonal function eofs geographically weighted pca 1 introduction the presence of pathogenic organisms in irrigation water is a major concern for food safety about half of the food poisoning in the united states is attributed to the consumption of minimally processed or raw produce painter et al 2013 and irrigation is a known source for introducing pathogens to produce fields pachepsky et al 2011 analysis of irrigation water for multiple pathogens is not currently feasible and therefore concentrations of organisms that indicate the potential presence of pathogens in water are used to characterize microbial water quality specifically escherichia coli e coli is used as an indicator organism for the evaluation of the microbial quality of irrigation water in the united states and in other countries odonkor and ampofo 2013 uyttendaele et al 2015 the spatiotemporal variation of e coli concentrations in surface waters used for irrigation is quite complex because it depends on multiple physical chemical biological and ecological processes as well as management practices on land and in water this complexity calls for the search of patterns in e coli concentrations i e recurrent spatial or temporal features of concentration distributions the knowledge about patterns is invaluable for diagnostics monitoring prediction and management of environmental engineered and social systems vereecken et al 2016 persistent spatial patterns of e coli concentrations have been previously reported in both streams and ponds used for irrigation stocker et al 2018 jeon et al 2019 these authors employed the mean relative difference mrd method to search for stable patterns this method allows finding a single pattern in relative deviations of local concentrations from the average concentration across studied water bodies as this pattern does not change in time it is referred to as a temporally stable one and concentrations following this pattern exhibit temporal stability in environmental studies the search for patterns often demonstrates several superimposed temporally stable spatial patterns caused by the domination of different factors the mrd method is not suitable for finding several patterns and the application of empirical orthogonal functions eofs appears to be efficient in doing so this method was successfully applied to spatiotemporal variations found for various environmental variables e g rainfall saravan et al 2020 soil moisture perry and niemann 2007 korres et al 2010 snow cover thickness pan et al 2017 crop yield kim et al 2020 phytoplankton community structure liu et al 2021 etc pattern analysis with eofs typically concludes with identifying natural factors responsible for each pattern lee et al 2021 the eof analysis was applied to study e coli concentrations in a large creek in pennsylvania jeon et al 2019 and the patterns found were related to land use change and tributary effects although irrigation ponds and reservoirs provide a substantial fraction of irrigation water in the world the eof analysis has not yet been applied to study e coli concentrations in these surface water sources knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns in e coli concentrations in irrigation sources can improve monitoring design by characterizing the variability across a waterbody which will help identify representative sampling locations the objectives of this work were to i identify stable spatial patterns in variation of e coli concentrations in irrigation ponds using the eof analysis and ii examine if patterns of e coli correlate with patterns of water quality variables 2 methods 2 1 site description two working irrigation ponds in maryland were selected as study sites fig 1 pond p1 is an artificial embankment pond of a triangular shape p1 covers approximately 4150 m2 and provides irrigation water to the surrounding fruit fields this pond has 23 sampling locations water is withdrawn for irrigation at location 6 when the water level is low in p1 water is pumped into the pond from a creek fed pond about 430 m to the southeast of p1 pumped water enters p1 at the center point between locations 4 5 12 and 15 and pond water outflows in location 4 an ephemeral stream enters a few meters to the northwest of location 23 p1 is surrounded by tall shrubs on the eastern side locations 1 5 large trees on the northern side locations 6 20 21 23 and 22 and has short cut grass on the western side locations 7 9 1 all interior locations from 10 to 19 are open to direct sunlight and receive little to no shading the average pond depth at the interior locations is 2 7 m p1 receives a one time chemical fertilizer application on the surrounding fields in march of each year and no animal manures are used on the farm pond p2 is located at the university of maryland wye research and education center wrec on maryland s eastern shore 76 8 28 94 w 38 54 58 95 n p2 is an excavated pond of rectangular shape and has a 4 300 m2 area this pond provides irrigation water to the surrounding crop fields and greenhouses a concrete road skirts the northern end of the pond and the farm management facility is located just northeast of the pond a residential property equipped with a septic tank is located adjacent to locations 21 23 the average pond depth is 2 7 m and the water level is primarily maintained by rainfall generating runoff that enters through a culvert on the pond s northern end location 12 a level dependent outflow is between locations 24 and 25 the surrounding fields receive chemical fertilizers in march and no animals or animal manures are located or used on the property most of the pond bank consists of a combination of large bushes and tall grasses several trees surround the pond but are not immediately adjacent to the water locations 22 24 receive heavy shading throughout the day from the forest at the southern end of the pond locations 1 24 and locations 25 34 were considered bank and interior locations respectively 2 2 sampling schedule and details the sampling of both ponds occurred on roughly a biweekly schedule from may to october for the years 2016 to 2018 the exact starting and ending months for each year vary somewhat but overlap primarily during the produce growing season between june july and august in most cases care was taken to avoid sampling within proximity 48 h to rainfall events because there was an emphasis on characterizing the pond conditions during baseflow conditions which are more representative of when a farmer would irrigate in some years namely 2018 this led to larger than biweekly gaps between sampling events sampling on all dates started at 9 00 am and generally concluded between 10 30 or 11 am bank samples were collected with a 500 ml grab sampler and interior location samples were collected by hand using a small boat the sampling depth was about 0 20 cm which was considered the water surface all samples collected were immediately placed in ice packed insulated bags until they could be placed in a dark cooler with ice once collected samples were returned to the lab within 2 h for laboratory processing a ysi exo 2 sonde was used to measure water quality parameters at each sampling site at the same time and location that the water sample was collected measured parameters included temperature c specific conductance μs cm 1 dissolved oxygen concentration mg l 1 and ph which are abbreviated as c spc do and ph respectively in this work e coli was enumerated based on epa method 1603 epa 2002 which utilizes membrane filtration briefly samples were vacuum filtered through a 0 45 um membrane filter and placed onto modified mtec agar bd difco sparks maryland the volume of water that was filtered was adjusted so that a final colony count on the agar plates was typically between the range of 20 80 cfu per plate generally this filtered volume was 50 to 150 ml of pond water each sample was filtered and plated in duplicate and the cfu counts were then averaged before reporting empirical orthogonal function analysis the log10 transformed e coli concentration datasets were analyzed using empirical orthogonal functions eofs the eof analysis is a special case of the principal component analysis and has proven to be a powerful tool to discern spatial patterns in datasets consisting of measurements of a single scalar variable in space and time navarra and simomcini 2010 the eof analysis describes patterns not in variations of the target variable per se but in variations of its anomalies defined as deviations of the target variable in measurement locations from the average across all locations at the same time if measurements of the target variable y were done in m locations n times then the anomaly is 1 δ m n y m n y n where m 1 2 3 m and n 1 2 3 n locations and times of measurements and y n is the average value of y m n across all locations m 1 2 3 m at the time n the eof analysis presents the anomalies as sums 2 δ m n k 1 e o f k m e c k n where e o f k m is the kth spatial pattern defined for each of locations m and e c k n is the expansion coefficient ec defined for each of sampling times n for the kth spatial pattern each of the eofs explains some part of the variability in the anomaly values algorithms for eofs computation generate eofs in descending order by the value of explained variance the proportion of the total variance in the data explained by the eof1 is the largest eof2 explains less variance than eof1 but more than any of others etc in this work the singular value decomposition was performed to obtain the eofs and expansion coefficients bjornsson and venegas 1997 2 3 data analysis all values of e coli were log10 transformed prior to statistical analysis in cases where e coli was not detected in a water sample i e a concentration of 0 cfu 100 ml 1 the concentration was first assigned a value of one half the detection limit i e 0 5 cfu 100 ml 1 and was then log10 transformed eofs analysis was performed in r using the sinkr package taylor 2017 r core team 2013 following an eof analysis for individual years the datasets for each pond were then pooled to create a multiyear dataset the analysis was performed again on the 3 year dataset for each pond in this work we used north s rule of thumb which is described in overland and preisendorfer 1982 and examines the uniqueness of singular values whereby overlapping error limits between neighboring singular values indicate a possible mixture of signals those that do not show overlap can be retained for interpretation in this work only eof1 in the 3 year datasets for both ponds was found to be statistically significant and therefore this pattern will primarily be discussed eof analysis was also performed on the levels of water quality variables shown in table 1 the leading eof calculated from the multiyear e coli datasets were then correlated to the leading eofs calculated from the multiyear water quality data using the spearman correlation coefficient 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset daily average air temperature daily precipitation and average e coli concentrations on each date are shown in supplemental fig 1 for p1 there was a negative spearman correlation between the days since previous rainfall and the e coli concentration when data from all years was pooled rs 0 544 p 0 029 for p2 this relationship was also negative rs 0 380 p 0 146 indicating that e coli concentrations in the surface water samples generally decreased with increasing separation from rainfall events concentrations of e coli in p1 showed an increasing trend from late may to late july in 2016 the average concentration for 2016 was 0 83 0 51 average s d log cfu 100 ml 1 e coli concentrations in p1 in 2017 were consistently higher than in 2016 with an average of 1 66 0 41 log cfu 100 ml 1 and showed less variability overall table 1 supplemental fig 1 concentrations in 2018 had a lower mean of 1 09 0 60 log cfu 100 ml 1 than 2017 and contained the highest variability in e coli concentrations of all three years there was no consistent trend in average daily concentrations throughout the 2018 sampling season each year displayed unique inter seasonal dynamics in average e coli concentrations the three year average at p1 was 1 22 0 52 log cfu 100 ml 1 average water temperature values in p1 showed considerable differences with a max and min value of 22 7 c and 29 6 c respectively over the three year observation period the average water temperature during all observation dates was 26 5 1 9 c annual averages of ph in p1 were very similar in 2016 and 2017 with values of 8 64 0 33 and 8 81 0 30 respectively but in 2018 this value was noticeably lower at 7 64 0 24 average daily do concentrations in p1 across years ranged from 7 89 to 13 1 mg l 1 with a mean of 10 14 1 35 mg l 1 average daily values of spc ranged from 130 00 μs cm to 175 82 μs cm and had an inter annual average of 147 88 14 15 us cm spc showed small standard error across p1 on most sampling dates however on the 8 29 2018 the error was relatively large due to locations 20 and 21 have a combined average of 31 4 μs cm whereas all other locations had an average of 142 5 μs cm the median values of e coli c ph do and spc in p1 across years were 1 36 log cfu 100 ml 1 26 59 c 8 51 10 16 mg l 1 and 153 1 μs cm respectively similar to p1 p2 did not display consistent dynamics of average e coli concentrations in the same season across years table 2 supplemental fig 1 the concentration average for 2016 was 1 03 0 28 log cfu 100 ml 1 concentrations in 2017 generally increased over the sampling season but were on average lower than in 2016 with a value of 0 80 0 34 in 2018 the annual concentration average was even lower at 0 78 0 51 the lowest experiment wide daily average of e coli was on 8 7 2018 and had a value of 0 04 log cfu 100 ml 1 or approximately 1 10 cfu 100 ml 1 the 2018 season also had the highest observed average daily e coli concentration in p2 on 9 20 2018 1 67 log cfu 100 ml 1 the 3 year average e coli concentration in p2 was 0 82 0 39 log cfu 100 ml 1 average daily water temperatures in p2 displayed a greater range than p1 with min and max values of 21 5 c and 31 9 c and an experimental average of 27 5 2 6 c annual average ph values were 7 6 1 2 8 5 0 7 and 8 2 0 8 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively d o values were typically higher in p2 than in p1 over the study period and there were a greater proportion of sampling dates with do levels 10 mg l 1 in p2 than p1 the average do over observation dates in p2 was 12 6 3 7 mg l 1 and the cv was 29 21 daily average values of spc ranged from 125 μs cm to 179 μs cm with a mean of 154 μs cm which were all very similar to the same metrics in p1 129 μs cm 176 μs cm and 153 μs cm respectively the median values of e coli c ph do and spc in p1 across years were 0 78 log cfu 100 ml 1 28 05 c 8 15 12 4 mg l 1 and 153 3 μs cm respectively 3 2 empirical orthogonal function analysis the empirical orthogonal function analysis was performed on logarithms of e coli per 100 ml 1 measured at each pond date and location the total explained variance in the anomalies differed for each pond and by each of the observation years table 3 eof1 for p1 explained 34 48 and 54 percent of the total variance within the datasets for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the second and third eofs in p1 also tended to explain a non trivial fraction of the total variance in 2016 the sum of eof2 and eof3 52 2 explained a larger amount of variation than eof1 34 17 in 2017 the variance explained by eof1 and the sum of eof2 and eof3 were similar at approximately 50 in 2018 each subsequent eof explained nearly half as much of the variance as the previous one altogether the sum of the first three eigenvalues at p1 explained a similar fraction of the total variance at 87 94 and 90 for each respective year pooling data from all years produced an explained variance of 37 for the first p1 eof the first eof in the 3 year p1 dataset was the only one to show a significant pattern whereas eofs from individual years were not found to be significant total variance explained by the first eof at p2 was generally higher than p1 at 60 51 and 45 for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2016 the eof2 explained much less variation than eof1 and the sums of the trailing eofs were also low compared to eof1 indicating a robust spatial pattern identified by the first eof in 2017 and 2018 variances explained by the first and second eofs were similar summing the first three eofs for p2 also produced high total explained variance at 93 90 and 80 for three observation years respectively eof1 for the pooled dataset for p2 explained 41 of the explained variance like p1 the eof1 from the 3 year dataset was the only pattern to demonstrate statistical significance eof1 values from p1 between pairs of years showed weak positive correlations for comparisons between 2016 and 2017 rs 0 263 p 0 276 and 2017 and 2018 rs 0 332 p 0 121 however the comparison between 2016 and 2018 showed a stronger and significant relationship between eof1 values rs 0 533 p 0 018 for p2 eof1 values between locations and across years demonstrated significant positive relationships with correlation coefficients of 0 429 0 804 and 0 489 for the same comparisons as the above annual pairs p 0 011 p 0 001 and p 0 003 respectively fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of eof1 values from the 3 year datasets of e coli concentrations from the two ponds for both ponds lower eof1 values were observed in the pond interiors the kolmogorov smirnov test demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the distribution of eof1 scores between the interior and banks samples in both p1 p 0 007 and p2 p 0 001 several e coli hot spots and cold spots were identified by eof1 in both ponds these designations were determined by sampling locations with the highest and lowest eof1 values respectively relative to the other locations for p1 this included the bank adjacent to the road up to the western corner of the pond and the pond apex locations closest to the ephemeral inflow were also identified as hotspots however spot 22 stands as an outlier and an identified cold spot the eof analysis also revealed hot and cold spots in p2 hot spots were in the northern and southern ends of the pond adjacent to the ephemeral inflow and the outflow respectively sampling locations along the banks were primarily comprised of eof1 scores in between extremes while the interior contained mostly cold spots a comparison between eof1 score distributions among years can be seen in supplemental fig 2 in most cases the sign and amplitude of the eof1 scores are in agreement among all three years of observations however there are some notable exceptions for instance in p1 bank locations 6 and 22 have large eof1 values for 2016 which are not present in any other year indicating a strong deviation from the spatial average was observed at this location during this year there are notable differences in p2 particularly in the bank sampling locations from 2 to 9 and 16 through 19 locations 1 10 through 12 20 through 24 and 25 through 33 all have similar deviations between years overall the values of eof1 which correspond to the most well pronounced spatial pattern of anomalies appear to be mostly repeatable from one year to another graphs of the expansion coefficient 1 ec1 associated with the predominant empirical orthogonal function eof1 are shown in supplemental fig 3 ec1 shows the weight with which the eof1 contributed to the anomaly values on each sampling date eq 2 the ec1 values were almost entirely positive for both ponds across all dates similarity in signs of ec1 signifies that the stable spatial pattern in e coli concentrations is preserved over the year but to different extents the one exception to the positive ec1 values is the 6 8 2016 sampling date at p2 where the ec1 is slightly negative values of ec1 associated with specific sampling dates were correlated with the observed daily variances of the e coli dataset p1 showed a positive yet non significant relationship rs 0 380p 0 132 and p2 displayed a strong positive and significant relationship with the daily variances observed in the dataset rs 0 932 p 0 001 the eof1 and ec1 were able to effectively capture both the spatial and temporal variability of the datasets a correlation analysis was performed between the eof1 scores and the original datasets on e coli concentrations by date and location to assess on which dates the predominant spatial pattern in eof1 was present and to what degree results of the correlations are shown below each graph of ec1 values in supplementary fig 3 on a small number of sampling days the dominant spatial pattern was not strongly observed and the resulting correlation coefficient was not significant p 0 05 for p1 these dates were 5 31 2016 7 5 2017 7 18 2017 and 10 4 2018 in p2 only the 6 8 2016 date that did not show a significant correlation between e coli concentrations and the eof1 eofs were also computed for select water quality parameters for which paired measurements were consistently taken alongside e coli measurements for all years of observations these included temperature c specific conductivity spc ph and dissolved oxygen do in p1 the spearman correlation coefficient rs between eof1 for e coli and temperature demonstrated a significant negative relationship supplemental table 1 correlations between eof1 for e coli and both ph and do in p1 demonstrated significant negative relationships eof1 patterns between e coli concentrations and specific conductance showed no correlation in p1 do and ph were positively correlated as were do and temperature specific conductivity scores were negatively correlated with ph do and temperature in p2 spatial patterns from eof1 of e coli and temperature demonstrated negative relationship patterns between e coli and both ph and do showed significant negative correlation patterns of e coli were postively correlated with specific conductivity however this relationship was weak and not significant do and ph eof1 values were strongly correlated values of eof1 for temperature were also strongly correlated with both do and ph eof1 values in p2 eof1 values for water quality parameters across both ponds are shown in supplemental figs 4 7 examination of fig 2 and supplemental figs 4 7 shows that there were similar trends of high and low eof1 values between bank and interior locations for e coli and those of water quality parameters for example the eof1 values for e coli and temperature show opposite symbol colors in the banks versus interior which agrees with the reported negative correlation fig 2 and supplemental fig 4 4 discussion the two ponds in the present study demonstrated satisfactory microbial water quality over the 3 year period on average no sets of sampling dates exceeded the water quality criteria limit which is a geometric mean value of 126 cfu 100 ml 1 log 2 1 cfu 100 ml 1 as established by the us food and drug administration tables 1 and 2 us fda 2019 the stv values also were below the threshold value of 410 cfu 100 ml 1 data not shown temporal trends in the average concentrations were different in each pond tables 1 and 2 and fig s1 additionally the dynamics of the geometric means of e coli concentrations between ponds were different for the same year the 135 km distance between the ponds the 1 week difference in sampling times and general land management differences could play a role in creating and supporting mismatches in concentration dynamics between the two ponds the e coli dynamics did not demonstrate consistency across years at the same pond fig s1 by using anomalies rather than the absolute values of concentrations we were able to diminish the influence of temporal trends and focus only on the persistence of local deviations in e coli concentrations from the average of all concentrations the eof analysis informed not only about the temporally stable anomalies in specific locations but also about contributions of individual locations to the overall variability the observed correlations between expansion coefficients and variance of logarithm concentrations across the pond on the observation dates illustrate the role of the first eof as the most informative patterns if one truncates eq 2 and leaves only the first term of the sum then for each observation time the variance of the anomalies will be equal to the variance of the eof1 multiplied by the squared ec1 for this observation time because the first eof does not explain the total variance the above proportionality can only be observed as approximate estimation the maps in fig 2 support several hypothetical reasons for differences in eof1 values across locations high eof1 values in locations 11 13 of p2 could be related to the proximity of these locations to the culvert which delivers runoff from the fields and forested area to the north of the pond during rainfall events sedimentation of suspended material in this area that is rich in organic matter might create habitats for e coli that are more favorable than the other locations in the pond pachepsky and shelton 2011 other hot spots such as those observed in location 21 and 22 in the same pond may be related to the adjacent residential property that contains an old waste management unit and the presence of domesticated animals that wander in the area near the pond banks bank locations tended to have higher eof1 values fig 2 a known phenomenon for freshwater lakes and reservoirs us epa 2010 shallow waters facilitate the survival of e coli via several mechanisms including the presence of nutrients turbidity closeness to habitats in the bottom sediments and periphyton etc the hot spots in p1 were found at locations along the western bank locations 1 7 8 and 9 which serve as the major conduit for runoff and an entry way for waterfowl to enter the pond the locations in the north western corner which are very close to the outlet of an ephemeral creek which runs through a wooded area which has been observed to have abundant wildlife the above examples demonstrate well the applicability of the eof analysis to identify sources or inputs of fecal contamination in small water bodies differences in mixing conditions in the ponds can be another factor affecting the values of eof1 wind driven mixing has been shown to be a prominent factor microbial water quality dynamics brissaud et al 2003 it undoubtedly occurred in both ponds but the shapes of the two ponds may have influenced the degree of mixing the elongated shape of p2 can facilitate the preservation of differences in concentrations and the presence of hot and cold spots the across pond variability is higher in p2 than in p1 a greater degree of mixing in p1 could lead to a less dominant expression of spatial patterns elucidated by eof1 more work is needed to relate meteorological conditions to e coli concentrations in small water bodies used for irrigation such as the ponds in this study it should be noted that the bank e coli hot spots do not extend far into the pond interior the average distance between sampling locations is about 10 m and this distance is sufficient for the transition from hot to cold spot i e change from the highest to the lowest eof1 values the sources of e coli appear to be not strong enough to overcome the mixing effects in the pond water which act to efficiently dilute the presumably higher concentrations of e coli in runoff that enters the pond the correlations between eof1 values of e coli concentrations and those from water quality parameters provide additional insight into the differences of habitats as factors for the temporal stability of e coli concentrations negative correlations between eof1 of e coli and both ph and dissolved oxygen do indicate the deterioration of the e coli habitat with the increase of do and ph algal photosynthetic activity most likely resulted in increased ph and increased oxygenation but respiration processes and organic matter oxidation might also affect the do concentrations in the studied here aquatic environments ansa et al 2011 cheng et al 2013 increased oxygenation in treatment ponds or lagoons attributed to an abundance of algae has been observed to affect fecal bacteria die off due to the production of toxic free radical oxygen species curtis et al 1992 photosensitizer reactions at the wavelengths found in sunlight are usually much more injurious in the presence of oxygen curtis et al 1992 low oxygen zones can be more favorable for e coli survival a few studies have reported that light related inactivation of e coli is dependent on the ph of water under elevated ph 8 5 e coli could be inactivated by exogenous mechanisms while endogenous mechanisms would inactivate e coli more slowly under moderate ph conditions davies colley et al 1997 1999 the effects of ph on e coli have been attributed to conformational changes in the membrane of the bacteria bosshard et al 2010 bacterial inactivation can result from respiratory chain damage due to a physical breakdown in the membrane which exposes nucleic acids to environmental stresses liu et al 2019 we stress that while relationships between e coli temperature ph do and spc have been reported this work demonstrates a strong relationship between anomalies of these water quality variables rather than absolute values as is more traditionally investigated and presented still more work is needed to elucidate the relationships between water quality parameters that characterize the potential habitat for e coli and the observed e coli concentrations we present relationships using only 4 water quality variables and acknowledge that many more potential variables could be measured which may demonstrate stronger correlations with spatial patterns of e coli concentrations these may include variables such as turbidity orp cyanobacteria density or concentrations of ionic nutrients such as nitrates phosphates and ammonia or ammonium identification of important variables which control habitat conditions for e coli is an important avenue for future research since these variables may be used solely or concurrently to predict e coli levels using instantaneous sensor measurements stocker et al 2019 stocker et al 2022 numerous methods exist for determining significant patterns in data resulting from an eof or pca analysis in this work we chose the technique proposed by overland and preisendorfer 1982 known as north s rule of thumb which repeatedly computes eigenvalues of the covariance matrix and returns the 95th quantiles if the confidence interval is comparable to or larger than the spacing between neighboring eigenvalues then the distinction between variances is likely due not to sampling error and noise but rather due to interpretable patterns in the data other methods include bootstrap and monte carlo based methods which have shown both advantages and disadvantages babamoradi et al 2013 bjornsson and venegas 1997 it would also be interesting and advantageous for future work to see the eof separation techniques such as eof rotations affect the interpretability of results from an eof analysis in general the eofs explained more variance over one year than over the combined 3 year period table 3 however the emergence of interpretable signals patterns from the noise according to north s test was not noted for any eof found in a 1 year observation period three years of data were necessary to delineate the significant spatial patterns in the data it remains to be seen whether the sheer amount of sampling dates or the temporal extent of observations control the relationship between eof and noise in this case additionally the authors note that the first several eofs in various years explain a non trivial fraction of the total variance explained however they were not found to be significant researchers may elect to choose different significance tests or analyze non significant eofs and ecs which may provide additional insight into their data methods other than eof are applicable for spatial pattern recognition in time series from grid sampling in particular the mean relative difference mrd analysis was recently applied to studies documenting temporally stable spatial patterns of e coli concentrations in ponds pachepsky et al 2018 stocker et al 2021 the mrd analysis uses relative anomalies whereas the eof analysis works with absolute anomalies this presents some advantages to the mrd technique when there are large temporal variations of the studied variable on the other hand the mrd analysis generates a single pattern the eof analysis reveals several different spatial eofs and temporal ecs patterns that may also represent large fractions of the variability and can be attributed to separate mechanisms affecting the observed spatiotemporal variability additionally there are several methods to determine the significance of eofs but no such techniques are known for the mrd analysis overall each of the spatial pattern recognition methods has useful features and the methods can be complementary vereecken et al 2016 the existence of stable spatial patterns in e coli anomalies must be accounted for in microbial water quality monitoring design in both ponds sampling from the banks generally resulted in higher e coli concentration measurements than sampling in the interior the conservative estimation of e coli concentrations depends on the intended water use the microbial water quality evaluation of recreational waters is focused on the nearshore areas whereas the irrigation water from ponds comes mostly from the pond interior the existence of relationships between temporally stable patterns of ph and do on the one hand and e coli on the other hand may also be useful in monitoring design since documenting spatial variability of ph do and temperature using in situ sensing measurements is more practical than fine multi location measurements of e coli concentrations 5 conclusions spatial patterns in logarithms of e coli concentrations were found to be stable in time in the two irrigations ponds used in the current study the empirical orthogonal function method was effective in identifying these patterns patterns of e coli concentrations were correlated with patterns of habitat defining water quality parameters such as temperature do ph and spc additionally the identified patterns could be related to potential sources and pathways for the microorganism in the pond systems revealing and quantifying temporarily stable spatial patterns of fecal indicator concentrations can be useful in designing monitoring campaigns to assess the microbial water quality in ponds credit authorship contribution statement matthew d stocker methodology

3430,fecal contamination of water used for irrigation is assessed through the measurement of e coli concentrations the concentrations of this fecal indicator bacteria have been shown to vary highly in both space and time which may affect the results of microbial monitoring surveys determining if stable patterns of e coli can exist in irrigation sources will improve our ability to design effective monitoring campaigns the objective of this work was to research spatial and temporal variability of e coli concentrations in two working irrigation ponds using an empirical orthogonal function eof analysis e coli ph specific conductance dissolved oxygen and temperature were measured biweekly at 23 and 34 locations at ponds p1 and p2 respectively from 2016 to 2018 the first three spatial patterns eofs of e coli concentrations accounted for 80 of the total variance in the original dataset each year at both ponds in a given year eof1 explained from 34 to 54 and from 45 to 60 of the total variance in ponds p1 and p2 respectively examination of eof1 revealed distinct zones of relatively high and low e coli concentrations related to known microorganism sources and transport conditions the spatial patterns of e coli showed a significant negative correlation with spatial patterns of temperature rs 0 706 and 0 321 for p1 and p2 respectively ph rs 0 491 and 0 403 and do rs 0 591 and 0 460 in both ponds overall the eof analysis provided substantial information about the temporally stable spatial patterns of e coli by examining the deviations from the spatial averages across the ponds the eof analysis holds the promise to be a valuable tool for effective microbial water quality monitoring design keywords microbial water quality e coli irrigation water quality empirical orthogonal function eofs geographically weighted pca 1 introduction the presence of pathogenic organisms in irrigation water is a major concern for food safety about half of the food poisoning in the united states is attributed to the consumption of minimally processed or raw produce painter et al 2013 and irrigation is a known source for introducing pathogens to produce fields pachepsky et al 2011 analysis of irrigation water for multiple pathogens is not currently feasible and therefore concentrations of organisms that indicate the potential presence of pathogens in water are used to characterize microbial water quality specifically escherichia coli e coli is used as an indicator organism for the evaluation of the microbial quality of irrigation water in the united states and in other countries odonkor and ampofo 2013 uyttendaele et al 2015 the spatiotemporal variation of e coli concentrations in surface waters used for irrigation is quite complex because it depends on multiple physical chemical biological and ecological processes as well as management practices on land and in water this complexity calls for the search of patterns in e coli concentrations i e recurrent spatial or temporal features of concentration distributions the knowledge about patterns is invaluable for diagnostics monitoring prediction and management of environmental engineered and social systems vereecken et al 2016 persistent spatial patterns of e coli concentrations have been previously reported in both streams and ponds used for irrigation stocker et al 2018 jeon et al 2019 these authors employed the mean relative difference mrd method to search for stable patterns this method allows finding a single pattern in relative deviations of local concentrations from the average concentration across studied water bodies as this pattern does not change in time it is referred to as a temporally stable one and concentrations following this pattern exhibit temporal stability in environmental studies the search for patterns often demonstrates several superimposed temporally stable spatial patterns caused by the domination of different factors the mrd method is not suitable for finding several patterns and the application of empirical orthogonal functions eofs appears to be efficient in doing so this method was successfully applied to spatiotemporal variations found for various environmental variables e g rainfall saravan et al 2020 soil moisture perry and niemann 2007 korres et al 2010 snow cover thickness pan et al 2017 crop yield kim et al 2020 phytoplankton community structure liu et al 2021 etc pattern analysis with eofs typically concludes with identifying natural factors responsible for each pattern lee et al 2021 the eof analysis was applied to study e coli concentrations in a large creek in pennsylvania jeon et al 2019 and the patterns found were related to land use change and tributary effects although irrigation ponds and reservoirs provide a substantial fraction of irrigation water in the world the eof analysis has not yet been applied to study e coli concentrations in these surface water sources knowledge of spatial and temporal patterns in e coli concentrations in irrigation sources can improve monitoring design by characterizing the variability across a waterbody which will help identify representative sampling locations the objectives of this work were to i identify stable spatial patterns in variation of e coli concentrations in irrigation ponds using the eof analysis and ii examine if patterns of e coli correlate with patterns of water quality variables 2 methods 2 1 site description two working irrigation ponds in maryland were selected as study sites fig 1 pond p1 is an artificial embankment pond of a triangular shape p1 covers approximately 4150 m2 and provides irrigation water to the surrounding fruit fields this pond has 23 sampling locations water is withdrawn for irrigation at location 6 when the water level is low in p1 water is pumped into the pond from a creek fed pond about 430 m to the southeast of p1 pumped water enters p1 at the center point between locations 4 5 12 and 15 and pond water outflows in location 4 an ephemeral stream enters a few meters to the northwest of location 23 p1 is surrounded by tall shrubs on the eastern side locations 1 5 large trees on the northern side locations 6 20 21 23 and 22 and has short cut grass on the western side locations 7 9 1 all interior locations from 10 to 19 are open to direct sunlight and receive little to no shading the average pond depth at the interior locations is 2 7 m p1 receives a one time chemical fertilizer application on the surrounding fields in march of each year and no animal manures are used on the farm pond p2 is located at the university of maryland wye research and education center wrec on maryland s eastern shore 76 8 28 94 w 38 54 58 95 n p2 is an excavated pond of rectangular shape and has a 4 300 m2 area this pond provides irrigation water to the surrounding crop fields and greenhouses a concrete road skirts the northern end of the pond and the farm management facility is located just northeast of the pond a residential property equipped with a septic tank is located adjacent to locations 21 23 the average pond depth is 2 7 m and the water level is primarily maintained by rainfall generating runoff that enters through a culvert on the pond s northern end location 12 a level dependent outflow is between locations 24 and 25 the surrounding fields receive chemical fertilizers in march and no animals or animal manures are located or used on the property most of the pond bank consists of a combination of large bushes and tall grasses several trees surround the pond but are not immediately adjacent to the water locations 22 24 receive heavy shading throughout the day from the forest at the southern end of the pond locations 1 24 and locations 25 34 were considered bank and interior locations respectively 2 2 sampling schedule and details the sampling of both ponds occurred on roughly a biweekly schedule from may to october for the years 2016 to 2018 the exact starting and ending months for each year vary somewhat but overlap primarily during the produce growing season between june july and august in most cases care was taken to avoid sampling within proximity 48 h to rainfall events because there was an emphasis on characterizing the pond conditions during baseflow conditions which are more representative of when a farmer would irrigate in some years namely 2018 this led to larger than biweekly gaps between sampling events sampling on all dates started at 9 00 am and generally concluded between 10 30 or 11 am bank samples were collected with a 500 ml grab sampler and interior location samples were collected by hand using a small boat the sampling depth was about 0 20 cm which was considered the water surface all samples collected were immediately placed in ice packed insulated bags until they could be placed in a dark cooler with ice once collected samples were returned to the lab within 2 h for laboratory processing a ysi exo 2 sonde was used to measure water quality parameters at each sampling site at the same time and location that the water sample was collected measured parameters included temperature c specific conductance μs cm 1 dissolved oxygen concentration mg l 1 and ph which are abbreviated as c spc do and ph respectively in this work e coli was enumerated based on epa method 1603 epa 2002 which utilizes membrane filtration briefly samples were vacuum filtered through a 0 45 um membrane filter and placed onto modified mtec agar bd difco sparks maryland the volume of water that was filtered was adjusted so that a final colony count on the agar plates was typically between the range of 20 80 cfu per plate generally this filtered volume was 50 to 150 ml of pond water each sample was filtered and plated in duplicate and the cfu counts were then averaged before reporting empirical orthogonal function analysis the log10 transformed e coli concentration datasets were analyzed using empirical orthogonal functions eofs the eof analysis is a special case of the principal component analysis and has proven to be a powerful tool to discern spatial patterns in datasets consisting of measurements of a single scalar variable in space and time navarra and simomcini 2010 the eof analysis describes patterns not in variations of the target variable per se but in variations of its anomalies defined as deviations of the target variable in measurement locations from the average across all locations at the same time if measurements of the target variable y were done in m locations n times then the anomaly is 1 δ m n y m n y n where m 1 2 3 m and n 1 2 3 n locations and times of measurements and y n is the average value of y m n across all locations m 1 2 3 m at the time n the eof analysis presents the anomalies as sums 2 δ m n k 1 e o f k m e c k n where e o f k m is the kth spatial pattern defined for each of locations m and e c k n is the expansion coefficient ec defined for each of sampling times n for the kth spatial pattern each of the eofs explains some part of the variability in the anomaly values algorithms for eofs computation generate eofs in descending order by the value of explained variance the proportion of the total variance in the data explained by the eof1 is the largest eof2 explains less variance than eof1 but more than any of others etc in this work the singular value decomposition was performed to obtain the eofs and expansion coefficients bjornsson and venegas 1997 2 3 data analysis all values of e coli were log10 transformed prior to statistical analysis in cases where e coli was not detected in a water sample i e a concentration of 0 cfu 100 ml 1 the concentration was first assigned a value of one half the detection limit i e 0 5 cfu 100 ml 1 and was then log10 transformed eofs analysis was performed in r using the sinkr package taylor 2017 r core team 2013 following an eof analysis for individual years the datasets for each pond were then pooled to create a multiyear dataset the analysis was performed again on the 3 year dataset for each pond in this work we used north s rule of thumb which is described in overland and preisendorfer 1982 and examines the uniqueness of singular values whereby overlapping error limits between neighboring singular values indicate a possible mixture of signals those that do not show overlap can be retained for interpretation in this work only eof1 in the 3 year datasets for both ponds was found to be statistically significant and therefore this pattern will primarily be discussed eof analysis was also performed on the levels of water quality variables shown in table 1 the leading eof calculated from the multiyear e coli datasets were then correlated to the leading eofs calculated from the multiyear water quality data using the spearman correlation coefficient 3 results 3 1 overview of the dataset daily average air temperature daily precipitation and average e coli concentrations on each date are shown in supplemental fig 1 for p1 there was a negative spearman correlation between the days since previous rainfall and the e coli concentration when data from all years was pooled rs 0 544 p 0 029 for p2 this relationship was also negative rs 0 380 p 0 146 indicating that e coli concentrations in the surface water samples generally decreased with increasing separation from rainfall events concentrations of e coli in p1 showed an increasing trend from late may to late july in 2016 the average concentration for 2016 was 0 83 0 51 average s d log cfu 100 ml 1 e coli concentrations in p1 in 2017 were consistently higher than in 2016 with an average of 1 66 0 41 log cfu 100 ml 1 and showed less variability overall table 1 supplemental fig 1 concentrations in 2018 had a lower mean of 1 09 0 60 log cfu 100 ml 1 than 2017 and contained the highest variability in e coli concentrations of all three years there was no consistent trend in average daily concentrations throughout the 2018 sampling season each year displayed unique inter seasonal dynamics in average e coli concentrations the three year average at p1 was 1 22 0 52 log cfu 100 ml 1 average water temperature values in p1 showed considerable differences with a max and min value of 22 7 c and 29 6 c respectively over the three year observation period the average water temperature during all observation dates was 26 5 1 9 c annual averages of ph in p1 were very similar in 2016 and 2017 with values of 8 64 0 33 and 8 81 0 30 respectively but in 2018 this value was noticeably lower at 7 64 0 24 average daily do concentrations in p1 across years ranged from 7 89 to 13 1 mg l 1 with a mean of 10 14 1 35 mg l 1 average daily values of spc ranged from 130 00 μs cm to 175 82 μs cm and had an inter annual average of 147 88 14 15 us cm spc showed small standard error across p1 on most sampling dates however on the 8 29 2018 the error was relatively large due to locations 20 and 21 have a combined average of 31 4 μs cm whereas all other locations had an average of 142 5 μs cm the median values of e coli c ph do and spc in p1 across years were 1 36 log cfu 100 ml 1 26 59 c 8 51 10 16 mg l 1 and 153 1 μs cm respectively similar to p1 p2 did not display consistent dynamics of average e coli concentrations in the same season across years table 2 supplemental fig 1 the concentration average for 2016 was 1 03 0 28 log cfu 100 ml 1 concentrations in 2017 generally increased over the sampling season but were on average lower than in 2016 with a value of 0 80 0 34 in 2018 the annual concentration average was even lower at 0 78 0 51 the lowest experiment wide daily average of e coli was on 8 7 2018 and had a value of 0 04 log cfu 100 ml 1 or approximately 1 10 cfu 100 ml 1 the 2018 season also had the highest observed average daily e coli concentration in p2 on 9 20 2018 1 67 log cfu 100 ml 1 the 3 year average e coli concentration in p2 was 0 82 0 39 log cfu 100 ml 1 average daily water temperatures in p2 displayed a greater range than p1 with min and max values of 21 5 c and 31 9 c and an experimental average of 27 5 2 6 c annual average ph values were 7 6 1 2 8 5 0 7 and 8 2 0 8 in 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively d o values were typically higher in p2 than in p1 over the study period and there were a greater proportion of sampling dates with do levels 10 mg l 1 in p2 than p1 the average do over observation dates in p2 was 12 6 3 7 mg l 1 and the cv was 29 21 daily average values of spc ranged from 125 μs cm to 179 μs cm with a mean of 154 μs cm which were all very similar to the same metrics in p1 129 μs cm 176 μs cm and 153 μs cm respectively the median values of e coli c ph do and spc in p1 across years were 0 78 log cfu 100 ml 1 28 05 c 8 15 12 4 mg l 1 and 153 3 μs cm respectively 3 2 empirical orthogonal function analysis the empirical orthogonal function analysis was performed on logarithms of e coli per 100 ml 1 measured at each pond date and location the total explained variance in the anomalies differed for each pond and by each of the observation years table 3 eof1 for p1 explained 34 48 and 54 percent of the total variance within the datasets for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively the second and third eofs in p1 also tended to explain a non trivial fraction of the total variance in 2016 the sum of eof2 and eof3 52 2 explained a larger amount of variation than eof1 34 17 in 2017 the variance explained by eof1 and the sum of eof2 and eof3 were similar at approximately 50 in 2018 each subsequent eof explained nearly half as much of the variance as the previous one altogether the sum of the first three eigenvalues at p1 explained a similar fraction of the total variance at 87 94 and 90 for each respective year pooling data from all years produced an explained variance of 37 for the first p1 eof the first eof in the 3 year p1 dataset was the only one to show a significant pattern whereas eofs from individual years were not found to be significant total variance explained by the first eof at p2 was generally higher than p1 at 60 51 and 45 for 2016 2017 and 2018 respectively in 2016 the eof2 explained much less variation than eof1 and the sums of the trailing eofs were also low compared to eof1 indicating a robust spatial pattern identified by the first eof in 2017 and 2018 variances explained by the first and second eofs were similar summing the first three eofs for p2 also produced high total explained variance at 93 90 and 80 for three observation years respectively eof1 for the pooled dataset for p2 explained 41 of the explained variance like p1 the eof1 from the 3 year dataset was the only pattern to demonstrate statistical significance eof1 values from p1 between pairs of years showed weak positive correlations for comparisons between 2016 and 2017 rs 0 263 p 0 276 and 2017 and 2018 rs 0 332 p 0 121 however the comparison between 2016 and 2018 showed a stronger and significant relationship between eof1 values rs 0 533 p 0 018 for p2 eof1 values between locations and across years demonstrated significant positive relationships with correlation coefficients of 0 429 0 804 and 0 489 for the same comparisons as the above annual pairs p 0 011 p 0 001 and p 0 003 respectively fig 2 shows the spatial distribution of eof1 values from the 3 year datasets of e coli concentrations from the two ponds for both ponds lower eof1 values were observed in the pond interiors the kolmogorov smirnov test demonstrated that there was a significant difference in the distribution of eof1 scores between the interior and banks samples in both p1 p 0 007 and p2 p 0 001 several e coli hot spots and cold spots were identified by eof1 in both ponds these designations were determined by sampling locations with the highest and lowest eof1 values respectively relative to the other locations for p1 this included the bank adjacent to the road up to the western corner of the pond and the pond apex locations closest to the ephemeral inflow were also identified as hotspots however spot 22 stands as an outlier and an identified cold spot the eof analysis also revealed hot and cold spots in p2 hot spots were in the northern and southern ends of the pond adjacent to the ephemeral inflow and the outflow respectively sampling locations along the banks were primarily comprised of eof1 scores in between extremes while the interior contained mostly cold spots a comparison between eof1 score distributions among years can be seen in supplemental fig 2 in most cases the sign and amplitude of the eof1 scores are in agreement among all three years of observations however there are some notable exceptions for instance in p1 bank locations 6 and 22 have large eof1 values for 2016 which are not present in any other year indicating a strong deviation from the spatial average was observed at this location during this year there are notable differences in p2 particularly in the bank sampling locations from 2 to 9 and 16 through 19 locations 1 10 through 12 20 through 24 and 25 through 33 all have similar deviations between years overall the values of eof1 which correspond to the most well pronounced spatial pattern of anomalies appear to be mostly repeatable from one year to another graphs of the expansion coefficient 1 ec1 associated with the predominant empirical orthogonal function eof1 are shown in supplemental fig 3 ec1 shows the weight with which the eof1 contributed to the anomaly values on each sampling date eq 2 the ec1 values were almost entirely positive for both ponds across all dates similarity in signs of ec1 signifies that the stable spatial pattern in e coli concentrations is preserved over the year but to different extents the one exception to the positive ec1 values is the 6 8 2016 sampling date at p2 where the ec1 is slightly negative values of ec1 associated with specific sampling dates were correlated with the observed daily variances of the e coli dataset p1 showed a positive yet non significant relationship rs 0 380p 0 132 and p2 displayed a strong positive and significant relationship with the daily variances observed in the dataset rs 0 932 p 0 001 the eof1 and ec1 were able to effectively capture both the spatial and temporal variability of the datasets a correlation analysis was performed between the eof1 scores and the original datasets on e coli concentrations by date and location to assess on which dates the predominant spatial pattern in eof1 was present and to what degree results of the correlations are shown below each graph of ec1 values in supplementary fig 3 on a small number of sampling days the dominant spatial pattern was not strongly observed and the resulting correlation coefficient was not significant p 0 05 for p1 these dates were 5 31 2016 7 5 2017 7 18 2017 and 10 4 2018 in p2 only the 6 8 2016 date that did not show a significant correlation between e coli concentrations and the eof1 eofs were also computed for select water quality parameters for which paired measurements were consistently taken alongside e coli measurements for all years of observations these included temperature c specific conductivity spc ph and dissolved oxygen do in p1 the spearman correlation coefficient rs between eof1 for e coli and temperature demonstrated a significant negative relationship supplemental table 1 correlations between eof1 for e coli and both ph and do in p1 demonstrated significant negative relationships eof1 patterns between e coli concentrations and specific conductance showed no correlation in p1 do and ph were positively correlated as were do and temperature specific conductivity scores were negatively correlated with ph do and temperature in p2 spatial patterns from eof1 of e coli and temperature demonstrated negative relationship patterns between e coli and both ph and do showed significant negative correlation patterns of e coli were postively correlated with specific conductivity however this relationship was weak and not significant do and ph eof1 values were strongly correlated values of eof1 for temperature were also strongly correlated with both do and ph eof1 values in p2 eof1 values for water quality parameters across both ponds are shown in supplemental figs 4 7 examination of fig 2 and supplemental figs 4 7 shows that there were similar trends of high and low eof1 values between bank and interior locations for e coli and those of water quality parameters for example the eof1 values for e coli and temperature show opposite symbol colors in the banks versus interior which agrees with the reported negative correlation fig 2 and supplemental fig 4 4 discussion the two ponds in the present study demonstrated satisfactory microbial water quality over the 3 year period on average no sets of sampling dates exceeded the water quality criteria limit which is a geometric mean value of 126 cfu 100 ml 1 log 2 1 cfu 100 ml 1 as established by the us food and drug administration tables 1 and 2 us fda 2019 the stv values also were below the threshold value of 410 cfu 100 ml 1 data not shown temporal trends in the average concentrations were different in each pond tables 1 and 2 and fig s1 additionally the dynamics of the geometric means of e coli concentrations between ponds were different for the same year the 135 km distance between the ponds the 1 week difference in sampling times and general land management differences could play a role in creating and supporting mismatches in concentration dynamics between the two ponds the e coli dynamics did not demonstrate consistency across years at the same pond fig s1 by using anomalies rather than the absolute values of concentrations we were able to diminish the influence of temporal trends and focus only on the persistence of local deviations in e coli concentrations from the average of all concentrations the eof analysis informed not only about the temporally stable anomalies in specific locations but also about contributions of individual locations to the overall variability the observed correlations between expansion coefficients and variance of logarithm concentrations across the pond on the observation dates illustrate the role of the first eof as the most informative patterns if one truncates eq 2 and leaves only the first term of the sum then for each observation time the variance of the anomalies will be equal to the variance of the eof1 multiplied by the squared ec1 for this observation time because the first eof does not explain the total variance the above proportionality can only be observed as approximate estimation the maps in fig 2 support several hypothetical reasons for differences in eof1 values across locations high eof1 values in locations 11 13 of p2 could be related to the proximity of these locations to the culvert which delivers runoff from the fields and forested area to the north of the pond during rainfall events sedimentation of suspended material in this area that is rich in organic matter might create habitats for e coli that are more favorable than the other locations in the pond pachepsky and shelton 2011 other hot spots such as those observed in location 21 and 22 in the same pond may be related to the adjacent residential property that contains an old waste management unit and the presence of domesticated animals that wander in the area near the pond banks bank locations tended to have higher eof1 values fig 2 a known phenomenon for freshwater lakes and reservoirs us epa 2010 shallow waters facilitate the survival of e coli via several mechanisms including the presence of nutrients turbidity closeness to habitats in the bottom sediments and periphyton etc the hot spots in p1 were found at locations along the western bank locations 1 7 8 and 9 which serve as the major conduit for runoff and an entry way for waterfowl to enter the pond the locations in the north western corner which are very close to the outlet of an ephemeral creek which runs through a wooded area which has been observed to have abundant wildlife the above examples demonstrate well the applicability of the eof analysis to identify sources or inputs of fecal contamination in small water bodies differences in mixing conditions in the ponds can be another factor affecting the values of eof1 wind driven mixing has been shown to be a prominent factor microbial water quality dynamics brissaud et al 2003 it undoubtedly occurred in both ponds but the shapes of the two ponds may have influenced the degree of mixing the elongated shape of p2 can facilitate the preservation of differences in concentrations and the presence of hot and cold spots the across pond variability is higher in p2 than in p1 a greater degree of mixing in p1 could lead to a less dominant expression of spatial patterns elucidated by eof1 more work is needed to relate meteorological conditions to e coli concentrations in small water bodies used for irrigation such as the ponds in this study it should be noted that the bank e coli hot spots do not extend far into the pond interior the average distance between sampling locations is about 10 m and this distance is sufficient for the transition from hot to cold spot i e change from the highest to the lowest eof1 values the sources of e coli appear to be not strong enough to overcome the mixing effects in the pond water which act to efficiently dilute the presumably higher concentrations of e coli in runoff that enters the pond the correlations between eof1 values of e coli concentrations and those from water quality parameters provide additional insight into the differences of habitats as factors for the temporal stability of e coli concentrations negative correlations between eof1 of e coli and both ph and dissolved oxygen do indicate the deterioration of the e coli habitat with the increase of do and ph algal photosynthetic activity most likely resulted in increased ph and increased oxygenation but respiration processes and organic matter oxidation might also affect the do concentrations in the studied here aquatic environments ansa et al 2011 cheng et al 2013 increased oxygenation in treatment ponds or lagoons attributed to an abundance of algae has been observed to affect fecal bacteria die off due to the production of toxic free radical oxygen species curtis et al 1992 photosensitizer reactions at the wavelengths found in sunlight are usually much more injurious in the presence of oxygen curtis et al 1992 low oxygen zones can be more favorable for e coli survival a few studies have reported that light related inactivation of e coli is dependent on the ph of water under elevated ph 8 5 e coli could be inactivated by exogenous mechanisms while endogenous mechanisms would inactivate e coli more slowly under moderate ph conditions davies colley et al 1997 1999 the effects of ph on e coli have been attributed to conformational changes in the membrane of the bacteria bosshard et al 2010 bacterial inactivation can result from respiratory chain damage due to a physical breakdown in the membrane which exposes nucleic acids to environmental stresses liu et al 2019 we stress that while relationships between e coli temperature ph do and spc have been reported this work demonstrates a strong relationship between anomalies of these water quality variables rather than absolute values as is more traditionally investigated and presented still more work is needed to elucidate the relationships between water quality parameters that characterize the potential habitat for e coli and the observed e coli concentrations we present relationships using only 4 water quality variables and acknowledge that many more potential variables could be measured which may demonstrate stronger correlations with spatial patterns of e coli concentrations these may include variables such as turbidity orp cyanobacteria density or concentrations of ionic nutrients such as nitrates phosphates and ammonia or ammonium identification of important variables which control habitat conditions for e coli is an important avenue for future research since these variables may be used solely or concurrently to predict e coli levels using instantaneous sensor measurements stocker et al 2019 stocker et al 2022 numerous methods exist for determining significant patterns in data resulting from an eof or pca analysis in this work we chose the technique proposed by overland and preisendorfer 1982 known as north s rule of thumb which repeatedly computes eigenvalues of the covariance matrix and returns the 95th quantiles if the confidence interval is comparable to or larger than the spacing between neighboring eigenvalues then the distinction between variances is likely due not to sampling error and noise but rather due to interpretable patterns in the data other methods include bootstrap and monte carlo based methods which have shown both advantages and disadvantages babamoradi et al 2013 bjornsson and venegas 1997 it would also be interesting and advantageous for future work to see the eof separation techniques such as eof rotations affect the interpretability of results from an eof analysis in general the eofs explained more variance over one year than over the combined 3 year period table 3 however the emergence of interpretable signals patterns from the noise according to north s test was not noted for any eof found in a 1 year observation period three years of data were necessary to delineate the significant spatial patterns in the data it remains to be seen whether the sheer amount of sampling dates or the temporal extent of observations control the relationship between eof and noise in this case additionally the authors note that the first several eofs in various years explain a non trivial fraction of the total variance explained however they were not found to be significant researchers may elect to choose different significance tests or analyze non significant eofs and ecs which may provide additional insight into their data methods other than eof are applicable for spatial pattern recognition in time series from grid sampling in particular the mean relative difference mrd analysis was recently applied to studies documenting temporally stable spatial patterns of e coli concentrations in ponds pachepsky et al 2018 stocker et al 2021 the mrd analysis uses relative anomalies whereas the eof analysis works with absolute anomalies this presents some advantages to the mrd technique when there are large temporal variations of the studied variable on the other hand the mrd analysis generates a single pattern the eof analysis reveals several different spatial eofs and temporal ecs patterns that may also represent large fractions of the variability and can be attributed to separate mechanisms affecting the observed spatiotemporal variability additionally there are several methods to determine the significance of eofs but no such techniques are known for the mrd analysis overall each of the spatial pattern recognition methods has useful features and the methods can be complementary vereecken et al 2016 the existence of stable spatial patterns in e coli anomalies must be accounted for in microbial water quality monitoring design in both ponds sampling from the banks generally resulted in higher e coli concentration measurements than sampling in the interior the conservative estimation of e coli concentrations depends on the intended water use the microbial water quality evaluation of recreational waters is focused on the nearshore areas whereas the irrigation water from ponds comes mostly from the pond interior the existence of relationships between temporally stable patterns of ph and do on the one hand and e coli on the other hand may also be useful in monitoring design since documenting spatial variability of ph do and temperature using in situ sensing measurements is more practical than fine multi location measurements of e coli concentrations 5 conclusions spatial patterns in logarithms of e coli concentrations were found to be stable in time in the two irrigations ponds used in the current study the empirical orthogonal function method was effective in identifying these patterns patterns of e coli concentrations were correlated with patterns of habitat defining water quality parameters such as temperature do ph and spc additionally the identified patterns could be related to potential sources and pathways for the microorganism in the pond systems revealing and quantifying temporarily stable spatial patterns of fecal indicator concentrations can be useful in designing monitoring campaigns to assess the microbial water quality in ponds credit authorship contribution statement matthew d stocker methodology

3431,study on co2 breakthrough pressures in caprocks under formation temperatures t and pressures p which can make co2 in gaseous liquid and supercritical states are vital to the seal ability of caprocks for co2 sequestration laboratory testing is necessary to obtain breakthrough pressures as there is no in situ method to accurately estimate the factors that can affect its variability in this study we use the step by step method to study co2 breakthrough pressures in unsaturated low permeability sandstone and carried out 9 cases of co2 breakthrough pressure experiments under multiple p t conditions that can make co2 in gaseous liquid and supercritical states respectively the variation of co2 breakthrough pressures pbt were analyzed based on 4 properties of multi phase flow co2 h2o interfacial tension γ co2 h2o rock wettability co2 h2o viscosity ratio m and co2 h2o density difference the results show that co2 breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time are positively correlated with experimental temperatures and pressures the main property affecting co2 breakthrough pressures is the co2 h2o viscosity ratio which is more affected by the p t conditions or co2 phase moreover the breakthrough pressures of co2 under 9 groups of multiple p t conditions which can make co2 in various phases is supercritical co2 liquid co2 gaseous co2 this study has important guiding significance for the selection of target caprock for co2 geo sequestration keywords co2 geo sequestration co2 phase multiple p t conditions co2 breakthrough pressure 1 introduction co2 geo sequestration is considered to be an effective method to reduce greenhouse gases within the existing technical capacities kim et al 2018 fan et al 2019 oh et al 2019 xu et al 2020 sun et al 2021 when co2 is injected into deep reservoirs and encounters impermeable or low permeability rocks its migration is restricted and then it is enclosed by stratigraphic formation sun et al 2017 zhang et al 2021 at the early stage of co2 injection into the formation when the accumulated pressure of co2 in the reservoir exceeds a certain value co2 will break through the caprock and leak bachu et al 2007 low permeability sandstones can be regarded as caprock zhao and yu 2017 co2 breakthrough pressure is one of the key parameters for evaluating caprock sealing ability for co2 sequestration espinoza and santamarina 2017 guiltinan et al 2018 laboratory measurement is the most important means to obtain breakthrough pressure as it is difficult for field testing the methods for measuring breakthrough pressure are mainly divided into direct and indirect methods indirect methods include pore structure measurement methods such as mercury pressure and gas adsorption to derive gas breakthrough pressure with slightly poorer accuracy hildenbrand et al 2013 the direct method includes step by step continuous displacement and pulse methods ito et al 2010 among which the step by step method is done by gradually increasing the gas injection pressure at the inlet of rock sample until there is gas flow at the outlet gas breakthrough pressure in laboratory test based on step by step method is defined as the pressure difference between the inlet non wetting phase and outlet wetting phase of the rock core this definition and method have been widely used by many scholars for the measurement of gas breakthrough pressure in laboratory li and yu 2020 many scholars have studied the co2 breakthrough pressure in rock specimens li et al 2005 conducted co2 breakthrough pressure experiments based on the step by step method the results show that the low permeability caprock which were sampled systematically from the top to the bottom of weyburn midale evaporite formation and were mostly the anhydrite shale break slightly shaly and dolomite have high sequestration performance when the breakthrough pressure of co2 is up to 21 mpa breakthrough pressure of supercritical co2 was studied by tokunaga et al 2013 the results show that co2 was more easily accessible to the silica rich reservoir due to the reduced wettability zhao and yu 2017 conducted co2 breakthrough pressure experiments using low permeability sandstones with different water saturations and analyzed the factors affecting the breakthrough pressure the results show that co2 breakthrough pressure increases exponentially with the increase of water saturation the effects of co2 breakthrough pressure and water production in displacement experiments were also studied by al zaidi et al 2018 they analyzed the influencing factors of the displacing process on co2 breakthrough time zhao and yu 2018 investigated the breakthrough pressure and permeability of co2 using five different saturated and low permeability sandstone samples they found that low permeability sandstones have significant sealing capacity li and yu 2020 investigated the effect of initial water saturation on co2 breakthrough pressure based on comsol multiphysics the simulation results show that both co2 breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time are exponentially related to the initial water saturation moreover xu et al 2021 studied the effect of co2 injection pressure on the dynamic strain response and co2 injection process the results show that the surface strain response is linearly correlated with the co2 injection pressure in summary most studies have focused on breakthrough pressures of single phase co2 especially supercritical co2 in actual reservoirs the p t conditions are complex and the fluid states can change with the variation of depth and location meanwhile caprock including low permeability sandstone cannot be completely saturated in some special position zhao and yu 2017 zhao and yu 2018 therefore the study of co2 breakthrough pressures in unsaturated low permeability sandstones under multiple p t conditions which can make co2 in various phases is important for the evaluation of sealing performance of caprock for co2 geo sequestration in this study we focus on the effects of phase characteristics on co2 breakthrough pressures in an unsaturated low permeability sandstone sample one rock sample with 30 saturation and 3 phases of co2 gaseous liquid and supercritical combined with 9 groups of p t conditions have been adopted the variation trends of co2 breakthrough pressure and time are investigated in detail this study has guiding significance for the selection of target reservoirs for co2 geo sequestration and it is also of great value to evaluate the breakthrough pressure of co2 in various reservoirs moreover study on the breakthrough pressure of full phase co2 can provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for strengthening the sequestration of supercritical co2 in deep reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock core the materials used in this study include co2 with the purity of 99 99 deionized water and a sandstone sample drilled from the deep formation of ordos basin china this sample is very suitable for the study of co2 breakthrough pressure as it is low permeability sandstone the specification of rock core is ф25 mm 29 mm which is shown in fig 1 the relative contents of mineral compositions in this sample were analyzed by x ray diffraction analysis as shown in table 1 this sandstone sample is mainly composed of quartz interstitial filler rock fragment biotitle and feldspar in addition to the mineral composition this rock sample was further investigated by microscopy as can be seen in fig 2 quartz is sub angular with the grain size of 0 25 0 4 mm and directed distribution the biotitle is long flakes with the diameter of 0 15 0 40 mm the feldspar is slate shaped well rounded with the grain size of 0 15 0 45 mm in order to visualize the three dimensional pore structure of this sample the rock core was microscopically photographed by field emission scanning electron microscopy and the scale of the electron microscope images was 2 0 μm as shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the pores and mineral grains are irregular in shape and the pore diameters are about 0 01 0 53 μm the pore structure of rock core affects its permeability thus a conventional mercury pressure experiment was conducted and the permeability of rock core was measured to be 0 005 md and the porosity was 3 17 as shown in fig 4 the maximum pore throat radius of rock core is 0 267 μm the average pore throat radius is 0 059 μm and the median pore throat radius is 0 017 μm respectively 2 2 experimental apparatus the diagram of experimental device is shown in fig 5 the device can be used to determine the gas breakthrough pressure in sandstone mud shale and other rock samples under different p t and various gas composition conditions the experimental apparatus includes 1 gas pressure regulating system 2 gas injection system 3 liquid injection system 4 evacuation system 5 rock core clamping system 6 detection system and 7 constant temperature control system among which the fiber pipe can accurately detect the breakthrough or escape of gases 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 preparation of unsaturated rock core firstly rock core was dried at 105 c for 8 h and the dry weight defined as m0 was measured the core sample was then vacuumed 0 1 mpa for 5 h after which it was completely submerged in deionized water to ensure uniform saturation and then the water bath was pressurized with helium to 18 mpa for 12 h until the weight of the core no longer increased at which point the saturation weight of the core was defined as m1 finally dry the saturated rock core at 105 c until it reaches the saturation of 30 the purpose of this saturation is to make the breakthrough process of co2 neither too difficult nor too easy and this residual weight was defined as m2 zhao and yu 2017 zhao and yu 2018 the calculation equation is as perrin et al 2009 li et al 2017 1 s w m 2 m 0 m 1 m 0 100 where sw is the saturation of rock core m0 is the dry weight of rock core g m1 is the weight of fully saturated rock core g m2 is the weight of the rock core after drying for a period of time 2 3 2 co2 breakthrough pressure experiments co2 breakthrough pressure experiments were performed using a high precision step by step method the specific steps were as follows 1 check the apparatus make apparatus calibration and check the gas tightness of the apparatus the rock core should be re prepared with 30 saturation before the start of each experiment put the rock core into the core holder connect all the pipes and tighten the joints turn on the thermostat to set the temperature so that it reaches the experimental temperatures 20 40 or 60 and a constant temperature was maintained after the temperature was stabilized increase the confining pressure to 20 mpa and keep it unchanged to ensure that fluids flow through the core pore channels and did not escape from around the rock core 2 in the experiments the back pressure experimental pressure was set to 2 4 or 8 mpa respectively then gradually increase the injection pressure of co2 start from the same value as the back pressure according to table 2 at the inlet of the rock core until there was detected co2 at the outlet which means that co2 has broken through the pressure increment and constant pressure time at the entrance of the rock core were performed exactly according to the national standard of sy t5748 2020 which is shown in table 2 it should be noted that table 2 is completely quoted from the standard of sy t5748 2020 and the pressure range involved in this table far exceeds the pressure range involved in the experiments meanwhile table 3 shows the phase characteristics of co2 in 9 groups of experimental conditions the back pressures experimental pressures were set according to the pressure values in table 3 3 the fiber pipe was used to detect the escape of co2 if gas escapes the fiber pipe will light up and the computer terminal will record the pressure values at this time the pressure difference the accuracy of the pressure values recorded by the computer is retained to two digit decimal places between the inlet and outlet of the rock core was recognized as the co2 breakthrough pressure and the duration was the breakthrough time after co2 breakthrough the rock core was taken out from the holder and was weighed to obtain the residual water saturation at the breakthrough point in each experiment in addition the effective permeability of co2 was obtained after co2 break through the rock as we can t get an accurate co2 flow rate value during the experiments after co2 break though the volumetric flow rate q of co2 exiting from the outlet the pressures at the inlet p1 and outlet p2 were all stabilized the effective permeability of co2 was obtained from the following expression zhang et al 2021 2 k 2 p a q μ l z a p 1 2 p 2 2 z a where k is the effective permeability of co2 after breakthrough md pa is the standard atmospheric pressure q is the volumetric rate flow ml s which can be recorded in the outlet end of rock core μ is the gas dynamic viscosity under experimental conditions its value can be obtained from https webbook nist gov chemistry fluid z is the gas compression factor at experimental temperature and pressure and can be found in https www ap1700 com the data is in full agreement with the united states national bureau of standards thermal physical parameters p1 and p2 are the pressure values at the inlet and outlet ends of the rock core respectively mpa za is the compression factor at the experimental temperature and standard atmospheric pressure and l and a are the length cm and cross sectional area cm2 of the rock core respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results according to the above experimental conditions which can make co2 in various phases 9 cases of co2 breakthrough pressure experiments were conducted on an unsaturated low permeability sandstone rock sample and the experimental results are shown in figs 6 7 and 8 it can be concluded that the breakthrough pressures of co2 under 9 groups of multiple p t conditions which can make co2 in various phases is supercritical co2 liquid co2 gaseous co2 moreover it can be seen from fig 6 a that when the temperature is constant 20 40 and 6 with the increase of experimental pressures specifically refers to the back pressures set in each group of experiments the residual water saturation calculated based on equation 1 in rock core at breakthrough point all decrease at a constant pressure 2 4 and 8 mpa the residual water saturation at breakthrough point decrease with the increase of temperature the effective permeability of co2 can be calculated based on equation 2 the relationship of co2 breakthrough pressure and its effective permeability is shown in fig 6b overall co2 effective permeability and breakthrough pressure are negatively correlated with the increase of effective permeability co2 breakthrough pressures decrease and the curve tends to be stable then based on fig 7 it can be seen that 9 cases of co2 breakthrough pressures all increase with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures to further determine the quantitative functional relationship between experimental temperatures and pressures and co2 breakthrough pressures the experimental results were fitted it is found that the co2 breakthrough pressure as a function of experimental pressure and temperature could be expressed as an exponential function fig 7 the correlation coefficient r2 of each fitted curve is greater than 0 99 which indicates the accuracy and validity of the functions the functions between co2 breakthrough pressures and experimental temperatures and pressures can be written uniformly as the following equations respectively 3 p bt a e bp 4 p bt c e dt where pbt is co2 breakthrough pressure mpa p is the experimental pressure mpa t is the experimental temperature a b c and d are the fitting parameters the relationship between the fitted parameters a and b and experimental p t conditions is shown in table 4 the value of the fitted parameter a increases with increasing temperatures while the value of b decreases with increasing temperatures when the temperature increases from 20 c to 60 c the value of a increases from 0 3690 to 0 5313 1 44 times increase and the value of b decreases from 0 1174 to 0 0997 0 85 times decrease which shows that the temperature has a higher effect on the parameter a and the larger the value of a the higher the co2 breakthrough pressures as can be shown in table 5 the value of the fitted parameter c increases with increasing pressures while the value of d decreases with increasing pressures when the pressure increases from 2 to 8 mpa the value of c increases from 0 3863 to 0 8688 2 25 times increase and the value of d decreases from 0 0089 to 0 0054 0 61 times decrease which shows that the effect of experimental pressures on parameter c is higher than that of parameter d and the parameter c has a larger effect on co2 breakthrough pressure i e the larger the value of c the greater the co2 breakthrough pressures based on table 4 and 5 it can be seen that parameter a and c increases with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures respectively parameter b and d decrease with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures respectively the values of the fitted parameters are all influenced by experimental temperatures and pressures however experimental pressure has a higher influence on the parameters therefore co2 breakthrough pressure is more obviously affected by experimental pressures based on tables 4 and 5 it is demonstrated that co2 breakthrough time is influenced by experimental temperatures and pressures in the same way co2 breakthrough time increases with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures the relationship between co2 breakthrough time and experimental temperature and pressure can be expressed by exponential functions fig 8 as follows 5 t bt i e jp 6 t bt k e lt where tbt is co2 breakthrough time min p is the experimental pressure mpa t is the experimental temperature i j k and l are the fitting parameters the fitted parameters of i j k and l in relation to experimental temperatures and pressures are shown in table 6 it can be seen that parameter i increases with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures when the temperature increase from 20 to 60 the values of i increase from 45 9016 to 60 008 1 31 times increase and the values of j remain unchanged as can be seen in table 7 the values of the fitted parameters of k and l increase with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures respectively when the pressures increase from 2 to 8 mpa the values of k increase from 48 6520 to 83 7866 1 72 times increase and the values of l are irregular therefore the parameters j and l change very little with the change of experimental temperatures and pressures which indicates that the effect of experimental p t conditions on parameters j and l can be ignored 3 2 discussion 3 2 1 effect of interfacial tension on co2 breakthrough pressure interfacial tension of co2 h2o system is an important indicator to evaluate the characteristics of two phase flow li et al 2019 based on the experimental results of co2 breakthrough pressure and the values of co2 h2o interfacial tension under 9 groups of p t conditions the variation diagram of co2 breakthrough pressure with interfacial tension is shown in fig 9 the values of interfacial tensions are obtained from other studies akutsu et al 2007 li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 al yaseri et al 2021 based on fig 9 when experimental pressure is constant the interfacial tension increases with the increase of temperature and co2 breakthrough pressure also increases however when the temperature is constant the interfacial tension decreases as the experimental pressure increases but the co2 breakthrough pressure increases instead in the existing research the higher the co2 h2o interfacial tension the higher the capillary pressure to be overcome during co2 drainage li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 li et al 2017 li and yu 2020 which may lead to a higher co2 breakthrough pressure and a longer breakthrough time however a conclusion contrary to the original cognition appeared in this experimental study 3 2 2 effect of wettability on co2 breakthrough pressure wettability is generally evaluated by contact angle θ in co2 h2o rock systems shi et al 2010 as shown in fig 10 the contact angles are smaller than 90 under the p t conditions given in this study cheng and yu 2019 based on the young laplace equation 7 the contact angle like interfacial tension can affect the capillary entry pressure and then affect co2 breakthrough pressure it can be described as 7 p c 2 γ cos θ r where pc is the capillary entry pressure mpa γ is the co2 h2o interfacial tension mn m θ is the contact angle and r is the effective pore radius in rock μm tokunaga et al 2013 in fig 10 with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures the contact angle increases ameri et al 2013 singh et al 2016 pan et al 2019 and the values of cos θ decrease in the range of 1 0 as contact angle is smaller than 90 which indicates that the rock is strongly hydrophilic and have strong wettability resulting in a smaller capillary entry pressure pc and then reduces the co2 breakthrough pressure however the test of contact angle is very complex and so far there is no clear conclusion to show how the contact angle of the co2 h2o rock system changes with p t conditions li et al 2021 the data in fig 10 is only a combination of conclusions from other studies which are only applicable to specific experimental conditions moreover compared with the variation range of interfacial tension the variation range of cos θ is 1 0 which can be ignored moreover as the measurement of contact angle is very complex and there is no unified conclusion about the change of contact angle with temperature and pressure li et al 2017 therefore we only cite representative data to clarify the qualitative change trend of contact angle with temperature and pressure 3 2 3 effect of viscosity ratio on co2 breakthrough pressure in core flooding experiments the viscosity of co2 is significantly influenced by p t conditions meyer et al 2009 li et al 2021 as co2 is much less viscous than water and the viscosity ratio between them is small viscous fingering phenomenon occurs during the displacement process and leads to unstable displacement kuo and benson 2015 the viscosity ratios of the two phase flow under 9 groups of p t conditions are shown in table 8 the data are obtained from the website of https webbook nist gov chemistry fluid where the viscosity ratio of two phase can be expressed by the following equation randive and dalal 2014 8 m μ nw μ w where m is the viscosity ratio μnw is the viscosity of the non wetting phase co2 μw is the viscosity of the wetting phase h2o in fig 11 it can be seen that when the experimental pressure is constant 2 4 mpa the viscosity ratio increases continuously with the increasing temperature which then leads to increasing co2 breakthrough pressures when experimental pressure is 8 mpa the viscosity ratio decreases and then increases with increasing temperatures however there is an exception occurred at 20 c 8 mpa which is mainly due to the co2 is in liquid state at 20 c 8mp and liquid co2 is characterized by high density high viscosity and incompressibility kuo and benson 2015 lv 2019 and therefore has a high viscosity ratio of two phase fluids at 20 c 8 mpa when the temperature is constant the viscosity ratio keeps increasing as the pressure increase which then leads to a constant increase in breakthrough pressure 3 2 4 effect of density difference on co2 breakthrough pressure during the process of core flooding experiments densities of co2 and h2o will change accordingly with the change of p t conditions change of density difference between two phase fluids can significantly affect the displacement process li et al 2017 co2 density h2o density and co2 h2o density difference for various p t conditions in this study are shown in table 9 data are derived from the website of http webbook nist gov chemistry fluid as shown in table 9 when the temperature is constant the co2 h2o density difference decreases with the increase of experimental pressures when experimental pressure is 2 mpa and 4 mpa density difference decreases with the increase of temperatures while when experimental pressure is 8 mpa the density difference increases with the increase of temperatures in fig 12 co2 breakthrough pressure increase with decreasing co2 h2o density difference at 2 and 4 mpa and increases with increasing co2 h2o density difference at 8 mpa fig 12a meanwhile when the temperature is constant co2 breakthrough pressures decrease with the increase density difference fig 12b above all the influence law of density difference on co2 breakthrough pressure is not obvious 3 2 5 determination of the type of displacement zhang et al 2011 and hussain et al 2012 investigated the effect of viscous and capillary forces on unstable displacement using a two dimensional homogeneous microscopic model and plotted the observed displacement states on a log ca log m stable phase diagram by adjusting the co2 h2o viscosity ratio m and capillary number ca the boundaries of the three displacement states of viscous fingering capillary fingering and stable displacement were determined in this study we further investigated the effects of viscous and capillary forces on displacement process to determine the main factors affecting the experimental results in order to obtain fig 13 the capillary number and viscosity ratio are calculated based on co2 breakthrough experiments viscosity ratio can be calculated by eq 8 and the capillary number can be calculated by the following equation basirat et al 2017 9 c a μ nw v γ where ca is the capillary number μnw is the viscosity of the non wetting phase co2 v is the co2 flow rate m s γ is the interfacial tension of co2 h2o system n m the stable phase diagram of this study is plotted based on the boundaries determined by zhang et al 2011 and the results are shown in fig 13 it should be noted that as the solubility of co2 in water is very small and negligible li and yu 2014 we only consider the capillary number under the condition of immiscibility the values of log ca are in the range of 3 72 to 4 90 and log m are in the range of 1 37 to 1 82 with all points falling in the viscous fingering region it indicates that the breakthrough process under the 9 cases of p t conditions is dominated by viscous forces therefore the capillary force is not the key factor for co2 breakthrough process 4 conclusion as it is important to investigate the process of co2 breakthrough in unsaturated low permeability sandstone for the evaluation of sealing capacity of caprock for co2 geo sequestration in this study 9 cases of co2 breakthrough pressure experiments were carried out based on the step by step method the influence mechanisms of p t conditions or phase characteristics on co2 breakthrough pressure were discussed in detail this study has guiding significance for the selection of target reservoirs for co2 geo sequestration and it is also of great value to evaluate the breakthrough pressure of co2 in various reservoirs moreover study on the breakthrough pressure of full phase co2 can provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for strengthening the sequestration of supercritical co2 in deep reservoirs the main conclusions are as follows 1 co2 breakthrough pressures increase with the increase of experimental pressures and temperatures the relationship between co2 breakthrough pressures and p t conditions can be described by exponential functions the equation of co2 breakthrough pressure with experimental pressure is p bt a e bp when experimental pressure is constant the sensitivity of parameter a to temperature is higher than that of parameter b thus co2 breakthrough pressure depends mainly on the parameter a the equation of co2 breakthrough pressure with temperature is p bt c e dt when temperature is constant the sensitivity of parameter c to pressure is higher than that of parameter d thus co2 breakthrough pressure depends mainly on parameter c however more experiments are needed to determine the specific value or value range of the fitting coefficients 2 co2 breakthrough time is also positively correlated with the experimental temperatures and pressures the equation of co2 breakthrough time with experimental pressure is t bt i e jp at the constant temperature parameter i increase with increasing temperature while parameter j does not vary significantly thus co2 breakthrough time depends mainly on parameter j the equation of co2 breakthrough time with temperature is t bt k e lt at the constant pressure parameter k increases as the pressure increases and the change of parameter l is much smaller than that of parameter k thus co2 breakthrough time depends mainly on parameter k 3 there are 4 properties of two phase fluids that can significantly influence the displacement characteristics were discussed deeply in this study for instance 1 the interfacial tension in co2 h2o system can be affected by p t conditions the interfacial tension increases with the increase of temperature when experimental pressure is constant and decreases with the increase of pressure when the experimental temperature is constant however the effect of interfacial tension on co2 breakthrough pressure is not obvious 2 the contact angle in the co2 h2o rock system is very complex and has very small effects on the experimental results which can be ignored 3 with the increase of temperatures and pressures the viscosity ratio showed an overall increasing trend except for the viscosity ratio at 20 c 8 mpa co2 is in liquid state and the effect of viscosity ratio on co2 breakthrough pressure is relatively obvious 4 co2 breakthrough pressure increases with decreasing density difference at 2 and 4 mpa and increases with increasing density difference at 8 mpa when the temperature is constant co2 breakthrough pressure decreases with the increase of co2 h2o density difference its influence on the experimental results is not significant enough 4 in order to further determine the main factors affecting the experimental results the stable phase diagram was used in this study log ca ranges from 3 72 to 4 90 and log m ranges from 1 37 to 1 82 it can be determined that the dominant factor influencing co2 breakthrough process under the p t conditions in this study is the viscous force while the capillary force is less influential 5 on the whole in this study the values of co2 breakthrough pressures under 9 groups of multiple p t conditions which can make co2 in various phases is supercritical co2 liquid co2 gaseous co2 it is verified again that in the case of the same caprock supercritical co2 is the least likely to break through it and escape while gaseous co2 is the most likely to leak credit authorship contribution statement yi li

increase of water saturation the effects of co2 breakthrough pressure and water production in displacement experiments were also studied by al zaidi et al 2018 they analyzed the influencing factors of the displacing process on co2 breakthrough time zhao and yu 2018 investigated the breakthrough pressure and permeability of co2 using five different saturated and low permeability sandstone samples they found that low permeability sandstones have significant sealing capacity li and yu 2020 investigated the effect of initial water saturation on co2 breakthrough pressure based on comsol multiphysics the simulation results show that both co2 breakthrough pressure and breakthrough time are exponentially related to the initial water saturation moreover xu et al 2021 studied the effect of co2 injection pressure on the dynamic strain response and co2 injection process the results show that the surface strain response is linearly correlated with the co2 injection pressure in summary most studies have focused on breakthrough pressures of single phase co2 especially supercritical co2 in actual reservoirs the p t conditions are complex and the fluid states can change with the variation of depth and location meanwhile caprock including low permeability sandstone cannot be completely saturated in some special position zhao and yu 2017 zhao and yu 2018 therefore the study of co2 breakthrough pressures in unsaturated low permeability sandstones under multiple p t conditions which can make co2 in various phases is important for the evaluation of sealing performance of caprock for co2 geo sequestration in this study we focus on the effects of phase characteristics on co2 breakthrough pressures in an unsaturated low permeability sandstone sample one rock sample with 30 saturation and 3 phases of co2 gaseous liquid and supercritical combined with 9 groups of p t conditions have been adopted the variation trends of co2 breakthrough pressure and time are investigated in detail this study has guiding significance for the selection of target reservoirs for co2 geo sequestration and it is also of great value to evaluate the breakthrough pressure of co2 in various reservoirs moreover study on the breakthrough pressure of full phase co2 can provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for strengthening the sequestration of supercritical co2 in deep reservoirs 2 materials and methods 2 1 rock core the materials used in this study include co2 with the purity of 99 99 deionized water and a sandstone sample drilled from the deep formation of ordos basin china this sample is very suitable for the study of co2 breakthrough pressure as it is low permeability sandstone the specification of rock core is ф25 mm 29 mm which is shown in fig 1 the relative contents of mineral compositions in this sample were analyzed by x ray diffraction analysis as shown in table 1 this sandstone sample is mainly composed of quartz interstitial filler rock fragment biotitle and feldspar in addition to the mineral composition this rock sample was further investigated by microscopy as can be seen in fig 2 quartz is sub angular with the grain size of 0 25 0 4 mm and directed distribution the biotitle is long flakes with the diameter of 0 15 0 40 mm the feldspar is slate shaped well rounded with the grain size of 0 15 0 45 mm in order to visualize the three dimensional pore structure of this sample the rock core was microscopically photographed by field emission scanning electron microscopy and the scale of the electron microscope images was 2 0 μm as shown in fig 3 it can be seen that the pores and mineral grains are irregular in shape and the pore diameters are about 0 01 0 53 μm the pore structure of rock core affects its permeability thus a conventional mercury pressure experiment was conducted and the permeability of rock core was measured to be 0 005 md and the porosity was 3 17 as shown in fig 4 the maximum pore throat radius of rock core is 0 267 μm the average pore throat radius is 0 059 μm and the median pore throat radius is 0 017 μm respectively 2 2 experimental apparatus the diagram of experimental device is shown in fig 5 the device can be used to determine the gas breakthrough pressure in sandstone mud shale and other rock samples under different p t and various gas composition conditions the experimental apparatus includes 1 gas pressure regulating system 2 gas injection system 3 liquid injection system 4 evacuation system 5 rock core clamping system 6 detection system and 7 constant temperature control system among which the fiber pipe can accurately detect the breakthrough or escape of gases 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 preparation of unsaturated rock core firstly rock core was dried at 105 c for 8 h and the dry weight defined as m0 was measured the core sample was then vacuumed 0 1 mpa for 5 h after which it was completely submerged in deionized water to ensure uniform saturation and then the water bath was pressurized with helium to 18 mpa for 12 h until the weight of the core no longer increased at which point the saturation weight of the core was defined as m1 finally dry the saturated rock core at 105 c until it reaches the saturation of 30 the purpose of this saturation is to make the breakthrough process of co2 neither too difficult nor too easy and this residual weight was defined as m2 zhao and yu 2017 zhao and yu 2018 the calculation equation is as perrin et al 2009 li et al 2017 1 s w m 2 m 0 m 1 m 0 100 where sw is the saturation of rock core m0 is the dry weight of rock core g m1 is the weight of fully saturated rock core g m2 is the weight of the rock core after drying for a period of time 2 3 2 co2 breakthrough pressure experiments co2 breakthrough pressure experiments were performed using a high precision step by step method the specific steps were as follows 1 check the apparatus make apparatus calibration and check the gas tightness of the apparatus the rock core should be re prepared with 30 saturation before the start of each experiment put the rock core into the core holder connect all the pipes and tighten the joints turn on the thermostat to set the temperature so that it reaches the experimental temperatures 20 40 or 60 and a constant temperature was maintained after the temperature was stabilized increase the confining pressure to 20 mpa and keep it unchanged to ensure that fluids flow through the core pore channels and did not escape from around the rock core 2 in the experiments the back pressure experimental pressure was set to 2 4 or 8 mpa respectively then gradually increase the injection pressure of co2 start from the same value as the back pressure according to table 2 at the inlet of the rock core until there was detected co2 at the outlet which means that co2 has broken through the pressure increment and constant pressure time at the entrance of the rock core were performed exactly according to the national standard of sy t5748 2020 which is shown in table 2 it should be noted that table 2 is completely quoted from the standard of sy t5748 2020 and the pressure range involved in this table far exceeds the pressure range involved in the experiments meanwhile table 3 shows the phase characteristics of co2 in 9 groups of experimental conditions the back pressures experimental pressures were set according to the pressure values in table 3 3 the fiber pipe was used to detect the escape of co2 if gas escapes the fiber pipe will light up and the computer terminal will record the pressure values at this time the pressure difference the accuracy of the pressure values recorded by the computer is retained to two digit decimal places between the inlet and outlet of the rock core was recognized as the co2 breakthrough pressure and the duration was the breakthrough time after co2 breakthrough the rock core was taken out from the holder and was weighed to obtain the residual water saturation at the breakthrough point in each experiment in addition the effective permeability of co2 was obtained after co2 break through the rock as we can t get an accurate co2 flow rate value during the experiments after co2 break though the volumetric flow rate q of co2 exiting from the outlet the pressures at the inlet p1 and outlet p2 were all stabilized the effective permeability of co2 was obtained from the following expression zhang et al 2021 2 k 2 p a q μ l z a p 1 2 p 2 2 z a where k is the effective permeability of co2 after breakthrough md pa is the standard atmospheric pressure q is the volumetric rate flow ml s which can be recorded in the outlet end of rock core μ is the gas dynamic viscosity under experimental conditions its value can be obtained from https webbook nist gov chemistry fluid z is the gas compression factor at experimental temperature and pressure and can be found in https www ap1700 com the data is in full agreement with the united states national bureau of standards thermal physical parameters p1 and p2 are the pressure values at the inlet and outlet ends of the rock core respectively mpa za is the compression factor at the experimental temperature and standard atmospheric pressure and l and a are the length cm and cross sectional area cm2 of the rock core respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 experimental results according to the above experimental conditions which can make co2 in various phases 9 cases of co2 breakthrough pressure experiments were conducted on an unsaturated low permeability sandstone rock sample and the experimental results are shown in figs 6 7 and 8 it can be concluded that the breakthrough pressures of co2 under 9 groups of multiple p t conditions which can make co2 in various phases is supercritical co2 liquid co2 gaseous co2 moreover it can be seen from fig 6 a that when the temperature is constant 20 40 and 6 with the increase of experimental pressures specifically refers to the back pressures set in each group of experiments the residual water saturation calculated based on equation 1 in rock core at breakthrough point all decrease at a constant pressure 2 4 and 8 mpa the residual water saturation at breakthrough point decrease with the increase of temperature the effective permeability of co2 can be calculated based on equation 2 the relationship of co2 breakthrough pressure and its effective permeability is shown in fig 6b overall co2 effective permeability and breakthrough pressure are negatively correlated with the increase of effective permeability co2 breakthrough pressures decrease and the curve tends to be stable then based on fig 7 it can be seen that 9 cases of co2 breakthrough pressures all increase with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures to further determine the quantitative functional relationship between experimental temperatures and pressures and co2 breakthrough pressures the experimental results were fitted it is found that the co2 breakthrough pressure as a function of experimental pressure and temperature could be expressed as an exponential function fig 7 the correlation coefficient r2 of each fitted curve is greater than 0 99 which indicates the accuracy and validity of the functions the functions between co2 breakthrough pressures and experimental temperatures and pressures can be written uniformly as the following equations respectively 3 p bt a e bp 4 p bt c e dt where pbt is co2 breakthrough pressure mpa p is the experimental pressure mpa t is the experimental temperature a b c and d are the fitting parameters the relationship between the fitted parameters a and b and experimental p t conditions is shown in table 4 the value of the fitted parameter a increases with increasing temperatures while the value of b decreases with increasing temperatures when the temperature increases from 20 c to 60 c the value of a increases from 0 3690 to 0 5313 1 44 times increase and the value of b decreases from 0 1174 to 0 0997 0 85 times decrease which shows that the temperature has a higher effect on the parameter a and the larger the value of a the higher the co2 breakthrough pressures as can be shown in table 5 the value of the fitted parameter c increases with increasing pressures while the value of d decreases with increasing pressures when the pressure increases from 2 to 8 mpa the value of c increases from 0 3863 to 0 8688 2 25 times increase and the value of d decreases from 0 0089 to 0 0054 0 61 times decrease which shows that the effect of experimental pressures on parameter c is higher than that of parameter d and the parameter c has a larger effect on co2 breakthrough pressure i e the larger the value of c the greater the co2 breakthrough pressures based on table 4 and 5 it can be seen that parameter a and c increases with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures respectively parameter b and d decrease with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures respectively the values of the fitted parameters are all influenced by experimental temperatures and pressures however experimental pressure has a higher influence on the parameters therefore co2 breakthrough pressure is more obviously affected by experimental pressures based on tables 4 and 5 it is demonstrated that co2 breakthrough time is influenced by experimental temperatures and pressures in the same way co2 breakthrough time increases with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures the relationship between co2 breakthrough time and experimental temperature and pressure can be expressed by exponential functions fig 8 as follows 5 t bt i e jp 6 t bt k e lt where tbt is co2 breakthrough time min p is the experimental pressure mpa t is the experimental temperature i j k and l are the fitting parameters the fitted parameters of i j k and l in relation to experimental temperatures and pressures are shown in table 6 it can be seen that parameter i increases with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures when the temperature increase from 20 to 60 the values of i increase from 45 9016 to 60 008 1 31 times increase and the values of j remain unchanged as can be seen in table 7 the values of the fitted parameters of k and l increase with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures respectively when the pressures increase from 2 to 8 mpa the values of k increase from 48 6520 to 83 7866 1 72 times increase and the values of l are irregular therefore the parameters j and l change very little with the change of experimental temperatures and pressures which indicates that the effect of experimental p t conditions on parameters j and l can be ignored 3 2 discussion 3 2 1 effect of interfacial tension on co2 breakthrough pressure interfacial tension of co2 h2o system is an important indicator to evaluate the characteristics of two phase flow li et al 2019 based on the experimental results of co2 breakthrough pressure and the values of co2 h2o interfacial tension under 9 groups of p t conditions the variation diagram of co2 breakthrough pressure with interfacial tension is shown in fig 9 the values of interfacial tensions are obtained from other studies akutsu et al 2007 li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 al yaseri et al 2021 based on fig 9 when experimental pressure is constant the interfacial tension increases with the increase of temperature and co2 breakthrough pressure also increases however when the temperature is constant the interfacial tension decreases as the experimental pressure increases but the co2 breakthrough pressure increases instead in the existing research the higher the co2 h2o interfacial tension the higher the capillary pressure to be overcome during co2 drainage li and yu 2014 li et al 2015 li et al 2017 li and yu 2020 which may lead to a higher co2 breakthrough pressure and a longer breakthrough time however a conclusion contrary to the original cognition appeared in this experimental study 3 2 2 effect of wettability on co2 breakthrough pressure wettability is generally evaluated by contact angle θ in co2 h2o rock systems shi et al 2010 as shown in fig 10 the contact angles are smaller than 90 under the p t conditions given in this study cheng and yu 2019 based on the young laplace equation 7 the contact angle like interfacial tension can affect the capillary entry pressure and then affect co2 breakthrough pressure it can be described as 7 p c 2 γ cos θ r where pc is the capillary entry pressure mpa γ is the co2 h2o interfacial tension mn m θ is the contact angle and r is the effective pore radius in rock μm tokunaga et al 2013 in fig 10 with the increase of experimental temperatures and pressures the contact angle increases ameri et al 2013 singh et al 2016 pan et al 2019 and the values of cos θ decrease in the range of 1 0 as contact angle is smaller than 90 which indicates that the rock is strongly hydrophilic and have strong wettability resulting in a smaller capillary entry pressure pc and then reduces the co2 breakthrough pressure however the test of contact angle is very complex and so far there is no clear conclusion to show how the contact angle of the co2 h2o rock system changes with p t conditions li et al 2021 the data in fig 10 is only a combination of conclusions from other studies which are only applicable to specific experimental conditions moreover compared with the variation range of interfacial tension the variation range of cos θ is 1 0 which can be ignored moreover as the measurement of contact angle is very complex and there is no unified conclusion about the change of contact angle with temperature and pressure li et al 2017 therefore we only cite representative data to clarify the qualitative change trend of contact angle with temperature and pressure 3 2 3 effect of viscosity ratio on co2 breakthrough pressure in core flooding experiments the viscosity of co2 is significantly influenced by p t conditions meyer et al 2009 li et al 2021 as co2 is much less viscous than water and the viscosity ratio between them is small viscous fingering phenomenon occurs during the displacement process and leads to unstable displacement kuo and benson 2015 the viscosity ratios of the two phase flow under 9 groups of p t conditions are shown in table 8 the data are obtained from the website of https webbook nist gov chemistry fluid where the viscosity ratio of two phase can be expressed by the following equation randive and dalal 2014 8 m μ nw μ w where m is the viscosity ratio μnw is the viscosity of the non wetting phase co2 μw is the viscosity of the wetting phase h2o in fig 11 it can be seen that when the experimental pressure is constant 2 4 mpa the viscosity ratio increases continuously with the increasing temperature which then leads to increasing co2 breakthrough pressures when experimental pressure is 8 mpa the viscosity ratio decreases and then increases with increasing temperatures however there is an exception occurred at 20 c 8 mpa which is mainly due to the co2 is in liquid state at 20 c 8mp and liquid co2 is characterized by high density high viscosity and incompressibility kuo and benson 2015 lv 2019 and therefore has a high viscosity ratio of two phase fluids at 20 c 8 mpa when the temperature is constant the viscosity ratio keeps increasing as the pressure increase which then leads to a constant increase in breakthrough pressure 3 2 4 effect of density difference on co2 breakthrough pressure during the process of core flooding experiments densities of co2 and h2o will change accordingly with the change of p t conditions change of density difference between two phase fluids can significantly affect the displacement process li et al 2017 co2 density h2o density and co2 h2o density difference for various p t conditions in this study are shown in table 9 data are derived from the website of http webbook nist gov chemistry fluid as shown in table 9 when the temperature is constant the co2 h2o density difference decreases with the increase of experimental pressures when experimental pressure is 2 mpa and 4 mpa density difference decreases with the increase of temperatures while when experimental pressure is 8 mpa the density difference increases with the increase of temperatures in fig 12 co2 breakthrough pressure increase with decreasing co2 h2o density difference at 2 and 4 mpa and increases with increasing co2 h2o density difference at 8 mpa fig 12a meanwhile when the temperature is constant co2 breakthrough pressures decrease with the increase density difference fig 12b above all the influence law of density difference on co2 breakthrough pressure is not obvious 3 2 5 determination of the type of displacement zhang et al 2011 and hussain et al 2012 investigated the effect of viscous and capillary forces on unstable displacement using a two dimensional homogeneous microscopic model and plotted the observed displacement states on a log ca log m stable phase diagram by adjusting the co2 h2o viscosity ratio m and capillary number ca the boundaries of the three displacement states of viscous fingering capillary fingering and stable displacement were determined in this study we further investigated the effects of viscous and capillary forces on displacement process to determine the main factors affecting the experimental results in order to obtain fig 13 the capillary number and viscosity ratio are calculated based on co2 breakthrough experiments viscosity ratio can be calculated by eq 8 and the capillary number can be calculated by the following equation basirat et al 2017 9 c a μ nw v γ where ca is the capillary number μnw is the viscosity of the non wetting phase co2 v is the co2 flow rate m s γ is the interfacial tension of co2 h2o system n m the stable phase diagram of this study is plotted based on the boundaries determined by zhang et al 2011 and the results are shown in fig 13 it should be noted that as the solubility of co2 in water is very small and negligible li and yu 2014 we only consider the capillary number under the condition of immiscibility the values of log ca are in the range of 3 72 to 4 90 and log m are in the range of 1 37 to 1 82 with all points falling in the viscous fingering region it indicates that the breakthrough process under the 9 cases of p t conditions is dominated by viscous forces therefore the capillary force is not the key factor for co2 breakthrough process 4 conclusion as it is important to investigate the process of co2 breakthrough in unsaturated low permeability sandstone for the evaluation of sealing capacity of caprock for co2 geo sequestration in this study 9 cases of co2 breakthrough pressure experiments were carried out based on the step by step method the influence mechanisms of p t conditions or phase characteristics on co2 breakthrough pressure were discussed in detail this study has guiding significance for the selection of target reservoirs for co2 geo sequestration and it is also of great value to evaluate the breakthrough pressure of co2 in various reservoirs moreover study on the breakthrough pressure of full phase co2 can provide a more comprehensive theoretical basis for strengthening the sequestration of supercritical co2 in deep reservoirs the main conclusions are as follows 1 co2 breakthrough pressures increase with the increase of experimental pressures and temperatures the relationship between co2 breakthrough pressures and p t conditions can be described by exponential functions the equation of co2 breakthrough pressure with experimental pressure is p bt a e bp when experimental pressure is constant the sensitivity of parameter a to temperature is higher than that of parameter b thus co2 breakthrough pressure depends mainly on the parameter a the equation of co2 breakthrough pressure with temperature is p bt c e dt when temperature is constant the sensitivity of parameter c to pressure is higher than that of parameter d thus co2 breakthrough pressure depends mainly on parameter c however more experiments are needed to determine the specific value or value range of the fitting coefficients 2 co2 breakthrough time is also positively correlated with the experimental temperatures and pressures the equation of co2 breakthrough time with experimental pressure is t bt i e jp at the constant temperature parameter i increase with increasing temperature while parameter j does not vary significantly thus co2 breakthrough time depends mainly on parameter j the equation of co2 breakthrough time with temperature is t bt k e lt at the constant pressure parameter k increases as the pressure increases and the change of parameter l is much smaller than that of parameter k thus co2 breakthrough time depends mainly on parameter k 3 there are 4 properties of two phase fluids that can significantly influence the displacement characteristics were discussed deeply in this study for instance 1 the interfacial tension in co2 h2o system can be affected by p t conditions the interfacial tension increases with the increase of temperature when experimental pressure is constant and decreases with the increase of pressure when the experimental temperature is constant however the effect of interfacial tension on co2 breakthrough pressure is not obvious 2 the contact angle in the co2 h2o rock system is very complex and has very small effects on the experimental results which can be ignored 3 with the increase of temperatures and pressures the viscosity ratio showed an overall increasing trend except for the viscosity ratio at 20 c 8 mpa co2 is in liquid state and the effect of viscosity ratio on co2 breakthrough pressure is relatively obvious 4 co2 breakthrough pressure increases with decreasing density difference at 2 and 4 mpa and increases with increasing density difference at 8 mpa when the temperature is constant co2 breakthrough pressure decreases with the increase of co2 h2o density difference its influence on the experimental results is not significant enough 4 in order to further determine the main factors affecting the experimental results the stable phase diagram was used in this study log ca ranges from 3 72 to 4 90 and log m ranges from 1 37 to 1 82 it can be determined that the dominant factor influencing co2 breakthrough process under the p t conditions in this study is the viscous force while the capillary force is less influential 5 on the whole in this study the values of co2 breakthrough pressures under 9 groups of multiple p t conditions which can make co2 in various phases is supercritical co2 liquid co2 gaseous co2 it is verified again that in the case of the same caprock supercritical co2 is the least likely to break through it and escape while gaseous co2 is the most likely to leak credit authorship contribution statement yi li

3432,subsurface drainage modifications are a common practice in agricultural watersheds especially in poorly drained soils of the american midwest yet our understanding of their impact on baseflow generation processes is incomplete by extension these same practices can make baseflow vulnerable to salinization to address these knowledge gaps a combined geochemical and multiple isotope approach was used to identify sources of baseflow and salinity in the wabash river draining indiana ohio and illinois anomalously high salinity and high concentrations of f so4 2 na sr2 and k were measured in baseflow along the headwaters reach of the wabash river from fort recovery oh to huntington in three river sites in the headwaters reach have low 36cl cl ranging from 27 5 x 10 15 to 33 4 x 10 15 that do not fall within the 36cl cl range for monthly precipitation their 36cl cl are consistent with 36cl dilution most likely due to the presence of old cl found in potash kcl fertilizers however the 87sr 86sr ratios of the headwaters reach range from 0 708530 to 0 708904 0 000025 and are similar to silurian bedrock samples 0 708292 0 000047 indicating a geologic source for some solutes the δ18o of the headwaters reach are isotopically light and similar to cold season recharge whereas the δ18o of the downstream river samples are similar to summer precipitation the cl no3 cl br and 36cl cl data point to an anthropogenic source of salinity namely kcl and road salt whereas the f sr2 so4 2 and 87sr 86sr data point to a geologic source of solutes we infer that shallow groundwater that is cl and no3 rich mixes in the river with regional groundwater that is cl and no3 poor the contribution of regional groundwater to baseflow in the headwaters reach is not insignificant 58 percent and these interactions should be considered in future hydrologic models of the upper wabash river without the aid of multiple isotopic and geochemical tracers baseflow generation processes and sources of salinity in the headwaters reach would remain masked by the elevated solute concentrations associated with the shallow aquifers further research is needed to better understand the impact of kcl fertilizers on the overall salinity budgets of agricultural watersheds keywords baseflow agricultural watershed regional groundwater sources of salinity geochemistry isotopes abbreviations uwr upper wabash river mwr middle wabash river lwr lower wabash river ec electrical conductivity spc specific conductivity tds total dissolved solids do dissolved oxygen 1 introduction baseflow in pristine and or relatively undisturbed watersheds is sourced primarily from groundwater and other delayed sources of water hall 1968 although baseflow is present year round in perennial streams it is especially critical in sustaining flow and supporting aquatic life during dry seasons and droughts baseflow generation in agricultural watersheds in comparison is quite complicated due to the presence of subsurface drainage modification systems and their impact on the shallow water table and suspected impacts to recharge to deep aquifers the installation of tile drains and modified tile drains frankenberger et al 2004 fausey 2005 skaggs et al 2010 is a common practice in humid areas with poorly draining soils such as the american midwest while subsurface drainage practices have obvious benefits to crop growth and yields kladivko 2020 it remains uncertain how over a century of drainage modifications has impacted groundwater recharge and baseflow generation in agricultural watersheds schilling 2005 zhang and schilling 2006 unfortunately we lack the field data in many cases to quantify how baseflow has been impacted by drainage modification since tile drain installations either pre date stream gauge installation and or are located in watersheds that are largely ungauged however if we want to understand how aquatic agroecosystems are currently responding and will respond in the future to predicted changes in recharge associated with climate and land use land cover change then it is imperative that we improve our understanding of how drainage modifications alter recharge processes and impact baseflow generation processes in agricultural watersheds today groundwater recharge is traditionally defined as water that has percolated through the unsaturated zone and entered the saturated porous media beneath the water table freeze and cherry 1979 in some agricultural watersheds tile drains control the depth of the shallow water table passively e g traditional drainage or actively e g controlled drainage see frankenberger et al 2004 as a consequence water that recharges the shallow aquifer may be quickly routed to a drain thereby limiting circulation deeper than approximately 1 m and reducing the potential for recharge to deeper aquifers there is growing concern that baseflow in these watersheds is sourced predominantly from tile drainage systems schilling 2005 schilling et al 2012 this has serious implications for water quality salinity nutrient persistence and overall agroecosystem health tesoriero et al 2013 yaeger et al 2013 munn et al 2018 unfortunately baseline geochemical and isotopic surveys of baseflow are lacking for many large agricultural watersheds in the american midwest and globally data from synoptic and longitudinal surveys are sorely needed in these large agricultural watersheds to address the larger knowledge gap two catchment scale studies and one large watershed scale study were initiated in the wabash river watershed in 2015 the two catchment scale studies were conducted in 2015 through 2016 to quantify the sources of baseflow in four small catchments draining agriculturally fragmented land in northern and central indiana frisbee et al 2017 this study revealed that relatively old 60 years nitrate free groundwater from confined glacial outwash sands supported baseflow in one catchment ross reserve located near west lafayette in this catchment was not as heavily impacted by agriculture as an adjacent catchment and as a consequence the geochemistry of baseflow was quite different the adjacent catchment was heavily impacted by agricultural runoff thereby shortening the mean residence times of shallow groundwater and increasing the nitrate concentration substantially frisbee et al 2017 during that same time a synoptic sampling campaign was conducted in october and november of 2015 to identify the sources of baseflow in the much larger wabash river and its major tributaries figs 1 2 the wabash river drains nearly 70 percent of indiana and portions of ohio and illinois it is the largest northern tributary to the ohio river and the ohio river is an important tributary to the mississippi river over 65 percent of the northern wabash river watershed drains agricultural land pyron and neumann 2008 ahiablame et al 2013 wiener et al 2016 the geochemical data from the wabash river sampling campaign revealed high spatial complexity in geochemical concentrations and isotopic compositions for example anomalously high salinity cl coincident with high total dissolved solids tds and high concentrations of sodium na sulfate so4 2 strontium sr2 potassium k and fluoride f were measured in river samples collected along the headwaters reach from fort recovery oh wr1 in figs 1 2 to the forks of the wabash near huntington in wr4 in figs 1 2 these observations pose two interrelated questions what is the source of the high salinity and high tds in the headwaters reach and what does the observed high salinity and tds of baseflow mean with respect to long term water quality in the headwaters of the wabash river while this research was initiated to improve our understanding of the sources of water that support baseflow in large agricultural watersheds the observed high salinity in the headwaters reach of the wabash river watershed has additional implications for the salinization of baseflow and cl legacies in agricultural watersheds freshwater salinization is a global problem kaushal et al 2018 agricultural watersheds such as those in the american midwest are particularly vulnerable to salinization because there are many potential sources of salt that can contribute to salinity including anthropogenic sources such as potash kcl fertilizers seasonal ice snow control using road salt halite septic and industrial effluent home and business water softener systems and dust control on country roads using brines panno et al 2006 kaushal et al 2018 salt can also come from geologic sources warren 2016 such as bedded halite the dissolution of the fluid inclusions in the halite can potentially alter other solute concentrations cendón et al 2008 brennan et al 2013 due to its unique geologic setting and the presence of intensive agricultural practices the headwaters of the wabash river provides a unique setting to address this issue since there are numerous anthropogenic and potential geologic sources that can explain the observed salinity in the study area we investigate the following sources of salinity 1 surface and shallow subsurface runoff from agricultural fields impacted by potash fertilizers kcl or muriate of potash 2 septic effluent vengosh and pankratov 1998 panno et al 2006 wastewater discharge wiener et al 2016 or brine discharge from home water softener systems panno et al 2006 3 discharge from deep sedimentary brines or leaky gas wells given the proximity of the headwaters reach to the trenton gas field keith 1985 and 4 deicing and dust control agents in the study area namely road salt or halite although oil field brines may have been used at one time in portions of northwestern oh kell et al 2004 we also assess regional groundwater discharge from the midwestern basins and arches regional aquifer system eberts and george 2000 as a potential source of elevated cl and other solutes this aquifer is hosted in silurian devonian carbonate rocks and is spatially extensive through northwestern ohio northern indiana southern michigan and northeastern illinois see fig 2 of eberts and george 2000 the dataset presented here adds to the growing body of literature on the effects of landscape management namely agricultural and drainage practices on hydrological processes skaggs et al 1994 sloan et al 2016 buskirk et al 2020 impacts of agricultural practices on shallow subsurface processes have been well documented in research completed at the intensively managed landscapes critical zone observatory iml czo and in other independent study sites the iml czo research has substantially improved our understanding on how surface agricultural practices such as tillage and subsurface drainage modifications have impacted water solute and nutrient yields from agriculturally managed landscapes kumar et al 2018 wilson et al 2018 however these studies rarely consider interactions with deeper aquifers thereby limiting our understanding on their role in baseflow generation and their effect on salinity and tds in these agricultural watersheds this study bridges that gap by providing valuable insight into 1 the interactions between surface water shallow aquifers and deep aquifers including regional flow in bedrock 2 advantages and limitations in using multiple isotopic and geochemical tracers as forensic tools to differentiate between anthropogenic and geologic sources of salinity to agricultural rivers and 3 the two way exchange of salinity and nutrients between surface water shallow aquifers and deeper aquifers here we address the following overarching questions 1 what is the source of the anomalous solute concentrations and high salinity in the headwaters reach of the wabash river 2 what do the solute concentrations reveal about the sources of baseflow in the headwaters reach and 3 how much if any groundwater from the regional aquifer is discharged to the headwaters reach we answer these questions using a multiple isotopic tracer approach combined with geochemical analyses specifically chlorine 36 ratios 36cl cl and chloride bromide mass ratios cl br are used to identify and differentiate between the numerous sources of salinity strontium isotopic ratios 87sr 86sr are measured in river water soil and bedrock samples to identify the flowpaths that contribute to baseflow salinity i e is the salinity coming from the shallow subsurface deeper aquifers or gas field formations stable isotopes of water 18o and 2h are used to identify mixing relationships between different sources of water and to identify sources of recharge 2 description of study area 2 1 geography and geology the wabash river watershed is large 85 340 km2 and the river flows through different geologic settings therefore to aid in the comparison of data across the watershed the entire watershed was divided into 3 regions that largely conform to preexisting subdivisions used in other publications in this paper we define the upper wabash river uwr as that portion of the river extending from ft recovery oh wr1 in fig 1 to lafayette in wr7 in fig 1 the uwr primarily drains the central till plain tipton till plain see gray 2000 the middle wabash river mwr extends from lafayette in south to terre haute in wr12 in fig 1 and primarily drains the central till plain gray 2000 the mwr defined here conforms to the area defined in doss 1994 the lower wabash river lwr extends from terre haute in south to new haven il wr18 in fig 1 and primarily drains the southern hills and lowlands region gray 2000 the area that we have defined as the lwr largely conforms to the area delineated in illinois flood maps isws 2020 a brief geologic description is provided here please see casey 1996 bugliosi 1999 and eberts and george 2000 for a detailed explanation of the geological hydrogeological and geochemical framework of the study area including the midwestern basin and arches regional aquifer system bedrock units and their associated deep aquifers in the study area are covered by glacial sediments up to approximately 154 m thick in some places from the wisconsinan ice sheet fig 3 eberts and george 2000 however the unconsolidated glacial sediment is relatively thin less than 30 m along the headwaters reach silurian bedrock units found in northeastern indiana and northwestern ohio were originally deposited in shallow marine and reef settings casey 1996 mclaughlin et al 2018 these units are primarily comprised of limestones and dolomites pinsak and shaver 1964 and contain evaporites and sulfide minerals pinsak and shaver 1964 casey 1996 outcrops of silurian bedrock wabash formation are exposed at the land surface in road cuts near the forks of the wabash huntington in see site wr4 in fig 2 and near france park logansport in frisbee et al 2019 see site wr6 in fig 2 discontinuous exposures of upper ordovician rocks are present beneath the unconsolidated sediment in the headwaters reach of the wabash river watershed where the ancient teays river system has eroded the silurian carbonate sequence melhorn and kempton 1991 figs 2 and 3 the ordovician rocks are primarily comprised of shales with a smaller proportion of interbedded limestones the upper ordovician rocks host the maquoketa group aquifer system schmidt 2009 that is coincident with the buried teays valley the ordovician trenton limestone lies beneath the maquoketa group aquifer system and it hosts the trenton gas field and associated formation brines keith 1985 casey 1996 the headwaters reach of the wabash river is positioned between the michigan basin located to the north separated by the kankakee arch the illinois basin located to the southwest separated by the cincinnati arch and the appalachian basin located to the east separated by the findlay arch see fig 2 of eberts and george 2000 the location between these arches has profoundly affected the underlying structure and attitude of sedimentary units and groundwater flow directions for example older geologic units such as upper ordovician silurian and devonian rocks were brought closer to the land surface along the axes of these arches thus bedrock units get younger moving west north and east from the axes of the arches see fig 2 of eberts and george 2000 uplift and glaciation have also affected groundwater flowpaths casey 1996 bugliosi 1999 eberts and george 2000 2 2 hydrogeology and surface hydrology unconsolidated glacial sediments in the uwr and mwr fig 3 host shallow phreatic aquifers these aquifers are thought to contain primarily modern groundwater eberts and george 2000 report tritium 3h activities ranging from 3 0 to 20 6 tu in the shallow phreatic aquifers which were at the time consistent with modern recharge 70 years although eberts and george 2000 did not collect samples of groundwater that are spatially coincident with the wabash headwaters reach they did sample a transect across the uwr they report some overlap in δ18o between the shallow phreatic aquifers in the unconsolidated glacial deposits 7 85 to 7 65 and the shallow portion of the regional carbonate aquifer 7 90 to 7 75 however isotopically light groundwater 14 4 to 7 40 was found in the deep regional carbonate aquifer with the lightest groundwater found in the maumee river basin northeast of fort wayne in this isotopically light groundwater was inferred to be a mixture of pleistocene recharge and modern cold season recharge eberts george 2000 the silurian bedrock units whose thickness generally increases to over 760 m progressing northward from the axes of the arches toward michigan support the midwestern basin and arches regional aquifer system regional groundwater flow in the silurian carbonate aquifer follows the dip away from the axes of the arches eberts and george 2000 modeled the hydrogeology of this aquifer system and found that local scale groundwater i e short groundwater flowpaths that are affected by seasonal variations in recharge likely accounts for 50 to 97 percent of baseflow to streams in the region while regional groundwater i e long groundwater flowpaths that are minimally affected by variations in seasonal recharge accounts for 3 to 50 percent of baseflow eberts and george 2000 also present isotopic data on samples of groundwater collected from the deep regional carbonate aquifer these samples were found to be largely tritium dead 3h 0 1 tu in addition radiocarbon residence times tended to get longer as flowpath lengths increased ranging up to approximately 13 000 years near the distal end of a set of flowpaths in the maumee river basin near lake erie eberts and george 2000 thus they inferred that a significant proportion of pleistocene recharge from the last glacial maximum is present in the deep regional carbonate aquifer the wabash river originates from seeps located on private property south of fort recovery oh west of wr1 in figs 1 2 during this study water samples could not be collected from the private property however water samples were collected where the headwater stream is channelized in a ditch located approximately 1 5 km downstream of the private property at the historic anthony wayne parkway roadside park wabash river 16s 691220 me 4 469 326 mn see wr1 in fig 2 the stream channel then takes a circuitous route looping northeast then northwest back to fort recovery oh see site wr2 in fig 2 before flowing into northeastern indiana fig 1 this paper focuses on the headwaters reach from fort recovery oh site wr1 in fig 2 to huntington in site wr4 in fig 2 there are three usgs stream gauging sites in the headwaters reach of the wabash river and all three sites are located in indiana two of our sampling sites in the headwaters reach are located near a usgs stream gauging site site wr3 is located near the stream gauge at linn grove in site 03322900 https waterdata usgs gov in nwis inventory site no 03322900 last

the average daily discharge at linn grove over the period from 01 january 1965 to 31 december 2019 ranged from 0 11 to 394 m3 s 1 a continuous record of discharge over the same time period is not available at huntington in however the average daily discharge at huntington over the period from 01 january 1965 to 31 december 2001 excluding incomplete years of 1992 and 1993 ranged from 0 10 to 239 m3 s 1 an average annual hydrograph fig 4 was created for the headwaters reach over a 55 year period of record 01 january 1965 to 31 december 2019 using stream gauge data from the usgs gauge at linn grove in a set of flow duration curves fdcs was created for the discharge data from the usgs gauging sites at linn grove huntington and an additional site at peru in located in proximity to site wr5 daily discharge data for the wabash river near peru in was obtained from usgs site 03 327 500 https waterdata usgs gov in nwis inventory site no 03327500 last accessed on 08 february 2022 over the same interval as the linn grove site these curves fig 5 show that the headwaters reach is relatively flashy and that discharge generally increases from linn grove in wr3 to peru in near wr5 here we define flashy streamflow as stream discharge that responds quickly to rain or snowmelt events and has an event scale recession that is usually steep poff et al 1987 for example the annual hydrograph of the headwaters reach shows quick responses to precipitation events particularly during summer and fall thunderstorms see days 160 to 280 of fig 4 in addition the slopes of the flow duration curves shown in fig 5 are slightly steeper in the 20 to 80 exceedence probability range of the plots than expected for groundwater dominated streams searcy 1959 in general the highest stream flows occur in the spring after snowmelt late february through late april and prior to the growing season days 52 to 115 of fig 4 stream flows gradually decrease over the course of the summer growing season despite plentiful rainfall during this time fig 4 the lowest stream flows occur in the autumn near the end of the growing season and prior to winter storms occurring in november and december figs 4 5 miller and lyon 2021 report similar flashy behavior for tile drained watersheds in ohio baker et al 2004 examined flashy stream behavior in midwestern watersheds using a new flashiness index 2 3 climatology the headwaters reach of the wabash river experiences cold winters and hot summers only one weather station was found in the headwaters reach with a sufficiently long and continuous period of record comparable to the 55 year period of record of from the stream gauge at linn grove in meteorological data were obtained from noaa climate data online https www ncei noaa gov maps daily last accessed on

temperatures measured at berne in over the last 55 years are 8 0 c and 0 4 c respectively and the average low and high july summer temperatures are 17 8 c and 29 2 c berne in receives an average of 100 3 cm of precipitation per year fig 6 precipitation is seasonally distributed 19 percent occurs in the winter months 30 percent occurs in the spring months 30 percent occurs in the summer months and 21 percent occurs in the fall months the study area receives between 10 7 cm and 157 9 cm of snow not snow water equivalent per year during the spring and summer of 2015 the study area received the 4th highest annual precipitation observed over the 55 year period of record fig 6 this resulted in widespread flooding throughout the wabash river watershed see green dashed line in fig 4 floodwaters began to recede near the end of august calendar day 240 of fig 4b and baseflow conditions resumed in late september and were persistent through october and early november samples were collected in the uwr on 30 october 2015 indicated by the red x mark in fig 4a confirming that samples were collected during acceptable baseflow conditions 3 methods 3 1 field chemistry and geochemical analyses the entire main channel of the wabash river was longitudinally sampled over the course of 3 days sites wr1 through wr5 fig 1 in the uwr were sampled on 30 october 2015 and the remaining two sites in the uwr wr6 and wr7 were sampled on 06 november 2015 the mwr sampling sites wr8 to wr12 fig 1 were sampled on 06 november 2015 the lwr sampling sites wr13 to wr18 fig 1 were sampled on 20 november 2015 a ysi professional plus pro plus multi parameter meter https www ysi com proplus last accessed on 10 february 2022 was used to measure field chemical parameters including ph temperature electrical conductivity ec μs cm 1 and dissolved oxygen do mg l 1 and saturation relative to air saturation specific conductivity spc μs cm 1 ec corrected to 25⁰c is calculated by the ysi meter by spc

first sample site each day using a three point calibration for ph and ec the calibration was checked randomly throughout the day a new do membrane and fresh electrolyte o2 solution was used for each sampling trip all water samples were collected by tossing one end of a 10 m length of viton tubing into the river from the bank letting the tubing settle to the bottom of the channel and then connecting the other end to a geotech 0 45 μm dispos a filter http www geotechenv com disposable filter capsules html last accessed on 08 february 2022 the tubing was then fed into the drive head of a pegasus alexis peristaltic pump and pumped for 3 to 5 min to completely flush the filter the filters were replaced approximately every 2 to 3 sample sites water samples were collected in clean non acidified 250 ml wide mouth hdpe nalgene bottles for general geochemistry analyses standard cations and anions which were completed at the chemical laboratory of the new mexico bureau of geology and mineral resources the suite of cations includes sodium na potassium k magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 and strontium sr2 and these were measured using a perkinelmer optima 5300 dv icp oes per epa 200 7 the

analyses chlorine 36 ratios 36cl cl and cl br mass ratios mg l 1 mg l 1 are used to identify and differentiate between the numerous sources of salinity that are present in the headwaters of the wabash river watershed potential chloride endmembers were identified through previous research by frisbee et al 2017 and from other published data see below groundwater recharged during the bomb pulse era should have elevated 36cl cl compared to pre anthropogenic and modern recharge clark and fritz 1997 corcho alvarado et al 2005 tosaki et al 2011 phillips 2000 2013 shaw et al 2014 frisbee et al 2017 found that springs in shades state park in central indiana were discharging a substantial component of groundwater recharged during or immediately after the bomb pulse era those springs had 36cl cl 1300 x 10 15 baseflow in streams draining those same catchments ranged from 720 x10 15 to 1250 x10 15 in comparison pre anthropogenic 36cl cl in groundwater for northern indiana should range from 300 x10 15 to approximately 450 x10 15 based on data provided in davis et al 2000 2003 monthly integrated samples of precipitation were collected in west lafayette in to provide an endmember for within year runoff frisbee et al 2017 geologic brines can be found in the headwaters of the wabash river watershed brines tend to have very low 36cl cl 20 1015 relative to modern and clean unaffected groundwater vengosh 2014 the expected range of cl br mass ratios for wet deposition varies with distance inland from oceanic sources short et al 2017 davis et al 1998 2000 report cl br less than approximately 250 for clean modern groundwater defined as groundwater unaffected by cl pollution regionally panno et al 2006 reports a cl br range of 23 to 521 and a mean of 156 for pristine groundwater from sand and gravel aquifers in nearby northeastern illinois frisbee et al 2017 report cl br ranging from 30 to 95 for clean unaffected springs in central indiana cl br mass ratios tend to be elevated 1000 in geologic brines and in waters that interacted with evaporite minerals davis et al 1998 therefore 36cl cl can be coupled with cl br to potentially differentiate between sources of cl davis et al 2000 davis et al 2003 filtered water samples were collected from each river site in clean non acidified wide mouth 1000 ml hdpe nalgene bottles for 36cl analyses precipitation was collected on a monthly basis in 2015 the winter precipitation samples that were collected after baseflow samples were collected for this study are not shown in this paper the 36cl cl of precipitation was assumed to be equivalent to the 36cl cl of modern within year recharge and surface runoff this assumption is made based on the inferred flashy behavior of streams in the region precipitation was collected in clean buckets installed in an open grassy area located near west lafayette in frisbee et al 2017 the buckets were inspected daily or immediately following precipitation events event scale precipitation samples were then poured into clean 2l nalgene bottles samples were then combined at the end of the month to create integrated monthly samples the buckets were washed with alconox and rinsed with deionized water after precipitation samples were collected and then re installed samples of road salt halite were acquired from two salt vendors that supply the indiana department of transportation one sample was provided by compass minerals from silurian salt deposits near goderich ontario and the other sample was provided by cargill deicing from silurian salt deposits near cleveland oh halite samples were dissolved in deionized water given a sulfur reduction step to reduce interference with 36s and agcl was precipitated from the water sample all 36cl cl analyses and chemistry steps were completed at the purdue prime lab using accelerator mass spectrometry ams sharma et al 2000 https www physics purdue edu primelab the reported relative measurement uncertainty ranged between 2 3 to 4 5 3 3 strontium isotope analyses strontium isotopic ratios 87sr 86sr of water samples are compared to the 87sr 86sr of rocks rock leachate and glacial sediment leachate present in the study area to identify which rocks host the flowpaths assuming that the 87sr 86sr of each endmember are distinct hogan and blum 2003 frisbee et al 2017 filtered water samples were collected from each river site in clean non acidified wide mouth 1000 ml hdpe nalgene bottles for 87sr 86sr analyses samples of geologic material found in the study area were also collected for whole rock and rock leachate 87sr 86sr analyses bedrock samples were also collected in the study area including silurian wabash formation dolomitic limestone silurian brassfield formation dolomitic limestone and ordovician platteville formation dolostone whole rock samples were crushed and processed at isotope tracer technologies glacial sediment samples were collected from the surface and shallow subsurface in the study area the glacial sediment samples were leached using deionized water since they are a mix of rock clasts and clay material and leaching is thought to provide a more representative 87sr 86sr of the unconsolidated glacial sediment this technique has been applied successfully in other recent studies frisbee et al 2017 warix et al 2020 gleason et al 2020 rock leachate samples were created by 1 placing 300 g of glacial sediment in clean 2 l nalgene bottles 2 filling the bottle with deionized water di 3 capping the bottle and leaching the rock samples for 2 months 4 decanting the water from the bottle and 5 measuring the strontium sr2 concentrations of the water and measuring the 87sr 86sr of the rock leachate all 87sr 86sr analyses were completed by isotope tracer technologies using thermal ionization mass spectrometry tims the reported analytical uncertainty is provided for comparison purposes we use 87sr 86sr ratios for precipitation that were reported in sherman et al 2015 specifically 87sr 86sr for precipitation for dexter mi 0 709966 0 000360 and detroit mi 0 708785 0 000390 are used as potential endmembers given the proximity of these sites to the headwaters of the wabash river in northern in and oh 3 4 stable isotopes of water stable isotopes of water 18o and 2h were used to identify the sources of water contributing to baseflow small aliquots of water 5 ml were pipetted from each general chemistry sample stable isotopic ratios of water δ2h and δ18o were analyzed by the purdue stable isotope lab using an lgr triple isotope liquid water analyzer three standards were used for calibration δ2h 18 1 and δ18o 2 78 δ2h 117 2 and δ18o 15 7 and δ2h 44 5 and δ18o 6 9 each water sample was analyzed ten times the first four runs were discarded

ranging from 52 to 92 one potential explanation for the elevated cl br ratios of the headwaters reach is septic effluent and or the discharge of brines from home water softener systems in septic effluent davis et al 1998 report that the cl br of domestic sewage commonly ranges between 300 and 600 for comparison vengosh and pankratov 1998 reported cl br for domestic sewage in israel ranging from 410 to 873 for a regional comparison panno et al 2006 reported cl br of 403 to 533 for septic effluent in northeastern illinois although private septic systems had ratios ranging from 65 to 5404 where the highest ratios were due to the discharge of brine solution from water softener systems installed in the homes see harrison 2006 for a description on how water softeners work a simple divalent monovalent cation mass ratio d m ratio can be created from ca2 mg2 na k to differentiate untreated hard from treated softened water for example water samples were analyzed before and after a water softener was installed in the home of the author for reference table 7 the untreated water has a d m ratio of 4 1 and the treated water has a d m ratio of 0 67 illustrating the substantial reduction adsorption of divalent ions in the water after treatment water samples from wr2 wr3 and wr4 have d m ratios of 2 77 1 73 and 1 07 respectively whereas the average d m ratio of the remaining river sites is 3 53 0 75 and range from 1 72 near the confluence with the ohio river at wr18 to 4 69 wr1 ultimately it s unlikely that the d m ratios in the headwaters reach result from brine effluent from home water softener systems due to the sparse population of the region this type of effluent may have localized impacts but we suspect that the brine becomes diluted in the larger aquifer or once it reaches a river it s unlikely that septic effluent alone is responsible for the high cl br ratios observed in the headwaters reach since it is located in open farmland and is not heavily populated except for the town of huntington in schnoebelen and krothe 1999 state that non reef portions of the silurian devonian carbonate aquifer in northwestern indiana contain layers of interbedded montmorillonite and that these clay layers have a high cation exchange capacity they attribute sodium rich groundwater found in the non reef carbonate aquifer to cation exchange processes occurring in the clay layers it s plausible that elevated na and possibly at least some of the k may originate from a similar process in the silurian devonian carbonate aquifer in northeastern indiana eberts and george 2000 state that sodium rich groundwater found in the study area is due to cation exchange processes occurring in devonian shales and subsequent mixing of waters in the carbonate aquifer unfortunately we do not have bedrock cores to test this explanation road salt halite is used as a deicer throughout the uwr during the winter in addition oilfield brines have historically been used as road deicers in the winter and as dust control agents on country roads in the summer in northwestern ohio kell et al 2004 but brines are not used as deicers today the dissolution of halite increases both the cl concentration and cl br in water but dilutes the 36cl cl in water davis et al 1998 reported that halite dissolution results in cl br mass ratios ranging from 1000 to 10 000 samples of halite obtained for this study were dissolved in deionized water and found to have cl br of 6060 and 6091 consistent with the range reported by davis et al 1998 given the geologic age of these halite deposits they should be 36cl dead 36cl cl 0 these halite samples had 36cl cl of 2 39 0 51 x 10 15 and 2 43 0 49 x 10 15 bedded halite if present in silurian bedrock in northeastern in would be expected to have similar cl br and 36cl cl approximately equal to 0 however bedded halite deposits have not been mapped in the silurian units of northeastern in therefore a geologic explanation in the silurian bedrock for the observed salinity is tenuous at best alternatively the elevated cl and cl br could potentially come from oilfield brines in the underlying ordovician bedrock however the 87sr 86sr data argue against trenton oilfield brines as a source for the observed salinity since the river samples do not fall within the range shown in the grey shaded box data from mcnutt et al 1987 in fig 9 thus trenton oilfield brines are not likely the source of the observed salinity fertilizers such as muriate of potash kcl can also contribute excess cl to the headwaters reach via agricultural runoff or subsurface tile drains samples of potash were not analyzed during this study however panno et al 2006 report a cl br of 510 for potash in that same study cl br ranged from 108 to 1974 for tile drainage from agricultural fields in northeastern illinois in this study the mass ratio of k cl ranges from 0 05 to 0 21 in the headwaters reach whereas the na k cl ranges from 0 80 to 0 90 this would suggest that the cl is sourced primarily from nacl rather than potash fertilizers table 3 however the na k cl ratio can be misleading since potassium and sodium do not behave conservatively or similarly in agricultural landscapes potassium is an essential nutrient for all plants hawkesford et al 2012 while sodium is not essential for most crop plants maathuis 2014 although data for na and cl concentrations of soybean and corn grain are sparse what data is available shows that k concentration in grain exceeds that of na and cl by approximately 1 to 2 orders of magnitude pietz et al 1978 parker et al 1983 1985 yang and blanchar 1993 crop plants take up k and a proportion of this k is removed in the grain and subsequently leaves the field ultimately the na k cl ratio does not account for the uptake removal ratio of k by plants in studies investigating sources of cl in watersheds it s common to see either 1 plots of k vs cl compared to plots of na vs cl 2 na cl ratios compared to k cl ratios shown here or 3 attempts to close cl mass balances at the watershed scale if the effects of uptake removal ratios of k per crop are not considered then the impact of kcl applications on the cl load at the watershed scale will be underestimated recommended rates of potash application to crops in indiana are made based on soil test k an estimate of plant available k and are outlined in culman et al 2020 applications are usually made uniformly to the soil surface in the months of november through april annually for one crop season or biennially for two crop seasons typically the fertilizer will either be left on the soil surface or incorporated into the upper 15 cm of the soil briefly the objective of fertilization is to maintain an optimal level of soil test k 100 to 170 mg kg 1 soil varying by soil cation exchange capacity and then replace crop removal from the field plus 20 lb k2o acre 20 kg k ha 1 corn and soybean k removal from the field in the grain are estimated at 0 20 and 1 15 lb k2o bushel 1 respectively equivalent to approximately 3 5 and approximately 18 kg k mg 1 grain dry matter since the recommendations are geared to replace crop k removal only approximately 20 kg k ha 1 of the k applied is expected to remain in the field as k 20 30 of that added and most would be retained by the negative charge of the soil this would tend to drive the k cl of agricultural runoff lower than expected based on fertilizer application rates in contrast only 2 to 10 of the cl applied would be removed from the field in the grain and that left in the soil 90 98 of that added would be repelled by the soil s negative charge making it much more likely to move with water the headwaters reach flows through farmland in adams wells and huntington counties in indiana where the primary crops are soybeans and corn in 2015 adams county had 100 760 acres of soybeans and 67 962 acres of corn wells county had 116 635 acres of soybeans and 85 283 acres of corn and huntington county had 101 297 acres of soybeans and 61 315 acres of corn in this region approximately 150 lb kcl acre 168 kg kcl ha would be recommended annually for soybean crops and approximately 75 lb kcl acre 84 kg kcl ha for corn crops combined this equates to approximately 34 094 u s tons 30 929 metric tons of kcl that would be applied annually in these three counties alone the vast majority of the potash used in this region and in the midwest is mined from devonian evaporite deposits in saskatchewan fuzesy 1982 and is supplemented with potash mined from late permian deposits in new mexico austin 1980 given the geologic ages of these deposits we can assume that the cl present in the potash mined from these deposits is also 36cl dead thus based on these data potash is a plausible explanation for the high cl high cl br and 36cl cl dilution observed in the headwaters reach 5 1 2 sources of elevated strontium sulfate fluoride and nitrate the unique geochemical composition of the three headwater sites is apparent when the data are plotted in a piper diagram fig 11 despite their location in the headwaters of the watershed their geochemical composition more closely matches that of river sites in the lwr the three headwater sites are calcium sulfate type waters while the remaining river samples are calcium bicarbonate type waters except for wr16 fig 11 site wr16 likely has elevated so4 2 from coal ash residuals and is an anomalous sample discussed below the sr2 and so4 2 concentrations measured in the headwaters reach are quite high relative to the remaining river samples in general sr2 concentrations tend to be very low in natural waters often less than 0 10 mg l 1 hem 1985 foley et al 1972 reported elevated sr2 and so4 2 in the bedrock aquifer of allen county in located immediately north of the headwaters reach however sr2 concentrations in the unconsolidated glacial aquifers of allen county tended to be very low in comparison in that study they attributed the anomalous concentrations of sr2 and so4 2 in the bedrock aquifer to the dissolution of celestite srso4 and or strontianite srco3 present in the carbonate bedrock the findlay arch mineral belt contains abundant celestite carlson 1987 1994 however celestite has a relatively low solubility compared to gypsum dove and czank 1995 which may limit its contribution to the sr2 and so4 2 load to groundwater and surface water schnoebelen and krothe 1999 analyzed groundwater from bedrock in silurian devonian bedrock in northwestern indiana they did not observe elevated sr2 0 41 to 0 63 mg l 1 in the non reef silurian devonian aquifer but they did report elevated so4 2 150 to 170 mg l 1 feulner and hubble 1960 and oh epa 2012 both report high sr2 concentrations in groundwater from silurian carbonate aquifers in western ohio southeast of fort recovery oh due to the presence of celestite and strontianite in the bedrock luczaj and masarik 2015 also suggest that celestite and possibly strontianite are responsible for elevated sr2 concentrations in groundwater in eastern wisconsin however their groundwater samples were collected from older cambrian ordovician sandstones sacks and tihansky 1996 analyzed concentrations of sr2 and so4 2 in samples of gypsum collected from the upper floridan aquifer that were dissolved in deionized water they report sr2 so4 2 molar ratios of 1 for celestite and 0 003 in gypsum explained by limited replacement of ca2 with sr2 in gypsum we ground samples of carbonate rocks collected in the headwaters of the wabash river from the ordovician platteville formation silurian wabash formation and silurian brassfield formation and dissolved them in deionized water in a similar fashion the leachates yielded sr2 so4 2 molar ratios of 0 002 0 004 and 0 037 respectively in addition frisbee et al 2019 collected water samples from three karst springs emerging from the wabash formation near site wr6 in logansport in these three springs had sr2 so4 2 molar ratios ranging from 0 005 to 0 008 consistent with the rock leachate from the silurian wabash formation in comparison sites wr2 wr3 and wr4 had sr2 so4 2 molar ratios of 0 009 0 021 and 0 019 respectively which are again similar to the silurian rock leachates the three headwater sites have the highest sr2 so4 2 molar ratios in the entire watershed site wr1 has a sr2 so4 2 molar ratio of 0 012 and the ratios decrease progressing downstream of wr4 therefore the dissolution of gypsum can potentially explain the higher concentrations of strontium and sulfate only one sampling site in the lwr has a so4 2 concentration comparable to the headwater reach that site wr16 has a so4 2 concentration of 175 mg l 1 and is located immediately downstream of a coal burning power plant near mt carmel il this site also has an elevated 87sr 86sr ratio 0 710702 that is consistent with the range of coal combustion residuals ccr from the illinois basin reported in ruhl et al 2014 and harkness et al 2016 high so4 2 concentrations were also reported in plumes from a coal fired power plant in portage wi simsiman et al 1987 a water sample collected concurrently in the white river upstream of its confluence with the wabash river and upstream of the coal burning power plant near mt carmel il has a 87sr 86sr of 0 709359 and a so4 2 concentration of 74 mg l 1 for comparison the elevated so4 2 and high 87sr 86sr at site wr16 are consistent with coal ash residuals the findlay arch mineral belt also contains abundant fluorite carlson 1994 fluorite has a low solubility and fluoride concentrations tend to be very low 1 0 mg l 1 in natural waters having tds less than 1000 mg l 1 hem 1985 however elevated f concentrations ranging up to 4 mg l 1 have been reported in wells installed in silurian and devonian rocks in northwestern ohio in close proximity to the headwater reach oh epa 2012 the f concentrations for sites wr2 wr3 and wr4 were 0 29 mg l 1 0 41 mg l 1 and 0 51 mg l 1 respectively all but one of the remaining river sites have f less than 0 29 mg l 1 schnoebelen and krothe 1999 provide an alternative explanation for high f concentrations 2 4 to 3 1 mg l 1 observed in the non reef silurian devonian aquifer in northwestern indiana they state that the high f can be explained by apatite instead of fluorite in their study the groundwater samples were undersaturated with respect to fluorite and positive with respect to apatite in principle po4 3 concentrations should increase as apatite is weathered however our samples were not field acidified and therefore nearly all the sites were non detects with respect to po4 3 in any case there is a plausible geologic explanation for the relatively high f concentrations observed in the headwaters reach reconciling the apparent disagreement on the source of the high cl high cl br and low 36cl cl and the source of the high sr2 so4 2 and f is difficult however no3 provides additional insight the no3 concentrations in the headwaters reach are also high relative to the remaining river sites site wr1 has a no3 concentration of 25 8 mg l 1 while sites wr2 wr3 and wr4 have concentrations of 64 4 8 91 and 30 1 mg l 1 respectively site wr3 is again distinct from wr2 and wr4 in that it has the lowest no3 concentration the remaining downstream river sites have no3 concentrations ranging from 4 09 to 8 55 mg l 1 with an average concentration of 5 76 1 23 mg l 1 elevated no3 is an indicator of nutrient rich runoff or legacy nutrients in groundwater these data again seem at odds with the concentrations of sr2 and so4 2 which are not likely due to anthropogenic effects found in the study area one plausible explanation for sites wr2 and wr4 is that groundwater discharging to the river from the silurian carbonate regional aquifer mixes with shallow groundwater that has been contaminated over time with cl and no3 from agricultural practices this would preserve the high cl high cl br low 36cl cl and the high sr2 so4 2 mg2 and f however site wr3 does not conform to this conceptual model 5 2 sources of salinity inferred from isotope data river samples are plotted relative to the lmwl dashed line gmwl solid line and seasonal endmembers in fig 10b the storm to storm interstorm variability in the seasonal precipitation endmembers is quite high fig 10b welp smith et al 2020 winter and spring precipitation have the lightest minimum δ18o values 26 3 and 22 4 respectively yet winter precipitation also has the largest interstorm variability of all seasonal endmembers summer precipitation has the heaviest least negative δ18o and δ2h composition and shows the least interstorm variability of the seasonal endmembers the δ18o and δ2h compositions of wr1 wr2 wr3 and wr4 are lighter more negative than and distinct from the remaining downstream river samples fig 10a these four river samples plot closely with the average spring endmember fig 10b in comparison the remaining river samples have δ18o value more positive than 7 1 and plot between the average summer and average fall precipitation endmembers fig 10b it s unlikely that much if any recharge occurs during the summer growing season april through september in northern indiana because there is an increased water demand for crops and the summer months are typically the driest in fact daniels et al 1991 and naylor et al 2016 state that 65 percent of groundwater recharge in northern indiana occurs from fall october november to spring march april frisbee et al 2017 found that a recharge temperature between 0 c and approximately 4 c provided the best fit to atmospheric cfc curves and yielded comparable cfc ages for the groundwater samples suggesting that little if any recharge occurs in the summer growing season it s more likely that the δ18o values of the downstream river samples reflect a large proportion of recent runoff this inference is consistent with the 36cl cl data table 3 shows the 36cl cl of monthly precipitation from april to october of 2015 the minimum 36cl cl during this period was 43 2 10 15 and the maximum was 79 8 10 15 this range is illustrated by the grey box in fig 8 the water samples were collected in the uwr in october 2015 when the monthly 36cl cl in precipitation was 55 4 10 15 in comparison the remaining downstream river samples have 36cl cl ranging from 39 9 1 9 x 10 15 to 94 8 3 5 x 10 15 this range is somewhat misleading since 11 of the 14 downstream samples fall within the range of 42 3 10 15 to 59 6 10 15 a range that is similar to that of monthly precipitation during this time table 3 fig 8 we infer that the downstream river samples contained a substantial component of recent runoff at the time of sampling sites wr2 wr3 and wr4 have 36cl cl of 33 4 10 15 27 5 10 15 and 30 4 10 15 respectively these ratios are even lower than the range for monthly precipitation collected in 2015 ranging from 43 2 10 15 to 79 8 10 15 davis et al 2000 show 36cl cl data for five wells located northeast of fort wayne in these wells were installed at depths of 6 1 18 0 24 4 29 0 and 48 8 m deep all but the deepest well was installed in unconsolidated glacial sediments the 48 8 m well was screened into the underlying devonian carbonate bedrock they report 36cl cl of 12 6 2 9 x 10 15 166 11 x 10 15 153 8 x 10 15 190 22 x 10 15 and 250 15 x 10 15 respectively and all but the 6 1 m deep well were tritium dead these groundwater samples had cl br of 2720 43 4 47 8 32 4 and 41 6 respectively davis et al 2000 inferred that the low 36cl cl high cl br and high 3h 16 tu of the shallow well 6 1 m resulted from an influx of cl contaminated surface water the higher 36cl cl lower cl br and 3h dead groundwaters of the remaining wells most likely resulted from the weathering of fluid inclusions in plutonic clasts in the unconsolidated glacial sediment the 36cl cl of wr2 wr3 and wr4 are lower than the groundwater samples reported in davis et al 2000 and lower than 2015 precipitation samples reported here we infer that these samples show the effects of 36cl dilution as mentioned earlier it s unlikely that the old cl originates from septic effluent and or home water softener brine alone or bedded halite in addition the 87sr 86sr of wr2 wr3 and wr4 most closely match the 87sr 86sr of the silurian brassfield formation sbf and silurian wabash formation swf and argue against a source in the ordovician rocks or ordovician oilfield brines ultimately the two remaining sources that can potentially explain the low 36cl cl are old cl from road salt or potash fertilizer given the application rates of kcl in the counties of the headwaters reach and the timing of the river sampling in late fall prior to the winter use of deicers kcl seems most plausible we cannot discount the possibility of legacy cl from road salt the unconsolidated thickness of the headwater reach may help reconcile these datasets the unconsolidated sediment is relatively thin in the headwaters reach fig 3 ranging from less than 1 0 to 154 m in the uwr please note that fig 3 shows the minimum and maximum thickness in the window and not in the uwr alone the unconsolidated sediment is 28 2 m 23 4 m 43 7 m and 17 0 m at sites wr1 wr2 wr3 and wr4 respectively this thin cover of glacial sediment would in principle increase the possibility that regional groundwater could be discharged to the wabash river or allow it to mix with shallow groundwater hoyer and hallberg 1991 state that bedrock aquifers in iowa that are overlain by glacial sediment less than 30 5 m are more susceptible to contamination if applied to indiana then this suggests that sites wr1 wr2 and wr4 are likewise more susceptible site wr3 does not conform to this conceptual model this site is spatially located where the ordovician maquoketa group aquifer system has been mapped schmidt 2009 and is spatially coincident with the buried channel of the ancient teays river fidlar 1943 steeg 1946 bruns and steen 2003 at ceylon in north of geneva in the unconsolidated sediment is 43 7 m previous research indicates that the sidewalls of the buried teays valley in this area are steep and cut through silurian salamonie dolomite into ordovician carbonates and shales bruns and steen 2003 in northern in the salamonie dolomite overlies the brassfield formation thereby supporting the 87sr 86sr data site wr3 also has lower do and spc than the other sites in the headwaters reach and much lower no3 concentrations if ture then this suggests that the groundwater discharging from the teays valley sediment and carbonate bedrock aquifer may not be contaminated if significant mixing were occurring between the shallow aquifers and deep relatively clean groundwater from the regional carbonate aquifer then we would expect wr3 to show similar effects as wr2 and wr4 in any case a hydrogeologic connection is present between the headwaters of the wabash river the silurian devonian carbonate aquifer and the buried teays valley sediment at wr3 without the aid of multiple isotopic tracers and geochemical data this hydrogeologic connection would remain masked by the solute burden of the phreatic aquifer 5 3 baseflow separation models a second goal of this study was to determine how much if any baseflow comes from the inferred sources of the salinity to accomplish this task we chose to use a 87sr 86sr mixing model in the 87sr 86sr mixing model we assumed that the strontium ratio for each river sample is equal to a mixture of shallow groundwater phreatic aquifer in unconsolidated sediment and regional groundwater carbonate aquifer we know the 87sr 86sr of glacial sediment in the region and the glacial sediment leachate should approximate the 87sr 86sr of the shallow aquifer tile drains and perhaps even surface runoff in the headwaters reach thus if water infiltrates the glacial sediment then it will slowly acquire the 87sr 86sr of the strontium bearing minerals in the sediment therefore we assume that the 87sr 86sr of the shallow aquifer is equivalent to the 87sr 86sr of leachate from glacial sediment 0 709783 0 000034 the regional groundwater endmember is assumed to be equivalent to the 87sr 86sr of the silurian brassfield formation 0 708292 0 000047 the results of this two endmember mixing model show that the fraction of regional groundwater in baseflow at wr2 wr3 and wr4 is 58 84 and 79 percent respectively the highest contribution from regional groundwater is associated with wr3 these estimates are conservative first as mentioned earlier widespread flooding occurred throughout the uwr and mwr in 2015 while we have faith that baseflow conditions were present when the uwr was sampled fig 4 it is difficult to determine what effect delayed subsurface runoff had on the isotopic and geochemical signature of baseflow in the headwaters repeat synoptic sampling campaigns should be completed to sample baseflow during a normal precipitation year and identify the contribution of groundwater from deep aquifers on baseflow in the remaining downstream sites second while we have collected and analyzed a small subset of the rocks in the stratigraphic column we may not have captured variability in 87sr 86sr present in different lithofacies however our data and interpretations of groundwater flow and geochemical processes largely conform to those of other studies in the same rock units in any case the 87sr 86sr data support a hydrogeologic connection between the headwaters of the wabash river and the regional carbonate aquifer and show that there is a connection between the aquifer associated with the buried teays valley regional carbonate aquifer and river without the aid of multiple isotopic and geochemical tracers the hydrogeologic connection between the river and the regional aquifer would have remained masked 6 conclusions the main objectives of this research study were to address the following questions 1 what is the source of the anomalous solute concentrations and high salinity in the headwaters reach of the wabash river 2 what do the solute concentrations reveal about the sources of baseflow in the headwaters reach and 3 how much if any groundwater from the regional aquifer is discharged to the headwaters reach the most plausible explanation for the elevated cl observed in the headwaters of the wabash river is that it comes from an anthropogenic source the timing of the sampling at the end of the growing season and prior to widespread application of road salt in winter suggests that kcl fertilizers are the likely source of the salinity however we cannot rule out the effects of legacy cl from past road salt usage in either case an old source of cl is responsible for the salinity and the observed 36cl dilution in the headwaters reach unfortunately 36cl cl cannot by itself differentiate between the proportions of salinity coming from two 36cl dead sources of salt with respect to the 2nd objective baseflow generation processes in the headwaters of the wabash river are spatially complex the cl no3 cl br and 36cl cl data seem at odds with the f sr2 so4 2 and 87sr 86sr data the former point to anthropogenic effects while the latter point to geologic sources of solutes the 87sr 86sr data support a hydrogeologic connection between the headwaters of the wabash river and the regional carbonate aquifer sites wr2 wr3 and wr4 have 87sr 86sr ratios similar to silurian carbonate rocks which host the midwestern basins and arches regional aquifer system in comparison the 87sr 86sr steadily increase progressing downstream of the headwaters reach and gradually reach a 87sr 86sr similar to leachate from glacial sediment in addition the δ2h and δ18o compositions for the downstream sites are distinct from the headwaters reach and plot more closely to the average summer precipitation endmember suggesting again that these sites contain a large proportion of recent runoff these data support our inference that the downstream river sites are comprised of a larger proportion of runoff or discharge of shallow groundwater from recent flooding in comparison sites wr1 wr2 wr3 and wr4 have the lightest most negative δ2h and δ18o compositions and are similar to the average δ2h and δ18o composition of spring precipitation cold season recharge the retention of the light δ2h and δ18o composition in the headwaters reach is important we infer that it points to groundwater discharged from the regional aquifer it s plausible that the regional groundwater is a mixture of modern recharge and pleistocene recharge based on the range for pleistocene recharge presented in eberts and george 2000 our conceptual model for the headwaters reach is that the cl no3 cl br and 36cl cl are tracking anthropogenic sources of solutes discharged from shallow groundwater hosted in unconsolidated sediment whereas the f sr2 so4 2 and 87sr 86sr are tracking bedrock weathering processes in the underlying carbonate aquifer at baseflow mixing between shallow cl and no3 rich groundwater from the unconsolidated sediment and regional cl and no3 poor groundwater from the carbonate aquifer occurs in the river site wr3 does not completely conform to this conceptual model we infer that there is some communication between the river and groundwater associated with the buried teays valley at site wr3 in fact a greater proportion of deep groundwater is present in baseflow at site wr3 based on the 87sr 86sr mixing model thus with respect to the 3rd objective we estimate that 58 to 84 percent of baseflow in the headwater reach comes from the regional groundwater discharged from the silurian devonian carbonate aquifer and buried teays valley sediment at wr3 these estimates are conservative and additional synoptic sampling campaigns combined with sampling of groundwater wells are necessary to get a more complete understanding of seasonal variability in the sources of baseflow and salinity in the headwaters of the wabash river without the aid of multiple isotopic and geochemical tracers the hydrogeologic connection between the river and the regional aquifer would have remained masked forensic applications of multiple isotopes enhance the ability to see different reservoirs of water even in intensively managed landscapes these findings have implications for the uwr and other agricultural watersheds while the intensively managed landscapes critical zone observatory iml czo has substantially improved our understanding on how agricultural practices such as tillage and subsurface drainage modifications have impacted water solute and nutrient yields from agriculturally managed landscapes kumar et al 2018 wilson et al 2018 these studies rarely quantify deep or regional groundwater processes as a consequence our understanding of their role in solute release salinity residence times and agroecosystem integrity is incomplete in addition our understanding of the exchange of cl and no3 between phreatic aquifers and deeper aquifers remains incomplete further quantification of this groundwater component in agricultural watersheds will improve regional hydrological models solute and nutrient loading models and geochemical weathering models it will also fill knowledge gaps in our understanding of baseflow generation processes in agricultural watersheds and improve salinity budgets in these same areas on a local scale future investigations of the uwr should not ignore the discharge of groundwater from the regional carbonate aquifer or groundwater associated with the buried teays valley in the majority of agricultural watersheds salinization can largely be explained by anthropogenic sources of salt in the american midwest road salt and kcl fertilizers are usually identified as the primary sources of salinity however the role of kcl in salinization may be underestimated in studies where crop k uptake removal ratios are not considered the uptake removal of k is very different than na for crops grown in the uwr therefore ratios of na cl k cl or na k cl suggest that kcl has less of an impact on salinity this seems at odds with the kcl application rates while 36cl cl can be used to identify old sources of cl it cannot by itself discern between two sources of cl that are both 36cl dead future work should investigate coupling 36cl cl with other tracers to sort out the individual impacts of road salt versus kcl fertilizers this problem is further exacerbated by our incomplete understanding of the roles of shallow and deep groundwater in baseflow generation in these settings the salinity budget in agricultural watersheds is complicated by a continual exchange of water salt and nutrients between the land surface and shallow subsurface aquifers however there are few attempts to quantify the exchanges with deep aquifers if exchanges of cl between surface water shallow aquifers and deep aquifers are substantial then future efforts to mitigate salinity increases in agricultural rivers will not be successful because there may be substantial storage of cl in groundwater and it may be released slowly across long time scales credit authorship contribution statement marty d frisbee conceptualization methodology sample collection writing review editing marc w

3432,subsurface drainage modifications are a common practice in agricultural watersheds especially in poorly drained soils of the american midwest yet our understanding of their impact on baseflow generation processes is incomplete by extension these same practices can make baseflow vulnerable to salinization to address these knowledge gaps a combined geochemical and multiple isotope approach was used to identify sources of baseflow and salinity in the wabash river draining indiana ohio and illinois anomalously high salinity and high concentrations of f so4 2 na sr2 and k were measured in baseflow along the headwaters reach of the wabash river from fort recovery oh to huntington in three river sites in the headwaters reach have low 36cl cl ranging from 27 5 x 10 15 to 33 4 x 10 15 that do not fall within the 36cl cl range for monthly precipitation their 36cl cl are consistent with 36cl dilution most likely due to the presence of old cl found in potash kcl fertilizers however the 87sr 86sr ratios of the headwaters reach range from 0 708530 to 0 708904 0 000025 and are similar to silurian bedrock samples 0 708292 0 000047 indicating a geologic source for some solutes the δ18o of the headwaters reach are isotopically light and similar to cold season recharge whereas the δ18o of the downstream river samples are similar to summer precipitation the cl no3 cl br and 36cl cl data point to an anthropogenic source of salinity namely kcl and road salt whereas the f sr2 so4 2 and 87sr 86sr data point to a geologic source of solutes we infer that shallow groundwater that is cl and no3 rich mixes in the river with regional groundwater that is cl and no3 poor the contribution of regional groundwater to baseflow in the headwaters reach is not insignificant 58 percent and these interactions should be considered in future hydrologic models of the upper wabash river without the aid of multiple isotopic and geochemical tracers baseflow generation processes and sources of salinity in the headwaters reach would remain masked by the elevated solute concentrations associated with the shallow aquifers further research is needed to better understand the impact of kcl

or relatively undisturbed watersheds is sourced primarily from groundwater and other delayed sources of water hall 1968 although baseflow is present year round in perennial streams it is especially critical in sustaining flow and supporting aquatic life during dry seasons and droughts baseflow generation in agricultural watersheds in comparison is quite complicated due to the presence of subsurface drainage modification systems and their impact on the shallow water table and suspected impacts to recharge to deep aquifers the installation of tile drains and modified tile drains frankenberger et al 2004 fausey 2005 skaggs et al 2010 is a common practice in humid areas with poorly draining soils such as the american midwest while subsurface drainage practices have obvious benefits to crop growth and yields kladivko 2020 it remains uncertain how over a century of drainage modifications has impacted groundwater recharge and baseflow generation in agricultural watersheds schilling 2005 zhang and schilling 2006 unfortunately we lack the field data in many cases to quantify how baseflow has been impacted by drainage modification since tile drain installations either pre date stream gauge installation and or are located in watersheds that are largely ungauged however if we want to understand how aquatic agroecosystems are currently responding and will respond in the future to predicted changes in recharge associated with climate and land use land cover change then it is imperative that we improve our understanding of how drainage modifications alter recharge processes and impact baseflow generation processes in agricultural watersheds today groundwater recharge is traditionally defined as water that has percolated through the unsaturated zone and entered the saturated porous media beneath the water table freeze and cherry 1979 in some agricultural watersheds tile drains control the depth of the shallow water table passively e g traditional drainage or actively e g controlled drainage see frankenberger et al 2004 as a consequence water that recharges the shallow aquifer may be quickly routed to a drain thereby limiting circulation deeper than approximately 1 m and reducing the potential for recharge to deeper aquifers there is growing concern that baseflow in these watersheds is sourced predominantly from tile drainage systems schilling 2005 schilling et al 2012 this has serious implications for water quality salinity nutrient persistence and overall agroecosystem health tesoriero et al 2013 yaeger et al 2013 munn et al 2018 unfortunately baseline geochemical and isotopic surveys of baseflow are lacking for many large agricultural watersheds in the american midwest and globally data from synoptic and longitudinal surveys are sorely needed in these large agricultural watersheds to address the larger knowledge gap two catchment scale studies and one large watershed scale study were initiated in the wabash river watershed in 2015 the two catchment scale studies were conducted in 2015 through 2016 to quantify the sources of baseflow in four small catchments draining agriculturally fragmented land in northern and central indiana frisbee et al 2017 this study revealed that relatively old 60 years nitrate free groundwater from confined glacial outwash sands supported baseflow in one catchment ross reserve located near west lafayette in this catchment was not as heavily impacted by agriculture as an adjacent catchment and as a consequence the geochemistry of baseflow was quite different the adjacent catchment was heavily impacted by agricultural runoff thereby shortening the mean residence times of shallow groundwater and increasing the nitrate concentration substantially frisbee et al 2017 during that same time a synoptic sampling campaign was conducted in october and november of 2015 to identify the sources of baseflow in the much larger wabash river and its major tributaries figs 1 2 the wabash river drains nearly 70 percent of indiana and portions of ohio and illinois it is the largest northern tributary to the ohio river and the ohio river is an important tributary to the mississippi river over 65 percent of the northern wabash river watershed drains agricultural land pyron and neumann 2008 ahiablame et al 2013 wiener et al 2016 the geochemical data from the wabash river sampling campaign revealed high spatial complexity in geochemical concentrations and isotopic compositions for example anomalously high salinity cl coincident with high total dissolved solids tds and high concentrations of sodium na sulfate so4 2 strontium sr2 potassium k and fluoride f were measured in river samples collected along the headwaters reach from fort recovery oh wr1 in figs 1 2 to the forks of the wabash near huntington in wr4 in figs 1 2 these observations pose two interrelated questions what is the source of the high salinity and high tds in the headwaters reach and what does the observed high salinity and tds of baseflow mean with respect to long term water quality in the headwaters of the wabash river while this research was initiated to improve our understanding of the sources of water that support baseflow in large agricultural watersheds the observed high salinity in the headwaters reach of the wabash river watershed has additional implications for the salinization of baseflow and cl legacies in agricultural watersheds freshwater salinization is a global problem kaushal et al 2018 agricultural watersheds such as those in the american midwest are particularly vulnerable to salinization because there are many potential sources of salt that can contribute to salinity including anthropogenic sources such as potash kcl fertilizers seasonal ice snow control using road salt halite septic and industrial effluent home and business water softener systems and dust control on country roads using brines panno et al 2006 kaushal et al 2018 salt can also come from geologic sources warren 2016 such as bedded halite the dissolution of the fluid inclusions in the halite can potentially alter other solute concentrations cendón et al 2008 brennan et al 2013 due to its unique geologic setting and the presence of intensive agricultural practices the headwaters of the wabash river provides a unique setting to address this issue since there are numerous anthropogenic and potential geologic sources that can explain the observed salinity in the study area we investigate the following sources of salinity 1 surface and shallow subsurface runoff from agricultural fields impacted by potash fertilizers kcl or muriate of potash 2 septic effluent vengosh and pankratov 1998 panno et al 2006 wastewater discharge wiener et al 2016 or brine discharge from home water softener systems panno et al 2006 3 discharge from deep sedimentary brines or leaky gas wells given the proximity of the headwaters reach to the trenton gas field keith 1985 and 4 deicing and dust control agents in the study area namely road salt or halite although oil field brines may have been used at one time in portions of northwestern oh kell et al 2004 we also assess regional groundwater discharge from the midwestern basins and arches regional aquifer system eberts and george 2000 as a potential source of elevated cl and other solutes this aquifer is hosted in silurian devonian carbonate rocks and is spatially extensive through northwestern ohio northern indiana southern michigan and northeastern illinois see fig 2 of eberts and george 2000 the dataset presented here adds to the growing body of literature on the effects of landscape management namely agricultural and drainage practices on hydrological processes skaggs et al 1994 sloan et al 2016 buskirk et al 2020 impacts of agricultural practices on shallow subsurface processes have been well documented in research completed at the intensively managed landscapes critical zone observatory iml czo and in other independent study sites the iml czo research has substantially improved our understanding on how surface agricultural practices such as tillage and subsurface drainage modifications have impacted water solute and nutrient yields from agriculturally managed landscapes kumar et al 2018 wilson et al 2018 however these studies rarely consider interactions with deeper aquifers thereby limiting our understanding on their role in baseflow generation and their effect on salinity and tds in these agricultural watersheds this study bridges that gap by providing valuable insight into 1 the interactions between surface water shallow aquifers and deep aquifers including regional flow in bedrock 2 advantages and limitations in using multiple isotopic and geochemical tracers as forensic tools to differentiate between anthropogenic and geologic sources of salinity to agricultural rivers and 3 the two way exchange of salinity and nutrients between surface water shallow aquifers and deeper aquifers here we address the following overarching questions 1 what is the source of the anomalous solute concentrations and high salinity in the headwaters reach of the wabash river 2 what do the solute concentrations reveal about the sources of baseflow in the headwaters reach and 3 how much if any groundwater from the regional aquifer is discharged to the headwaters reach we answer these questions using a multiple isotopic tracer approach combined with geochemical analyses specifically chlorine 36 ratios 36cl cl and chloride bromide mass ratios cl br are used to identify and differentiate between the numerous sources of salinity strontium isotopic ratios 87sr 86sr are measured in river water soil and bedrock samples to identify the flowpaths that contribute to baseflow salinity i e is the salinity coming from the shallow subsurface deeper aquifers or gas field formations stable isotopes of water 18o and 2h are used to identify mixing relationships between different sources of water and to identify sources of recharge 2 description of study area 2 1 geography and geology the wabash river watershed is large 85 340 km2 and the river flows through different geologic settings therefore to aid in the comparison of data across the watershed the entire watershed was divided into 3 regions that largely conform to preexisting subdivisions used in other publications in this paper we define the upper wabash river uwr as that portion of the river extending from ft recovery oh wr1 in fig 1 to lafayette in wr7 in fig 1 the uwr primarily drains the central till plain tipton till plain see gray 2000 the middle wabash river mwr extends from lafayette in south to terre haute in wr12 in fig 1 and primarily drains the central till plain gray 2000 the mwr defined here conforms to the area defined in doss 1994 the lower wabash river lwr extends from terre haute in south to new haven il wr18 in fig 1 and primarily drains the southern hills and lowlands region gray 2000 the area that we have defined as the lwr largely conforms to the area delineated in illinois flood maps isws 2020 a brief geologic description is provided here please see casey 1996 bugliosi 1999 and eberts and george 2000 for a detailed explanation of the geological hydrogeological and geochemical framework of the study area including the midwestern basin and arches regional aquifer system bedrock units and their associated deep aquifers in the study area are covered by glacial sediments up to approximately 154 m thick in some places from the wisconsinan ice sheet fig 3 eberts and george 2000 however the unconsolidated glacial sediment is relatively thin less than 30 m along the headwaters reach silurian bedrock units found in northeastern indiana and northwestern ohio were originally deposited in shallow marine and reef settings casey 1996 mclaughlin et al 2018 these units are primarily comprised of limestones and dolomites pinsak and shaver 1964 and contain evaporites and sulfide minerals pinsak and shaver 1964 casey 1996 outcrops of silurian bedrock wabash formation are exposed at the land surface in road cuts near the forks of the wabash huntington in see site wr4 in fig 2 and near france park logansport in frisbee et al 2019 see site wr6 in fig 2 discontinuous exposures of upper ordovician rocks are present beneath the unconsolidated sediment in the headwaters reach of the wabash river watershed where the ancient teays river system has eroded the silurian carbonate sequence melhorn and kempton 1991 figs 2 and 3 the ordovician rocks are primarily comprised of shales with a smaller proportion of interbedded limestones the upper ordovician rocks host the maquoketa group aquifer system schmidt 2009 that is coincident with the buried teays valley the ordovician trenton limestone lies beneath the maquoketa group aquifer system and it hosts the trenton gas field and associated formation brines keith 1985 casey 1996 the headwaters reach of the wabash river is positioned between the michigan basin located to the north separated by the kankakee arch the illinois basin located to the southwest separated by the cincinnati arch and the appalachian basin located to the east separated by the findlay arch see fig 2 of eberts and george 2000 the location between these arches has profoundly affected the underlying structure and attitude of sedimentary units and groundwater flow directions for example older geologic units such as upper ordovician silurian and devonian rocks were brought closer to the land surface along the axes of these arches thus bedrock units get younger moving west north and east from the axes of the arches see fig 2 of eberts and george 2000 uplift and glaciation have also affected groundwater flowpaths casey 1996 bugliosi 1999 eberts and george 2000 2 2 hydrogeology and surface hydrology unconsolidated glacial sediments in the uwr and mwr fig 3 host shallow phreatic aquifers these aquifers are thought to contain primarily modern groundwater eberts and george 2000 report tritium 3h activities ranging from 3 0 to 20 6 tu in the shallow phreatic aquifers which were at the time consistent with modern recharge 70 years although eberts and george 2000 did not collect samples of groundwater that are spatially coincident with the wabash headwaters reach they did sample a transect across the uwr they report some overlap in δ18o between the shallow phreatic aquifers in the unconsolidated glacial deposits 7 85 to 7 65 and the shallow portion of the regional carbonate aquifer 7 90 to 7 75 however isotopically light groundwater 14 4 to 7 40 was found in the deep regional carbonate aquifer with the lightest groundwater found in the maumee river basin northeast of fort wayne in this isotopically light groundwater was inferred to be a mixture of pleistocene recharge and modern cold season recharge eberts george 2000 the silurian bedrock units whose thickness generally increases to over 760 m progressing northward from the axes of the arches toward michigan support the midwestern basin and arches regional aquifer system regional groundwater flow in the silurian carbonate aquifer follows the dip away from the axes of the arches eberts and george 2000 modeled the hydrogeology of this aquifer system and found that local scale groundwater i e short groundwater flowpaths that are affected by seasonal variations in recharge likely accounts for 50 to 97 percent of baseflow to streams in the region while regional groundwater i e long groundwater flowpaths that are minimally affected by variations in seasonal recharge accounts for 3 to 50 percent of baseflow eberts and george 2000 also present isotopic data on samples of groundwater collected from the deep regional carbonate aquifer these samples were found to be largely tritium dead 3h 0 1 tu in addition radiocarbon residence times tended to get longer as flowpath lengths increased ranging up to approximately 13 000 years near the distal end of a set of flowpaths in the maumee river basin near lake erie eberts and george 2000 thus they inferred that a significant proportion of pleistocene recharge from the last glacial maximum is present in the deep regional carbonate aquifer the wabash river originates from seeps located on private property south of fort recovery oh west of wr1 in figs 1 2 during this study water samples could not be collected from the private property however water samples were collected where the headwater stream is channelized in a ditch located approximately 1 5 km downstream of the private property at the historic anthony wayne parkway roadside park wabash river 16s 691220 me 4 469 326 mn see wr1 in fig 2 the stream channel then takes a circuitous route looping northeast then northwest back to fort recovery oh see site wr2 in fig 2 before flowing into northeastern indiana fig 1 this paper focuses on the headwaters reach from fort recovery oh site wr1 in fig 2 to huntington in site wr4 in fig 2 there are three usgs stream gauging sites in the headwaters reach of the wabash river and all three sites are located in indiana two of our sampling sites in the headwaters reach are located near a usgs stream gauging site site wr3 is located near the stream gauge at linn grove in site 03322900 https waterdata usgs gov in nwis inventory site no 03322900 last accessed on 08 february 2022 and site wr4 is located near the stream gauge at huntington in site 03323500 https waterdata usgs gov in nwis inventory site no 03323500 last accessed on 08 february 2022 the average daily discharge at linn grove over the period from 01 january 1965 to 31 december 2019 ranged from 0 11 to 394 m3 s 1 a continuous record of discharge over the same time period is not available at huntington in however the average daily discharge at huntington over the period from 01 january 1965 to 31 december 2001 excluding incomplete years of 1992 and 1993 ranged from 0 10 to 239 m3 s 1 an average annual hydrograph fig 4 was created for the headwaters reach over a 55 year period of record 01 january 1965 to 31 december 2019 using stream gauge data from the usgs gauge at linn grove in a set of flow duration curves fdcs was created for the discharge data from the usgs gauging sites at linn grove huntington and an additional site at peru in located in proximity to site wr5 daily discharge data for the wabash river near peru in was obtained from usgs site 03 327 500 https waterdata usgs gov in nwis inventory site no 03327500 last accessed on 08 february 2022 over the same interval as the linn grove site these curves fig 5 show that the headwaters reach is relatively flashy and that discharge generally increases from linn grove in wr3 to peru in near wr5 here we define flashy streamflow as stream discharge that responds quickly to rain or snowmelt events and has an event scale recession that is usually steep poff et al 1987 for example the annual hydrograph of the headwaters reach shows quick responses to precipitation events particularly during summer and fall thunderstorms see days 160 to 280 of fig 4 in addition the slopes of the flow duration curves shown in fig 5 are slightly steeper in the 20 to 80 exceedence probability range of the plots than expected for groundwater dominated streams searcy 1959 in general the highest stream flows occur in the spring after snowmelt late february through late april and prior to the growing season days 52 to 115 of fig 4 stream flows gradually decrease over the course of the summer growing season despite plentiful rainfall during this time fig 4 the lowest stream flows occur in the autumn near the end of the growing season and prior to winter storms occurring in november and december figs 4 5 miller and lyon 2021 report similar flashy behavior for tile drained watersheds in ohio baker et al 2004 examined flashy stream behavior in midwestern watersheds using a new flashiness index 2 3 climatology the headwaters reach of the wabash river experiences cold winters and hot summers only one weather station was found in the headwaters reach with a sufficiently long and continuous period of record comparable to the 55 year period of record of from the stream gauge at linn grove in meteorological data were obtained from noaa climate data online https www ncei noaa gov maps daily last accessed on 10 february 2022 for a weather station located in berne in approximately 7 0 km to the east of linn grove in 01 january 1965 to 31 december 2019 fig 1 the average low and high january winter temperatures measured at berne in over the last 55 years are 8 0 c and 0 4 c respectively and the average low and high july summer temperatures are 17 8 c and 29 2 c berne in receives an average of 100 3 cm of precipitation per year fig 6 precipitation is seasonally distributed 19 percent occurs in the winter months 30 percent occurs in the spring months 30 percent occurs in the summer months and 21 percent occurs in the fall months the study area receives between 10 7 cm and 157 9 cm of snow not snow water equivalent per year during the spring and summer of 2015 the study area received the 4th highest annual precipitation observed over the 55 year period of record fig 6 this resulted in widespread flooding throughout the wabash river watershed see green dashed line in fig 4 floodwaters began to recede near the end of august calendar day 240 of fig 4b and baseflow conditions resumed in late september and were persistent through october and early november samples were collected in the uwr on 30 october 2015 indicated by the red x mark in fig 4a confirming that samples were collected during acceptable baseflow conditions 3 methods 3 1 field chemistry and geochemical analyses the entire main channel of the wabash river was longitudinally sampled over the course of 3 days sites wr1 through wr5 fig 1 in the uwr were sampled on 30 october 2015 and the remaining two sites in the uwr wr6 and wr7 were sampled on 06 november 2015 the mwr sampling sites wr8 to wr12 fig 1 were sampled on 06 november 2015 the lwr sampling sites wr13 to wr18 fig 1 were sampled on 20

first sample site each day using a three point calibration for ph and ec the calibration was checked randomly throughout the day a new do membrane and fresh electrolyte o2 solution was used for each sampling trip all water samples were collected by tossing one end of a 10 m length of viton tubing into the river from the bank letting the tubing settle to the bottom of the channel and then connecting the other end to a geotech 0 45 μm dispos a filter http www geotechenv com disposable filter capsules html last accessed on 08 february 2022 the tubing was then fed into the drive head of a pegasus alexis peristaltic pump and pumped for 3 to 5 min to completely flush the filter the filters were replaced approximately every 2 to 3 sample sites water samples were collected in clean non acidified 250 ml wide mouth hdpe nalgene bottles for general geochemistry analyses standard cations and anions which were completed at the chemical laboratory of the new mexico bureau of geology and mineral resources the suite of cations includes sodium na potassium k magnesium mg2 calcium ca2 and strontium sr2 and these were measured using a perkinelmer optima 5300 dv icp oes per epa 200 7 the suite of anions includes chloride cl bromide br fluoride f nitrate no3 and sulfate so4 2 and these were measured using a dionex ics 5000 ic according to epa 300 0 alkalinity was not measured in the

analyses chlorine 36 ratios 36cl cl and cl br mass ratios mg l 1 mg l 1 are used to identify and differentiate between the numerous sources of salinity that are present in the headwaters of the wabash river watershed potential chloride endmembers were identified through previous research by frisbee et al 2017 and from other published data see below groundwater recharged during the bomb pulse era should have elevated 36cl cl compared to pre anthropogenic and modern recharge clark and fritz 1997 corcho alvarado et al 2005 tosaki et al 2011 phillips 2000 2013 shaw et al 2014 frisbee et al 2017 found that springs in shades state park in central indiana were discharging a substantial component of groundwater recharged during or immediately after the bomb pulse era those springs had 36cl cl 1300 x 10 15 baseflow in streams draining those same catchments ranged from 720 x10 15 to 1250 x10 15 in comparison pre anthropogenic 36cl cl in groundwater for northern indiana should range from 300 x10 15 to approximately 450 x10 15 based on data provided in davis et al 2000 2003 monthly integrated samples of precipitation were collected in west lafayette in to provide an endmember for within year runoff frisbee et al 2017 geologic brines can be found in the headwaters of the wabash river watershed brines tend to have very low 36cl cl 20 1015 relative to modern and clean unaffected groundwater vengosh 2014 the expected range of cl br mass ratios for wet deposition varies with distance inland from oceanic sources short et al 2017 davis et al 1998 2000 report cl br less than approximately 250 for clean modern groundwater defined as groundwater unaffected by cl pollution regionally panno et al 2006 reports a cl br range of 23 to 521 and a mean of 156 for pristine groundwater from sand and gravel aquifers in nearby northeastern illinois frisbee et al 2017 report cl br ranging from 30 to 95 for clean unaffected springs in central indiana cl br mass ratios tend to be elevated 1000 in geologic brines and in waters that interacted with evaporite minerals davis et al 1998 therefore 36cl cl can be coupled with cl br to potentially differentiate between sources of cl davis et al 2000 davis et al 2003 filtered water samples were collected from each river site in clean non acidified wide mouth 1000 ml hdpe nalgene bottles for 36cl analyses precipitation was collected on a monthly basis in 2015 the winter precipitation samples that were collected after baseflow samples were collected for this study are not shown in this paper the 36cl cl of precipitation was assumed to be equivalent to the 36cl cl of modern within year recharge and surface runoff this assumption is made based on the inferred flashy behavior of streams in the region precipitation was collected in clean buckets installed in an open grassy area located near west lafayette in frisbee et al 2017 the buckets were inspected daily or immediately following precipitation events event scale precipitation samples were then poured into clean 2l nalgene bottles samples were then combined at the end of the month to create integrated monthly samples the buckets were washed with alconox and rinsed with deionized water after precipitation samples were collected and then re installed samples of road salt halite were acquired from two salt vendors that supply the indiana department of transportation one sample was provided by compass minerals from silurian salt deposits near goderich ontario and the other sample was provided by cargill deicing from silurian salt deposits near cleveland oh halite samples were dissolved in deionized water given a sulfur reduction step to reduce interference with 36s and agcl was precipitated from the water sample all 36cl cl analyses and chemistry steps were completed at the purdue prime lab using accelerator mass spectrometry ams sharma et al 2000 https www physics purdue edu primelab the reported relative measurement uncertainty ranged between 2 3 to 4 5 3 3 strontium isotope analyses strontium isotopic ratios 87sr 86sr of water samples are compared to the 87sr 86sr of rocks rock leachate and glacial sediment leachate present in the study area to identify which rocks host the flowpaths assuming that the 87sr 86sr of each endmember are distinct hogan and blum 2003 frisbee et al 2017 filtered water samples were collected from each river site in clean non acidified wide mouth 1000 ml hdpe nalgene bottles for 87sr 86sr analyses samples of geologic material found in the study area were also collected for whole rock and rock leachate 87sr 86sr analyses bedrock samples were also collected in the study area including silurian wabash formation dolomitic limestone silurian brassfield formation dolomitic limestone and ordovician platteville formation dolostone whole rock samples were crushed and processed at isotope tracer technologies glacial sediment samples were collected from the surface and shallow subsurface in the study area the glacial sediment samples were leached using deionized water since they are a mix of rock clasts and clay material and leaching is thought to provide a more representative 87sr 86sr of the unconsolidated glacial sediment this technique has been applied successfully in other recent studies frisbee et al 2017 warix et al 2020 gleason et al 2020 rock leachate samples were created by 1 placing 300 g of glacial sediment in clean 2 l nalgene bottles 2 filling the bottle with deionized water di 3 capping the bottle and leaching the rock samples for 2 months 4 decanting the water from the bottle and 5 measuring the strontium sr2 concentrations of the water and measuring the 87sr 86sr of the rock leachate all 87sr 86sr analyses were completed by isotope tracer technologies using thermal ionization mass spectrometry tims the reported analytical uncertainty is provided for comparison purposes we use 87sr 86sr ratios for precipitation that were reported in

vernon in and downstream of the confluence at old shawneetown il have cl concentrations of 37 mg l 1 and 29 2 mg l 1 respectively sodium concentrations largely parallel cl concentrations fig 7 table 2

watershed has a so4 2 concentration comparable to the headwater reach site wr16 has a so4 2 concentration of 175 mg l 1 and is located immediately downstream of a coal burning power plant near mt carmel il the sites in the headwaters reach also have elevated f concentrations ranging from 0 30 to 0 51 mg l 1 relative to the other sampling sites which have an average f concentration of 0 26 0 03

silurian rock leachate samples closely match the 87sr 86sr seawater curve for the silurian era reported in burke et al 1982 and mcnutt et al 1987 the 87sr 86sr of the headwater sites are not similar

86sr similar to glacial sediment fig 9 table 4 some samples in the lwr have 87sr 86sr that fall within the grey box for trenton brines however these sample sites are located far from the trenton gas field and are therefore not associated with oilfield brines 4 4 spatial trends in δ18o and δ2h of water the δ18o and δ2h compositions of all river sites are plotted in fig 10 relative to the global

stable isotopes measured in precipitation are not available for the headwaters reach the samples from the headwaters reach are isotopically distinct from the remainder of the river samples in fact wr1 wr2 wr3 and wr4 all cluster together and have δ18o values less than 7 65 and δ2h values less than 45 2 fig 10a site wr3 has the lowest most negative stable isotopic composition of the three sites in

geochemistry data 5 1 1 sources of elevated chloride sodium and potassium baseflow cl concentrations in the three headwater sites range from 56 4 to 131 mg l 1 and are 1 9 to 4 3 times higher than measured elsewhere in the wabash river for regional context these cl concentrations are higher than the two samples collected in the much larger ohio river above 37 mg l 1 orup in table 2 and below 29 2 mg l 1 ordn in table 2 the confluence with the wabash river for a broader context these cl concentrations are higher than those reported for the middle rio grande and portions of the lower rio grande in new mexico cl less than 75 mg l 1 where deep sedimentary brines are thought to discharge to the rio grande hogan et al 2007 the cl br mass ratios of the headwaters reach 758 to 1139 are also surprisingly high compared to the remainder of the watershed in comparison clean shallow groundwater unaffected by pollution collected in the middle reaches of the wabash river watershed have cl br ranging from 52 to 92 one potential explanation for the elevated cl br ratios of the headwaters reach is septic effluent and or the discharge of brines from home water softener systems in septic effluent davis et al 1998 report that the cl br of domestic sewage commonly ranges between 300 and 600 for comparison vengosh and pankratov 1998 reported cl br for domestic sewage in israel ranging from 410 to 873 for a regional comparison panno et al 2006 reported cl br of 403 to 533 for septic effluent in northeastern illinois although private septic systems had ratios ranging from 65 to 5404 where the highest ratios were due to the discharge of brine solution from water softener systems installed in the homes see harrison 2006 for a description on how water softeners work a simple divalent monovalent cation mass ratio d m ratio can be created from ca2 mg2 na k to differentiate untreated hard from treated softened water for example water samples were analyzed before and after a water softener was installed in the home of the author for reference table 7 the untreated water has a d m ratio of 4 1 and the treated water has a d m ratio of 0 67 illustrating the substantial reduction adsorption of divalent ions in the water after treatment water samples from wr2 wr3 and wr4 have d m ratios of 2 77 1 73 and 1 07 respectively whereas the average d m ratio of the remaining river sites is 3 53 0 75 and range from 1 72 near the confluence with the ohio river at wr18 to 4 69 wr1 ultimately it s unlikely that the d m ratios in the headwaters reach result from brine effluent from home water softener systems due to the sparse population of the region this type of effluent may have localized impacts but we suspect that the brine becomes diluted in the larger aquifer or once it reaches a river it s unlikely that septic effluent alone is responsible for the high cl br ratios observed in the headwaters reach since it is located in open farmland and is not heavily populated except for the town of huntington in schnoebelen and krothe 1999 state that non reef portions of the silurian devonian carbonate aquifer in northwestern indiana contain layers of interbedded montmorillonite and that these clay layers have a high cation exchange capacity they attribute sodium rich groundwater found in the non reef carbonate aquifer to cation exchange processes occurring in the clay layers it s plausible that elevated na and possibly at least some of the k may originate from a similar process in the silurian devonian carbonate aquifer in northeastern indiana eberts and george 2000 state that sodium rich groundwater found in the study area is due to cation exchange processes occurring in devonian shales and subsequent mixing of waters in the carbonate aquifer unfortunately we do not have bedrock cores to test this explanation road salt halite is used as a deicer throughout the uwr during the winter in addition oilfield brines have historically been used as road deicers in the winter and as dust control agents on country roads in the summer in northwestern ohio kell et al 2004 but brines are not used as deicers today the dissolution of halite increases both the cl concentration and cl br in water but dilutes the 36cl cl in water davis et al 1998 reported that halite dissolution results in cl br mass ratios ranging from 1000 to 10 000 samples of halite obtained for this study were dissolved in deionized water and found to have cl br of 6060 and 6091 consistent with the range reported by davis et al 1998 given the geologic age of these halite deposits they should be 36cl dead 36cl cl 0 these halite samples had 36cl cl of 2 39 0 51 x 10 15 and 2 43 0 49 x 10 15 bedded halite if present in silurian bedrock in northeastern in would be expected to have similar cl br and 36cl cl approximately equal to 0 however bedded halite deposits have not been mapped in the silurian units of northeastern in therefore a geologic explanation in the silurian bedrock for the observed salinity is tenuous at best alternatively the elevated cl and cl br could potentially come from oilfield brines in the underlying ordovician bedrock however the 87sr 86sr data argue against trenton oilfield brines as a source for the observed salinity since the river samples do not fall within the range shown in the grey shaded box data from mcnutt et al 1987 in fig 9 thus trenton oilfield brines are not likely the source of the observed salinity fertilizers such as muriate of potash kcl can also contribute excess cl to the headwaters reach via agricultural runoff or subsurface tile drains samples of potash were not analyzed during this study however panno et al 2006 report a cl br of 510 for potash in that same study cl br ranged from 108 to 1974 for tile drainage from agricultural fields in northeastern illinois in this study the mass ratio of k cl ranges from 0 05 to 0 21 in the headwaters reach whereas the na k cl ranges from 0 80 to 0 90 this would suggest that the cl is sourced primarily from nacl rather than potash fertilizers table 3 however the na k cl ratio can be misleading since potassium and sodium do not behave conservatively or similarly in agricultural landscapes potassium is an essential nutrient for all plants hawkesford et al 2012 while sodium is not essential for most crop plants maathuis 2014 although data for na and cl concentrations of soybean and corn grain are sparse what data is available shows that k concentration in grain exceeds that of na and cl by approximately 1 to 2 orders of magnitude pietz et al 1978 parker et al 1983 1985 yang and blanchar 1993 crop plants take up k and a proportion of this k is removed in the grain and subsequently leaves the field ultimately the na k cl ratio does not account for the uptake removal ratio of k by plants in studies investigating sources of cl in watersheds it s common to see either 1 plots of k vs cl compared to plots of na vs cl 2 na cl ratios compared to k cl ratios shown here or 3 attempts to close cl mass balances at the watershed scale if the effects of uptake removal ratios of k per crop are not considered then the impact of kcl applications on the cl load at the watershed scale will be underestimated recommended rates of potash application to crops in indiana are made based on soil test k an estimate of plant available k and are outlined in culman et al 2020 applications are usually made uniformly to the soil surface in the months of november through april annually for one crop season or biennially for two crop seasons typically the fertilizer will either be left on the soil surface or incorporated into the upper 15 cm of the soil briefly the objective of fertilization is to maintain an optimal level of soil test k 100 to 170 mg kg 1 soil varying by soil cation exchange capacity and then replace crop removal from the field plus 20 lb k2o acre 20 kg k ha 1 corn and soybean k removal from the field in the grain are estimated at 0 20 and 1 15 lb k2o bushel 1 respectively equivalent to approximately 3 5 and approximately 18 kg k mg 1 grain dry matter since the recommendations are geared to replace crop k removal only approximately 20 kg k ha 1 of the k applied is expected to remain in the field as k 20 30 of that added and most would be retained by the negative charge of the soil this would tend to drive the k cl of agricultural runoff lower than expected based on fertilizer application rates in contrast only 2 to 10 of the cl applied would be removed from the field in the grain and that left in the soil 90 98 of that added would be repelled by the soil s negative charge making it much more likely to move with water the headwaters reach flows through farmland in adams wells and huntington counties in indiana where the primary crops are soybeans and corn in 2015 adams county had 100 760 acres of soybeans and 67 962 acres of corn wells county had 116 635 acres of soybeans and 85 283 acres of corn and huntington county had 101 297 acres of soybeans and 61 315 acres of corn in this region approximately 150 lb kcl acre 168 kg kcl ha would be recommended annually for soybean crops and approximately 75 lb kcl acre 84 kg kcl ha for corn crops combined this equates to approximately 34 094 u s tons 30 929 metric tons of kcl that would be applied annually in these three counties alone the vast majority of the potash used in this region and in the midwest is mined from devonian evaporite deposits in saskatchewan fuzesy 1982 and is supplemented with potash mined from late permian deposits in new mexico austin 1980 given the geologic ages of these deposits we can assume that the cl present in the potash mined from these deposits is also 36cl dead thus based on these data potash is a plausible explanation for the high cl high cl br and 36cl cl dilution observed in the headwaters reach 5 1 2 sources of elevated strontium sulfate fluoride and nitrate the unique geochemical composition of the three headwater sites is apparent when the data are plotted in a piper diagram fig 11 despite their location in the headwaters of the watershed their geochemical composition more closely matches that of river sites in the lwr the three headwater sites are calcium sulfate type waters while the remaining river samples are calcium bicarbonate type waters except for wr16 fig 11 site wr16 likely has elevated so4 2 from coal ash residuals and is an anomalous sample discussed below the sr2 and so4 2 concentrations measured in the headwaters reach are quite high relative to the remaining river samples in general sr2 concentrations tend to be very low in natural waters often less than 0 10 mg l 1 hem 1985 foley et al 1972 reported elevated sr2 and so4 2 in the bedrock aquifer of allen county in located immediately north of the headwaters reach however sr2 concentrations in the unconsolidated glacial aquifers of allen county tended to be very low in comparison in that study they attributed the anomalous concentrations of sr2 and so4 2 in the bedrock aquifer to the dissolution of celestite srso4 and or strontianite srco3 present in the carbonate bedrock the findlay arch mineral belt contains abundant celestite carlson 1987 1994 however celestite has a relatively low solubility compared to gypsum dove and czank 1995 which may limit its contribution to the sr2 and so4 2 load to groundwater and surface water schnoebelen and krothe 1999 analyzed groundwater from bedrock in silurian devonian bedrock in northwestern indiana they did not observe elevated sr2 0 41 to 0 63 mg l 1 in the non reef silurian devonian aquifer but they did report elevated so4 2 150 to 170 mg l 1 feulner and hubble 1960 and oh epa 2012 both report high sr2 concentrations in groundwater from silurian carbonate aquifers in western ohio southeast of fort recovery oh due to the presence of celestite and strontianite in the bedrock luczaj and masarik 2015 also suggest that celestite and possibly strontianite are responsible for elevated sr2 concentrations in groundwater in eastern wisconsin however their groundwater samples were collected from older cambrian ordovician sandstones sacks and tihansky 1996 analyzed concentrations of sr2 and so4 2 in samples of gypsum collected from the upper floridan aquifer that were dissolved in deionized water they report sr2 so4 2 molar ratios of 1 for celestite and 0 003 in gypsum explained by limited replacement of ca2 with sr2 in gypsum we ground samples of carbonate rocks collected in the headwaters of the wabash river from the ordovician platteville formation silurian wabash formation and silurian brassfield formation and dissolved them in deionized water in a similar fashion the leachates yielded sr2 so4 2 molar ratios of 0 002 0 004 and 0 037 respectively in addition frisbee et al 2019 collected water samples from three karst springs emerging from the wabash formation near site wr6 in logansport in these three springs had sr2 so4 2 molar ratios ranging from 0 005 to 0 008 consistent with the rock leachate from the silurian wabash formation in comparison sites wr2 wr3 and wr4 had sr2 so4 2 molar ratios of 0 009 0 021 and 0 019 respectively which are again similar to the silurian rock leachates the three headwater sites have the highest sr2 so4 2 molar ratios in the entire watershed site wr1 has a sr2 so4 2 molar ratio of 0 012 and the ratios decrease progressing downstream of wr4 therefore the dissolution of gypsum can potentially explain the higher concentrations of strontium and sulfate only one sampling site in the lwr has a so4 2 concentration comparable to the headwater reach that site wr16 has a so4 2 concentration of 175 mg l 1 and is located immediately downstream of a coal burning power plant near mt carmel il this site also has an elevated 87sr 86sr ratio 0 710702 that is consistent with the range of coal combustion residuals ccr from the illinois basin reported in ruhl et al 2014 and harkness et al 2016 high so4 2 concentrations were also reported in plumes from a coal fired power plant in portage wi simsiman et al 1987 a water sample collected concurrently in the white river upstream of its confluence with the wabash river and upstream of the coal burning power plant near mt carmel il has a 87sr 86sr of 0 709359 and a so4 2 concentration of 74 mg l 1 for comparison the elevated so4 2 and high 87sr 86sr at site wr16 are consistent with coal ash residuals the findlay arch mineral belt also contains abundant fluorite carlson 1994 fluorite has a low solubility and fluoride concentrations tend to be very low 1 0 mg l 1 in natural waters having tds less than 1000 mg l 1 hem 1985 however elevated f concentrations ranging up to 4 mg l 1 have been reported in wells installed in silurian and devonian rocks in northwestern ohio in close proximity to the headwater reach oh epa 2012 the f concentrations for sites wr2 wr3 and wr4 were 0 29 mg l 1 0 41 mg l 1 and 0 51 mg l 1 respectively all but one of the remaining river sites have f less than 0 29 mg l 1 schnoebelen and krothe 1999 provide an alternative explanation for high f concentrations 2 4 to 3 1 mg l 1 observed in the non reef silurian devonian aquifer in northwestern indiana they state that the high f can be explained by apatite instead of fluorite in their study the groundwater samples were undersaturated with respect to fluorite and positive with respect to apatite in principle po4 3 concentrations should increase as apatite is weathered however our samples were not field acidified and therefore nearly all the sites were non detects with respect to po4 3 in any case there is a plausible geologic explanation for the relatively high f concentrations observed in the headwaters reach reconciling the apparent disagreement on the source of the high cl high cl br and low 36cl cl and the source of the high sr2 so4 2 and f is difficult however no3 provides additional insight the no3 concentrations in the headwaters reach are also high relative to the remaining river sites site wr1 has a no3 concentration of 25 8 mg l 1 while sites wr2 wr3 and wr4 have concentrations of 64 4 8 91 and 30 1 mg l 1 respectively site wr3 is again distinct from wr2 and wr4 in that it has the lowest no3 concentration the remaining downstream river sites have no3 concentrations ranging from 4 09 to 8 55 mg l 1 with an average concentration of 5 76 1 23 mg l 1 elevated no3 is an indicator of nutrient rich runoff or legacy nutrients in groundwater these data again seem at odds with the concentrations of sr2 and so4 2 which are not likely due to anthropogenic effects found in the study area one plausible explanation for sites wr2 and wr4 is that groundwater discharging to the river from the silurian carbonate regional aquifer mixes with shallow groundwater that has been contaminated over time with cl and no3 from agricultural practices this would preserve the high cl high cl br low 36cl cl and the high sr2 so4 2 mg2 and f however site wr3 does not conform to this conceptual model 5 2 sources of salinity inferred from isotope data river samples are plotted relative to the lmwl dashed line gmwl solid line and seasonal endmembers in fig 10b the storm to storm interstorm variability in the seasonal precipitation endmembers is quite high fig 10b welp smith et al 2020 winter and spring precipitation have the lightest minimum δ18o values 26 3 and 22 4 respectively yet winter precipitation also has the largest interstorm variability of all seasonal endmembers summer precipitation has the heaviest least negative δ18o and δ2h composition and shows the least interstorm variability of the seasonal endmembers the δ18o and δ2h compositions of wr1 wr2 wr3 and wr4 are lighter more negative than and distinct from the remaining downstream river samples fig 10a these four river samples plot closely with the average spring endmember fig 10b in comparison the remaining river samples have δ18o value more positive than 7 1 and plot between the average summer and average fall precipitation endmembers fig 10b it s unlikely that much if any recharge occurs during the summer growing season april through september in northern indiana because there is an increased water demand for crops and the summer months are typically the driest in fact daniels et al 1991 and naylor et al 2016 state that 65 percent of groundwater recharge in northern indiana occurs from fall october november to spring march april frisbee et al 2017 found that a recharge temperature between 0 c and approximately 4 c provided the best fit to atmospheric cfc curves and yielded comparable cfc ages for the groundwater samples suggesting that little if any recharge occurs in the summer growing season it s more likely that the δ18o values of the downstream river samples reflect a large proportion of recent runoff this inference is consistent with the 36cl cl data table 3 shows the 36cl cl of monthly precipitation from april to october of 2015 the minimum 36cl cl during this period was 43 2 10 15 and the maximum was 79 8 10 15 this range is illustrated by the grey box in fig 8 the water samples were collected in the uwr in october 2015 when the monthly 36cl cl in precipitation was 55 4 10 15 in comparison the remaining downstream river samples have 36cl cl ranging from 39 9 1 9 x 10 15 to 94 8 3 5 x 10 15 this range is somewhat misleading since 11 of the 14 downstream samples fall within the range of 42 3 10 15 to 59 6 10 15 a range that is similar to that of monthly precipitation during this time table 3 fig 8 we infer that the downstream river samples contained a substantial component of recent runoff at the time of sampling sites wr2 wr3 and wr4 have 36cl cl of 33 4 10 15 27 5 10 15 and 30 4 10 15 respectively these ratios are even lower than the range for monthly precipitation collected in 2015 ranging from 43 2 10 15 to 79 8 10 15 davis et al 2000 show 36cl cl data for five wells located northeast of fort wayne in these wells were installed at depths of 6 1 18 0 24 4 29 0 and 48 8 m deep all but the deepest well was installed in unconsolidated glacial sediments the 48 8 m well was screened into the underlying devonian carbonate bedrock they report 36cl cl of 12 6 2 9 x 10 15 166 11 x 10 15 153 8 x 10 15 190 22 x 10 15 and 250 15 x 10 15 respectively and all but the 6 1 m deep well were tritium dead these groundwater samples had cl br of 2720 43 4 47 8 32 4 and 41 6 respectively davis et al 2000 inferred that the low 36cl cl high cl br and high 3h 16 tu of the shallow well 6 1 m resulted from an influx of cl contaminated surface water the higher 36cl cl lower cl br and 3h dead groundwaters of the remaining wells most likely resulted from the weathering of fluid inclusions in plutonic clasts in the unconsolidated glacial sediment the 36cl cl of wr2 wr3 and wr4 are lower than the groundwater samples reported in davis et al 2000 and lower than 2015 precipitation samples reported here we infer that these samples show the effects of 36cl dilution as mentioned earlier it s unlikely that the old cl originates from septic effluent and or home water softener brine alone or bedded halite in addition the 87sr 86sr of wr2 wr3 and wr4 most closely match the 87sr 86sr of the silurian brassfield formation sbf and silurian wabash formation swf and argue against a source in the ordovician rocks or ordovician oilfield brines ultimately the two remaining sources that can potentially explain the low 36cl cl are old cl from road salt or potash fertilizer given the application rates of kcl in the counties of the headwaters reach and the timing of the river sampling in late fall prior to the winter use of deicers kcl seems most plausible we cannot discount the possibility of legacy cl from road salt the unconsolidated thickness of the headwater reach may help reconcile these datasets the unconsolidated sediment is relatively thin in the headwaters reach fig 3 ranging from less than 1 0 to 154 m in the uwr please note that fig 3 shows the minimum and maximum thickness in the window and not in the uwr alone the unconsolidated sediment is 28 2 m 23 4 m 43 7 m and 17 0 m at sites wr1 wr2 wr3 and wr4 respectively this thin cover of glacial sediment would in principle increase the possibility that regional groundwater could be discharged to the wabash river or allow it to mix with shallow groundwater hoyer and hallberg 1991 state that bedrock aquifers in iowa that are overlain by glacial sediment less than 30 5 m are more susceptible to contamination if applied to indiana then this suggests that sites wr1 wr2 and wr4 are likewise more susceptible site wr3 does not conform to this conceptual model this site is spatially located where the ordovician maquoketa group aquifer system has been mapped schmidt 2009 and is spatially coincident with the buried channel of the ancient teays river fidlar 1943 steeg 1946 bruns and steen 2003 at ceylon in north of geneva in the unconsolidated sediment is 43 7 m previous research indicates that the sidewalls of the buried teays valley in this area are steep and cut through silurian salamonie dolomite into ordovician carbonates and shales bruns and steen 2003 in northern in the salamonie dolomite overlies the brassfield formation thereby supporting the 87sr 86sr data site wr3 also has lower do and spc than the other sites in the headwaters reach and much lower no3 concentrations if ture then this suggests that the groundwater discharging from the teays valley sediment and carbonate bedrock aquifer may not be contaminated if significant mixing were occurring between the shallow aquifers and deep relatively clean groundwater from the regional carbonate aquifer then we would expect wr3 to show similar effects as wr2 and wr4 in any case a hydrogeologic connection is present between the headwaters of the wabash river the silurian devonian carbonate aquifer and the buried teays valley sediment at wr3 without the aid of multiple isotopic tracers and geochemical data this hydrogeologic connection would remain masked by the solute burden of the phreatic aquifer 5 3 baseflow separation models a second goal of this study was to determine how much if any baseflow comes from the inferred sources of the salinity to accomplish this task we chose to use a 87sr 86sr mixing model in the 87sr 86sr mixing model we assumed that the strontium ratio for each river sample is equal to a mixture of shallow groundwater phreatic aquifer in unconsolidated sediment and regional groundwater carbonate aquifer we know the 87sr 86sr of glacial sediment in the region and the glacial sediment leachate should approximate the 87sr 86sr of the shallow aquifer tile drains and perhaps even surface runoff in the headwaters reach thus if water infiltrates the glacial sediment then it will slowly acquire the 87sr 86sr of the strontium bearing minerals in the sediment therefore we assume that the 87sr 86sr of the shallow aquifer is equivalent to the 87sr 86sr of leachate from glacial sediment 0 709783 0 000034 the regional groundwater endmember is assumed to be equivalent to the 87sr 86sr of the silurian brassfield formation 0 708292 0 000047 the results of this two endmember mixing model show that the fraction of regional groundwater in baseflow at wr2 wr3 and wr4 is 58 84 and 79 percent respectively the highest contribution from regional groundwater is associated with wr3 these estimates are conservative first as mentioned earlier widespread flooding occurred throughout the uwr and mwr in 2015 while we have faith that baseflow conditions were present when the uwr was sampled fig 4 it is difficult to determine what effect delayed subsurface runoff had on the isotopic and geochemical signature of baseflow in the headwaters repeat synoptic sampling campaigns should be completed to sample baseflow during a normal precipitation year and identify the contribution of groundwater from deep aquifers on baseflow in the remaining downstream sites second while we have collected and analyzed a small subset of the rocks in the stratigraphic column we may not have captured variability in 87sr 86sr present in different lithofacies however our data and interpretations of groundwater flow and geochemical processes largely conform to those of other studies in the same rock units in any case the 87sr 86sr data support a hydrogeologic connection between the headwaters of the wabash river and the regional carbonate aquifer and show that there is a connection between the aquifer associated with the buried teays valley regional carbonate aquifer and river without the aid of multiple isotopic and geochemical tracers the hydrogeologic connection between the river and the regional aquifer would have remained masked 6 conclusions the main objectives of this research study were to address the following questions 1 what is the source of the anomalous solute concentrations and high salinity in the headwaters reach of the wabash river 2 what do the solute concentrations reveal about the sources of baseflow in the headwaters reach and 3 how much if any groundwater from the regional aquifer is discharged to the headwaters reach the most plausible explanation for the elevated cl observed in the headwaters of the wabash river is that it comes from an anthropogenic source the timing of the sampling at the end of the growing season and prior to widespread application of road salt in winter suggests that kcl fertilizers are the likely source of the salinity however we cannot rule out the effects of legacy cl from past road salt usage in either case an old source of cl is responsible for the salinity and the observed 36cl dilution in the headwaters reach unfortunately 36cl cl cannot by itself differentiate between the proportions of salinity coming from two 36cl dead sources of salt with respect to the 2nd objective baseflow generation processes in the headwaters of the wabash river are spatially complex the cl no3 cl br and 36cl cl data seem at odds with the f sr2 so4 2 and 87sr 86sr data the former point to anthropogenic effects while the latter point to geologic sources of solutes the 87sr 86sr data support a hydrogeologic connection between the headwaters of the wabash river and the regional carbonate aquifer sites wr2 wr3 and wr4 have 87sr 86sr ratios similar to silurian carbonate rocks which host the midwestern basins and arches regional aquifer system in comparison the 87sr 86sr steadily increase progressing downstream of the headwaters reach and gradually reach a 87sr 86sr similar to leachate from glacial sediment in addition the δ2h and δ18o compositions for the downstream sites are distinct from the headwaters reach and plot more closely to the average summer precipitation endmember suggesting again that these sites contain a large proportion of recent runoff these data support our inference that the downstream river sites are comprised of a larger proportion of runoff or discharge of shallow groundwater from recent flooding in comparison sites wr1 wr2 wr3 and wr4 have the lightest most negative δ2h and δ18o compositions and are similar to the average δ2h and δ18o composition of spring precipitation cold season recharge the retention of the light δ2h and δ18o composition in the headwaters reach is important we infer that it points to groundwater discharged from the regional aquifer it s plausible that the regional groundwater is a mixture of modern recharge and pleistocene recharge based on the range for pleistocene recharge presented in eberts and george 2000 our conceptual model for the headwaters reach is that the cl no3 cl br and 36cl cl are tracking anthropogenic sources of solutes discharged from shallow groundwater hosted in unconsolidated sediment whereas the f sr2 so4 2 and 87sr 86sr are tracking bedrock weathering processes in the underlying carbonate aquifer at baseflow mixing between shallow cl and no3 rich groundwater from the unconsolidated sediment and regional cl and no3 poor groundwater from the carbonate aquifer occurs in the river site wr3 does not completely conform to this conceptual model we infer that there is some communication between the river and groundwater associated with the buried teays valley at site wr3 in fact a greater proportion of deep groundwater is present in baseflow at site wr3 based on the 87sr 86sr mixing model thus with respect to the 3rd objective we estimate that 58 to 84 percent of baseflow in the headwater reach comes from the regional groundwater discharged from the silurian devonian carbonate aquifer and buried teays valley sediment at wr3 these estimates are conservative and additional synoptic sampling campaigns combined with sampling of groundwater wells are necessary to get a more complete understanding of seasonal variability in the sources of baseflow and salinity in the headwaters of the wabash river without the aid of multiple isotopic and geochemical tracers the hydrogeologic connection between the river and the regional aquifer would have remained masked forensic applications of multiple isotopes enhance the ability to see different reservoirs of water even in intensively managed landscapes these findings have implications for the uwr and other agricultural watersheds while the intensively managed landscapes critical zone observatory iml czo has substantially improved our understanding on how agricultural practices such as tillage and subsurface drainage modifications have impacted water solute and nutrient yields from agriculturally managed landscapes kumar et al 2018 wilson et al 2018 these studies rarely quantify deep or regional groundwater processes as a consequence our understanding of their role in solute release salinity residence times and agroecosystem integrity is incomplete in addition our understanding of the exchange of cl and no3 between phreatic aquifers and deeper aquifers remains incomplete further quantification of this groundwater component in agricultural watersheds will improve regional hydrological models solute and nutrient loading models and geochemical weathering models it will also fill knowledge gaps in our understanding of baseflow generation processes in agricultural watersheds and improve salinity budgets in these same areas on a local scale future investigations of the uwr should not ignore the discharge of groundwater from the regional carbonate aquifer or groundwater associated with the buried teays valley in the majority of agricultural watersheds salinization can largely be explained by anthropogenic sources of salt in the american midwest road salt and kcl fertilizers are usually identified as the primary sources of salinity however the role of kcl in salinization may be underestimated in studies where crop k uptake removal ratios are not considered the uptake removal of k is very different than na for crops grown in the uwr therefore ratios of na cl k cl or na k cl suggest that kcl has less of an impact on salinity this seems at odds with the kcl application rates while 36cl cl can be used to identify old sources of cl it cannot by itself discern between two sources of cl that are both 36cl dead future work should investigate coupling 36cl cl with other tracers to sort out the individual impacts of road salt versus kcl fertilizers this problem is further exacerbated by our incomplete understanding of the roles of shallow and deep groundwater in baseflow generation in these settings the salinity budget in agricultural watersheds is complicated by a continual exchange of water salt and nutrients between the land surface and shallow subsurface aquifers however there are few attempts to quantify the exchanges with deep aquifers if exchanges of cl between surface water shallow aquifers and deep aquifers are substantial then future efforts to mitigate salinity increases in agricultural rivers will not be successful because there may be substantial storage of cl in groundwater and it may be released slowly across long time scales credit authorship contribution statement marty d frisbee conceptualization methodology sample collection writing review editing marc w

3433,recently the long short term memory lstm based rainfall runoff models have achieved good performance and thus have received many attentions in this paper we propose a novel rainfall runoff model named rr former based on the transformer which is entirely composed of attention mechanisms compared with a lstm based model the architecture of rr former can connect two arbitrary positions in a time series process directly by using attention modules it can strengthen or weaken the connection of two arbitrary positions and thus is more flexible than a lstm based model therefore the rr former has potential to achieve better performance by employing the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels dataset we test the performance of rr former in two tasks individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling in the first task our rr former outperforms two lstm based sequence to sequence models significantly for 7 day ahead runoff predictions for example the median and the mean of nash sutcliffe efficiency for the 673 basins provided by our rr former achieve 0 8265 and 0 7904 respectively while those provided by the benchmark model the better one between two benchmark models are 0 7448 and 0 6952 respectively in the second task our rr former also shows its power and suits for a big dataset better keywords rainfall runoff modeling transformer attention module lstm 1 introduction rainfall runoff modeling is very important in hydrological sciences which is a critical task that predicts runoff values by using rainfall values other meteorological forcings and catchment attributes especially in cases of regional runoff predictions recently data driven approaches have gained a lot of attentions especially for the lstm based ones which achieved good performance on runoff predictions in cases ofboth individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling gao et al 2020 barzegar et al 2021 khosravi et al 2020 salloom et al 2021 tennant et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 introduced to use two deep recurrent neural network models including a lstm model and a gated recurrent unit model to predict daily runoff values they showed that the principal component analysis method improved the performance by selecting appropriate input variables solgi et al 2021 presented a lstm neural network for groundwater level forecasting using only previously observed groundwater level data as the input and indicated the importance of high quality and long term groundwater level data by testing the performance of rainfall runoff models in great britain lees et al 2021 found that the lstm based models outperform a suite of benchmark conceptual models suggesting an opportunity to use additional data to refine conceptual models to predict hourly streamflow lin et al 2021 proposed a hybrid model having three parts including the first order difference a feedforward neural network and the lstm nourani and behfar 2021 proposed two types of seasonal lstm networks including sequenced lstm and wavelet lstm to model runoff sediment process of three gauging stations and the results showed that the seasonal lstm network can outperform the classic lstm network feng et al 2020 tested several data integration versions to leverage recent discharge measurements for improving predictions based on a lstm model and concluded that data integration was most beneficial in regions with high flow temporal autocorrelation kao et al 2021 proposed a hybrid of the stacked autoencoder with a recurrent neural network which can provide accurate and timely information to support emergency management in areas impacted by flood hazards to our knowledge many state of the art approaches to different tasks of runoff predictions on different datasets are established based on lstm for multi ahead runoff predictions lstm based sequence to sequence s2s models or encoder decoder architectures perform excellently on many datasets therefore lstm based data driven models have achieved good performance and thus have received many attentions recently however the lstm based models cannot connect twopositions in a time series process directly let alone strengthen the connection of two arbitrary positions to show it clearly we first briefly introduce the structure of lstm network as shown in fig 1 the lstm contains four parts a constant error carousel cell in addition to three gates i e the forget gate the input gate and the output gate the cell runs straight down the entire chain without any activation function and the nonlinear gating units can regulate the information flow into and out of the memory cell the forget gate decides what information the cell state would forget it ranges from 0 to 1 which means completely removing the memory to completely keeping the memory the input gate decides which information is used to update the cell state the potential cell state gate i e the tanh layer adds a new candidate value to the state the output gate controls the information of cell state flowing into the new hidden state the autoregression of lstm network shows that the lstm network does not consider the direct connection of two nonadjacent positions note that considering the connection of two arbitrary positions has the following advantages first compared with the direct connection of two adjacent positions the connection of two arbitrary positions considers the relations of positions more comprehensively and can generate features from all positions for each position in some cases two nonadjacent positions may have strong relations and this useful information can be digged out by the model considering the connection of two nonadjacent positions however the lstm cannot dig such information out due to its recurrent neural network based structureand the lost of its memory second the connection of two arbitrary positions is beneficial for multi step ahead runoff predictions specifically the non autoregressive multi step ahead predicting is available which is faster and can avoid error accumulation due to its structure the lstm network has to do autoregressive predicting that may result in lower speed and error accumulation the transformer proposed by vaswani et al 2017 relies entirely on attention modules to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence aligned recurrent neural network e g lstm this architecture can connect two arbitrary positions in a time series process directly by using a self attention module that is the transformer can strengthen or weaken the connection of two arbitrary positions and thus is more flexible than a lstm based model besides the transformer has longer memory than the lstm which is not discussed in this paper here the memory refers to how long sequence time series the model can handle that is a long memory means that the model can capture the information provided by the position with a long distance due to its advantages the transformer has the potential to achieve better performance compared with the lstm in this paper we develop a novel rainfall runoff model named rr former based on the transformer for a hydrology system the connection between two arbitrary positions can dig out the correlation or data similarity of these two positions by using the self attention mechanism and cross attention mechanism the input including meteorological forcings catchment attributes and runoff observations of a position is related to those of all positions and then their correlations or data similarities can be obtained this is beneficial for runoff predictions because we can give more attentions or larger weights to the positions which have more correlations to the position needed runoff prediction the transformer along with its improved versions see dai et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 has been applied successfully in several tasks vaswani et al 2017 proposed the transformer for the first time and then applied it on both wmt 2014 english to german and wmt 2014 english to french translation tasks dai et al 2019 proposed a novel architecture named transformer xl that can learn dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence and achieved better performance on both short and long sequences for better handling long sequence time series forecasting problem zhou et al 2021 designed an efficient transformer based model named informer experiments on four datasets showed that informer performed better than existing methods and provided a good solution to the long sequence time series forecasting problem chen et al 2019 proposed to use the transformer to capture the sequential signals underlying users behavior sequences for recommendation in alibaba gonzalez et al 2021 proposed twilbert which is a specialization of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers bert architecture to deal with the case of the spanish language used in twitter rasmy et al 2021 proposed med bert adapting the bert framework for pre training contextualized embedding models on structured diagnosis data from 28 490 650 patients ehr dataset dosovitskiy et al 2021 applied a pure transformer model directly to sequences of image patches and showed that it can perform very well on image classification tasks in this paper we focus on two tasks individual rainfall runoff modeling one model for each basin and regional rainfall runoff modeling one model for all basins by employing the camels dataset for this big dataset we list several representative methods about rainfall runoff modeling as follows kratzert et al 2018 showed the potential of lstm for individual rainfall runoff modeling on 241 basins of camels dataset with meteorological forcings for the first time and also tested the performance of lstm for regional runoff predictions on 4 hydrological units yin et al 2021 proposed a sequence to sequence model with multi state vector based on lstm named lstm msv s2s to predict multi day ahead runoff values and tested its performance for individual rainfall runoff modeling on 673 basins of camels dataset the results showed that the lstm msv s2s performed well and its structure was beneficial for improving the performance kratzert et al 2019 handled the regional rainfall runoff modeling problem by training a single lstm based model on 531 basins of the camels dataset and significantly improved performance compared to a set of benchmarks they used meteorological forcings and catchment attributes and emphasized the importance of catchment characteristics for regional rainfall runoff modeling besides these data driven models there are several process driven models including the sac sma newman et al 2017 the vic regionally calibrated mizukami et al 2017 the vic basin individually calibrated newman et al 2017 the hbv model seibert et al 2018 the mhm regionally calibrated rakovec et al 2019 and the mhm basin individually calibrated mizukami et al 2019 in this paper by employing the camels dataset we handled individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling by using our proposed rr former the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows first we propose the rr former which is a rainfall runoff model based on the transformer for the first time second we apply our rr former on two runoff prediction tasks individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling in camels dataset third we show the good performance of our rr former for multi step ahead runoff predictions we organize this paper as follows section 2 discusses the rr former we introduce the camels dataset and experimental design in section 3 results and discussions are given in section 4 section 5 concludes this paper 2 methods we propose and discuss the architecture of rr former in this section and first introduce its basic component i e attention mechanism as follows 2 1 attention mechanism attention mechanism can be explained by how we pay attention to some words in a sentence or a target area in an image in other words it is a weighted sum mechanism which assigns different weights to different positions that is it gives more important positions larger weights assume that we have a set of key value pairs k v and queries q in which the dimensions of keys values and queries are d k d v and d q respectively by measuring the similarity between the queries and keys the weights are assigned to the values and then the output can be described as 1 attn q k v f similarity q k v where q is a matrix by packing a set of queries vector q together the cases are the same to k and v there are many similarity measures for the queries and keys and vaswani et al 2017 adopted the following so called scaled dot product attention 2 attn q k v soft max qk t d k v it is an improved version of the dot product attention by dividing d k this is important and we show it as follows assume that the elements in query and key are normalized independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1 the traditional dot product operation without dividing d k will generate results with mean 0 and variance d k and the output of softmax operation will be closer to 0 or 1 this will lead to gradient vanishing when backpropagation is done through softmax layer here we introduce cross attention self attention masked attention and multi head attention which are used in rr former note that if k and v are linearly transformed from the same sequence in attention mechanism and q is linearly transformed from another sequence it is called cross attention cross attention can catch long range relations between two sequences and will be used in the decoder of our rr former here the keys and the values are linearly transformed from the sequence related to meteorological forcings and catchment attributes and the queries are linearly transformed from the sequence related to runoff observations if q k and v are linearly transformed from the same sequence it is named self attention self attention can catch the long range internal relations in one sequence and will be used in the encoder and decoder of our rr former for the encoder the sequence refers to the inputs including meteorological forcings and catchment attributes of different positions by using the keys values and queries the correlations or similarities of meteorological forcings and catchment attributes from different positions can be obtained for the decoder the sequence refers to the runoff observations of different positions by using the keys values and queries the correlations or similarities of runoff observations from different positions can be obtained for transformer decoder we need to avoid future information flows to the left thus we employ masking operation before softmax operation which is named masked attention here we introduce the right part masking matrix in fig 2 for non autoregressive decoding by multi head attention the model can attend to different features from many representation subspaces simultaneously outputs from each head will be concatenated into one and followed by a linear transformation operation fig 3 shows how multi head attention works the pseudocode of multi head attention is presented in algorithm 1 here we summarize the above introduced attention modules in table 1 and show the combinations of those attention modules used by the rr former which is proposed in the following subsection algorithm 1

encoder decoder structure which is beneficial for multi step ahead runoff predictions we introduce the proposed rr former in detail as follows in order to fit our inputs to the dimension of model an input transformation layer is given at the beginning of the encoder and decoder as a linear operation it converts the inputs to vectors with the dimension of model because the transformer itself does not have time label we employ learnable position embedding to give position information then the results of input transformation and position embedding are added together which are sent to the encoder and decoder each encoder layer is composed of two sub layers self attention layers and position wise fully connected networks a self attention layer constructs long range dependence inside an encoder for each position a position wise fully connected network consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer residual connection and layer normalization are employed sequentially around each of the two sub layers the output of the last encoder layer is sent to the decoder the decoder layer consists of three sub layers masked self attention layers encoder decoder attention layers and position wise fully connected networks a masked self attention layer constructs long range dependence inside a decoder for each position which can guarantee to use only the known runoff observations an encoder decoder attention layer constructs long range dependence between the outputs of encoder and the inputs of decoder the position wise fully connected network residual connection and layer normalization are employed just like the encoder layer the output of the last decoder layer followed by linear transformation is the final runoff prediction here we use the non autoregressive decoding method that the decoder outputs all positions 7 day ahead runoff predictions through only one forward procedure rather than the step by step mode this implies that the non autoregressive decoding method runs much faster than the step by step mode besides the non autoregressive decoding method does not have error accumulation problem the pseudocode of our rr former is presented in algorithm 2

the following metrics the nash suteliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error rmse the absolute top 2 prediction error atpe 2 and the bias the nse is defined as 3 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i is the observed value at time i y i is the prediction y refers to the average of n observations the rmse is defined as 4 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n the smaller rmse refers to the better model the atpe 2 measures the accuracy of peak flow prediction defined as 5 atpe 2 j 1 h y j y j j 1 h y j where y 1 y 2 y h y j is the jth ordered runoff observations y j is the prediction result of

the values close to zero are desirable as mentioned we deal with individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling in this paper for individual rainfall runoff modeling the benchmarks are lstm msv s2s yin et al 2021 and lstm s2s xiang et al 2020 for regional rainfall runoff modeling the benchmarks are the sac sma newman et al 2017 the vic regionally calibrated mizukami et al 2017 the vic basin individually calibrated newman et al 2017 the hbv model seibert et al 2018 the mhm regionally calibrated rakovec et al 2019 and the mhm basin individually calibrated mizukami et al 2019 3 dataset and experimental setup 3 1 camels dateset the camels dataset addor et al 2017 newman et al 2015 having 674 basins in the united states is employed here this big dataset has many differently complex catchments and thus we can evaluate the models comprehensively the camels dataset contains meteorological forcings catchment attributes and observed runoff values on each basin at the daily timescale from october 1 1980 to december 31 2014 the daily meteorological data used for individual rainfall runoff modeling are calculated from the daymet data thornton et al 2012 and those used for regional rainfall runoff modeling are from the maurer data maurer et al 2002 these data can be available freely at https ral ucar edu solutions products camels newman et al 2014 here we use different daily meteorological data sources because the benchmarks for individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling used the above two different daily meteorological data sources the catchment attributes are about soils climate vegetation topography geology and so on they are introduced in detail in addor et al 2017 addor et al 2018 and we list the meteorological forcings and catchment attributes in table 2 for individual rainfall runoff modeling we select the same 673 basins as the benchmarks for regional rainfall runoff modeling we select the same 448 basins as the benchmarks for a fair comparison our proposed rr former uses the same daily meteorological forcings and catchment attributes as the benchmarks 3 2 experimental setup in this paper we design the following three experiments first we want to show the advantage of our proposed rr former for individual rainfall runoff modeling thus we test the rr former and benchmarks on 673 basins and compare their performance by using the statistics of those four evaluation metrics second we would like to point out that the pretraining process is very important to the rr former and thus compare the results having pretraining process with the results without pretraining process furthermore we also want to show the effect of fine tuning process and thus compare the results with fine tuning process and those without such a process third we will show that the proposed rr former suits for regional rainfall runoff modeling especially for big datasets like the camels 3 2 1 individual rainfall runoff modeling for the first two experiments i e individual rainfall runoff modeling by using our rr former and the importance of the pretraining process and fine tuning process we have the following steps first we preprocess the camels dataset and generate the so called basin specific dataset and global dataset here a global dataset refers to the dataset containing data of all basins and a basin specific dataset is a collection of the dataset for each basin second we apply the hyper parameter optimization or named hyper parameter grid search for suitable hyper parameters third we pretrain our model on global dataset and fine tune the model on basin specific dataset the above steps are about individual rainfall runoff modeling to show the importance of the pretraining process we train the models directly on basin specific dataset without pretraining on global dataset to show the importance of the fine tuning process we train the model on global dataset without fine tuning on basin specific dataset we will describe the steps about individual rainfall runoff modeling in details as follows we divide camels dataset into the training set from october 1 1980 to september 30 1995 validation set october 1 1995 to september 30 2000 and testing set october 1 2000 to september 31 2014 after data z score normalization and serialization see fig 5 the training set will be randomly shuffled while the validation set and testing set are order unchanged we employ the training set to update learnable parameters by using the backpropagation the validation set to determine hyper parameters and select models and the testing set to evaluate the rr former here as mentioned we generate the global dataset and basin specific dataset which are used for pretraining the rr former and fine tuning the model for each basin respectively the global dataset contains data of all basins which is also divided into three parts the training set validation set and testing set once the pretrained model is ready we fine tune it by using the basin specific dataset and then obtain the rr former for each basin 3 2 2 regional rainfall runoff modeling for regional rainfall runoff modeling we divide camels dataset into the training set from october 1 2001 to september 30 2008 validation set from october 1 1999 to september 30 2001 and testing set from october 1 1989 to september 31 1999 which is the same as benchmark models besides the meteorological forcings the same 27 catchment attributes used by benchmark models in table 2 are also used by our rr former here using both the same dataset partition and the same catchment attributes is for a fair comparison for regional rainfall runoff modeling we train one rr former for all selected 448 basins by using their training data to make it clear we show the experimental setup of individual rainfall runoff modeling and that of regional rainfall runoff modeling in table 3 3 2 3 model settings we employ hyper parameter grid search to determine the hyper parameters for our rr former with the limitation of computing resources we first select three hyper parameters groups by applying in 30 basins and then apply them in all basins to find the best group which is shown in table 4 the models were implemented based in python 3 7 using pytorch framework the libraries for data processing we used are numpy pandas and matplotlib all the experiments can be conducted on one single nvidia geforce rtx 2080ti 11 gb memory 4 results and discussion we evaluate the performance of different models by using four performance measures including the nse the rmse the atpe 2 and the bias we will show the power of our rr former for individual rainfall runoff modeling the importance of pretraining process and fine tuning process and the power of our rr former for regional rainfall runoff modeling in the following subsections 4 1 power of rr former for individual rainfall runoff modeling for individual rainfall runoff modeling we compare our proposed rr former with two benchmarks including lstm msv s2s yin et al 2021 and lstm s2s xiang et al 2020 and show their results of 7 day ahead runoff predictions in table 5 and more intuitively in fig 6 besides the cdfs of nses for 7 day ahead runoff predictions provided by those three models are given in fig 7 the results show that for both the overall predictions shown by nse and rmse and the peak flow predictions shown by atpe 2 the performance of our rr former is much better than that of the benchmarks besides the performance of 7th day ahead runoff predictions provided by rr former is much better than the performance of 1 day ahead runoff predictions provided by lstm s2s the median of nses of 5th day ahead runoff predictions provided by rr former is larger better than the median of nses of 1 day ahead runoff predictions provided by lstm msv s2s besides the accuracy of predictions for the unbiasedness of predictions the rr former is better than the benchmark models all these results show the power of rr former for individual rainfall runoff modeling and our rr former entirely based on attention mechanisms can find a better representation of rainfall runoff processing compared with the benchmarks based on the lstm here we take the basin numbered 12374250 as an example to show the advantages of rr former see fig 8 we can see that our rr former has much better performance than the two benchmarks i e lstm msv s2s and lstm s2s intuitively in fig 8 our rr former estimates those several peak flows well while the two benchmarks underestimate them heavily this example intuitively shows that our rr former can provide a better representation of rainfall runoff processing better overall predictions and better peak flow predictions compared with those two lstm based s2s models the rr former has two key processes pretraining process and fine tuning process for individual rainfall runoff modeling these two processes are important for the rr former which will be shown as follows 4 1 1 pretraining and fine tuning for rr former as mentioned our rr former contains two important processes pretraining process and fine tuning process that is our rr former achieves excellent performance on individual rainfall runoff modeling task by pretraining using the so called global dataset first and then fine tuning the model for each basin using the so called basin specific dataset here we want to show that these two processes are necessary by the rr former without fine tuning and the rr former without pretraining the rr former without fine tuning uses only the global dataset to train the model and does not use the basin specific dataset to fine tune the model for each basin the rr former without pretraining does not use the global dataset to pretrain the rr former but train one model for each basin by using its dataset basin specific dataset directly the statistic results provided by rr former rr former without fine tuning and rr former without pretraining are shown in table 6 and more intuitively in fig 9 besides the cdfs of nses for 7 day ahead runoff predictions provided by rr former rr former without fine tuning and rr former without pretraining are given in fig 10 the results show that both the pretraining process and the fine tuning process are necessary for our rr former without either process the performance of prediction accuracy and that of prediction unbiasedness decrease furthermore we compare the rr former without pretraining with those two benchmarks including lstm msv s2s and lstm s2s we can see that the rr former without pretraining still can outperform those two benchmarks in general which further indicates that our rr former can find a better representation of rainfall runoff processing than the two benchmarks even if the rr former does not have the important pretraining process that is it further shows the advantage of rr former moreover we compare the rr former without fine tuning with those two benchmarks including lstm msv s2s and lstm s2s comparing the nse median of rr former without fine tuning with that of lstm msv s2s we can see that lstm msv s2s can beat the rr former without fine tuning except for the 1 day ahead runoff predictions note that the rr former without fine tuning learns the overall characteristics of 673 basins and does not focus on the characteristics of a specific basin thus it cannot beat the benchmarks furthermore the inputs of rr former without fine tuning do not contain catchment attributes which are very important for regional rainfall runoff modeling this point will be shown in the following subsection 4 2 power of rr former for regional rainfall runoff modeling for regional rainfall runoff modeling in camels dataset the benchmarks including the sac sma the vic regionally calibrated the vic basin individually calibrated the hbv model the mhm regionally calibrated and the mhm basin individually calibrated are for 1 day ahead runoff predictions these results are provided by other research groups and we show them in table 7 without running any of them for a fair comparison our rr former can provide multi day ahead runoff predictions and its results for regional rainfall runoff modeling are shown in table 7 here since the evaluation of benchmarks did not provide the rmse the atpe 2 and the bias we use the nse to measure their performance besides the cdfs of nses for 7 day ahead runoff predictions provided by rr former with catchment attributes and rr former without catchment attributes are given in fig 11 from table 7 we can see that our rr former outperforms all benchmarks significantly for 1 day ahead runoff predictions for multi day ahead runoff predictions our rr former still performs well and even the performance of 7th day ahead runoff predictions is better than the performance of 1 day ahead runoff predictions provided by the physically based benchmark models the above results show the power of rr former for regional rainfall runoff modeling our rr former based on the transformer entirely composed of attention mechanisms suits for the big dataset much better than the lstm based ones actually for individual rainfall runoff modeling the pretraining process is as similar as the regional rainfall runoff modeling except for the use of catchment attributes here we also compare the rr former with catchment attributes and the rr former without catchment attributes in table 7 and fig 11 the results show that the catchment attributes are important to regional rainfall runoff modeling and the performance can be significantly improved by using those catchment attributes in our opinion the rr former can learn to group similar basins together by using the catchment attributes so that hydrologically similar basins use similar parts of the rr former thus for regional rainfall runoff modeling the catchment attributes should better be used by our rr former it is also worth noting that the rr former without catchment attributes for 1 day ahead runoff predictions still can beat the physically based benchmark models which further shows the power of rr former for regional rainfall runoff modeling 4 3 limitations of rr former the results show the power of our rr former for individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling however it is also worthwhile for pointing out its limitations as a deep learning based data driven model the rr former learns the connection of two arbitrary positions and feature similarities of different levels from the data purely the physical explanation is lacking to some extent although we have tried our best to relate different terminologies from the rr former to interpretations from a hydrologic perspective chadalawada et al 2020 introduced a novel machine learning rainfall runoff model induction toolkit for hydrological model building using genetic programming and carried out a induction of lumped models this kind of hydrologically informed machine learning approaches not only can generate the runoff predictions but also have meaningful hydrological explanations herath et al 2021 developed another hydrologically informed rainfall runoff model induction toolkits namely machine induction knowledge augmented system hydrologique asiatique for distributed rainfall runoff modeling herath et al 2021 showedthe potential of gp as a model induction toolkit in contrast to its most frequent usage as a short term forecasting tool pointed out the difference between theory based models and data science models and also analyzed the advantages of hydrologically informed models this kind of theory guided data science models has the advantages of both theory based models and data science models however the deep learning based rr former focuses on data science and thus its physical explanation is lacking to some extent nowadays many scientists are focusing on the explanations of deep learning models e g lstm based models and transformer based models a theory guided or hydrologically informed rr former is our future work 5 conclusions in this paper we proposed a novel rainfall runoff model named rr former based on the transformer which is entirely composed of attention mechanisms its architecture can connect two arbitrary positions in a time series process directly by using attention modules that is it can strengthen or weaken the connection of two arbitrary positions and thus is more flexible than a lstm based model the rr former has an encoder decoder structure which is beneficial for multi step ahead runoff predictions to show the advantages of rr former we tested its performance on two tasks individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling by employing the camels dataset and then compared it with both lstm based models and some physically based models our rr former has much better performance than those benchmarks on these two tasks the results showed that the rr former based on the transformer can find a better representation of rainfall runoff processing for individual rainfall runoff modeling our rr former has two important processes pretraining process and fine tuning process the pretraining process can improve the performance of the rr former significantly the rr former should better be pretrained by using a big dataset and our experiment showed this point although the results without the pretraining process still outperform those benchmarks the fine tuning process focuses on the characteristics of a specific basin and thus is also important for individual rainfall runoff modeling while the pretraining process learns the overall characteristics of all basins the main findings can be concluded as follows in brief first the proposed rr former can achieve better performance compared with the lstm based models due to the advantages of its architecture and thus more attentions on transformer based rainfall runoff models are needed second our rr former can achieve excellent performance on individual rainfall runoff modeling third a big dataset can be used to pretrain the rr former and this pretraining process is very important to rr former fourth the fine tuning process is also very important to our rr former on individual rainfall runoff modeling in which the characteristics of a specific basin can be considered by the rr former fifth our rr former suits for big datasets and can achieve excellent performance on regional rainfall runoff modeling in the future we will consider a combination of a physically based model and the rr former which has both the advantage of a physically based model and that of the rr former besides a better rainfall runoff model based on the transformer is also our future work code

3433,recently the long short term memory lstm based rainfall runoff models have achieved good performance and thus have received many attentions in this paper we propose a novel rainfall runoff model named rr former based on the transformer which is entirely composed of attention mechanisms compared with a lstm based model the architecture of rr former can connect two arbitrary positions in a time series process directly by using attention modules it can strengthen or weaken the connection of two arbitrary positions and thus is more flexible than a lstm based model therefore the rr former has potential to achieve better performance by employing the catchment attributes and meteorology for large sample studies camels dataset we test the performance of rr former in two tasks individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling in the first task our rr former outperforms two lstm based sequence to sequence models significantly for 7 day ahead runoff predictions for example the median and the mean of nash sutcliffe efficiency for the 673 basins provided by our rr former achieve 0 8265 and 0 7904 respectively while those provided by the benchmark model the better one between two benchmark models are 0 7448 and 0 6952 respectively in the second task our rr former also shows its power and suits for a big dataset better keywords rainfall runoff modeling transformer attention module lstm 1 introduction rainfall runoff modeling is very important in hydrological sciences which is a critical task that predicts runoff values by using rainfall values other meteorological forcings and catchment attributes especially in cases of regional runoff predictions recently data driven approaches have gained a lot of attentions especially for the lstm based ones which achieved good performance on runoff predictions in cases ofboth individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling gao et al 2020 barzegar et al 2021 khosravi et al 2020 salloom et al 2021 tennant et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 introduced to use two deep recurrent neural network models including a lstm model and a gated recurrent unit model to predict daily runoff values they showed that the principal component analysis method improved the performance by selecting appropriate input variables solgi et al 2021 presented a lstm neural network for groundwater level forecasting using only previously observed groundwater level data as the input and indicated the importance of high quality and long term groundwater level data by testing the performance of rainfall runoff models in great britain lees et al 2021 found that the lstm based models outperform a suite of benchmark conceptual models suggesting an opportunity to use additional data to refine conceptual models to predict hourly streamflow lin et al 2021 proposed a hybrid model having three parts including the first order difference a feedforward neural network and the lstm nourani and behfar 2021 proposed two types of seasonal lstm networks including sequenced lstm and wavelet lstm to model runoff sediment process of three gauging stations and the results showed that the seasonal lstm network can outperform the classic lstm network feng et al 2020 tested several data integration versions to leverage recent discharge measurements for improving predictions based on a lstm model and concluded that data integration was most beneficial in regions with high flow temporal autocorrelation kao et al 2021 proposed a hybrid of the stacked autoencoder with a recurrent neural network which can provide accurate and timely information to support emergency management in areas impacted by flood hazards to our knowledge many state of the art approaches to different tasks of runoff predictions on different datasets are established based on lstm for multi ahead runoff predictions lstm based sequence to sequence s2s models or encoder decoder architectures perform excellently on many datasets therefore lstm based data driven models have achieved good performance and thus have received many attentions recently however the lstm based models cannot connect twopositions in a time series process directly let alone strengthen the connection of two arbitrary positions to show it clearly we first briefly introduce the structure of lstm network as shown in fig 1 the lstm contains four parts a constant error carousel cell in addition to three gates i e the forget gate the input gate and the output gate the cell runs straight down the entire chain without any activation function and the nonlinear gating units can regulate the information flow into and out of the memory cell the forget gate decides what information the cell state would forget it ranges from 0 to 1 which means completely removing the memory to completely keeping the memory the input gate decides which information is used to update the cell state the potential cell state gate i e the tanh layer adds a new candidate value to the state the output gate controls the information of cell state flowing into the new hidden state the autoregression of lstm network shows that the lstm network does not consider the direct connection of two nonadjacent positions note that considering the connection of two arbitrary positions has the following advantages first compared with the direct connection of two adjacent positions the connection of two arbitrary positions considers the relations of positions more comprehensively and can generate features from all positions for each position in some cases two nonadjacent positions may have strong relations and this useful information can be digged out by the model considering the connection of two nonadjacent positions however the lstm cannot dig such information out due to its recurrent neural network based structureand the lost of its memory second the connection of two arbitrary positions is beneficial for multi step ahead runoff predictions specifically the non autoregressive multi step ahead predicting is available which is faster and can avoid error accumulation due to its structure the lstm network has to do autoregressive predicting that may result in lower speed and error accumulation the transformer proposed by vaswani et al 2017 relies entirely on attention modules to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence aligned recurrent neural network e g lstm this architecture can connect two arbitrary positions in a time series process directly by using a self attention module that is the transformer can strengthen or weaken the connection of two arbitrary positions and thus is more flexible than a lstm based model besides the transformer has longer memory than the lstm which is not discussed in this paper here the memory refers to how long sequence time series the model can handle that is a long memory means that the model can capture the information provided by the position with a long distance due to its advantages the transformer has the potential to achieve better performance compared with the lstm in this paper we develop a novel rainfall runoff model named rr former based on the transformer for a hydrology system the connection between two arbitrary positions can dig out the correlation or data similarity of these two positions by using the self attention mechanism and cross attention mechanism the input including meteorological forcings catchment attributes and runoff observations of a position is related to those of all positions and then their correlations or data similarities can be obtained this is beneficial for runoff predictions because we can give more attentions or larger weights to the positions which have more correlations to the position needed runoff prediction the transformer along with its improved versions see dai et al 2019 zhou et al 2021 has been applied successfully in several tasks vaswani et al 2017 proposed the transformer for the first time and then applied it on both wmt 2014 english to german and wmt 2014 english to french translation tasks dai et al 2019 proposed a novel architecture named transformer xl that can learn dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence and achieved better performance on both short and long sequences for better handling long sequence time series forecasting problem zhou et al 2021 designed an efficient transformer based model named informer experiments on four datasets showed that informer performed better than existing methods and provided a good solution to the long sequence time series forecasting problem chen et al 2019 proposed to use the transformer to capture the sequential signals underlying users behavior sequences for recommendation in alibaba gonzalez et al 2021 proposed twilbert which is a specialization of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers bert architecture to deal with the case of the spanish language used in twitter rasmy et al 2021 proposed med bert adapting the bert framework for pre training contextualized embedding models on structured diagnosis data from 28 490 650 patients ehr dataset dosovitskiy et al 2021 applied a pure transformer model directly to sequences of image patches and showed that it can perform very well on image classification tasks in this paper we focus on two tasks individual rainfall runoff modeling one model for each basin and regional rainfall runoff modeling one model for all basins by employing the camels dataset for this big dataset we list several representative methods about rainfall runoff modeling as follows kratzert et al 2018 showed the potential of lstm for individual rainfall runoff modeling on 241 basins of camels dataset with meteorological forcings for the first time and also tested the performance of lstm for regional runoff predictions on 4 hydrological units yin et al 2021 proposed a sequence to sequence model with multi state vector based on lstm named lstm msv s2s to predict multi day ahead runoff values and tested its performance for individual rainfall runoff modeling on 673 basins of camels dataset the results showed that the lstm msv s2s performed well and its structure was beneficial for improving the performance kratzert et al 2019 handled the regional rainfall runoff modeling problem by training a single lstm based model on 531 basins of the camels dataset and significantly improved performance compared to a set of benchmarks they used meteorological forcings and catchment attributes and emphasized the importance of catchment characteristics for regional rainfall runoff modeling besides these data driven models there are several process driven models including the sac sma newman et al 2017 the vic regionally calibrated mizukami et al 2017 the vic basin individually calibrated newman et al 2017 the hbv model seibert et al 2018 the mhm regionally calibrated rakovec et al 2019 and the mhm basin individually calibrated mizukami et al 2019 in this paper by employing the camels dataset we handled individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling by using our proposed rr former the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows first we propose the rr former which is a rainfall runoff model based on the transformer for the first time second we apply our rr former on two runoff prediction tasks individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling in camels dataset third we show the good performance of our rr former for multi step ahead runoff predictions we organize this paper as follows section 2 discusses the rr former we introduce the camels dataset and experimental design in section 3 results and discussions are given in section 4 section 5 concludes this paper 2 methods we propose and discuss the architecture of rr former in this section and first introduce its basic component i e attention mechanism as follows 2 1 attention mechanism attention mechanism can be explained by how we pay attention to some words in a sentence or a target area in an image in other words it is a weighted sum mechanism which assigns different weights to different positions that is it gives more important positions larger weights assume that we have a set of key value pairs k v and queries q in which the dimensions of keys values and queries are d k d v and d q respectively by measuring the similarity between the queries and keys the weights are assigned to the values and then the output can be described as 1 attn q k v f similarity q k v where q is a matrix by packing a set of queries vector q together the cases are the same to k and v there are many similarity measures for the queries and keys and vaswani et al 2017 adopted the following so called scaled dot product attention 2 attn q k v soft max qk t d k v it is an improved version of the dot product attention by dividing d k this is important and we show it as follows assume that the elements in query and key are normalized independent random variables with mean 0 and variance 1 the traditional dot product operation without dividing d k will generate results with mean 0 and variance d k and the output of softmax operation will be closer to 0 or 1 this will lead to gradient vanishing when backpropagation is done through softmax layer here we introduce cross attention self attention masked attention and multi head attention which are used in rr former note that if k and v are linearly transformed from the same sequence in attention mechanism and q is linearly transformed from another sequence it is called cross attention cross attention can catch long range relations between two sequences and will be used in the decoder of our rr former here the keys and the values are linearly transformed from the sequence related to meteorological forcings and catchment attributes and the queries are linearly transformed from the sequence related to runoff observations if q k and v are linearly transformed from the same sequence it is named self attention self attention can catch the long range internal relations in one sequence and will be used in the encoder and decoder of our rr former for the encoder the sequence refers to the inputs including meteorological forcings and catchment attributes of different positions by using the keys values and queries the correlations or similarities of meteorological forcings and catchment attributes from different positions can be obtained for the decoder the sequence refers to the runoff observations of different positions by using the keys values and queries the correlations or similarities of runoff observations from different positions can be obtained for transformer decoder we need to avoid future information flows to the left thus we employ masking operation before softmax operation which is named masked attention here we introduce the right part masking matrix in fig 2 for non autoregressive decoding by multi head attention the model can attend to different features from many representation subspaces simultaneously outputs from each head will be concatenated into one and followed by a linear transformation operation fig 3 shows how multi head attention works the pseudocode of multi head attention is presented in algorithm 1 here we summarize the above introduced attention modules in table 1 and show the combinations of those attention modules used by the rr former which is proposed in the following subsection algorithm 1

encoder decoder structure which is beneficial for multi step ahead runoff predictions we introduce the proposed rr former in detail as follows in order to fit our inputs to the dimension of model an input transformation layer is given at the beginning of the encoder and decoder as a linear operation it converts the inputs to vectors with the dimension of model because the transformer itself does not have time label we employ learnable position embedding to give position information then the results of input transformation and position embedding are added together which are sent to the encoder and decoder each encoder layer is composed of two sub layers self attention layers and position wise fully connected networks a self attention layer constructs long range dependence inside an encoder for each position a position wise fully connected network consists of an input layer a hidden layer and an output layer residual connection and layer normalization are employed sequentially around each of the two sub layers the output of the last encoder layer is sent to the decoder the decoder layer consists of three sub layers masked self attention layers encoder decoder attention layers and position wise fully connected networks a masked self attention layer constructs long range dependence inside a decoder for each position which can guarantee to use only the known runoff observations an encoder decoder attention layer constructs long range dependence between the outputs of encoder and the inputs of decoder the position wise fully connected network residual connection and layer normalization are employed just like the encoder layer the output of the last decoder layer followed by linear transformation is the final runoff prediction here we use the non autoregressive decoding method that the decoder outputs all positions 7 day ahead runoff predictions through only one forward procedure rather than the step by step mode this implies that the non autoregressive decoding method runs much faster than the step by step mode besides the non autoregressive decoding method does not have error accumulation problem the pseudocode of our rr former is presented in algorithm 2

the following metrics the nash suteliffe efficiency nse the root mean square error rmse the absolute top 2 prediction error atpe 2 and the bias the nse is defined as 3 nse 1 i 1 n y i y i 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where y i is the observed value at time i y i is the prediction y refers to the average of n observations the rmse is defined as 4 rmse i 1 n y i y i 2 n the smaller rmse refers to the better model the atpe 2 measures the accuracy of peak flow prediction defined as 5 atpe 2 j 1 h y j y j j 1 h y j where y 1 y 2 y h y j is the jth ordered runoff observations y j is the prediction result of y j h denotes the number of the top 2 peaks the smaller tpe refers to the better model the bias bias is defined as 6 bias i 1 n y i i 1 n y i i 1 n y i it measures the unbiasedness of the predictions the values close to zero are desirable as mentioned we deal with individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling in this paper for individual rainfall runoff modeling the benchmarks are lstm msv s2s yin et al 2021 and lstm s2s xiang et al 2020 for regional rainfall runoff modeling the benchmarks are the sac sma newman et al 2017 the vic regionally calibrated mizukami et al 2017 the vic basin individually calibrated newman et al 2017 the hbv model seibert et al 2018 the mhm regionally calibrated rakovec et al 2019 and the mhm basin individually calibrated mizukami et al 2019 3 dataset and experimental setup 3 1 camels dateset the camels dataset addor et al 2017 newman et al 2015 having 674 basins in the united states is employed here this big dataset has many differently complex catchments and thus we can evaluate the models comprehensively the camels dataset contains meteorological forcings catchment attributes and observed runoff values on each basin at the daily timescale from october 1 1980 to december 31 2014 the daily meteorological data used for individual rainfall runoff modeling are calculated from the daymet data thornton et al 2012 and those used for regional rainfall runoff modeling are from the maurer data maurer et al 2002 these data can be available freely at https ral ucar edu solutions products camels newman et al 2014 here we use different daily meteorological data sources because the benchmarks for individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling used the above two different daily meteorological data sources the catchment attributes are about soils climate vegetation topography geology and so on they are introduced in detail in addor et al 2017 addor et al 2018 and we list the meteorological forcings and catchment attributes in table 2 for individual rainfall runoff modeling we select the same 673 basins as the benchmarks for regional rainfall runoff modeling we select the same 448 basins as the benchmarks for a fair comparison our proposed rr former uses the same daily meteorological forcings and catchment attributes as the benchmarks 3 2 experimental setup in this paper we design the following three experiments first we want to show the advantage of our proposed rr former for individual rainfall runoff modeling thus we test the rr former and benchmarks on 673 basins and compare their performance by using the statistics of those four evaluation metrics second we would like to point out that the pretraining process is very important to the rr former and thus compare the results having pretraining process with the results without pretraining process furthermore we also want to show the effect of fine tuning process and thus compare the results with fine tuning process and those without such a process third we will show that the proposed rr former suits for regional rainfall runoff modeling especially for big datasets like the camels 3 2 1 individual rainfall runoff modeling for the first two experiments i e individual rainfall runoff modeling by using our rr former and the importance of the pretraining process and fine tuning process we have the following steps first we preprocess the camels dataset and generate the so called basin specific dataset and global dataset here a global dataset refers to the dataset containing data of all basins and a basin specific dataset is a collection of the dataset for each basin second we apply the hyper parameter optimization or named hyper parameter grid search for suitable hyper parameters third we pretrain our model on global dataset and fine tune the model on basin specific dataset the above steps are about individual rainfall runoff modeling to show the importance of the pretraining process we train the models directly on basin specific dataset without pretraining on global dataset to show the importance of the fine tuning process we train the model on global dataset without fine tuning on basin specific dataset we will describe the steps about individual rainfall runoff modeling in details as follows we divide camels dataset into the training set from october 1 1980 to september 30 1995 validation set october 1 1995 to september 30 2000 and testing set october 1 2000 to september 31 2014 after data z score normalization and serialization see fig 5 the training set will be randomly shuffled while the validation set and testing set are order unchanged we employ the training set to update learnable parameters by using the backpropagation the validation set to determine hyper parameters and select models and the testing set to evaluate the rr former here as mentioned we generate the global dataset and basin specific dataset which are used for pretraining the rr former and fine tuning the model for each basin respectively the global dataset contains data of all basins which is also divided into three parts the training set validation set and testing set once the pretrained model is ready we fine tune it by using the basin specific dataset and then obtain the rr former for each basin 3 2 2 regional rainfall runoff modeling for regional rainfall runoff modeling we divide camels dataset into the training set from october 1 2001 to september 30 2008 validation set from october 1 1999 to september 30 2001 and testing set from october 1 1989 to september 31 1999 which is the same as benchmark models besides the meteorological forcings the same 27 catchment attributes used by benchmark models in table 2 are also used by our rr former here using both the same dataset partition and the same catchment attributes is for a fair comparison for regional rainfall runoff modeling we train one rr former for all selected 448 basins by using their training data to make it clear we show the experimental setup of individual rainfall runoff modeling and that of regional rainfall runoff modeling in table 3 3 2 3 model settings we employ hyper parameter grid search to determine the hyper parameters for our rr former with the limitation of computing resources we first select three hyper parameters groups by applying in 30 basins and then apply them in all basins to find the best group which is shown in table 4 the models were implemented based in python 3 7 using pytorch framework the libraries for data processing we used are numpy pandas and matplotlib all the experiments can be conducted on one single nvidia geforce rtx 2080ti 11 gb memory 4 results and discussion we evaluate the performance of different models by using four performance measures including the nse the rmse the atpe 2 and the bias we will show the power of our rr former for individual rainfall runoff modeling the importance of pretraining process and fine tuning process and the power of our rr former for regional rainfall runoff modeling in the following subsections 4 1 power of rr former for individual rainfall runoff modeling for individual rainfall runoff modeling we compare our proposed rr former with two benchmarks including lstm msv s2s yin et al 2021 and lstm s2s xiang et al 2020 and show their results of 7 day ahead runoff predictions in table 5 and more intuitively in fig 6 besides the cdfs of nses for 7 day ahead runoff predictions provided by those three models are given in fig 7 the results show that for both the overall predictions shown by nse and rmse and the peak flow predictions shown by atpe 2 the performance of our rr former is much better than that of the benchmarks besides the performance of 7th day ahead runoff predictions provided by rr former is much better than the performance of 1 day ahead runoff predictions provided by lstm s2s the median of nses of 5th day ahead runoff predictions provided by rr former is larger better than the median of nses of 1 day ahead runoff predictions provided by lstm msv s2s besides the accuracy of predictions for the unbiasedness of predictions the rr former is better than the benchmark models all these results show the power of rr former for individual rainfall runoff modeling and our rr former entirely based on attention mechanisms can find a better representation of rainfall runoff processing compared with the benchmarks based on the lstm here we take the basin numbered 12374250 as an example to show the advantages of rr former see fig 8 we can see that our rr former has much better performance than the two benchmarks i e lstm msv s2s and lstm s2s intuitively in fig 8 our rr former estimates those several peak flows well while the two benchmarks underestimate them heavily this example intuitively shows that our rr former can provide a better representation of rainfall runoff processing better overall predictions and better peak flow predictions compared with those two lstm based s2s models the rr former has two key processes pretraining process and fine tuning process for individual rainfall runoff modeling these two processes are important for the rr former which will be shown as follows 4 1 1 pretraining and fine tuning for rr former as mentioned our rr former contains two important processes pretraining process and fine tuning process that is our rr former achieves excellent performance on individual rainfall runoff modeling task by pretraining using the so called global dataset first and then fine tuning the model for each basin using the so called basin specific dataset here we want to show that these two processes are necessary by the rr former without fine tuning and the rr former without pretraining the rr former without fine tuning uses only the global dataset to train the model and does not use the basin specific dataset to fine tune the model for each basin the rr former without pretraining does not use the global dataset to pretrain the rr former but train one model for each basin by using its dataset basin specific dataset directly the statistic results provided by rr former rr former without fine tuning and rr former without pretraining are shown in table 6 and more intuitively in fig 9 besides the cdfs of nses for 7 day ahead runoff predictions provided by rr former rr former without fine tuning and rr former without pretraining are given in fig 10 the results show that both the pretraining process and the fine tuning process are necessary for our rr former without either process the performance of prediction accuracy and that of prediction unbiasedness decrease furthermore we compare the rr former without pretraining with those two benchmarks including lstm msv s2s and lstm s2s we can see that the rr former without pretraining still can outperform those two benchmarks in general which further indicates that our rr former can find a better representation of rainfall runoff processing than the two benchmarks even if the rr former does not have the important pretraining process that is it further shows the advantage of rr former moreover we compare the rr former without fine tuning with those two benchmarks including lstm msv s2s and lstm s2s comparing the nse median of rr former without fine tuning with that of lstm msv s2s we can see that lstm msv s2s can beat the rr former without fine tuning except for the 1 day ahead runoff predictions note that the rr former without fine tuning learns the overall characteristics of 673 basins and does not focus on the characteristics of a specific basin thus it cannot beat the benchmarks furthermore the inputs of rr former without fine tuning do not contain catchment attributes which are very important for regional rainfall runoff modeling this point will be shown in the following subsection 4 2 power of rr former for regional rainfall runoff modeling for regional rainfall runoff modeling in camels dataset the benchmarks including the sac sma the vic regionally calibrated the vic basin individually calibrated the hbv model the mhm regionally calibrated and the mhm basin individually calibrated are for 1 day ahead runoff predictions these results are provided by other research groups and we show them in table 7 without running any of them for a fair comparison our rr former can provide multi day ahead runoff predictions and its results for regional rainfall runoff modeling are shown in table 7 here since the evaluation of benchmarks did not provide the rmse the atpe 2 and the bias we use the nse to measure their performance besides the cdfs of nses for 7 day ahead runoff predictions provided by rr former with catchment attributes and rr former without catchment attributes are given in fig 11 from table 7 we can see that our rr former outperforms all benchmarks significantly for 1 day ahead runoff predictions for multi day ahead runoff predictions our rr former still performs well and even the performance of 7th day ahead runoff predictions is better than the performance of 1 day ahead runoff predictions provided by the physically based benchmark models the above results show the power of rr former for regional rainfall runoff modeling our rr former based on the transformer entirely composed of attention mechanisms suits for the big dataset much better than the lstm based ones actually for individual rainfall runoff modeling the pretraining process is as similar as the regional rainfall runoff modeling except for the use of catchment attributes here we also compare the rr former with catchment attributes and the rr former without catchment attributes in table 7 and fig 11 the results show that the catchment attributes are important to regional rainfall runoff modeling and the performance can be significantly improved by using those catchment attributes in our opinion the rr former can learn to group similar basins together by using the catchment attributes so that hydrologically similar basins use similar parts of the rr former thus for regional rainfall runoff modeling the catchment attributes should better be used by our rr former it is also worth noting that the rr former without catchment attributes for 1 day ahead runoff predictions still can beat the physically based benchmark models which further shows the power of rr former for regional rainfall runoff modeling 4 3 limitations of rr former the results show the power of our rr former for individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling however it is also worthwhile for pointing out its limitations as a deep learning based data driven model the rr former learns the connection of two arbitrary positions and feature similarities of different levels from the data purely the physical explanation is lacking to some extent although we have tried our best to relate different terminologies from the rr former to interpretations from a hydrologic perspective chadalawada et al 2020 introduced a novel machine learning rainfall runoff model induction toolkit for hydrological model building using genetic programming and carried out a induction of lumped models this kind of hydrologically informed machine learning approaches not only can generate the runoff predictions but also have meaningful hydrological explanations herath et al 2021 developed another hydrologically informed rainfall runoff model induction toolkits namely machine induction knowledge augmented system hydrologique asiatique for distributed rainfall runoff modeling herath et al 2021 showedthe potential of gp as a model induction toolkit in contrast to its most frequent usage as a short term forecasting tool pointed out the difference between theory based models and data science models and also analyzed the advantages of hydrologically informed models this kind of theory guided data science models has the advantages of both theory based models and data science models however the deep learning based rr former focuses on data science and thus its physical explanation is lacking to some extent nowadays many scientists are focusing on the explanations of deep learning models e g lstm based models and transformer based models a theory guided or hydrologically informed rr former is our future work 5 conclusions in this paper we proposed a novel rainfall runoff model named rr former based on the transformer which is entirely composed of attention mechanisms its architecture can connect two arbitrary positions in a time series process directly by using attention modules that is it can strengthen or weaken the connection of two arbitrary positions and thus is more flexible than a lstm based model the rr former has an encoder decoder structure which is beneficial for multi step ahead runoff predictions to show the advantages of rr former we tested its performance on two tasks individual rainfall runoff modeling and regional rainfall runoff modeling by employing the camels dataset and then compared it with both lstm based models and some physically based models our rr former has much better performance than those benchmarks on these two tasks the results showed that the rr former based on the transformer can find a better representation of rainfall runoff processing for individual rainfall runoff modeling our rr former has two important processes pretraining process and fine tuning process the pretraining process can improve the performance of the rr former significantly the rr former should better be pretrained by using a big dataset and our experiment showed this point although the results without the pretraining process still outperform those benchmarks the fine tuning process focuses on the characteristics of a specific basin and thus is also important for individual rainfall runoff modeling while the pretraining process learns the overall characteristics of all basins the main findings can be concluded as follows in brief first the proposed rr former can achieve better performance compared with the lstm based models due to the advantages of its architecture and thus more attentions on transformer based rainfall runoff models are needed second our rr former can achieve excellent performance on individual rainfall runoff modeling third a big dataset can be used to pretrain the rr former and this pretraining process is very important to rr former fourth the fine tuning process is also very important to our rr former on individual rainfall runoff modeling in which the characteristics of a specific basin can be considered by the rr former fifth our rr former suits for big datasets and can achieve excellent performance on regional rainfall runoff modeling in the future we will consider a combination of a physically based model and the rr former which has both the advantage of a physically based model and that of the rr former besides a better rainfall runoff model based on the transformer is also our future work code

the enrichment of arsenic and fluoride in groundwater keywords high fluoride arsenic groundwater solutes palaeo recharge shallow leakages hydrochemistry isotopes semi arid area 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most valuable and vital resources for domestic irrigation and agricultural activities due to the ever growing demand for clean drinking and irrigation water and lack of surface water supplies the importance of groundwater is increasing exponentially which is more pronounced in arid semi arid areas diouf et al 2020 unfortunately the improper exploitation and continued mismanagement of groundwater resources have led to severe problems of water stress and degradation of water quality kumar et al 2020a kumar et al 2020b re et al 2017 the most common occurrence of water quality deterioration particularly in arid semiarid regions is high fluoride arsenic groundwater pollution bhattacharya et al 2020 mirzavand et al 2020 pant et al 2021 rather than influencing the water aspects groundwater fluoride arsenic contamination have been recognized to present a health risk relying on the levels in which they are present kumar et al 2020a kumar et al 2020b long term intake of high f groundwater 1 0 1 5 mg l is the main cause of fluorosis and triggers multiple diseases including osteosclerosis cardiovascular diseases multi organ lesions and disorder of endocrine system gupta ayoob 2016 hossain patra 2020 lower intelligence and cognitive deficits in children are also associated with excessive exposure to fluoride established by plenty of epidemiological evidences yu et al 2021 consistently high level of arsenic exposure 10 µg l through groundwater has been documented to result in severe chronic human diseases e g skin damage circulatory problems and various visceral cancers ahmad bhattacharya 2019 usepa 2018 the yuncheng basin of shanxi province is one of the representative fluorosis and arsenicosis affected areas in northern china where groundwater salinization is severely taking place gao et al 2019 li et al 2018 li gao 2019 historically elevated fluoride and arsenic concentrations occur in shallow groundwater in this basin hu guo 1992 since the early 2000 s in order to prevent and control endemic fluorosis and arsenicosis water management authorities had carried out water improvement project in the form of water diversion from other places and drilling middle deep wells for centralized water supply wang et al 2011 more and more endemic areas benefit greatly from years of defluoridation and dearsenic water improvement projects however this progress brings up new issues with heavy pumping of middle and deep aquifers for local industry agriculture and the life fluoride and arsenic enrichment are not only limited in shallow groundwater but also widely distributed in deep aquifers undoubtedly this poses new threat to public health as well as for agricultural activities this study incorporates major and minor ion chemistry conservative source and age indicators of water br cl δ18o δ2h and 14c and the isotopic composition of the dissolved constituents 87sr 86sr δ34s and δ13c with the following major objectives 1 to delineate the origins and evolutions of deep groundwater and 2 to investigate the mechanisms of groundwater solutes fluoride and arsenic enrichment the primary results for this study could be useful for other arid semi arid basins with limited resources to understand groundwater quality deterioration and provide scientific basis for planning protecting and making decisions of water resource management 2 study area 2 1 geographical location the yuncheng basin in northern china stretches from latitudes 34 40 to 35 30 n and longitudes 110 15 to 111 25 e fig 1 and covers a total area of about 6 211 km2 china geological survey 2006 there is a yuncheng salt lake located in the southwestern part of yuncheng city extending over an area of 120 km2 the study area is a semi closed intermontane basin with mountains surrounded to the south east and north zhongtiao mountain lies down the southern and northeastern boundary with the highest elevation of 1 260 1 990 m the yellow river flows to the west of the yuncheng basin the study area is characterized by monsoonal climate with large fluctuations in daily temperature and low relative humidity the annual total evapotranspiration is 2 000 mm while the annual average rainfall is 550 mm generally concentrated in the summer months of july august and september yang lu 2005 2 2 geology and hydrogeology the basin consists of 300 500 m thick quaternary sediments q1 q4 fine grained aeolian loess are dominant in the sediments with occasional interlayered fluvial and lacustrine deposits archean metamorphic rocks arsm outcrop in the southern of the zhongtiao mountain comprising of hornblendite amphibolites and quartzite elsewhere the quaternary sediments sit above the sedimentary rocks mainly neogene mudstone and cambro ordivician limestone yuncheng regional water bureau 1982 the quaternary deposits are divided into two aquifers the unconfined shallow unit q3 and locally q4 with a depth of 10 70 m below the land surface and the confined deep unit consisting of q1 and locally q2 80 500 m fig 1 b china geological survey 2006 from the basin margins to the central areas the grain size of the two aquifers sediments changes from the coarse particles to fine particles gradually and the thickness of the aquifers increases controlled by the lithological structures groundwater in the basin flows from the margins towards its interior with precipitation infiltration being the main recharge source additional recharge occurs due to lateral penetration of fissure water along the basin margin leakage of non perennial river water and irrigation return flow groundwater discharge is dominated by evapotranspiration and artificial abstraction horizontal hydraulic gradients in the deep aquifer are higher up to 0 015 than that in the shallow unit 0 001 0 01 leading to a faster horizontal flow in the deep unit currell et al 2010 throughout the basin vertical groundwater flow is more rapid than horizontal flow with high vertical hydraulic gradients 0 01 0 45 due to the high rates of deep groundwater pumping china geological survey 2006 according to the investigation the estimated total groundwater withdrawal from the yuncheng basin in 2003 was 4 108 m3 yr which is 1 5 times the estimated sustainable yield of 2 6 108 m3 yr cao 2005 therefore the basin has witnessed severe over exploitation of groundwater 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling in order to characterize the water chemistry and isotopes of yuncheng basin 25 groundwater samples from deep aquifers with depth of 80 360 m including one geothermal water were collected in august of 2014 fig 1 a additionally one rainfall water and thirty shallow groundwater database with depth between 10 m and 50 m were also incorporated into this study fig 1 and table 1 li et al 2016 samples were collected in 1l capacity polythene bottles which had been thoroughly washed with dilute hno3 acid distilled water in the laboratory and the extracted water at least three times temperature t ph and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ while alkalinity was determined by gran titration on the sampling day all

standard deviation calculated from three scans of each sample must be below 10 for μg l concentrations and 20 for ng l concentrations otherwise it was re analyzed the δ18o δ2h and δ13c values were analyzed by a finnigan mat 253 isotope ratio mass spectrometer at the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences the results of 2h 1h and 18o 16o ratios of the samples were both

effects of water rock interactions saturation indices si of the dissolved minerals in groundwater samples were thermodynamically calculated using phreeqc parkhurst appelo 1999 4 results and discussion the univariate overview of physical chemical parameters and isotopic compositions of the 25 sampled deep groundwater were presented in table 1 the groundwater salinity tds in the study area ranged from 230 to 1 720 mg l in this paper groundwater with salinity 1 000 mg l was defined as freshwater and groundwater containing tds 1 000 mg l as saline water according to this 50 of the deep water samples collected fell into saline water category low tds groundwater was typical na hco3 so4 type water while groundwater with high tds normally belonged to na so4 cl type fig 2 among the 25 deep groundwater collected fluoride concentrations varied between 0 10 and 3 73 mg l median value 1 46 mg l with about 48 of the samples above the 1 5 mg l threshold who drinking guideline and 80 exceeding the chinese standard of 1 mg l fig 3 a part of saline groundwater showed higher fluoride contents approaching or over 2 mg l fig 3 b dissolved arsenic as concentration in the deep groundwater ranged from 0 41 to 24 3 µg l with a median value of 3 34 µg l four fresh groundwater from the northern part close to the yuncheng salt lake and kaolao uplifted area fig 1 a showed simultaneous increase of fluoride and arsenic contents 1 5 3 73 mg l and 14 7 24 3 µg l exceeding the who guideline values 1 5 mg l and 10 µg l in drinking water these co contamination of fluoride and arsenic groundwater evolved in two environments in the study area fig 4 a i closed reducing environment in depth of 280 m and ii semi closed facultative environment in depth of 100 m different from other low tds groundwater the high f as groundwater in closed reducing environment were characterized by relatively higher so4 2 contents exhibiting na so4 hco3 type 4 1 tracing groundwater recharge in order to get a better understanding of the deep groundwater origin in the study area recharge to the deep aquifers were discussed using mainly hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and also radiocarbon data for comparison previous isotopic data from the rainfall and shallow groundwater samples in yuncheng basin were also incorporated into fig 5 the general meteoric relationship between δ18o and δ2h compositions was demonstrated by the global meteoric water line gmwl with the eq craig 1961 2 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of precipitation and infiltrating waters were controlled by several physical factors e g altitude effect latitude effect continental effect intensity and duration of precipitation temperature of condensation of precipitation and the degree of rainout of the air mass clark fritz 1997 unfortunately no records of historic δ18o and δ2h values for local precipitation were available in the study area an estimate can be made using the weighted mean monthly values of δ18o and δ2h of the rainfall from 1985 to 1992 in xi an about 150 km southwestern of the study area lmwl δ2h 7δ18o 4 8 iaea wmo 2007 the two meteoric water lines gmwl and lmwl were shown in fig 5 for references the isotopic composition of the rainfall sample was 10 93 and 73 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively and it was located extremely close to the lmwl several observations were recognized from the plot of δ18o and δ2h in the groundwater firstly all of the groundwater in this study area were generally below the lmwl and distributed around the gmwl suggesting precipitation being the dominant recharge resource secondly the isotopic compositions of the analyzed deep groundwater varied from 11 03 to 8 62 and from 81 7 to 61 8 with a median value of 9 56 and 70 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively it can be clearly seen that the δ18o and δ2h values of deep groundwater were in places depleted relative to modern precipitation and shallow groundwater fig 5 this was most pronounced in several deep saline waters termed group i hereafter and three high f as fresh groundwater do3 d04 and d06 which yielded δ18o and δ2h values less than 10 and 75 respectively the regression line for these groundwater samples rl intersected lmwl at δ18o 27 2 one may argue that these depleted isotopic compositions of deep samples may be due to altitude effect clark fritz 1997 documented that at higher altitude where the average temperatures are lower precipitation would be isotopically depleted typical gradients varied between about 0 15 and 0 5 per 100 m rise in altitude for δ18o however even if the deep waters were recharged from modern precipitation at the highest altitude of zhongtiao mountain 1 000 m the depletion was in the range of 0 9 3 in view of that the δ18o in rainfall was 10 91 the altitude effect cannot account for such a low δ18o value at which rl intersected lmwl the most probable explanation for the stable isotopes depletion in these deep groundwater was the palaeo recharge origin of the groundwater in a much cooler period than present according to clark fritz 1997 the paleo temperature mean annual air temperature maat can be calculated based on the following eq 3 t δ 18 o g r a d i e n t h 18 o paleo mod δ 18 o paleo g w δ 18 o mod g w 0 5 t maat where δ18opaleo gw and δ18omod gw were the δ18o contents in the paleo groundwater and modern groundwater respectively in this paper the median value of δ18o in deep groundwater 9 56 was used as δ18opaleo gw while the median value of δ18o in shallow groundwater 8 48 was adopted in this study area li et al 2016 as δ18omod gw calculation results showed that paleo temperature was approximately 3 c lower than the modern temperature another interesting finding was that five deep saline groundwater characterized by relatively enriched δ18o and δ2h values deviated from other deep saline samples fig 5 two of them termed group ii hereafter were situated on the theoretical mixing line between deep freshwater d01 and deep geothermal water d16 the other three deep saline wells named group iii hereafter and one high f as fresh groundwater d09 lay close to shallow samples yielding waters with oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions similar to those of shallow groundwater 4 2 estimation of groundwater residence times carbon isotope measurements 14c and δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic were applied to establish the groundwater residence time thereby providing additional information to evaluate their origins in the yuncheng basin the radiocarbon data reported as percent modern carbon pmc showed values of 13 6 37 in the deep groundwater table 2 other previous studies of groundwater 14c activities and noble gas temperatures had demonstrated that groundwater radiocarbon activities of 20 pmc acted as a pleistocene holocene transition throughout northern china edmunds et al 2006 most of the saline deep groundwater and two high f as fresh groundwater samples showed 14c values of a little more or 20 pmc reflecting an ancient recharge this was also supported by stable isotopes vs 14c values fig 5 c and d groundwater with low 14c values 20 pmc was characterized by relatively depleted δ18o and δ2h values reinforcing that some groundwater in the study area was recharged before holocene additionally three exceptions d05 d20 and d21 with higher values of up to 37 pmc showed enriched δ18o and δ2h values approaching those of shallow groundwater samples this suggested a result of mixing with modern water again confirming the assumption in previous discussion two models were frequently used to facilitate the conversion of pmc contents into residence time modifying the effect of 14c free endogenic co2 from the aquifers δ13c mixing

aatm of 100 pmc was used together with the 14c activities measured for the groundwater the q factor was obtained for the δ13c mixing model 5 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c carb δ 13 c soil δ 13 c carb where δ13cdic measured δ13c in groundwater δ13ccarb δ13c values of carbonate in the loess taken as 4 δ13crech δ13c of the soil co2 usually close to 23 the age dating results of δ13c mixing model indicated an apparent groundwater residence time of 3 9 13 2 ka table 2 however deep groundwater may suffer from carbonate dissolution cation exchange with aquifer matrix methanogenesis bacterial sulfate reduction and oxidation of organic matter schlegel et al 2011 which can lead to significant dilution and loss of 14c thus creating an over estimation of groundwater ages therefore the above stated groundwater residence times can only be regarded as a maximum age limit factor q for chemical mass balance was calculated by the following eq 6 q mdic rech mdic final where mdicrech was the 14c active

matsumoto et al 2018 4 3 the origin and evolution of deep groundwater 4 3 1 constraints from correlation between elemental ratios relationship of na and cl commonly acted as a first order tracer of water rock interaction all the groundwater samples were plotted above the 1 1 halite dissolution line with na concentration being directly proportional to the cl concentration fig 4 b several possible causes of the high na cl ratios must be considered weathering of na bearing silicate minerals can produce kaolinite and na ion albite made up 20 of the quaternary loess in the study area li et al 2015 and may be a source of na however in view of the high carbonate concentrations of the loess and the higher solubility and faster dissolution rates of carbonates compared with silicates jacobson et al 2002 silicate weathering was unlikely a major source of the solutes of deep groundwater this reasoning was also proved by the si na cl ratios weathering of albite would lead to a si na cl ratio of 2 nevertheless the deep groundwater in the basin contained low si na cl ratio with a median value of 0 1 table 1 considering the fact that no silicate weathering reactions accounted for such low ratios moon et al 2007 silicate weathering can be discounted on the grounds a second possibility was that the sodium could be derived from dissolution of sulfate salts a good linear relationship between na and so4 2 fig 4 c confirmed the dissolution of mirabilite na2so4 which was widely distributed in the study area if dissolution of na2so4 was a significant groundwater composition controlling process the plot of na cl vs so4 ca mg should have a slope of 1 all the groundwater samples showed na cl excess relative to so4 ca mg suggesting extra sources of sodium and or a deficit of sulfate a third process involving na enrichment was direct cation exchange between groundwater and the clay fraction of the aquifer material high sr ca and low sr na ratios in some deep groundwater samples group ii and iii indicated the significance of cation exchange on the hydrochemistry of these samples fig 4 e this interpretation was in concordance with the evolution of groundwater hydrochemical type from ca mg hco3 to na hco3 so4 na hco3 cl along groundwater flow path additionally ca2 exhibited a positive correlation with so4 2 fig 4 f suggesting that gypsum dissolution had an impact on the calcium and sulfate compositions of these deep groundwater however with the exception of two fresh groundwater in the southern recharge area all the water samples positioned below the gypsum dissolution line the enrichment of so4 2 relative to ca2 supported the contribution of multiple processes e g mirabilite dissolution and cation exchange the br cl and b cl molar ratios were used together to evaluate the sources mixing relationships and the accompanied geochemical processes in groundwater different original sources of water solutes would produce distinctive high br cl ratios relative to other sources with low br cl ratios li et al 2019 vengosh 2005 boron was commonly found at elevated concentrations in effluents as a result of the presence of synthetic soluble boron containing materials mainly na borate used in washing powders zango et al 2019 according to our preliminary investigations there are several detergent factories in yuncheng city qiangfeng washing daily chemical co ltd being the biggest detergent factories produced an estimated 20 000 tons of washing powders annually and made contributions to the people s daily life in the yuncheng basin however improper usage of the boron containing detergent would bring about adverse environmental impacts to the groundwater systems untreated domestic wastewater as a result of the use of synthetic na borate additives is either reinjected into streams lakes or discharged directly into the soils raising the possibility of boron migration through infiltration into groundwater shleh 2017 due to the low background concentration of boron from geological sources and the conservative behavior of chloride b cl ratios can be applied as elsewhere rodriguez espinosa et al 2020 scheiber et al 2016 as a chemically conservative tracer for anthropogenic influences in the study area yet boron in groundwater can be adsorbed onto clay minerals and oxides through an outer sphere adsorption mechanism which was salinity dependent the systematics of using br cl and b cl ratios were adopted to identify groundwater solute sources fig 6 a group i saline water samples d14 d15 d22 d23 d24 and d25 from the recharge area in qiji and wenxi area were characterized by the conspicuously low br cl ratios this chemical characteristic and their linear relationships of na vs cl ca vs so4 and na cl vs so4 ca mg fig 4 d were typical of evaporite dissolution the enrichment of b cl compared to that of the original solute source of evaporite dissolution can be attributed to the desorption process saldi et al 2018 yılmaz et al 2005 as a matter of fact species in high concentrations in groundwater would be adsorbed onto the mineral sites exchange sites therefore in a water rock system during salinization sites would sorb substantially greater amounts of sodium and boron cary et al 2015 when fresh water flushed the saline b was desorbed from the mineral sites accompanied by na enrichment for ca2 therefore in the recharge area in qiji and wenxi palaeo saline waters were supposed to exist during evapotranspiration process the water evaporated and most if not all of the solutes remained usually these solutes were described as evaporite this was consistent with previous borehole data that suggested that sediment cores near these areas contain locally distributed evaporitic formations when relatively newly fresh groundwater flushing the palaeo saline water occurred the groundwater would be characterized by certain significant features such as high tds na ca and b cl and low br cl this interpretation was also supported by the hco3 composition goldberg et al 1996 stated that high hco3 contents in groundwater facilitated b desorption from mineral surfaces as decreasing b adsorption occurred in the presence of hco3 from the plot of b vs hco3 fig 6 b there was indeed a positive correlation between b and hco3 in the group i waters r2 0 79 group ii deep saline waters d17 and d19 sampled near the faults were plotted on the deep freshwater deep geothermal water dilution line fig 6 a suggesting the contribution of geothermal water to the solutes of these deep waters the three deep saline waters in group iii d05 d20 and d21 with enriched δ18o and δ2h values and high 14c activity were characterized by higher b cl and br cl ratios approaching those of shallow groundwater samples these water samples were located near the cone of depression to the west of yuncheng city and have no3 concentrations of 20 mg l these combined geochemical and isotopic characteristics were supporting the hypothesis of gradual downwards leakage of overlying shallow saline groundwater near the cone of depression consequently three sources of solutes in deep groundwater of yuncheng basin were delineated freshening of palaeo saline water mixing with geothermal water and vertical leakage of shallow groundwater for group i ii and iii samples respectively 4 3 2 constraints from multi isotopes in order to provide further insights for the origin and evolution of deep groundwater in the yuncheng basin multiple isotopic compositions δ34s δ13c and 87sr 86sr were investigated sulfur isotope δ34s of dissolved so4 2 in groundwater served as a good indicator for identifying sulfate provenance and evaluating the effects of pyrite oxidation and sulfate reduction dogramaci et al 2017 torres martínez et al 2020 basically characteristics of sulfate concentrations and sulfur isotopic composition in groundwater were controlled by both its sources and mechanism of formation dissolution of evaporates such as gypsum anhydrite would produce elevated sulfate levels combined with highest δ34s values 10 30 brenot et al 2007 whereas igneous rocks typically exhibited a range of δ34s values from 10 to 10 with an average of 0 laouar et al 2018 sulfate minerals dissolution did not alter the original δ34s signature in groundwater however the pristine sulfate isotopic composition can be modified by bacteria sulfate reduction bsr and oxidation of pyrite since 32s of solid and dissolved sulfur compounds were preferentially consumed compared to 34s during bsr and bacterial processes associated with the recycling of sulfide δ34s values of residual sulfate gradually increased with an association of so4 2 depletion as reduction proceeds on the other hand pyrite oxidation would induce increasing so4 concentrations whilst decreasing the remaining so4 2 in δ34s values dogramaci et al 2017 sulfate in the investigated deep groundwater samples were characterized by positive δ34s values ranging between 8 74 and 16 13 with a median value of 11 73 table 1 these values were similar to those of evaporites thus suggesting an origin mainly from dissolution of evaporites the negative saturation index for gypsum and halite and their simultaneous increase with increasing salinity in most groundwater samples were also supporting the major involvement of evaporites dissolution fig 7 c and d the deep freshwater d10 d11 d12 and d13 in the northern recharge area and two high f as groundwater d03 and d04 showed δ34s values higher than those of freshwater in the recharge area in the southern part of zhongtiao mountain the anaerobic conditions of these wells with a depth of 200 m might provide a sufficient explanation for the observed ion and isotopic compositions somewhat lower so4 2 contents higher δ34s compositions and lowest so4 δ34s ratios fig 8 a through a bsr process as follows 7 2 c h 2 o s o 4 2 2 h c o 3 h 2 s here ch2o represented organic matter during this process sulfate was consumed accompanied by sulfur isotope fractionating leading to a gradual increase of δ34s fritz fontes 1980 in addition to the concentration and isotopic variations the hypothesis of bsr in the deep aquifers in the e mei plateau and in the center basin was supported by two independent compelling evidences the first was the presence of h2s identified by the odor of rotten eggs during our preliminary investigation the other evidence was the relatively low concentrations of fe in these groundwater it was likely that h2s generated during bsr will be in fast reaction with dissolved fe in the aquifer forming iron sulfide minerals and thereby decreasing the overall fe content in the residual groundwater vengosh et al 2007 from the plot of δ34s vs so4 fig 8 a the combined low δ34s values and high so4 2 contents in group iii groundwater d05 d20 and d21 indicate that either 1 an additional δ34s depleted sulfate source was involved or 2 the pristine sulfate isotopic composition was modified by oxidation of pyrite on the basis of chemical and isotopic compositions discussed above leaching of shallow groundwater exerted a control on the chemistry of group iii deep groundwater the oxidizing environment and the high fe contents in shallow groundwater provided further evidences that the low δ34s values in group iii deep groundwater were derived from mixing with shallow groundwater suffered from oxidation of pyrite which was in accordance with field data reporting pyrite in sediment samples additionally two deep saline groundwater in group i d14 and d15 were characterized by high so4 2 concentrations and high δ34s values pointing to dissolution of evaporates gypsum these also reflected the geochemical and isotopic signals of palaeo saline waters finally group ii saline groundwater yielded relatively lower so4 2 concentrations and medium δ34s ratios and fitted a mixing line between deep freshwater and deep geothermal end member which favored a geothermal origin of the so4 2 that reconciled with the other findings the δ13c of dic was studied to determine the origin of hco3 due to the distinct δ13c values in the various carbon reservoirs and can better understand the sources of components in the aquifer in the semi arid ecosystem of yuncheng basin the vegetation mainly consisted of fruit trees groundwater δ13c values mainly depended on the level of co2 in the soil and the possible interaction of photosynthetic uptake of co2 by these c3 plants the δ13c values in the deep groundwater at yuncheng basin varied from 12 92 to 6 55 with a median value of 8 75 table 1 these values spanned those expected for dic originated from soil dominated by c3 plants δ13c to 15 clark fritz 1997 and those of carbonate in the loess δ13c to 4 there was a positive correlation of δ13c values with hco3 contents r2 0 84 fig 8 c suggesting that carbonate weathering was the principal carbon source in deep groundwater at yuncheng basin although most of the groundwater was slightly saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite with the exception of four saline waters the saturation indices of calcite and dolomite increased in steps with increasing tds fig 7 a and b such tendency enforced the dissolution of carbonates often degradation of organic matter occurred in deep aquifers in accordance with bsr stated above this was the case for the high f as groundwater d03 and d04 it was observed that these two groundwater were characterized by relatively lower δ13c values fig 8 d indicating the controlling role of organic degradation in the formation of hydrogeochemical characteristics due to the input of depleted δ13c values in organic matter however relationship between δ34s and δ13c values fig 8 b showed that the groundwater in e mei plateau d10 d11 d12 and d13 suffered from bsr have an enrichment of δ13c values 7 7 to 6 55 if no other processes relating to δ13c enrichment happened to these groundwater samples they should show relatively lower δ13c values the increase in δ13c values was therefore most probably related to the input of inorganic carbon with enriched δ13c values methanogenesis could produce δ13c enriched co2 through the following two pathways as a result of isotopic fractionation leading to a strong δ13c enrichment of the dic gehring et al 2015 penning et al 2006 9 c o 2 4 h 2 c h 4 2 h 2 o 10 c h 3 c o o h c h 4 c o 2 however this did not reconcile with the relatively high levels of arsenic in groundwater which coupled methanogenesis with bsr should produce kirk et al 2004 wang et al 2015 hence the most probable process which was in greatest accord with the evidence was calcite dissolution fig 8 d the strontium isotopic ratio was another valuable tracer to demonstrate the origin of solutes the type of host sediments rocks and the impact of weathering processes due to the absence of isotopic fractionation during natural processes e g precipitation evaporation and biological uptake in the environment the strontium isotopic composition of groundwater was identical to that of the host aquifer rocks sahib et al 2016 shand et al 2009 basically groundwater going through silicate weathering would show high 87sr 86sr ratios 0 720 han liu 2004 whilst relatively lower 87sr 86sr ratios were characterized in groundwater suffering from carbonate and evaporite dissolution in the study area 87sr 86sr ratios in the deep groundwater ranged from 0 711036 to 0 719899 with a median value of 0 711979 fig 9 a lying between evaporite dissolution carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering this indicated the probable influence of dissolution of these three minerals similar distribution were shown also by the bivariate plot of 87sr 86sr against hco3 na molar ratio fig 9 b the deep groundwater samples were plotted for different mixing ratios between these three end members most saline samples lay closer to the area of evaporite dissolution manifesting the greater contribution of evaporite dissolution on the hydrogeochemistry of these groundwater this was also pronounced for the three high f as fresh groundwater d03 d04 and d06 based on the higher hco3 na and lower 87sr 86sr ratio in most fresh groundwater carbonate dissolution exerted control on their hydrogeochemical behaviors two fresh waters from the southern recharge area of zhongtiao mountain contained highest 87sr 86sr ratios up to 0 719899 suggesting the controlling role of silicate weathering 4 4 genesis of high fluoride and arsenic groundwater high levels of fluoride and arsenic co occurring fresh groundwater in yuncheng basin occupied 16 of the total sampled groundwater evolving in different environments and characterizing diverse hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions high f as groundwater in closed reducing environment d03 d04 and d06 showed the most depleted δ18o and δ2h compositions and lower 14c activity of 20 pmc deviating other fresh water samples fig 5 this suggested that these groundwater were largely affected by intrusion of palaeo waters as stated above during the formation of palaeo waters evaporites e g gypsum and mirabilite would sorb substantially greater amounts of ionic components including fluoride arsenic sodium and boron cary et al 2015 wang et al 2019 during the flushing of relatively newly fresh groundwater into the palaeo saline waters desorption of already adsorbed fluoride and arsenic from evaporites would occur resulting in the co contamination evidenced by high δ34s low so4 2 and δ13c values the occurrence of bacterial sulfate reduction and organic degradation facilitated by the closed reducing environment had also enhanced arsenic and fluoride enrichment in groundwater it was interesting to note that groundwater in the e mei plateau d10 d11 d12 and d13 evolved likewise in closed reducing environment and suffered from bsr however with low arsenic values this indicated that it was organic degradation rather than bsr that created the groundwater contamination with elevated concentrations of arsenic and fluoride this was in accordance with the observations of kirk et al 2004 who reported that bacterial sulfate reduction limited natural arsenic contamination in groundwater on the other hand under the semi closed facultative environment high f and as level in deep fresh groundwater d09 with enriched δ18o and δ2h values was indicative of arsenic and fluoride mobilization via vertical recharge of shallow waters elevated contents of na and b in this sample fig 6 c were consistent with shallow leakage influence during the flushing and leaching of shallow groundwater degradation process of heavily input of organic matter accelerated arsenic and fluoride accumulation indicated by the relatively lower δ13c and high hco3 value in this groundwater fig 8 d anawar et al 2013 consequently organic degradation process played an immeasurable role in the formation of high f as groundwater 4 5 conceptual model carbon 14 activity together with stable isotopes and chemical compositions were used to assist delineation of the mechanisms of fluoride arsenic and solutes enrichment in the deep groundwater at yuncheng basin fig 10 in the northern recharge area deep wells yielded high fluoride 1 39 1 53 mg l low arsenic 3 1 6 µg l fresh groundwater and showed residence times of 5622 6767 yrs the enrichment of δ34s values 13 58 14 19 the associated low so4 2 contents 39 96 111 mg l and highest δ13c values 7 7 6 55 suggested that bsr and carbonate dissolution were taking place in the deep aquifers in the e mei plateau relatively older deep fresh groundwater 8225 yrs with low fluoride and arsenic contents were found in the southern recharge area the low δ13c values and high 87sr 86sr ratios in these groundwater suggested the dominance of silicate weathering at the front edge of e mei plateau saline groundwater sampled near the faults had residence time 7403 yrs approaching to that of geothermal water 8353 yrs the good fitness of these deep samples in the mixing line between deep freshwater and deep geothermal water as inferred from br cl vs b cl ratio δ18o vs δ2h values and δ34s vs so4 2 concentrations showed strong evidences of a geothermal origin which promoted fluoride enrichment 1 61 2 33 mg l the most depleted δ18o and δ2h values high b cl and low br cl were detected in some deep groundwater pointing towards the intrusion of palaeo waters dissolution of ancient evporites produced locally distributed saline groundwater in the qiji and wenxi county fig 1 a with high f 1 61 1 85 mg l low as 3 6 7 8 µg l and old residence times of 10997 11991 yrs palaeo recharge was also responsible for the high f as levels of fresh groundwater in closed environment in the basin center some deep saline groundwater in the central basin yielding modern ages 3696 yrs and 4348 yrs were characterized by similar isotopic δ18o δ2h δ13c and 87sr 86sr signatures to those of shallow groundwater and high no3 concentrations which were in concordance with downward shallow leakage near the cone of depression the relatively lower δ34s values 9 96 to 12 55 in these deep groundwater reflected that the mixed shallow groundwater suffered from pyrite oxidation under the semi closed facultative environment in the kaolao uplifted area shallow vertical leakage had led to the co occurring fluoride and arsenic in fresh groundwater with concentration of 3 73 mg l and 14 7 µg l respectively 4 6 groundwater fluoride and arsenic management on the global scale the vital role of groundwater as a water supply for the steady growth in population and expanding economic activities was threatened by the degradation of water quality associated with some health related inorganic contaminants e g salt as and f fakhreddine et al 2021 han currell 2022 large scale groundwater extraction to maintain societies and economies prevailed burri et al 2019 foster 2020 hssaisoune et al 2020 however the potential environmental impacts of groundwater extraction cannot be neglected heavy pumping of middle and deep aquifers for local industry agriculture and the life leaded to the situation that toxic elements were not only limited in shallow groundwater but also widely distributed in deep aquifers the government should strengthen the monitoring of groundwater dynamic status and establish a comprehensive monitoring network of the groundwater system this could help to acquire the groundwater level quality and quantity and formulate plans to avoid the deterioration of the situation local government should also take actions to ensure the sustainable exploitation of groundwater additionally sustainable measures such as adsorption membrane separation precipitation and ion exchange techniques should be adopted for mitigating high fluoride and arsenic menace in aquifers alkurdi et al 2019 biswas sarkar 2021 sosa et al 2020 sunkari et al 2021 van geen et al 2019 in summary our research suggested that to avoid further deterioration of groundwater resources forceful measures dealing with the over exploitation of groundwater were required 5 conclusions in this study the origin and evolution of deep groundwater at yuncheng basin were elaborated by integrating major trace elements and multiple isotopes the tds contents of deep groundwater samples from yuncheng basin range from 230 to 1 720 mg l with 50 of the samples belonging to saline category tds 1 000 mg l four fresh groundwater show simultaneous increase of fluoride and arsenic contents above the who guideline value 1 5 mg l and 10 µg l depleted stable isotope compositions δ18o h2o and δd values as low as 11 03 and 81 7 respectively along with low radiocarbon activities mostly 20 pmc indicate the palaeo recharge origin of the deep groundwater in the late pleistocene and early holocene during a cooler period and the palaeo temperature is approximately 3 c cooler than the modern temperature groundwater ages estimated from 14c activities further indicate that the deep groundwater was mostly recharged between 5 000 and 11 000 years ago three types of solute sources for deep groundwater at yuncheng basin are delineated the correlation between br cl and b cl ratios reflects the dominant effects of freshening of depleted δ18o and δ2h palaeo saline waters on locally distributed groundwater salinity in the qiji and wenxi county saline groundwater sampled near the faults show strong evidence of a geothermal origin while vertical seepage of shallow saline groundwater suffering from pyrite oxidation contributes to elevation of tds contents in deep groundwater near the depression cone high levels of fluoride and arsenic co occurring fresh groundwater are characterized by diverse hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions evidenced by δ18o and δ2h compositions and 14c activity palaeo waters intrusion and shallow leakages enhance the enrichment of groundwater fluoride and arsenic in closed reducing environment and semi closed facultative environment respectively organic degradation process plays an important role in the formation of high f as groundwater our research recommends that forceful management strategies dealing with groundwater over exploitation are required to meet the ever increasing human needs without further water resources deterioration the water management authorities should adopt effective measures to establish comprehensive monitoring network and ensure sustainable exploitation of groundwater ex situ treatment methods such as adsorption precipitation membrane separation and ion exchange techniques should be employed for mitigation of fluorosis and arsenicosis hazards 6 data availability the underlying research data can be found from the first author upon

type and is characterized by distinctly depleted δ18o and δ2h values as low as 10 4 and 78 5 respectively than deep fresh water and shallow groundwater indicating palaeo climatic effect results of ionic ratios and isotopes reveal that three types of solute sources are delineated for deep aquifers deep saline groundwater with old residence times of 11000 yrs showed the most depleted δ18o and δ2h values high b cl and low br cl pointing towards the palaeo saline water for the locally distributed groundwater solutes in the qiji and wenxi county saline sample near the faults with residence time

compositions are evolved in closed reducing environment and semi closed facultative environment and controlled by palaeo recharge and shallow leakage respectively organic degradation mainly controls the enrichment of arsenic and fluoride in groundwater keywords high fluoride arsenic groundwater solutes palaeo recharge shallow leakages hydrochemistry isotopes semi arid area 1 introduction groundwater is one of the most valuable and vital resources for domestic irrigation and agricultural activities due to the ever growing demand for clean drinking and irrigation water and lack of surface water supplies the importance of groundwater is increasing exponentially which is more pronounced in arid semi arid areas diouf et al 2020 unfortunately the improper exploitation and continued mismanagement of groundwater resources have led to severe problems of water stress and degradation of water quality kumar et al 2020a kumar et al 2020b re et al 2017 the most common occurrence of water quality deterioration particularly in arid semiarid regions is high fluoride arsenic groundwater pollution bhattacharya et al 2020 mirzavand et al 2020 pant et al 2021 rather than influencing the water aspects groundwater fluoride arsenic contamination have been recognized to present a health risk relying on the levels in which they are present kumar et al 2020a kumar et al 2020b long term

various visceral cancers ahmad bhattacharya 2019 usepa 2018 the yuncheng basin of shanxi province is one of the representative fluorosis and arsenicosis affected areas in northern china where groundwater salinization is severely taking place gao et al 2019 li et al 2018 li gao 2019 historically elevated fluoride and arsenic concentrations occur in shallow groundwater in this basin hu guo 1992 since the early 2000 s in order to prevent and control endemic fluorosis and arsenicosis water management authorities had carried out water improvement project in the form of water diversion from other places and drilling middle deep wells for centralized water supply wang et al 2011 more and more endemic areas benefit greatly from years of defluoridation and dearsenic water improvement projects however this progress brings up new issues with heavy pumping of middle and deep aquifers for local industry agriculture and the life fluoride and arsenic enrichment are not only limited in shallow groundwater but also widely distributed in deep aquifers undoubtedly this poses new threat to public health as well as for agricultural activities this study incorporates major and minor ion chemistry conservative source and age indicators of water br cl δ18o δ2h and 14c and the isotopic composition of the dissolved constituents 87sr 86sr δ34s and δ13c with the following major objectives 1 to delineate the origins and evolutions of deep groundwater and 2 to investigate the mechanisms of groundwater solutes fluoride and arsenic enrichment the primary results for this study could be useful for other arid semi arid basins with limited resources to understand groundwater quality deterioration and provide scientific basis for planning protecting and making decisions of water resource management 2 study area 2 1 geographical location the yuncheng basin in northern china stretches from latitudes 34 40 to 35 30 n and longitudes 110 15 to 111 25 e fig 1 and covers a total area of about 6 211 km2 china geological survey 2006 there is a yuncheng salt lake located in the southwestern part of yuncheng city extending over an area of 120 km2 the study area is a semi closed intermontane basin with mountains surrounded to the south east and north zhongtiao mountain lies down the southern and northeastern boundary with the highest elevation of 1 260 1 990 m the yellow

sediments changes from the coarse particles to fine particles gradually and the thickness of the aquifers increases controlled by the lithological structures groundwater in the basin flows from the margins towards its interior with precipitation infiltration being the main recharge source additional recharge occurs due to lateral penetration of fissure water along the basin margin leakage of non perennial river water and irrigation return flow groundwater discharge is dominated by evapotranspiration and artificial abstraction horizontal hydraulic gradients in the deep aquifer are higher up to

with high vertical hydraulic gradients 0 01 0 45 due to the high rates of deep groundwater pumping china geological survey 2006 according to the investigation the estimated total groundwater withdrawal from the yuncheng basin in 2003 was 4 108 m3 yr which is 1 5 times the estimated sustainable yield of 2 6 108 m3 yr cao 2005 therefore the basin has witnessed severe over exploitation of groundwater 3 materials and methods 3 1 groundwater sampling in order to characterize the water chemistry and isotopes of yuncheng basin 25 groundwater samples from deep aquifers with depth of 80 360

the univariate overview of physical chemical parameters and isotopic compositions of the 25 sampled deep groundwater were presented in table 1 the groundwater salinity tds in the study area ranged from 230 to 1 720 mg l in this paper groundwater with salinity 1 000 mg l was defined as freshwater and groundwater containing tds 1 000 mg l as saline water according to this 50 of the deep water samples collected fell into saline water category low tds groundwater was typical na hco3 so4 type water while groundwater with high tds normally belonged to na so4 cl type fig 2 among the 25 deep

the chinese standard of 1 mg l fig 3 a part of saline groundwater showed higher fluoride contents approaching or over 2 mg l fig 3 b dissolved arsenic as concentration in the deep groundwater ranged from 0 41 to 24 3 µg l with a median value of 3 34 µg l four fresh groundwater from the northern part close to the yuncheng salt lake and kaolao uplifted area fig 1 a showed simultaneous increase of fluoride and arsenic contents 1 5 3 73 mg l and 14 7 24 3 µg l exceeding the who guideline values 1 5 mg l and 10 µg l in drinking water these co contamination of fluoride and arsenic groundwater evolved in two environments in the study area fig 4 a i closed reducing environment in depth of 280 m and ii semi closed facultative environment in depth of 100 m different from other low tds groundwater the high f as groundwater in closed reducing environment were characterized by relatively higher so4 2 contents exhibiting na so4 hco3 type 4 1 tracing groundwater recharge in order to get a better understanding of the deep groundwater origin in the study area recharge to the deep aquifers were discussed using mainly hydrogen and oxygen isotopes and also radiocarbon data for comparison previous isotopic data from the rainfall and shallow groundwater samples in yuncheng basin were also incorporated into fig 5 the general meteoric relationship between δ18o and δ2h compositions was demonstrated by the global meteoric water line gmwl with the eq craig 1961 2 δ 2 h 8 δ 18 o 10 the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions of precipitation and infiltrating waters were controlled by several physical factors e g altitude effect latitude effect continental effect intensity and duration of precipitation temperature of condensation of precipitation and the degree of rainout of the air mass clark fritz 1997 unfortunately no records of historic δ18o and δ2h values for local precipitation were available in the study area an estimate can be made using the weighted mean monthly values of δ18o and δ2h of the rainfall from 1985 to 1992 in xi an about 150 km southwestern of the study area lmwl δ2h 7δ18o 4 8 iaea wmo 2007 the two meteoric water lines gmwl and lmwl were shown in fig 5 for references the isotopic composition of the rainfall sample was 10 93 and 73 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively and it was located extremely close to the lmwl several observations were recognized from the plot of δ18o and δ2h in the groundwater firstly all of the groundwater in this study area were generally below the lmwl and distributed around the gmwl suggesting precipitation being the dominant recharge resource secondly the isotopic compositions of the analyzed deep groundwater varied from 11 03 to 8 62 and from 81 7 to 61 8 with a median value of 9 56 and 70 1 for δ18o and δ2h respectively it can be clearly seen that the δ18o and δ2h values of deep groundwater were in places depleted relative to modern precipitation and shallow groundwater fig 5 this was most pronounced in several deep saline waters termed group i hereafter and three high f as fresh groundwater do3 d04 and d06 which yielded δ18o and δ2h values less than 10 and 75 respectively the regression line for these groundwater samples rl intersected lmwl at δ18o 27 2 one may argue that these depleted isotopic compositions of deep samples may be due to altitude effect clark fritz 1997 documented that at higher altitude where the average temperatures are lower precipitation would be isotopically depleted typical gradients varied between about 0 15 and 0 5 per 100 m rise in altitude for δ18o however even if the deep waters were recharged from modern precipitation at the highest altitude of zhongtiao mountain 1 000 m the depletion was in the range of 0 9 3 in view of that the δ18o in rainfall was 10 91 the altitude effect cannot account for such a low δ18o value at which rl intersected lmwl the most probable explanation for the stable isotopes depletion in these deep groundwater was the palaeo recharge origin of the groundwater in a much cooler period than present according to clark fritz 1997 the paleo temperature mean annual air temperature maat can be calculated based on the following eq 3 t δ 18 o g r a d i e n t h 18 o paleo mod δ 18 o paleo g w δ 18 o mod g w 0 5 t maat where δ18opaleo gw and δ18omod gw were the δ18o contents in the paleo groundwater and modern groundwater respectively in this paper the median value of δ18o in deep groundwater 9 56 was used as δ18opaleo gw while the median value of δ18o in shallow groundwater 8 48 was adopted in this study area li et al 2016 as δ18omod gw calculation results showed that paleo temperature was approximately 3 c lower than the modern temperature another interesting finding was that five deep saline groundwater characterized by relatively enriched δ18o and δ2h values deviated from other deep saline samples fig 5 two of them termed group ii hereafter were situated on the theoretical mixing line between deep freshwater d01 and deep geothermal water d16 the other three deep saline wells named group iii hereafter and one high f as fresh groundwater d09 lay close to shallow samples yielding waters with oxygen and hydrogen isotopic compositions similar to those of shallow groundwater 4 2 estimation of groundwater residence times carbon isotope measurements 14c and δ13c of dissolved inorganic carbon dic were applied to establish the groundwater residence time thereby providing additional information to evaluate their origins in the yuncheng basin the radiocarbon data reported as percent modern carbon pmc showed values of 13 6 37 in the deep groundwater table 2 other previous studies of groundwater 14c activities and noble gas temperatures had demonstrated that groundwater radiocarbon activities of 20 pmc acted as a pleistocene holocene transition throughout northern china edmunds et al 2006 most of the saline deep groundwater and two high f as fresh groundwater samples showed 14c values of a little more or 20 pmc reflecting an ancient recharge this was also supported by stable isotopes vs 14c values fig 5 c and d groundwater with low 14c values 20 pmc was characterized by relatively depleted δ18o and δ2h values reinforcing that some groundwater in the study area was recharged before holocene additionally three exceptions d05 d20 and d21 with higher values of up to 37 pmc showed enriched δ18o and δ2h values approaching those of shallow groundwater samples this suggested a result of mixing with modern water again confirming the assumption in previous discussion two models were frequently used to facilitate the conversion of pmc contents into residence time modifying the effect of 14c free endogenic co2 from the aquifers δ13c mixing model pearson 1965 and the chemical mass balance cmb method fontes garnier 1979 4 14 t age 8267 l n q a a t m 14 c a m e d 14 c here q represented the 14c correction factor an atmospheric 14c activity aatm of 100 pmc was used together with the 14c activities measured for the groundwater the q factor was obtained for the δ13c mixing model 5 q δ 13 c dic δ 13 c carb δ 13 c soil δ 13 c carb where δ13cdic measured δ13c in groundwater δ13ccarb δ13c values of carbonate in the loess taken as 4 δ13crech δ13c of the soil co2 usually close to 23 the age dating results of δ13c mixing model indicated an apparent groundwater residence time of 3 9 13 2 ka table 2 however deep groundwater may suffer from carbonate dissolution cation exchange with aquifer matrix methanogenesis bacterial sulfate reduction and oxidation of organic matter schlegel et al 2011 which can lead to significant dilution and loss of 14c thus creating an over estimation of groundwater ages therefore the above stated groundwater residence times can only be regarded as a maximum age limit factor q for chemical mass balance was calculated by the following eq 6 q mdic rech mdic final where mdicrech was the 14c active dic concentration of groundwater in a recharge area mdicfinal represented the measured dic concentration in groundwater and can be estimated from the chemical data mdicfinal mdicrech mca mmg mso4 0 5 mna mk mcl groundwater residence times 3 7 11 1 ka table 2 were calculated using the cmb model and this range of ages reconciled with groundwater in other aquifers of northern china huang et al 2017 matsumoto et al 2018 4 3 the origin and evolution of deep groundwater 4 3 1 constraints from correlation between elemental ratios relationship of na and cl commonly acted as a first order tracer of water rock interaction all the groundwater samples were plotted above the 1 1 halite dissolution line with na concentration being directly proportional to the cl concentration fig 4 b several possible causes of the high na cl ratios must be considered weathering of na bearing silicate minerals can produce kaolinite and na ion albite made up 20 of the quaternary loess in the study area li et al 2015 and may be a source of na however in view of the high carbonate concentrations of the loess and the higher solubility and faster dissolution rates of carbonates compared with silicates jacobson et al 2002 silicate weathering was unlikely a major source of the solutes of deep groundwater this reasoning was also proved by the si na cl ratios weathering of albite would lead to a si na cl ratio of 2 nevertheless the deep groundwater in the basin contained low si na cl ratio with a median value of 0 1 table 1 considering the fact that no silicate weathering reactions accounted for such low ratios moon et al 2007 silicate weathering can be discounted on the grounds a second possibility was that the sodium could be derived from dissolution of sulfate salts a good linear relationship between na and so4 2 fig 4 c confirmed the dissolution of mirabilite na2so4 which was widely distributed in the study area if dissolution of na2so4 was a significant groundwater composition controlling process the plot of na cl vs so4 ca mg should have a slope of 1 all the groundwater samples showed na cl excess relative to so4 ca mg suggesting extra sources of sodium and or a deficit of sulfate a third process involving na enrichment was direct cation exchange between groundwater and the clay fraction of the aquifer material high sr ca and low sr na ratios in some deep groundwater samples group ii and iii indicated the significance of cation exchange on the hydrochemistry of these samples fig 4 e this interpretation was in concordance with the evolution of groundwater hydrochemical type from ca mg hco3 to na hco3 so4 na hco3 cl along groundwater flow path additionally ca2 exhibited a positive correlation with so4 2 fig 4 f suggesting that gypsum dissolution had an impact on the calcium and sulfate compositions of these deep groundwater however with the exception of two fresh groundwater in the southern recharge area all the water samples positioned below the gypsum dissolution line the enrichment of so4 2 relative to ca2 supported the contribution of multiple processes e g mirabilite dissolution and cation exchange the br cl and b cl molar ratios were used together to evaluate the sources mixing relationships and the accompanied geochemical processes in groundwater different original sources of water solutes would produce distinctive high br cl ratios relative to other sources with low br cl ratios li et al 2019 vengosh 2005 boron was commonly found at elevated concentrations in effluents as a result of the presence of synthetic soluble boron containing materials mainly na borate used in washing powders zango et al 2019 according to our preliminary investigations there are several detergent factories in yuncheng city qiangfeng washing daily chemical co ltd being the biggest detergent factories produced an estimated 20 000 tons of washing powders annually and made contributions to the people s daily life in the yuncheng basin however improper usage of the boron containing detergent would bring about adverse environmental impacts to the groundwater systems untreated domestic wastewater as a result of the use of synthetic na borate additives is either reinjected into streams lakes or discharged directly into the soils raising the possibility of boron migration through infiltration into groundwater shleh 2017 due to the low background concentration of boron from geological sources and the conservative behavior of chloride b cl ratios can be applied as elsewhere rodriguez espinosa et al 2020 scheiber et al 2016 as a chemically conservative tracer for anthropogenic influences in the study area yet boron in groundwater can be adsorbed onto clay minerals and oxides through an outer sphere adsorption mechanism which was salinity dependent the systematics of using br cl and b cl ratios were adopted to identify groundwater solute sources fig 6 a group i saline water samples d14 d15 d22 d23 d24 and d25 from the recharge area in qiji and wenxi area were characterized by the conspicuously low br cl ratios this chemical characteristic and their linear relationships of na vs cl ca vs so4 and na cl vs so4 ca mg fig 4 d were typical of evaporite dissolution the enrichment of b cl compared to that of the original solute source of evaporite dissolution can be attributed to the desorption process saldi et al 2018 yılmaz et al 2005 as a matter of fact species in high concentrations in groundwater would be adsorbed onto the mineral sites exchange sites therefore in a water rock system during salinization sites would sorb substantially greater amounts of sodium and boron cary et al 2015 when fresh water flushed the saline b was desorbed from the mineral sites accompanied by na enrichment for ca2 therefore in the recharge area in qiji and wenxi palaeo saline waters were supposed to exist during evapotranspiration process the water evaporated and most if not all of the solutes remained usually these solutes were described as evaporite this was consistent with previous borehole data that suggested that sediment cores near these areas contain locally distributed evaporitic formations when relatively newly fresh groundwater flushing the palaeo saline water occurred the groundwater would be characterized by certain significant features such as high tds na ca and b cl and low br cl this interpretation was also supported by the hco3 composition goldberg et al 1996 stated that high hco3 contents in groundwater facilitated b desorption from mineral surfaces as decreasing b adsorption occurred in the presence of hco3 from the plot of b vs hco3 fig 6 b there was indeed a positive correlation between b and hco3 in the group i waters r2 0 79 group ii deep saline waters d17 and d19 sampled near the faults were plotted on the deep freshwater deep geothermal water dilution line fig 6 a suggesting the contribution of geothermal water to the solutes of these deep waters the three deep saline waters in group iii d05 d20 and d21 with enriched δ18o and δ2h values and high 14c activity were characterized by higher b cl and br cl ratios approaching those of shallow groundwater samples these water samples were located near the cone of depression to the west of yuncheng city and have no3 concentrations of 20 mg l these combined geochemical and isotopic characteristics were supporting the hypothesis of gradual downwards leakage of overlying shallow saline groundwater near the cone of depression consequently three sources of solutes in deep groundwater of yuncheng basin were delineated freshening of palaeo saline water mixing with geothermal water and vertical leakage of shallow groundwater for group i ii and iii samples respectively 4 3 2 constraints from multi isotopes in order to provide further insights for the origin and evolution of deep groundwater in the yuncheng basin multiple isotopic compositions δ34s δ13c and 87sr 86sr were investigated sulfur isotope δ34s of dissolved so4 2 in groundwater served as a good indicator for identifying sulfate provenance and evaluating the effects of pyrite oxidation and sulfate reduction dogramaci et al 2017 torres martínez et al 2020 basically characteristics of sulfate concentrations and sulfur isotopic composition in groundwater were controlled by both its sources and mechanism of formation dissolution of evaporates such as gypsum anhydrite would produce elevated sulfate levels combined with highest δ34s values 10 30 brenot et al 2007 whereas igneous rocks typically exhibited a range of δ34s values from 10 to 10 with an average of 0 laouar et al 2018 sulfate minerals dissolution did not alter the original δ34s signature in groundwater however the pristine sulfate isotopic composition can be modified by bacteria sulfate reduction bsr and oxidation of pyrite since 32s of solid and dissolved sulfur compounds were preferentially consumed compared to 34s during bsr and bacterial processes associated with the recycling of sulfide δ34s values of residual sulfate gradually increased with an association of so4 2 depletion as reduction proceeds on the other hand pyrite oxidation would induce increasing so4 concentrations whilst decreasing the remaining so4 2 in δ34s values dogramaci et al 2017 sulfate in the investigated deep groundwater samples were characterized by positive δ34s values ranging between 8 74 and 16 13 with a median value of 11 73 table 1 these values were similar to those of evaporites thus suggesting an origin mainly from dissolution of evaporites the negative saturation index for gypsum and halite and their simultaneous increase with increasing salinity in most groundwater samples were also supporting the major involvement of evaporites dissolution fig 7 c and d the deep freshwater d10 d11 d12 and d13 in the northern recharge area and two high f as groundwater d03 and d04 showed δ34s values higher than those of freshwater in the recharge area in the southern part of zhongtiao mountain the anaerobic conditions of these wells with a depth of 200 m might provide a sufficient explanation for the observed ion and isotopic compositions somewhat lower so4 2 contents higher δ34s compositions and lowest so4 δ34s ratios fig 8 a through a bsr process as follows 7 2 c h 2 o s o 4 2 2 h c o 3 h 2 s here ch2o represented organic matter during this process sulfate was consumed accompanied by sulfur isotope fractionating leading to a gradual increase of δ34s fritz fontes 1980 in addition to the concentration and isotopic variations the hypothesis of bsr in the deep aquifers in the e mei plateau and in the center basin was supported by two independent compelling evidences the first was the presence of h2s identified by the odor of rotten eggs during our preliminary investigation the other evidence was the relatively low concentrations of fe in these groundwater it was likely that h2s generated during bsr will be in fast reaction with dissolved fe in the aquifer forming iron sulfide minerals and thereby decreasing the overall fe content in the residual groundwater vengosh et al 2007 from the plot of δ34s vs so4 fig 8 a the combined low δ34s values and high so4 2 contents in group iii groundwater d05 d20 and d21 indicate that either 1 an additional δ34s depleted sulfate source was involved or 2 the pristine sulfate isotopic composition was modified by oxidation of pyrite on the basis of chemical and isotopic compositions discussed above leaching of shallow groundwater exerted a control on the chemistry of group iii deep groundwater the oxidizing environment and the high fe contents in shallow groundwater provided further evidences that the low δ34s values in group iii deep groundwater were derived from mixing with shallow groundwater suffered from oxidation of pyrite which was in accordance with field data reporting pyrite in sediment samples additionally two deep saline groundwater in group i d14 and d15 were characterized by high so4 2 concentrations and high δ34s values pointing to dissolution of evaporates gypsum these also reflected the geochemical and isotopic signals of palaeo saline waters finally group ii saline groundwater yielded relatively lower so4 2 concentrations and medium δ34s ratios and fitted a mixing line between deep freshwater and deep geothermal end member which favored a geothermal origin of the so4 2 that reconciled with the other findings the δ13c of dic was studied to determine the origin of hco3 due to the distinct δ13c values in the various carbon reservoirs and can better understand the sources of components in the aquifer in the semi arid ecosystem of yuncheng basin the vegetation mainly consisted of fruit trees groundwater δ13c values mainly depended on the level of co2 in the soil and the possible interaction of photosynthetic uptake of co2 by these c3 plants the δ13c values in the deep groundwater at yuncheng basin varied from 12 92 to 6 55 with a median value of 8 75 table 1 these values spanned those expected for dic originated from soil dominated by c3 plants δ13c to 15 clark fritz 1997 and those of carbonate in the loess δ13c to 4 there was a positive correlation of δ13c values with hco3 contents r2 0 84 fig 8 c suggesting that carbonate weathering was the principal carbon source in deep groundwater at yuncheng basin although most of the groundwater was slightly saturated with respect to calcite and dolomite with the exception of four saline waters the saturation indices of calcite and dolomite increased in steps with increasing tds fig 7 a and b such tendency enforced the dissolution of carbonates often degradation of organic matter occurred in deep aquifers in accordance with bsr stated above this was the case for the high f as groundwater d03 and d04 it was observed that these two groundwater were characterized by relatively lower δ13c values fig 8 d indicating the controlling role of organic degradation in the formation of hydrogeochemical characteristics due to the input of depleted δ13c values in organic matter however relationship between δ34s and δ13c values fig 8 b showed that the groundwater in e mei plateau d10 d11 d12 and d13 suffered from bsr have an enrichment of δ13c values 7 7 to 6 55 if no other processes relating to δ13c enrichment happened to these groundwater samples they should show relatively lower δ13c values the increase in δ13c values was therefore most probably related to the input of inorganic carbon with enriched δ13c values methanogenesis could produce δ13c enriched co2 through the following two pathways as a result of isotopic fractionation leading to a strong δ13c enrichment of the dic gehring et al 2015 penning et al 2006 9 c o 2 4 h 2 c h 4 2 h 2 o 10 c h 3 c o o h c h 4 c o 2 however this did not reconcile with the relatively high levels of arsenic in groundwater which coupled methanogenesis with bsr should produce kirk et al 2004 wang et al 2015 hence the most probable process which was in greatest accord with the evidence was calcite dissolution fig 8 d the strontium isotopic ratio was another valuable tracer to demonstrate the origin of solutes the type of host sediments rocks and the impact of weathering processes due to the absence of isotopic fractionation during natural processes e g precipitation evaporation and biological uptake in the environment the strontium isotopic composition of groundwater was identical to that of the host aquifer rocks sahib et al 2016 shand et al 2009 basically groundwater going through silicate weathering would show high 87sr 86sr ratios 0 720 han liu 2004 whilst relatively lower 87sr 86sr ratios were characterized in groundwater suffering from carbonate and evaporite dissolution in the study area 87sr 86sr ratios in the deep groundwater ranged from 0 711036 to 0 719899 with a median value of 0 711979 fig 9 a lying between evaporite dissolution carbonate dissolution and silicate weathering this indicated the probable influence of dissolution of these three minerals similar distribution were shown also by the bivariate plot of 87sr 86sr against hco3 na molar ratio fig 9 b the deep groundwater samples were plotted for different mixing ratios between these three end members most saline samples lay closer to the area of evaporite dissolution manifesting the greater contribution of evaporite dissolution on the hydrogeochemistry of these groundwater this was also pronounced for the three high f as fresh groundwater d03 d04 and d06 based on the higher hco3 na and lower 87sr 86sr ratio in most fresh groundwater carbonate dissolution exerted control on their hydrogeochemical behaviors two fresh waters from the southern recharge area of zhongtiao mountain contained highest 87sr 86sr ratios up to 0 719899 suggesting the controlling role of silicate weathering 4 4 genesis of high fluoride and arsenic groundwater high levels of fluoride and arsenic co occurring fresh groundwater in yuncheng basin occupied 16 of the total sampled groundwater evolving in different environments and characterizing diverse hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions high f as groundwater in closed reducing environment d03 d04 and d06 showed the most depleted δ18o and δ2h compositions and lower 14c activity of 20 pmc deviating other fresh water samples fig 5 this suggested that these groundwater were largely affected by intrusion of palaeo waters as stated above during the formation of palaeo waters evaporites e g gypsum and mirabilite would sorb substantially greater amounts of ionic components including fluoride arsenic sodium and boron cary et al 2015 wang et al 2019 during the flushing of relatively newly fresh groundwater into the palaeo saline waters desorption of already adsorbed fluoride and arsenic from evaporites would occur resulting in the co contamination evidenced by high δ34s low so4 2 and δ13c values the occurrence of bacterial sulfate reduction and organic degradation facilitated by the closed reducing environment had also enhanced arsenic and fluoride enrichment in groundwater it was interesting to note that groundwater in the e mei plateau d10 d11 d12 and d13 evolved likewise in closed reducing environment and suffered from bsr however with low arsenic values this indicated that it was organic degradation rather than bsr that created the groundwater contamination with elevated concentrations of arsenic and fluoride this was in accordance with the observations of kirk et al 2004 who reported that bacterial sulfate reduction limited natural arsenic contamination in groundwater on the other hand under the semi closed facultative environment high f and as level in deep fresh groundwater d09 with enriched δ18o and δ2h values was indicative of arsenic and fluoride mobilization via vertical recharge of shallow waters elevated contents of na and b in this sample fig 6 c were consistent with shallow leakage influence during the flushing and leaching of shallow groundwater degradation process of heavily input of organic matter accelerated arsenic and fluoride accumulation indicated by the relatively lower δ13c and high hco3 value in this groundwater fig 8 d anawar et al 2013 consequently organic degradation process played an immeasurable role in the formation of high f as groundwater 4 5 conceptual model carbon 14 activity together with stable isotopes and chemical compositions were used to assist delineation of the mechanisms of fluoride arsenic and solutes enrichment in the deep groundwater at yuncheng basin fig 10 in the northern recharge area deep wells yielded high fluoride 1 39 1 53 mg l low arsenic 3 1 6 µg l fresh groundwater and showed residence times of 5622 6767 yrs the enrichment of δ34s values 13 58 14 19 the associated low so4 2 contents 39 96 111 mg l and highest δ13c values 7 7 6 55 suggested that bsr and carbonate dissolution were taking place in the deep aquifers in the e mei plateau relatively older deep fresh groundwater 8225 yrs with low fluoride and arsenic contents were found in the southern recharge area the low δ13c values and high 87sr 86sr ratios in these groundwater suggested the dominance of silicate weathering at the front edge of e mei plateau saline groundwater sampled near the faults had residence time 7403 yrs approaching to that of geothermal water 8353 yrs the good fitness of these deep samples in the mixing line between deep freshwater and deep geothermal water as inferred from br cl vs b cl ratio δ18o vs δ2h values and δ34s vs so4 2 concentrations showed strong evidences of a geothermal origin which promoted fluoride enrichment 1 61 2 33 mg l the most depleted δ18o and δ2h values high b cl and low br cl were detected in some deep groundwater pointing towards the intrusion of palaeo waters dissolution of ancient evporites produced locally distributed saline groundwater in the qiji and wenxi county fig 1 a with high f 1 61 1 85 mg l low as 3 6 7 8 µg l and old residence times of 10997 11991 yrs palaeo recharge was also responsible for the high f as levels of fresh groundwater in closed environment in the basin center some deep saline groundwater in the central basin yielding modern ages 3696 yrs and 4348 yrs were characterized by similar isotopic δ18o δ2h δ13c and 87sr 86sr signatures to those of shallow groundwater and high no3 concentrations which were in concordance with downward shallow leakage near the cone of depression the relatively lower δ34s values 9 96 to 12 55 in these deep groundwater reflected that the mixed shallow groundwater suffered from pyrite oxidation under the semi closed facultative environment in the kaolao uplifted area shallow vertical leakage had led to the co occurring fluoride and arsenic in fresh groundwater with concentration of 3 73 mg l and 14 7 µg l respectively 4 6 groundwater fluoride and arsenic management on the global scale the vital role of groundwater as a water supply for the steady growth in population and expanding economic activities was threatened by the degradation of water quality associated with some health related inorganic contaminants e g salt as and f fakhreddine et al 2021 han currell 2022 large scale groundwater extraction to maintain societies and economies prevailed burri et al 2019 foster 2020 hssaisoune et al 2020 however the potential environmental impacts of groundwater extraction cannot be neglected heavy pumping of middle and deep aquifers for local industry agriculture and the life leaded to the situation that toxic elements were not only limited in shallow groundwater but also widely distributed in deep aquifers the government should strengthen the monitoring of groundwater dynamic status and establish a comprehensive monitoring network of the groundwater system this could help to acquire the groundwater level quality and quantity and formulate plans to avoid the deterioration of the situation local government should also take actions to ensure the sustainable exploitation of groundwater additionally sustainable measures such as adsorption membrane separation precipitation and ion exchange techniques should be adopted for mitigating high fluoride and arsenic menace in aquifers alkurdi et al 2019 biswas sarkar 2021 sosa et al 2020 sunkari et al 2021 van geen et al 2019 in summary our research suggested that to avoid further deterioration of groundwater resources forceful measures dealing with the over exploitation of groundwater were required 5 conclusions in this study the origin and evolution of deep groundwater at yuncheng basin were elaborated by integrating major trace elements and multiple isotopes the tds contents of deep groundwater samples from yuncheng basin range from 230 to 1 720 mg l with 50 of the samples belonging to saline category tds 1 000 mg l four fresh groundwater show simultaneous increase of fluoride and arsenic contents above the who guideline value 1 5 mg l and 10 µg l depleted stable isotope compositions δ18o h2o and δd values as low as 11 03 and 81 7 respectively along with low radiocarbon activities mostly 20 pmc indicate the palaeo recharge origin of the deep groundwater in the late pleistocene and early holocene during a cooler period and the palaeo temperature is approximately 3 c cooler than the modern temperature groundwater ages estimated from 14c activities further indicate that the deep groundwater was mostly recharged between 5 000 and 11 000 years ago three types of solute sources for deep groundwater at yuncheng basin are delineated the correlation between br cl and b cl ratios reflects the dominant effects of freshening of depleted δ18o and δ2h palaeo saline waters on locally distributed groundwater salinity in the qiji and wenxi county saline groundwater sampled near the faults show strong evidence of a geothermal origin while vertical seepage of shallow saline groundwater suffering from pyrite oxidation contributes to elevation of tds contents in deep groundwater near the depression cone high levels of fluoride and arsenic co occurring fresh groundwater are characterized by diverse hydrogeochemical and isotopic compositions evidenced by δ18o and δ2h compositions and 14c activity palaeo waters intrusion and shallow leakages enhance the enrichment of groundwater fluoride and arsenic in closed reducing environment and semi closed facultative environment respectively organic degradation process plays an important role in the formation of high f as groundwater our research recommends that forceful management strategies dealing with groundwater over exploitation are required to meet the ever increasing human needs without further water resources deterioration the water management authorities should adopt effective measures to establish comprehensive monitoring network and ensure sustainable exploitation of groundwater ex situ treatment methods such as adsorption precipitation membrane separation and ion exchange techniques should be employed for mitigation of fluorosis and arsenicosis hazards 6 data availability the underlying research data can be found from the first author upon
