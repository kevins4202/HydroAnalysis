24245,incorporation of a forest management module in the dynamic vegetation model lpj guess has allowed the study and predictions of management treatment effects on the carbon cycle and on forest ecosystem structure in this study lpj guess is evaluated at the regional scale against observational data from the swedish national forest inventory simulated standing volume is compared against observations for the four most common forest types in the country furthermore eddy covariance flux measurements from the integrated carbon observation system icos are used to evaluate model predictions of net ecosystem exchange nee gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration reco at the site scale the model results suggest an adequate representation of standing volume in monocultures of norway spruce and scots pine for regional simulations in southern and central sweden after an updated parameterization of the species for northern sweden the standing volume in norway spruce monocultures was overestimated with the updated parameter values at the stand scale the model produced mixed results for carbon fluxes when evaluated against eddy covariance data for two sites one in central and one in southern sweden the interannual variation of gpp was well captured for the central swedish site but the modelled average gpp for the period 2015 2019 was overestimated by 9 for the southern swedish site gpp was underestimated by 15 for the corresponding period and the simulated interannual variation was half of the observed the seasonal estimates of modelled net ecosystem exchange nee deviated from observations and the simulated standing volume was underestimated by 25 for both sites the results highlight further potential to perform species specific calibration to capture latitudinal gradients in key ecosystem properties and to incorporate additional characteristics of site quality which could benefit model accuracy at the scale of individual forest stands both regarding simulated carbon fluxes and forest stand variables keywords vegetation dynamics norway spruce forest management standing volume forest ecosystems data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction boreal and temperate forests together cover about 40 of the global forest area and contribute to two thirds of the annual net global forest carbon sink harris et al 2021 the sequestration of carbon by forests is a vital ecosystem service providing mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and a reduction of the magnitude of harmful effects of changes to the climate of the earth ipbes 2019 the sequestration potential of forest ecosystems depends on multiple environmental factors including climate soil and topography previous patterns of disturbance and on human land use such as forest management harris et al 2021 senf and seidl 2020 kljun et al 2006 in sweden forests cover 69 of the total land area and even aged silvicultural management practices dominate on the vast majority of the productive forest land snfi 2021a lindahl et al 2017 as a consequence the extraction of biomass is highly efficient the forests of sweden provide about 10 of the total global share of produced timber and pulp barklund et al 2009 commonly applied at regional to global scales dynamic vegetation models dvms are useful tools for large scale studies of the carbon cycle and for predicting the response of vegetation to changing climate conditions dvms are built from the theoretical understanding of how plants function and explicitly model vital aspects of a terrestrial ecosystem to project vegetation structure and functioning from climate and soil input data recent model development in lpj guess has allowed for projections of the effects of management treatments on the carbon cycle and on ecosystem service provisioning lindeskog et al 2021 lagergren and jönsson 2017 accounting for forest management is especially relevant for studies of forest ecosystems that bear little resemblance to unmanaged natural forests in the same location knowledge of disturbance and management history is important for simulating observed vegetation structure and for the accurate recreation of carbon and nitrogen content in the soil in forestry enabled dvms lindeskog et al 2021 the simulated fluxes of carbon nitrogen and water depend on the ecosystem composition which is influenced by management treatments such as thinning clear felling or fertilization thinning for example controls the extent of competition between individuals and reduces natural mortality which in turn affects processes such as photosynthesis and heterotrophic respiration which over long timescales can have major implications for the carbon balance lindeskog et al 2021 a common method of evaluating vegetation models involves the use of measurement data of net ecosystem co2 exchange nee the net flux of carbon from the atmosphere to the biosphere defined as the difference between the total ecosystem respiration reco and gross primary productivity gpp desai et al 2007 pan et al 2014 zaehle et al 2005 time series of nee measured with the eddy covariance ec technique are available for a multitude of sites in europe through icos ri integrated carbon observations system research infrastructure heiskanen et al 2021 while providing high quality observational data ec sites represent a local measurement heavily influenced by the site conditions of the forest stand in closest proximity to the point of measurement for this reason bottom up methods to scale up measured nee from the stand to the regional level are challenging and dependent on a modeling approach and such studies are rare but see chi et al 2019 desai et al 2007 measurements of forest variables including biomass standing stock and productivity are provided by national forest inventories nfis presenting an alternative method of large scale model evaluation pan et al 2014 in sweden long time series of observational data exist describing the state and change of forest ecosystems at the national scale fridman et al 2014 using nfi data lagergren et al 2012 evaluated the forestry enabled dvm lpj guess at the national scale of sweden and found an overestimation of simulated standing volume in southern sweden lindeskog et al 2021 evaluated the module for forest management at the scale of europe showing that simulated biomass and annual increment compares favorably against observational data improved simulation of stand growth and development for forests consisting of monocultures and species mixtures could provide the possibility of more detailed assessments of regulating ecosystem services related to carbon sequestration or of provisioning ecosystem services related to timber pulp and bioenergy here we update the forestry enabled dynamic vegetation model lpj guess with revised parameter settings for the two commercially most important tree species in swedish forestry scots pine pinus sylvestris l and norway spruce picea abies l karst at the regional scale the mean standing volume is evaluated for 20 year age classes representing the average forest state during different stages of growth and development for 1996 2015 in sweden birch betula l is evaluated in mixtures with norway spruce the approach captures the influence of climate conditions and forest management on volume development for the above mentioned species both in monocultures and in mixtures as well as stand growth development in monocultures additionally the model is evaluated at the stand scale against ec data to assess model capacity to simulate carbon fluxes and associated interannual variation an evaluation of forest stand variables at the stand scale is also included specifically the aims of the current study were to i assess the model performance of simulating standing volume at the regional scale by evaluating the results against observational data from the swedish national forest inventory ii improve the species specific model parameterization for the two dominating tree species based on projections of standing volume at the regional scale iii determine the model s capacity to accurately project stand variables such as mean height mean stand diameter stand density and mean stand volume as well as seasonal and interannual variation at the stand scale for carbon fluxes of nee gross primary production gpp and ecosystem respiration reco by evaluating the results against eddy covariance data 2 material methods 2 1 ecosystem model lpj guess is a dynamic vegetation model dvm with a process based representation of ecosystem function and vegetation structure smith et al 2001 2014 the model incorporates a detailed description of the exchange of carbon and water between the atmosphere and the biosphere ahlström et al 2012 and of nitrogen cycling smith et al 2014 terrestrial vegetation is simulated in dynamic response to input of external climate data fig 1 the plant physiological processes of photosynthesis respiration stomatal regulation and phenological development are simulated at a daily time step within the ecosystem soil hydrology and plant water uptake is modelled using a two layer soil profile lpj guess includes dynamic cycling of nitrogen and soil carbon based on the century model parton et al 1993 soil nitrogen build up results from mineralization of litter from biological nitrogen fixation estimated based on modelled evapotranspiration rates and from nitrogen deposition mineralization and nitrogen fixation are represented as internal model functions described in smith et al 2014 and nitrogen deposition is determined from an external dataset the model requires a spin up period of 500 years where the soil carbon nitrogen and ecosystem vegetation gradually build up from bare land vegetation is simulated for cohorts of different plant functional types pfts within patches where competition for resources affect regeneration growth and mortality smith et al 2014 species specific parameters govern tree allometry longevity and root distribution and influence the competition for light water and nutrients n within each simulated patch smith et al 2001 wramneby et al 2008 bioclimatic limits for establishment and survival determine the natural geographic distribution potential of each pft hickler et al 2012 the forest management module enables the simulation of even aged or uneven aged silvicultural systems through a user defined regime which initiates a naturally regenerated or planted forest stand at the patch level it includes a comprehensive set of parameters regulating timing and extent of planting thinning and clear cutting for individual tree species lindeskog et al 2021 2 2 environmental forcing data 2 2 1 regional simulations climate soil mean monthly values for temperature precipitation short wave radiation and annual values for carbon dioxide concentration were used to drive the model for regional simulations the climate variables originated from the cruncep version 7 forcing dataset viovy 2018 and co2 concentration data from the global carbon project le quéré et al 2018 detrended climate data for 1901 1930 were repeatedly cycled to build up pools of soil carbon and nitrogen over the course of the spin up period with the co2 value for 1901 representing pre industrial atmospheric concentrations a pre industrial value for nitrogen deposition was used during model spin up corresponding to 2 kg n ha 1 year 1 annual values for co2 were prescribed as input during the historical 1901 2015 period for regional simulations and for 1901 2020 for local simulations monthly values of nitrogen deposition at 10 year intervals were used as input based on lamarque et al 2011 during 1850 2009 we assumed similar nitrogen deposition rates post 2009 as of 2000 2009 the gridded climate data had a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 new soil types were created to represent the four most common forest soils throughout the country table 1 these were determined from a data set received from the swedish forest soil inventory sfsi consisting of 6621 sample sites across productive forest land the field data had been collected during the period 2003 2012 from permanent sample plots for the four soil types the fractions of sand silt and clay were determined from the classification scheme of albert atterberg tupek et al 2016 because lpj guess does not include simulation of mineral fractions coarser than sand fractions representing gravel stones and boulders were added to the sand fraction additional parameters such as soil water holding capacity hmax percolation rate k and soil thermal properties were calculated from these fractions based on haxeltine and prentice 1996 to enable model simulations table 1 2 2 2 stand scale simulations instrumentation data processing to enable model simulations for the sites norunda in central sweden 60ᵒ05 n 17ᵒ29 e 45 m asl and hyltemossa in southern sweden 56 06 n 13 25 e 115 m asl site specific meteorological data were received from the two icos integrated carbon observation system heiskanen et al 2021 stations fig 1 the variables included daily values of measured precipitation temperature shortwave radiation soil temperature and soil water content and originated from the warm winter 2020 ecosystem datasets heliasz et al 2022 mölder et al 2022 the site norunda is situated in the boreonemoral zone and experiences a mean annual temperature of 7 1 ᵒc and precipitation of 565 mm per year period 1990 2020 smhi station uppsala the site hyltemossa is located in the nemoral zone in the county of skåne with a mean annual temperature of 8 1 ᵒc and precipitation of 786 mm per year climate period 1991 2020 smhi stations klippan and hörby the eddy covariance tower in norunda is located in the center of a mixed coniferous forest stand the stand consists mainly of scots pine pinus sylvestris 58 of basal area and norway spruce picea abies 38 of basal area with dominant trees reaching heights of 30 m lindroth et al 2020 the mean leaf area index lai for 2019 was 2 8 m2 m 2 mölder et al 2021 the forest soil classified as a dystric regosol is a stony glacial till with a relatively high proportion of clay and silt lundin et al 1999 the soil contains a large amount of gravel and boulders and the fine material content of the soil 2 mm is about 30 the forest within the ec tower footprint of hyltemossa consists of an even aged norway spruce monoculture sparsely admixed with downy birch betula pubescens stand height in 2017 was 14 6 m with a mean leaf area index in 2019 of 4 4 m2 m 2 heliasz et al 2021 the norway spruce stand was established in 1983 and thinned in 2009 and 2013 the site index is estimated to 36 0 m at 100 years the soil is classified as a sandy silty glacial till with a shallow organic layer for the stand scale simulations monthly data originating from the cru ncep dataset from the gridcell containing the site were first bias corrected based on the averaged differences with the monthly averaged meteorological data from the sites over the overlapping period 1995 2013 for hyltemossa and 1995 2010 for norunda the bias corrected data were then used during the model spin up phase and the historical period up until 1994 thereafter the meteorological data from smhi weather stations in proximity to the two sites were applied directly enabling a gradual transition from the spin up and historical periods covering the years 1995 2013 for hyltemossa and 1995 2010 for norunda weather data from different stations were combined because of a lack of a complete dataset for the entire transition phase weather data for the 1995 2013 transition period of hyltemossa originated from the nearby munka ljungby and klippan weather stations for precipitation and from backåkra and munka ljungby for air temperature the dataset for the 1995 2010 transition period of norunda included temperature from uppsala airport and dannemora weather station and precipitation from harbo drälinge and vattholma meteorological data from the stations were used from 2011 for norunda and 2014 for hyltemossa covering the evaluation period 2015 2019 2 3 forest observational data for comparison with simulations at the regional scale data from the swedish national forest inventory snfi were obtained via the interactive tool taxwebb snfi 2021b the data consisted of quality controlled measurements of standing volume classified in four forest types for productive forest land in sweden norway spruce monoculture scots pine monoculture mixed norway spruce scots pine forest mixed norway spruce birch forest other forest types such as those containing nemoral broadleaves were excluded from the study the standing volume was received in 20 year age classes for each forest type for each of the 20 counties included in this study the youngest age class 0 20 years only included measured trees above a height of 1 3 m the uncertainty of the standing volume estimates provided by the snfi varies between 2 and 15 at the scale of individual counties snfi 2016 data were also received for the area cover of each age class within the counties the county level estimates of standing volume were weighted by forest area of the age class in each county enabling the calculation of mean standing volume for each of the three regions of sweden the mean observed standing volume used to evaluate model results represents the average forest state during the period 1996 to 2015 for each age class and region fig 1 a weighted standard deviation was calculated to indicate the variation in standing volume among the counties of a region for a given age class 1 s d w i 1 n w i x i x w 2 n 1 i 1 n w i n where w i is the forest area based weight for the ith county x i is the non weighted mean standing volume of the ith county x w is the weighted mean standing volume and n is the number of non zero weights 2 4 eddy covariance ec data for comparison with simulations at the stand scale model simulations for hyltemossa and norunda were validated with monthly and yearly values of net ecosystem exchange nee for the years 2015 to 2019 partitioned into the components of gross primary production gpp and total ecosystem respiration reco the datasets originate from the warm winter 2020 ecosystem eddy covariance flux product and were processed and quality controlled following the icos protocols sabbatini et al 2018 compliant with the fluxnet2015 release https fluxnet fluxdata org heliasz et al 2022 mölder et al 2022 evaluation data for stand variables originated from the icos l2 ecosystem datasets mölder et al 2021 heliasz et al 2021 two methods exist for calculating the components of gpp and reco from nee the nighttime method nt models reco from nighttime nee data based on its relationship to temperature the reco model is then extrapolated to daytime and gpp is derived as the difference between measured nee and modelled reco reichstein et al 2005 the daytime method dt models gpp and reco from measured nee where the gpp component is derived with a light response curve which includes the limiting effect of vapor pressure deficit during daytime the reco component is then modelled based on air temperature in a similar manner to the nighttime method lasslop et al 2010 the ecosystem model lpj guess models gpp based on a mechanistic description of photosynthesis during daytime which shares more resemblance with the approach of the daytime method compared to the nighttime method we therefore present the simulation results of annual and monthly carbon fluxes at the stand scale with a comparison against observational dt data for comparison of methods annual carbon fluxes are presented also for nt appendix a fig a7 the ec data used in this study were measured and analyzed by icos who have developed a standardized approach for post processing of raw data franz et al 2018 the approach ensures comparability of each dataset to other ec sites and provides a comprehensive quality control qa qc with an assessment of the uncertainty which arises during the measurement and post processing steps heiskanen et al 2021 franz et al 2018 one of the main contributions to ec data uncertainty is associated with the correct estimation of the threshold for friction velocity u the threshold value varies with site season and year and indicates a boundary below which measurement data of nighttime ecosystem respiration should be discarded due to low turbulent mixing wutzler et al 2018 filtering of data based on different values for friction velocity ultimately results in an assessment of the range of uncertainty for a time series of nee gpp and reco the method is fully discussed in pastorello et al 2020 the uncertainty in the data is indicated by the 16th and the 86th percentiles of the threshold values of u we visualized the uncertainty as an overlay for monthly nee in fig 3 for monthly gpp and reco in fig 4 for annual nee gpp and reco in fig 5 and for annual gpp and reco in fig a7 the micrometeorological sign convention for ecosystem fluxes is used in this study where a positive sign denotes a flow towards the atmosphere and a negative sign a flow towards the ground the datasets cover years representative of the climate normal period 1991 2020 this includes the drought year 2018 when large parts of scandinavia and the baltic was affected by a drought during the summer lindroth et al 2020 2 5 model setup of simulations 2 5 1 regional scale simulations we applied the forest management module of lpj guess version 4 0 within each of the three main regions of sweden southern central and northern fig 1 with the aim to simulate the standing volume in monocultural and mixed species stands formed by the main tree species norway spruce picea abies l karst scots pine pinus sylvestris l and birch betula l which together represent 92 2 of standing volume across productive forest land snfi 2021a monoculture stands were simulated for norway spruce and scots pine mixed stands were formed by norway spruce and downy birch betula pubescens ehrh and mixed coniferous stands by norway spruce and scots pine the simulations covered 194 gridcells capturing the 20 counties of mainland sweden the island of gotland was omitted the number of patches per forest stand was set to 12 gridcells situated above the treeline i e within alpine environments were excluded fig 1 stochastic mortality events were turned off after introduction of management to generate simulations representing the best case scenario for each given region lpj guess generates a forest ecosystem in equilibrium with the climate at the end of a 500 year long spin up period during which carbon and nutrients in the soil gradually are built up the establishment of managed forest types was initiated at different years during the 19th century by simulating clear felling and plantation of forest stands resulting in stands of different ages in the landscape during the period of evaluation we evaluated the simulated standing volume against the observed for the mean state of the forest during 1996 2015 for each age class five age classes were included for southern and central sweden for monocultures and mixed coniferous forest 0 20 21 40 41 60 61 80 81 100 years an additional age class 101 120 years was included for northern sweden as stand rotations are longer within the colder northern climate birch is often found with norway spruce within a mixture during early to mid rotation and was therefore represented by three age classes for southern and central sweden and four in northern sweden hynynen et al 2009 the applied forest management treatments represented even aged management which has characterized forest management during the 20th century in sweden table 2 for the mixed stands a selective cutting function was set to thin the stands every 12 to 20 years to retain an equal balance of the woody biomass of each of the two species within the mix for all but the two youngest age classes lindeskog et al 2021 as a consequence the strength of the thinning varied across age classes and gridcells and the removals are therefore not included in table 2 2 5 2 stand scale simulations the simulated forest management of both sites aimed to recreate a forest stand representative of current site conditions 2015 2019 based on the available knowledge regarding the history of stand management a mixed scots pine and norway spruce stand was simulated at the norunda site by initiating planting at the year 1900 following a clearcut of previously unmanaged forest table 2 very little is known regarding the stand management at norunda during the early 20th century we assumed the planting density was lower than in contemporary forestry since no formal law for mandatory regeneration had been passed at the time ekelund and hamilton 2001 p 37 one pre commercial thinning and two regular thinnings were assumed at given intervals as well as a known thinning which occurred in 2008 removing about 15 of the volume lindroth et al 2018 a till like soil type dominated by sand was used for the norunda site to represent a very high content of coarse material in the soil lundin et al 1999 as indicated by available stand management information the norway spruce monoculture was initiated in hyltemossa through planting of 3300 stems ha 1 in 1983 followed by pre commercial thinning in 1998 and a thinning in 2010 table 2 we assumed one previous rotation had occurred before the current stand was planted a till like sandy soil with high silt content was used for hyltemossa 2 6 sensitivity analysis and improvement of parameters a sensitivity analysis was performed to test the influence of the four key parameters turnover sap k latosa sla and cton sap on the modelled standing volume of norway spruce and scots pine the parameter turnover sap regulates the proportion of sapwood converted into heartwood influencing the tree carbon accumulation and respiratory losses zaehle et al 2005 the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the sapwood is determined by the parameter cton sap which influences autotrophic respiration by modifying the nitrogen content of the sapwood smith et al 2014 the parameter k latosa determines the proportion of carbon allocated to leaf and stem biomass zaehle et al 2005 the ratio between leaf area and leaf dry biomass is influenced by the parameter sla wramneby et al 2008 settings for the two parameters rootdist and leaflong were also changed but were not included within the sensitivity analysis as their settings are less uncertain the analysis was performed to determine if the species specific settings could improve model projections of standing volume tables a1 a2 appendix a the simulations represented monocultures at the landscape scale simulating their different age classes within one gridcell in örebro county situated in the boreonemoral zone in central sweden fig 1 model climate data input was the same as specified in 2 2 1 representing the grid cell average climate during the period of forest growth landscape averages for standing volume derived from the snfi data for both scots pine and norway spruce monocultural forest types were used for evaluating simulated standing volume during the analysis 3 of the above mentioned parameters were kept at their original setting while the 4th was changed to determine the relative influence of the parameter on simulated standing volume the sensitivity analysis resulted in 21 simulations for each species tables a1 a2 appendix a the sensitivity analysis indicated that region specific parameter settings would generate closer to observed volume estimates new parameters called opt were therefore identified used and evaluated along with the original parameters for scots pine and norway spruce for the three main regions table 3 according to mencuccini and grace 1995 the leaf to sapwood area ratio k latosa should increase with increasing latitude for this reason k latosa was raised slightly for northern sweden and lowered slightly for southern sweden additional specifications and motivations for changed parameter settings are presented in appendix a results below of simulated standing volume with the new parameters are denoted opt and results with the original estimates are referred to as orig these simulations were based solely on the till like fine sand soil type which here represents the most common soil for all regions of sweden table 1 the optimized model parameters opt were also used within the simulations for norunda and hyltemossa in order to generate stand variables fluxes of gross primary productivity gpp net ecosystem exchange nee and ecosystem respiration reco model runs with differing soil input information were aggregated into mean standing volume within simulations denoted optw these represent forest established on a wider range of soils differing in soil water holding capacity and percolation rate within each gridcell table 1 a comparison of the relative contribution of individual soil types to the weighted standing volume of simulation optw is presented in fig a1 appendix a this simulation was performed for a monocultural stand of norway spruce in örebro county with identical management settings as in the sensitivity analysis above for the simulations at the regional scale we assumed that scots pine was established primarily on sandy soils heiskanen and makitalo 2002 while downy birch and norway spruce were assumed to be primarily established on sandy to silty tills heiskanen et al 2016 hynynen et al 2009 we also assumed that the soil types were evenly distributed in the same proportions across all gridcells of sweden for a given forest type table a3 appendix a 2 7 sensitivity analysis and improvement of parameters simulated output data were analyzed using the software excel microsoft 2019 and matlab r2020b mathworks inc modelled stem wood biomass kg c m 2 was transformed to stem wood volume m3 ha 1 through application of biomass expansion factors befs using a constant carbon to dry matter fraction 0 51 kg c per kg dry matter for conifers and 0 48 kg c per kg dry matter for broadleaves aalde et al 2006 the stem volume was derived from befs for different age classes lehtonen et al 2004 an approach suitable for application of tree species in the boreal zone as constant biomass expansion factors may lead to biased results petersson et al 2012 the resulting volume given for each age class and species was derived for each of the 20 mainland counties of sweden fig 1 values for standing volume for each of the three study regions were then calculated as a weighted mean where counties with larger forested area within a region contributed more to the overall estimate in the same manner as described above for the observational data a weighted standard deviation was calculated for each age class to indicate the variation in standing volume within a region according to eq 1 this method allowed for a direct comparison of simulated standing volume against observed alternative methods such as a comparison of the net simulated periodic increment against the observed for each region would rely on further calculations introducing additional uncertainty into the analysis mean annual increment mai was calculated as the total stand production divided by the stand age the periodic annual increment pai was calculated as the net change in standing volume from a given point during the simulation to the next divided by the number of years between the points removed biomass from thinnings and natural mortality during the period was included in the estimate for both mai and pai model output for carbon fluxes were transformed from daily to monthly and annual values and were analyzed to determine the deviation from eddy covariance data by calculating the root mean square deviation rmsd kobayashi and salam 2000 the interannual variation was calculated as the standard deviation of the annual values of the studied period 2015 2019 for each site 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis and improvement of parameters any change in one of the assessed parameters had an influence on the simulated standing volume for both species a stepwise increase in the parameter k latosa reduced simulated volume while an increase in sla turnover sap or cton sap relative to the original setting caused an increase in vegetation carbon and biomass over time tables a1 and a2 the original model parameters showed large deviations for both scots pine and norway spruce when simulated standing volume was compared to observed for örebro county this motivated a need to increase accumulated biomass for norway spruce and decrease it for scots pine as a consequence an increase in any of the three parameters turnover sap sla or cton sap reduced the negative bias in standing volume compared to nfi data for örebro county for norway spruce table a2 for scots pine a reduction in turnover sap combined with increased values for k latosa reduced the positive bias table a1 the new parameter sets opt aimed to improve the species specific settings table 3 the mean annual increment mai of the norway spruce monoculture forest simulated in örebro using the updated parameter set opt showed a consistent increase over the studied period fig 2 similarly the scots pine monoculture simulated using the opt parameters indicated no clear peak of the mai over the course of the simulation fig 2 3 2 evaluation of simulated standing volume for the three regions of sweden 3 2 1 scots pine monoculture the original parameterization orig overestimated the standing volume of scots pine compared to the nfi data for all three regions table 4 the new parameterization opt and optw improved the overall accuracy most noticeably for the four oldest age classes in southern and central sweden table 4 the volume estimates with soil type representation optw and average soil type opt differed by less than 5 m3 ha 1 for northern and central sweden and less than 10 m3 ha 1 for southern sweden the orig setting produced age class specific estimates ranging from 22 to 315 m3 ha 1 for northern sweden table 4 with an overall positive bias of 63 optw and opt showing similar results had a bias of 31 and 30 respectively in central sweden orig had a positive bias of 21 opt 4 and optw 2 in southern sweden standing volume for orig varied from 58 to 316 m3 ha 1 while optw and opt ranged from 61 to 269 m3 ha 1 both optw and opt displayed a major improvement for age classes 21 40 41 60 and 61 80 overall positive bias was 13 for opt 9 for optw and 26 for orig 3 2 2 norway spruce monoculture simulations with the original setting orig underestimated volume for all three regions compared to the nfi data except for the youngest age class in southern sweden table 5 the opt and optw settings improved model results for central and southern sweden but the model overestimated standing volume for northern sweden in comparison to nfi data both opt and optw settings produced similar results for standing volume for the three regions differing by less than 5 m3 ha 1 in northern sweden and by less than 10 m3 ha 1 for central and southern sweden table 5 in northern sweden the bias was 21 for orig whereas the bias for opt was 33 and for optw 36 in central sweden the model results deviated only slightly for opt and for optw compared to the observational data for all age classes bias for opt was 2 and 0 2 for optw whereas orig underestimated standing volume for four out of five age classes table 5 results for orig in southern sweden had a bias of 51 bias for opt in southern sweden was 5 and for optw 4 table 5 3 2 3 mixed coniferous forest the orig setting for mixed coniferous forest was relatively well constrained for all three studied regions whereas opt and optw displayed a stronger positive bias in relation to the nfi data table 6 opt and optw generated similar results differing by 5 m3 ha 1 in northern sweden less than 5 m3 ha 1 in central sweden and less than 10 m3 ha 1 in southern sweden the orig setting in northern sweden ranged from 20 to 267 m3 ha 1 table 6 indicating a positive bias of 20 compared to the nfi data opt and optw in northern sweden had a positive bias of 41 and 43 respectively in central sweden orig had a negative bias of 11 which was reduced to 4 for southern sweden in central sweden opt ranged from 45 to 354 m3 ha 1 and had a positive bias of 24 whereas optw ranged from 45 to 352 m3 ha 1 with a positive bias of 23 opt and optw deviated strongly also from the nfi data in southern sweden by 31 and 29 respectively 3 2 4 mixed forest the original model parameters for mixed forest displayed agreement with the observational data for all studied regions opt and optw differed by 5 m3 ha 1 in northern sweden and central sweden and less than 10 m3 ha 1 in southern sweden table 7 in northern sweden orig deviated by 6 from the nfi data whereas opt deviated by 15 and optw by 16 the model accuracy was reduced for orig in central sweden with a bias of 13 compared to the nfi data whereas opt and optw improved the results bias of 5 and 3 respectively the orig setting agreed with the observational data regarding standing volume for southern sweden with a bias of 4 table 7 whereas opt and optw deviated more strongly with a bias of 40 and 38 respectively 3 3 evaluation of stand scale simulations 3 3 1 evaluation of simulated forest structure variables for norunda both height and diameter were relatively well captured for norway spruce within the mixed stand using the opt parameters but the density was underestimated the total simulated volume was 25 lower than observed primarily as a result of a low simulated height and diameter of scots pine table 8 this result indicates a discrepancy between the simulated productive capacity of scots pine calibrated at the regional scale for central sweden opt and the observed productive capacity for the species at the norunda site the simulated mean annual increment mai remained even but showed a tendency towards culmination 110 years after establishment fig a2 appendix a the simulated standing volume in the norway spruce monoculture in hyltemossa was 25 lower than the observed the simulated mai of the stand did not culminate within the period of study displaying a growth trend similar to observed for monocultures of norway spruce in southern sweden on sites of high quality fig a2 appendix a the high planting density caused competition within the simulated stand and elicited self thinning which offset the increase in standing volume over time by 2017 94 m3 of stemwood volume had been lost to natural mortality excluding thinnings in addition the simulated leaf area index was underestimated by 2 m2 m 2 resulting in a lower light use within the simulated stand which limited carbon sequestration and growth table 8 3 3 2 evaluation of simulated carbon fluxes net ecosystem exchange norunda norunda was observed to be a source of carbon for all years with an average net flux of 343 g c m 2 year 1 for the 2015 2019 period hereafter referred to as period average carbon emissions ranged from 259 g c m 2 in 2019 to 483 g c m 2 in 2016 presenting a total range of 224 g c m 2 year 1 for the studied period with an interannual variation of 91 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 for all years the site was a carbon sink in spring and the uptake was offset by high respiration during summer and autumn months fig 3 lpj guess forced with station based climate data simulated an average modelled net carbon flux of 103 g c m 2 year 1 for 2015 2019 with a range for the studied period of 280 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 the modelled interannual variation was 106 g c m 2 year 1 the modelled nee broadly agreed with the observed during spring months but the model overestimated carbon uptake during summers fig 3 leading to higher rmsd values fig 6 in 2018 the annual precipitation dropped to 456 mm which was 19 lower compared to the value for the climate normal period 1990 2020 565 mm year 1 the mean air temperature for the summer was 17 9 ᵒc whereas the period average for 2015 2019 was 16 1 ᵒc fig a4 appendix a lpj guess correctly estimated nee in 2018 as positive but underestimated its magnitude fig 5 net ecosystem exchange hyltemossa hyltemossa had an observed average annual net carbon flux of 175 g c m 2 which varied from 363 g c m 2 year 1 2017 to 13 g c m 2 year 1 2019 a range of 349 g c m 2 year 1 over the studied period with an interannual variation of 144 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 for three out of the six years the sink strength of the ecosystem was larger in spring mam than in summer jja fig 3 both spring and summer seasons displayed a net carbon uptake with the exception of the summer of 2019 when the norway spruce forest stand was a carbon source for jja releasing 77 g c m 2 fig 3 the period average nee was not accurately captured by lpj guess simulated as 19 g c m 2 year 1 individual years ranged from 143 g c m 2 year 1 2016 to 106 g c m 2 year 1 2015 presenting a simulated interannual variation of 93 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 stand observations indicated that photosynthesis started earlier during the years than in the modelled stand modelled nee in february was positive for all years whereas a net carbon uptake was commonly observed for this month for the studied period fig 3 gross primary production ecosystem respiration norunda the observed average gross primary production for the norunda site 2015 2019 was 1310 g c m 2 year 1 and varied from 1138 g c m 2 year 1 2017 to 1448 g c m 2 year 1 2015 fig 5 a range of 310 g c m 2 year 1 the interannual variation was 131 g c m 2 year 1 average reco for the corresponding period was 1514 g c m 2 year 1 with a between year variation of 168 g c m 2 year 1 ranging from 1333 g c m 2 year 1 2017 to 1753 g c m 2 year 1 a total range of 420 g c m 2 year 1 2016 model results for gross primary production were close to observed for norunda fig 4 the simulated period average gpp was 1423 g c m 2 year 1 on average 9 higher than observed and varied between 1304 g c m 2 year 1 2018 and 1583 g c m 2 year 1 2015 presenting a range for the period of 279 g c m 2 year 1 the interannual variation was 110 g c m 2 year 1 the ratio of modelled npp to gpp was on average 0 25 and varied from 0 17 2018 to 0 31 2019 modelled reco period average was 1416 g c m 2 year 1 6 below the observed average and ranged from 1298 g c m 2 year 1 2016 to 1540 g c m 2 year 1 2015 a range of 242 g c m 2 year 1 the modelled between year variation was 110 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 the modelled soil water content swc in the top 50 cm soil layer broadly agreed with the observed during summers and autumns of most years fig a3 appendix a modelled reco peaked in late july 2018 as a result of a sudden increase in soil water content following a period of drought inconsistent with the trends within the observational data fig 4 gross primary production ecosystem respiration hyltemossa the observed gpp was on average 1804 g c m 2 year 1 2015 2019 and varied from 1517 g c m 2 year 1 2018 to 1994 g c m 2 year 1 2017 a range of 477 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 the between year variation was 198 g c m 2 year 1 reco was on average 1591 g c m 2 year 1 2015 2019 and varied between 1352 g c m 2 year 1 2018 to 1850 g c m 2 year 1 2019 a range of 498 g c m 2 year 1 with an interannual variation of 195 g c m 2 year 1 the modelled gpp period average was 1525 g c m 2 year 1 which was 15 below the observed gpp period average and varied from 1371 g c m 2 year 1 2018 to 1625 g c m 2 year 1 2016 a range of 219 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 the modelled interannual variation was 103 g c m 2 year 1 the ratio of npp to gpp was 0 41 for the period 2015 2019 varying from 0 36 2018 to 0 45 2019 the range of annual flux values within the observational data for gpp and reco were larger for hyltemossa than for norunda over the observed period fig 5 the modelled period average reco was 1506 g c m 2 year 1 with a range of 377 g c m 2 for the studied period simulated reco was 5 lower than observed for the studied period and varied from 1320 g c m 2 in 2018 to 1697 g c m 2 in 2015 presenting an interannual variation of 134 g c m 2 year 1 the model accurately captured the reduction in reco during 2018 with a negative bias of 2 for this year fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 general overview this study provided an evaluation of the dvm lpj guess for managed forests in the nemoral and boreal zones of sweden an updated parameterization of norway spruce and scots pine based on data from central sweden generated regional averages of standing volume in monocultures in southern and central sweden that were closer to observed values the new parameters did however not work well for northern sweden or for mixed stands the regional scale evaluation was complemented by an assessment of the model s capacity to simulate the structure of two forest stands and associated interannual variation of carbon fluxes simulated annual values of nee were outside of the range of uncertainty presented in the ec data indicating a mismatch in the representation of site specific conditions the model produced acceptable predictions of the magnitude of gpp for norunda but underestimated gpp for hyltemossa fig 5 disagreement between observed and simulated stand variables further suggest potential for additional tuning and site specific configuration to account for differences in site quality at the stand scale 4 2 model application at the regional scale 4 2 1 northern sweden with the new parameters opt the model became better suited for application at the regional scale in southern and central sweden representing monocultures for age classes relevant to commercial forestry where stand rotations do not commonly exceed 100 years for scots pine and norway spruce the simulations of conifers in northern sweden were however not representative of the average regional standing volume in monocultures or mixed coniferous stands several aspects may have contributed to the discrepancy in this study we excluded gridcells within alpine regions in northwestern sweden due to the coarse size of a gridcell 50 50 km some portions of low productive forest land may then also have been omitted contributing in part to the overestimation of the simulated standing volume per hectare in comparison with nfi data the sensitivity analysis of the species specific parameters was performed for a county in central sweden however the new parameter settings include a decrease in k latosa with increasing latitude based on evidence from available literature mencuccini and grace 1995 a representative setting for leaflong for northern sweden would likely further improve model results however uncertainty regarding the minimum nitrogen content in older needles prevented an increase of leaflong to the observed 8 to 12 years reich et al 2014 furthermore to have a firm control of the modeling processes this study did not include the simulation of random stand replacing disturbances during the simulation of managed forests commonly set with a return time of 100 to 400 years lindeskog et al 2021 gustafson et al 2021 enabling this setting may provide results closer to observed specifically for regions with extensive forest cover such as northern sweden the tendency to overestimate biomass production at high latitudes may also result from inadequate descriptions of relevant additional processes that inhibit tree growth these could include a limiting effect of cold conditions on the synthesis of wood or a simulated loss of carbon representing the exchange of carbohydrates for the uptake of nitrogen through mycorrhizal symbiosis as well as an inhibition of water uptake due to frozen soils in spring and autumn months gustafson et al 2021 4 2 2 the influence of changed soil conditions accounting for variation in soil type optw had limited influence on the simulated standing volume for a forest type within the landscape as optw outputs resembled those from opt for all studied regions regarding estimated standing volume the comparison of simulations to highlight the influence of soil type on standing volume indicated that greater proportions of finer grain size material within a soil increases standing volume fig a1 appendix 1 the small difference between the till like fine sand and till like coarse sand soil type may possibly be explained by their similar water holding capacity table 1 determining the influence of individual soil parameters on biomass growth and structure within additional analyses in future studies could provide further valuable information on the influence of soil hydrology on forest growth and productivity the relative contribution of each soil type to the generated standing volume in optw did also depend on the assumptions made regarding their proportion within a gridcell for these simulations table a3 the assumed proportions were largely based on the site requirements of each tree species and the silvicultural recommendations of establishing scots pine on soils with higher sand content compared to norway spruce the small variations in productivity among the two model simulations opt and optw however imply a robustness when accounting for only one dominating soil type across a grid when the objective is to adequately represent a regional average standing volume apart from both climate and soil texture soil nutrient content soil depth and the movement of groundwater also influence growth and productivity within a stand skovsgaard and vanclay 2013 bergh et al 2005 significant variations in site productivity can exist for the same type of soil norway spruce established on a till dominated by fine sand has an estimated site index varying from 30 0 m to 38 0 m at 100 years at the research site tönnersjöheden in southern sweden johansson pers comm our modeling approach relying on variation in soil texture and climate is therefore not sufficient for capturing the variation in site conditions for individual forest stands additional model development adding processes and parameter settings for aspects which further influence productivity would be needed to account for differences in site quality such aspects could include variations in soil depth among sites or additional soil layers lasota et al 2016 bergh et al 2005 however the benefit of adding functionality to the model needs to be considered in relation to the uncertainty introduced by additional parameters and equations which may influence the robustness of the model wramneby et al 2008 4 2 3 age related aspects the standing volume was overestimated for the two oldest age classes by opt and optw compared with the nfi data for all three regions for the norway spruce monoculture forest type however the development of the simulated mai for norway spruce established in a monoculture in örebro county displayed a similar trend as described for stands of norway spruce in the southern boreal zone in sweden indicating a representative stand development over time bergh et al 2005 within commercial forestry older forest stands are commonly situated on soils with low inherent productive capacity whereas stands situated on fertile soils generally have a shorter rotation period bergh et al 2005 roberge et al 2016 high yielding forest stands are therefore less likely to contribute to the regional volume estimate for higher age classes we did not account for this in our model simulations the estimated volume for the youngest age class deviated from the observed both within monocultures and mixed forest types for several regions the modelled plants have a height of 2 m and are initiated directly after clear cut which we consider the main cause for the overestimation of standing volume for this age class furthermore the stand regeneration phase is associated with some challenges which are currently not included in the model such as failed regeneration due to browsing frost damage to buds or damage due to pathogens such as the pine weevil bergqvist et al 2014 wallertz and petersson 2011 holmström et al 2018 gustafson et al 2021 incorporation of these growth reducing factors and alteration to the tree allometry following planting would improve the representation of forest stands and their growth within the establishment and early growth phase 0 20 years 4 2 4 mixed coniferous forest the model results for the orig setting for mixed birch norway spruce forest matched the observed data relatively well for all regions furthermore the original model parameters generated a standing volume of mixed coniferous forest comparable to observational data for southern and central sweden likely due to a conservative growth response of norway spruce in orig table 5 in combination with a greater than observed growth of scots pine in orig table 4 the new parameterization opt resulted in higher standing volume of mixed coniferous stands at ages above 60 years in comparison to nfi data we checked if this result was due to reduced thinning since the mixed forest was simulated with a setting for variable thinning to maintain an even proportion 50 50 of the carbon biomass of each species within the stands but found no such indications the average removal of volume was similar but slightly below that of pure scots pine for higher age classes and similar to norway spruce for younger age classes the modelled environment is less complex than an actual ecosystem with more distinct characteristics of tree species hou et al 2013 the unexpected overestimation could be attributed to reduced competition within simulated mixed stands with the opt parameterization with modelled species being able to exploit resources more efficiently due to clear differences in functional traits kahmen et al 2006 4 3 model application at the stand scale 4 3 1 forest stand variables the setting opt generated model results for stand variables which were inconsistent with site data with an underestimation of simulated standing volume for both norunda and hyltemossa table 8 our model results indicated an initiation of self thinning due to a high initial stand density for the norway spruce stand at the hyltemossa site which reduced the stand volume increment however the simulated growth was consistent with the observed trend for forest stands of high site productivity in southern sweden fig a2 appendix a the observational data indicated a sustained carbon sequestration and growth in norway spruce even at high stand densities fig a2 appendix a similarly to this study lindeskog et al 2021 modelled the standing volume for norway spruce and beech fagus sylvatica monoculture stands for 16 sites in germany using the lpj guess forest management module the study found representative model results for stands with low standing volume but a negative bias of 50 or more for stands with high standing volume the authors pointed to the possibility of including additional plant physiological processes such as hardening and dehardening as a potential way to account for differences in productivity lindeskog et al 2021 another option apart from the aspects mentioned above concerning soil characteristics and hydrology could be to further tune the two species specific allometric parameters k allom2 and k allom3 smith et al 2001 2014 these parameters influence the mean height and diameter within a stand height k allom2 diameter k allom3 bellassen et al 2010 showed that several forest variables were sensitive to changes in parameter values within similar biomass allometric equations implemented in the orchidee dvm adapted for forest management an initial assessment in our study showed improved estimates of stand height and density of scots pine for the norunda site when optimized against observational data table 8 we decided however not to use site specific calibration of these parameters due to lack of additional independent stand data for validation 4 3 2 norunda carbon fluxes the modelled interannual variation of gpp for 2015 2019 of 110 g c m 2 was similar to the observed value of 131 g c m 2 year 1 for the mixed stand at the norunda site the modelled ratio of npp gpp was on average 0 25 for 2015 2019 and was identical compared to a given estimate for scots pine in the boreal zone at the observed stand height makela and valentine 2001 however the model simulations of nee indicated norunda to be an average sink of 103 g c m 2 year 1 for the period 2015 2019 which disagreed with the observational data showing the site to be a source of 343 g c m 2 year 1 previous empirical studies have suggested soil heterotrophic emissions from the site in the range of 240 g c m 2 yr 1 lagergren et al 2019 soil measurements at the site have indicated low soil nitrogen n content which both restricts stand photosynthesis and increases competition for available n among soil microorganisms the selective decomposition of old soil organic matter by microbes to make additional nitrogen available is therefore considered a plausible main cause for the net co2 emissions from the site shahbaz et al 2022 these aspects not captured by the model may therefore partly explain the discrepancy between simulated and observed reco furthermore the norunda site has been shown to have very large within canopy variability of co2 fluxes during nighttime with strong horizontal and vertical advection occurring during clear summer nights with stable conditions strong advection can lead to either underestimation or overestimation of co2 and therefore influence the estimation of nighttime nee within the observational data feigenwinter et al 2010 the modelled between year variation of nee 106 g c m 2 year 1 was an accurate estimate of the observed within the stand 91 g c m 2 year 1 the interannual variation of the site was slightly higher than in a scots pine stand within a comparable climate in southern finland of 77 g c m 2 suni et al 2003 empirical studies have found old forest stands to be carbon sinks or close to carbon neutral in the boreal zone indicating that the model represents the average net carbon balance of this age class well given the current management settings see below luyssaert et al 2008 4 3 3 hyltemossa carbon fluxes the modelled average nee estimate for 2015 to 2019 was 19 g c m 2 whereas the observed average for the period was 175 g c m 2 for the hyltemossa site the annual modelled estimate of gpp was lower than observed and the modelled lai was reduced causing lower light absorption and interception within the stand an increase of modelled gpp would raise both npp and modelled autotrophic respiration and consequently annual reco which was underestimated for the site by 5 the average ratio of npp to gpp in the norway spruce stand was 0 40 for 2015 2019 which agreed with the ratio of npp gpp for norway spruce within the boreal zone given in harkonen et al 2010 indicating a proportional contribution of the autotrophic respiration component to modelled gpp for the site an increase in modelled gpp to the observed value would result in an accurate estimate of nee assuming this ratio remains constant previous model studies using the forest management module of lpj guess have shown high estimates for modelled soil carbon stocks compared to observations which may cause higher than observed heterotrophic respiration lindeskog et al 2021 in the model simulation for hyltemossa forest management was initiated in 1892 by clear felling to allow for the known occurrence of one completed rotation period of norway spruce forest before the initiation of the current forest stand in 1982 records and maps exist which show established forest in 1938 but the land area had however most likely been managed for a longer period of time o dwyer et al 2021 the accurate recreation of the historical management was important for generating representative soil carbon emissions initializing management in the early 1920s would have transformed the stand to a weaker carbon source due to increased rh data not shown furthermore utilizing the original parameter settings for norway spruce during spin up is important as the new parameters opt are not intended for simulating uneven aged natural forest observational data to enable direct comparisons between modelled and observed rh are currently lacking for hyltemossa such an effort would involve directly measuring the soil emissions within the stand using a closed dynamic system in conjunction with trenching of roots to disentangle the components of autotrophic root respiration and heterotrophic respiration from reco schindlbacher et al 2009 4 4 model uncertainty development lpj guess has been developed with a key aim of modeling natural and managed forest ecosystems at regional to global scales smith et al 2014 the process based modeling approach supports the view of the forest as a complex dynamic system messier et al 2013 and the model can be considered a working hypothesis of forest structure and functioning korzukhin et al 1996 previous lpj guess evaluation studies of forest growth and standing stock in sweden have focused on simulations at the national scale without distinguishing the age classes of specific forest types lagergren et al 2012 we implemented a set of new parameters for the two most common coniferous species in sweden with an evaluation at the regional scale which improved the predictions for monocultures in central and southern sweden the original parameters were intended for simulation of uneven aged potential natural vegetation pnv but the simulation of managed even aged forest landscapes presents new and differing conditions for the competition of light water and nutrients the new optimized parameters have been developed to represent managed forest and are not intended for the simulation of pnv with lpj guess the development of the mai and pai over time both for monocultural forests in örebro fig 2 and for the central and southern swedish sites fig a2 appendix a indicated a growth pattern representative of temperate and boreal forest stands in sweden the increase in standing volume of the norway spruce monoculture at hyltemossa was reduced due to high natural mortality in the stand indicating a potential for further tuning to improve the rate of self thinning for stands experiencing similar conditions in this study 4 model vegetation parameters for norway spruce and scots pine were optimized against county level nfi data using climate data input at the landscape scale an optimization at the landscape scale is less likely to capture the stand level characteristics of each tree species attempts to achieve greater biological realism in model simulations would benefit from additional tuning at the site scale using local climate model data input and representations of site quality including variations in soil depth and the movement of groundwater given that scots pine typically is found on poorer soils in sweden resulting in less productive stands we would expect that an attempt to compensate for this at the landscape scale with changing turnover sap would lead to a negative directional change in turnover sap which is what we also observed within the sensitivity analysis table a1 appendix a we have with the current approach explored the possibility of accounting for differences in site productivity by using different soil types in the simulations but different soils produced similar estimates fig a1 appendix a in general the observational data at the stand scale derived with the daytime method suggested improved model performance compared to observational data based on the nighttime method fig a7 appendix a we have here chosen to present the model results primarily with a comparison to the daytime method due to a greater similarity between the mechanistic modeling of npp in lpj guess based on photosynthesis to the daytime method of lasslop et al 2010 the discrepancy in annual and monthly values between the daytime method and the nighttime method in gpp and reco highlights the fact that the exchange of carbon between the vegetation and the atmosphere is a complex phenomenon fig a7 appendix a lagergren et al 2008 the improvements made to the model can present opportunities for more detailed studies of forest ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration at large spatial scales allowing for better assessments of policy relevant forest based mitigation strategies over long timescales 5 conclusions lpj guess with an operational forest management module is useful for studying the long term influence of changed climate conditions on managed forest ecosystems and predict the direction of ecosystem responses to large scale changes in forest management regimes the new species specific parameters presented herein are suitable for application to simulate norway spruce and scots pine in monocultures but are not intended for simulation of potential natural vegetation lpj guess is in its current form limited in fully accounting for differences in site quality at the scale of individual forest stands the results highlight the potential to further incorporate additional characteristics of site quality which could benefit model accuracy including further tuning of species specific parameters at the site scale further analysis of the influence of specific soil parameters on forest growth could provide valuable insight into the role of the soil in stand growth additional model development to better capture local conditions could include a more detailed description of soil layers and associated effects on nutrient storage soil water freezing and thawing the movement of water

24245,incorporation of a forest management module in the dynamic vegetation model lpj guess has allowed the study and predictions of management treatment effects on the carbon cycle and on forest ecosystem structure in this study lpj guess is evaluated at the regional scale against observational data from the swedish national forest inventory simulated standing volume is compared against observations for the four most common forest types in the country furthermore eddy covariance flux measurements from the integrated carbon observation system icos are used to evaluate model predictions of net ecosystem exchange nee gross primary productivity gpp and ecosystem respiration reco at the site scale the model results suggest an adequate representation of standing volume in monocultures of norway spruce and scots pine for regional simulations in southern and central sweden after an updated parameterization of the species for northern sweden the standing volume in norway spruce monocultures was overestimated with the updated parameter values at the stand scale the model produced mixed results for carbon fluxes when evaluated against eddy covariance data for two sites one in central and one in southern sweden the interannual variation of gpp was well captured for the central swedish site but the modelled average gpp for the period 2015 2019 was overestimated by 9 for the southern swedish site gpp was underestimated by 15 for the corresponding period and the simulated interannual variation was half of the observed the seasonal estimates of modelled net ecosystem exchange nee deviated from observations and the simulated standing volume was underestimated by 25 for both sites the results highlight further potential to perform species specific calibration to capture latitudinal gradients in key ecosystem properties and to incorporate additional characteristics of site quality which could benefit model accuracy at the scale of individual

harris et al 2021 the sequestration of carbon by forests is a vital ecosystem service providing mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions and a reduction of the magnitude of harmful effects of changes to the climate of the earth ipbes 2019 the sequestration potential of forest ecosystems depends on multiple environmental factors including climate soil and topography previous patterns of disturbance

10 of the total global share of produced timber and pulp barklund et al 2009 commonly applied at regional to global scales dynamic vegetation models dvms are useful tools for large scale studies of the carbon cycle and for predicting the response of vegetation to changing climate conditions dvms are built from the theoretical understanding of how plants function and explicitly model vital aspects of a terrestrial ecosystem to project vegetation structure and functioning from climate and soil input data recent model development in lpj guess has allowed for projections of the effects of management treatments on the carbon cycle and on ecosystem service provisioning lindeskog et al 2021 lagergren and jönsson 2017 accounting for forest management is especially relevant for studies of forest ecosystems that bear little resemblance to unmanaged natural forests in the same location knowledge of disturbance and management history is important for simulating observed vegetation structure and for the accurate recreation of carbon and nitrogen content in the soil in forestry enabled dvms lindeskog et al 2021 the simulated fluxes of carbon nitrogen and water depend on the ecosystem composition which is influenced by management treatments such as thinning clear felling or fertilization thinning for example controls the extent of competition between individuals and reduces natural mortality which in turn affects processes such as photosynthesis and heterotrophic respiration which over long timescales can have major implications for the carbon balance lindeskog

technique are available for a multitude of sites in europe through icos ri integrated carbon observations system research infrastructure heiskanen et al 2021 while providing high quality observational data ec sites represent a local measurement heavily influenced by the site conditions of the forest stand in closest proximity to the point of measurement for this reason bottom up methods to scale up measured nee from the stand to the regional level are challenging and dependent on a modeling approach and such studies are rare but see chi et al 2019 desai et al 2007 measurements of forest

long time series of observational data exist describing the state and change of forest ecosystems at the national scale fridman et al 2014 using nfi data lagergren et al 2012 evaluated the forestry enabled dvm lpj guess at the national scale of sweden and found an overestimation of simulated standing volume in southern sweden lindeskog et al 2021 evaluated the module for forest management at the scale of europe showing that simulated biomass and annual increment compares favorably against observational data improved simulation of stand growth and development for forests consisting of monocultures and species mixtures could provide the possibility of more detailed assessments of regulating ecosystem services related to carbon sequestration or of provisioning ecosystem services related to timber pulp and bioenergy here we update the forestry enabled dynamic vegetation model lpj guess with revised parameter settings for the two commercially most important tree species in swedish forestry scots pine pinus sylvestris l and norway spruce picea abies l karst at the regional scale the mean standing volume is evaluated for 20 year age classes representing the average forest state during different stages of growth and development for 1996 2015 in sweden birch betula l is evaluated in mixtures with norway spruce the approach captures the influence of climate conditions and forest management on volume development for the above mentioned species both in monocultures and in mixtures as well as stand growth development in monocultures additionally the model is evaluated at the stand scale against ec data to assess model capacity to simulate carbon fluxes and associated interannual variation an evaluation of forest stand variables at the stand scale is also included

dynamic vegetation model dvm with a process based representation of ecosystem function and vegetation structure smith et al 2001 2014 the model incorporates a detailed description of the exchange of carbon and water between the atmosphere and the biosphere ahlström et al 2012 and of nitrogen cycling smith et al 2014 terrestrial vegetation is simulated in dynamic response to input of external climate data fig 1 the plant physiological processes of photosynthesis respiration stomatal regulation and phenological development are simulated at a daily time step within the ecosystem soil hydrology and plant water uptake is modelled using a two layer soil profile lpj guess includes dynamic cycling of nitrogen and soil carbon based on the century model parton et al 1993 soil nitrogen build up results from mineralization of litter from biological nitrogen fixation estimated based on modelled evapotranspiration rates and from nitrogen deposition mineralization and nitrogen fixation are represented as internal model functions described in smith et al 2014 and nitrogen deposition is determined from an external dataset the model requires a spin up period of 500 years where the soil carbon nitrogen and ecosystem vegetation gradually build up from bare land vegetation is simulated for cohorts of different plant functional types pfts within patches where competition for resources

forcing data 2 2 1 regional simulations climate soil mean monthly values for temperature precipitation short wave radiation and annual values for carbon dioxide concentration were used to drive the model for regional simulations the climate variables originated from the cruncep version 7 forcing dataset viovy 2018 and co2 concentration data from the global carbon project le quéré et al 2018 detrended climate data for 1901 1930 were repeatedly cycled to build up pools of soil carbon and nitrogen over the course of the spin up period with the co2 value for 1901 representing pre industrial atmospheric concentrations a pre industrial value for nitrogen deposition was used during model spin up corresponding to 2 kg n ha 1 year 1 annual values for co2 were prescribed as input during the historical 1901 2015 period for regional simulations and for 1901 2020 for local simulations monthly values of nitrogen deposition at 10 year intervals were used as input based on lamarque et al 2011 during 1850 2009 we assumed similar nitrogen deposition rates post 2009 as of 2000 2009 the gridded climate data had a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 new soil types were created to represent the four most common forest soils throughout the country table 1 these were determined from a data set received from the swedish forest soil inventory sfsi consisting of 6621 sample sites across productive forest land the field data had been collected during the period 2003 2012 from permanent sample plots for the four soil types the fractions of sand silt and clay were determined from the classification scheme of albert atterberg tupek et al 2016 because lpj guess does not include simulation of mineral fractions coarser than sand fractions representing gravel stones and boulders were added to the sand fraction additional parameters such as soil water holding capacity hmax percolation rate k and soil thermal properties were calculated from these fractions based on haxeltine and prentice 1996 to enable model simulations table 1 2 2 2 stand scale simulations instrumentation data processing to enable model simulations for the sites norunda in central sweden 60ᵒ05 n 17ᵒ29 e 45 m asl and hyltemossa in southern sweden 56 06 n 13 25 e 115 m asl site specific meteorological data were received from the two icos integrated carbon observation system heiskanen et al 2021 stations fig 1 the variables included daily values of measured precipitation temperature shortwave radiation soil temperature and soil water content and originated from the warm winter 2020 ecosystem datasets heliasz et al 2022 mölder et al 2022 the site norunda is situated in the boreonemoral zone and experiences a mean annual temperature of 7 1 ᵒc and precipitation of 565 mm per year period 1990 2020 smhi station uppsala the site hyltemossa is located in the nemoral zone in the county of skåne with a mean annual temperature of 8 1 ᵒc and precipitation of 786 mm per year climate period 1991 2020 smhi stations klippan and hörby the eddy covariance tower in norunda is located in the center of a mixed coniferous forest stand the stand consists mainly of scots pine pinus sylvestris 58 of basal area and norway spruce picea abies 38 of basal area with dominant trees reaching heights of 30 m lindroth et al 2020 the mean leaf area index lai for 2019 was 2 8 m2 m 2 mölder et al 2021 the forest soil classified as a dystric regosol is a stony glacial till with a relatively high proportion of clay and silt lundin et al 1999 the soil contains a large amount of gravel and boulders and the fine material content of the soil 2 mm is about 30 the forest within the ec tower footprint of hyltemossa consists of an even aged norway spruce monoculture sparsely admixed with downy birch betula pubescens stand height in 2017 was 14 6 m with a mean leaf area index in 2019 of 4 4 m2 m 2 heliasz et al 2021 the norway spruce stand was established in 1983 and thinned in 2009 and 2013 the site index is estimated to 36 0 m at 100 years the soil is classified as a sandy silty glacial till with a shallow organic layer for the stand scale simulations monthly data originating from the cru ncep dataset from the gridcell containing the site were first bias corrected based on the averaged differences with the monthly averaged meteorological data from the sites over the overlapping period 1995 2013 for hyltemossa and 1995 2010 for norunda the bias corrected data were then used during the model spin up phase and the historical period up until 1994 thereafter the meteorological data from smhi weather stations in proximity to the two sites were applied directly enabling a gradual transition from the spin up and historical periods covering the years 1995 2013 for hyltemossa and 1995 2010 for norunda weather data from different stations were combined because of a lack of a complete dataset for the entire transition phase weather data for the 1995 2013 transition period of hyltemossa originated from the nearby munka ljungby and klippan weather stations for precipitation and from backåkra and munka ljungby for air temperature the dataset for the 1995 2010 transition period of norunda included temperature from uppsala airport and dannemora weather station and precipitation from harbo drälinge and vattholma meteorological data from the stations were used from 2011 for norunda and 2014 for hyltemossa covering the evaluation period 2015 2019 2 3 forest observational data for comparison with simulations at the regional scale data from the swedish national forest inventory snfi were obtained via the interactive tool taxwebb snfi 2021b the data consisted of quality controlled measurements of standing volume classified in four forest types for productive forest land in sweden norway spruce monoculture scots pine monoculture mixed norway spruce scots pine forest mixed norway spruce birch forest other forest types such as those containing nemoral broadleaves were excluded from the study the standing volume was received in 20 year age classes for each forest type for each of the 20 counties included in this study the youngest age class 0 20 years only included measured trees above a height of 1 3 m the uncertainty of the standing volume estimates provided by the snfi varies between 2 and 15 at the scale of individual counties snfi 2016 data were also received for the area cover of each age class within the counties the county level estimates of standing volume were weighted by forest area of the age class in each county enabling the calculation of mean standing volume for each of the three regions of sweden the mean observed standing volume used to evaluate model results represents the average forest state during the period 1996 to 2015 for each age class and region fig 1 a weighted standard deviation was calculated to indicate the variation in standing volume among the counties of a region for a given age class 1 s d w i 1 n w i x i x w 2 n 1 i 1 n w i n where w i is the forest area based weight for the ith county x i is the non weighted mean standing volume of the ith county x w is the weighted mean standing volume and n is the number of non zero weights 2 4 eddy covariance ec data for comparison with simulations at the stand scale model simulations for hyltemossa and norunda were validated with monthly and yearly values of net ecosystem exchange nee for the years 2015 to 2019 partitioned into the components of gross primary production gpp and total ecosystem respiration reco the datasets originate from the warm winter 2020 ecosystem eddy covariance flux product and were processed and quality controlled following the icos protocols sabbatini et al 2018 compliant with the fluxnet2015 release https fluxnet fluxdata org heliasz et al 2022 mölder et al 2022 evaluation data for stand variables originated from the icos l2 ecosystem datasets mölder et al 2021 heliasz et al 2021 two methods exist for calculating the components of gpp and reco from nee the nighttime method nt models reco from nighttime nee data based on its relationship to temperature the reco model is then extrapolated to daytime and gpp is derived as the difference between measured nee and modelled reco reichstein et al 2005 the daytime method dt models gpp and reco from measured nee where the gpp component is derived with a light response curve which includes the limiting effect of vapor pressure deficit during daytime the reco component is then modelled based on air temperature in a similar manner to the nighttime method lasslop et al 2010 the ecosystem model lpj guess models gpp based on a mechanistic description of photosynthesis during daytime which shares more resemblance with the approach of the daytime method compared to the nighttime method we therefore present the simulation results of annual and monthly carbon fluxes at the stand scale with a comparison against observational dt data for comparison of methods annual carbon fluxes are presented also for nt appendix a fig a7 the ec data used in this study were measured and analyzed by icos who have developed a standardized approach for post processing of raw data franz et al 2018 the approach ensures comparability of each dataset to other ec sites and provides a comprehensive quality control qa qc with an assessment of the uncertainty which arises during the measurement and post processing steps heiskanen et al 2021 franz et al 2018 one of the main contributions to ec data uncertainty is associated with the correct estimation of the threshold for friction velocity u the threshold value varies with site season and year and indicates a boundary below which measurement data of nighttime ecosystem respiration should be discarded due to low turbulent mixing wutzler et al 2018 filtering of data based on different values for friction velocity ultimately results in an assessment of the range of uncertainty for a time series of nee gpp and reco the method is fully discussed in pastorello et al 2020 the uncertainty in the data is indicated by the 16th and the 86th percentiles of the threshold values of u we visualized the uncertainty as an overlay for monthly nee in fig 3 for monthly gpp and reco in fig 4 for annual nee gpp and reco in fig 5 and for annual gpp and reco in fig a7 the micrometeorological sign convention for ecosystem fluxes is used in this study where a positive sign denotes a flow towards the atmosphere and a negative sign a flow towards the ground the datasets cover years representative of the climate normal period 1991 2020 this includes the drought year 2018 when large parts of scandinavia and the baltic was affected by a drought during the summer lindroth et al 2020 2 5 model setup of simulations 2 5 1 regional scale simulations we applied the forest management module of lpj guess version 4 0 within each of the three main regions of sweden southern central and northern fig 1 with the aim to simulate the standing volume in monocultural and mixed species stands formed by the main tree species norway spruce picea abies l karst scots pine pinus sylvestris l and birch betula l which together represent 92 2 of standing volume across productive forest land snfi 2021a monoculture stands were simulated for norway spruce and scots pine mixed stands were formed by norway spruce and downy birch betula pubescens ehrh and mixed coniferous stands by norway spruce and scots pine the simulations covered 194 gridcells capturing the 20 counties of mainland sweden the island of gotland was omitted the number of patches per forest stand was set to 12 gridcells situated above the treeline i e within alpine environments were excluded fig 1 stochastic mortality events were turned off after introduction of management to generate simulations representing the best case scenario for each given region lpj guess generates a forest ecosystem in equilibrium with the climate at the end of a 500 year long spin up period during which carbon and nutrients in the soil gradually are built up the establishment of managed forest types was initiated at different years during the 19th century by simulating clear felling and plantation of forest stands resulting in stands of different ages in the landscape during the period of evaluation we evaluated the simulated standing volume against the observed for the mean state of the forest during 1996 2015 for each age class five age classes were included for southern and central sweden for monocultures and mixed coniferous forest 0 20 21 40 41 60 61 80 81 100 years an additional age class 101 120 years was included for northern sweden as stand rotations are longer within the colder northern climate birch is often found with norway spruce within a mixture during early to mid rotation and was therefore represented by three age classes for southern and central sweden and four in northern sweden hynynen et al 2009 the applied forest management treatments represented even aged management which has characterized forest management during the 20th century in sweden table 2 for the mixed stands a selective cutting function was set to thin the stands every 12 to 20 years to retain an equal balance of the woody biomass of each of the two species within the mix for all but the two youngest age classes lindeskog et al 2021 as a consequence the strength of the thinning varied across age classes and gridcells and the removals are therefore not included in table 2 2 5 2 stand scale simulations the simulated forest management of both sites aimed to recreate a forest stand representative of current site conditions 2015 2019 based on the available knowledge regarding the history of stand management a mixed scots pine and norway spruce stand was simulated at the norunda site by initiating planting at the year 1900 following a clearcut of previously unmanaged forest table 2 very little is known regarding the stand management at norunda during the early 20th century we assumed the planting density was lower than in contemporary forestry since no formal law for mandatory regeneration had been passed at the time ekelund and hamilton 2001 p 37 one pre commercial thinning and two regular thinnings were assumed at given intervals as well as a known thinning which occurred in 2008 removing about 15 of the volume lindroth et al 2018 a till like soil type dominated by sand was used for the norunda site to represent a very high content of coarse material in the soil lundin et al 1999 as indicated by available stand management information the norway spruce monoculture was initiated in hyltemossa through planting of 3300 stems ha 1 in 1983 followed by pre commercial thinning in 1998 and a thinning in 2010 table 2 we assumed one previous rotation had occurred before the current stand was planted a till like sandy soil with high silt content was used for hyltemossa 2 6 sensitivity analysis and improvement of parameters a sensitivity analysis was performed to test the influence of the four key parameters turnover sap k latosa sla and cton sap on the modelled standing volume of norway spruce and scots pine the parameter turnover sap regulates the proportion of sapwood converted into heartwood influencing the tree carbon accumulation and respiratory losses zaehle et al 2005 the carbon to nitrogen ratio of the sapwood is determined by the parameter cton sap which influences autotrophic respiration by modifying the nitrogen content of the sapwood smith et al 2014 the parameter k latosa determines the proportion of carbon allocated to leaf and stem biomass zaehle et al 2005 the ratio between leaf area and leaf dry biomass is influenced by the parameter sla wramneby et al 2008 settings for the two parameters rootdist and leaflong were also changed but were not included within the sensitivity analysis as their settings are less uncertain the analysis was performed to determine if the species specific settings could improve model projections of standing volume tables a1 a2 appendix a the simulations represented monocultures at the landscape scale simulating their different age classes within one gridcell in örebro county situated in the boreonemoral zone in central sweden fig 1 model climate data input was the same as specified in 2 2 1 representing the grid cell average climate during the period of forest growth landscape averages for standing volume derived from the snfi data for both scots pine and norway spruce monocultural forest types were used for evaluating simulated standing volume during the analysis 3 of the above mentioned parameters were kept at their original setting while the 4th was changed to determine the relative influence of the parameter on simulated standing volume the sensitivity analysis resulted in 21 simulations for each species tables a1 a2 appendix a the sensitivity analysis indicated that region specific parameter settings would generate closer to observed volume estimates new parameters called opt were therefore identified used and evaluated along with the original parameters for scots pine and norway spruce for the three main regions table 3 according to mencuccini and grace 1995 the leaf to sapwood area ratio k latosa should increase with increasing latitude for this reason k latosa was raised slightly for northern sweden and lowered slightly for southern sweden additional specifications and motivations for changed parameter settings are presented in appendix a results below of simulated standing volume with the new parameters are denoted opt and results with the original estimates are referred to as orig these simulations were based solely on the till like fine sand soil type which here represents the most common soil for all regions of sweden table 1 the optimized model parameters opt were also used within the simulations for norunda and hyltemossa in order to generate stand variables fluxes of gross primary productivity gpp net ecosystem exchange nee and ecosystem respiration reco model runs with differing soil input information were aggregated into mean standing volume within simulations denoted optw these represent forest established on a wider range of soils differing in soil water holding capacity and percolation rate within each gridcell table 1 a comparison of the relative contribution of individual soil types to the weighted standing volume of simulation optw is presented in fig a1 appendix a this simulation was performed for a monocultural stand of norway spruce in örebro county with identical management settings as in the sensitivity analysis above for the simulations at the regional scale we assumed that scots pine was established primarily on sandy soils heiskanen and makitalo 2002 while downy birch and norway spruce were assumed to be primarily established on sandy to silty tills heiskanen et al 2016 hynynen et al 2009 we also assumed that the soil types were evenly distributed in the same proportions across all gridcells of sweden for a given forest type table a3 appendix a 2 7 sensitivity analysis and improvement of parameters simulated output data were analyzed using the software excel microsoft 2019 and matlab r2020b mathworks inc modelled stem wood biomass kg c m 2 was transformed to stem wood volume m3 ha 1 through application of biomass expansion factors befs using a constant carbon to dry matter fraction 0 51 kg c per kg dry matter for conifers and 0 48 kg c per kg dry matter for broadleaves aalde et al 2006 the stem volume was derived from befs for different age classes lehtonen et al 2004 an approach suitable for application of tree species in the boreal zone as constant biomass expansion factors may lead to biased results petersson et al 2012 the resulting volume given for each age class and species was derived for each of the 20 mainland counties of sweden fig 1 values for standing volume for each of the three study regions were then calculated as a weighted mean where counties with larger forested area within a region contributed more to the overall estimate in the same manner as described above for the observational data a weighted standard deviation was calculated for each age class to indicate the variation in standing volume within a region according to eq 1 this method allowed for a direct comparison of simulated standing volume against observed alternative methods such as a comparison of the net simulated periodic increment against the observed for each region would rely on further calculations introducing additional uncertainty into the analysis mean annual increment mai was calculated as the total stand production divided by the stand age the periodic annual increment pai was calculated as the net change in standing volume from a given point during the simulation to the next divided by the number of years between the points removed biomass from thinnings and natural mortality during the period was included in the estimate for both mai and pai model output for carbon fluxes were transformed from daily to monthly and annual values and were analyzed to determine the deviation from eddy covariance data by calculating the root mean square deviation rmsd kobayashi and salam 2000 the interannual variation was calculated as the standard deviation of the annual values of the studied period 2015 2019 for each site 3 results 3 1 sensitivity analysis and improvement of parameters any change in one of the assessed parameters had an influence on the simulated standing volume for both species a stepwise increase in the parameter k latosa reduced simulated volume while an increase in sla turnover sap or cton sap relative to the original setting caused an increase in vegetation carbon and biomass over time tables a1 and a2 the original model parameters showed large deviations for both scots pine and norway spruce when simulated standing volume was compared to observed for örebro county this motivated a need to increase accumulated biomass for norway spruce and decrease it for scots pine as a consequence an increase in any of the three parameters turnover sap sla or cton sap reduced the negative bias in standing volume compared to nfi data for örebro county for norway spruce table a2 for scots pine a reduction in turnover sap combined with increased values for k latosa reduced the positive bias table a1 the new parameter sets opt aimed to improve the species specific settings table 3 the mean annual increment mai of the norway spruce monoculture forest simulated in örebro using the updated parameter set opt showed a consistent increase over the studied period fig 2 similarly the scots pine monoculture simulated using the opt parameters indicated no clear peak of the mai over the course of the simulation fig 2 3 2 evaluation of simulated standing volume for the three regions of sweden 3 2 1 scots pine monoculture the original parameterization orig overestimated the standing volume of scots pine compared to the nfi data for all three regions table 4 the new parameterization opt and optw improved the overall accuracy most noticeably for the four oldest age classes in southern and central sweden table 4 the volume estimates with soil type representation optw and average soil type opt differed by less than 5 m3 ha 1 for northern and central sweden and less than 10 m3 ha 1 for southern sweden the orig setting produced age class specific estimates ranging from 22 to 315 m3 ha 1 for northern sweden table 4 with an overall positive bias of 63 optw and opt showing similar results had a bias of 31 and 30 respectively in central sweden orig had a positive bias of 21 opt 4 and optw 2 in southern sweden standing volume for orig varied from 58 to 316 m3 ha 1 while optw and opt ranged from 61 to 269 m3 ha 1 both optw and opt displayed a major improvement for age classes 21 40 41 60 and 61 80 overall positive bias was 13 for opt 9 for optw and 26 for orig 3 2 2 norway spruce monoculture simulations with the original setting orig underestimated volume for all three regions compared to the nfi data except for the youngest age class in southern sweden table 5 the opt and optw settings improved model results for central and southern sweden but the model overestimated standing volume for northern sweden in comparison to nfi data both opt and optw settings produced similar results for standing volume for the three regions differing by less than 5 m3 ha 1 in northern sweden and by less than 10 m3 ha 1 for central and southern sweden table 5 in northern sweden the bias was 21 for orig whereas the bias for opt was 33 and for optw 36 in central sweden the model results deviated only slightly for opt and for optw compared to the observational data for all age classes bias for opt was 2 and 0 2 for optw whereas orig underestimated standing volume for four out of five age classes table 5 results for orig in southern sweden had a bias of 51 bias for opt in southern sweden was 5 and for optw 4 table 5 3 2 3 mixed coniferous forest the orig setting for mixed coniferous forest was relatively well constrained for all three studied regions whereas opt and optw displayed a stronger positive bias in relation to the nfi data table 6 opt and optw generated similar results differing by 5 m3 ha 1 in northern sweden less than 5 m3 ha 1 in central sweden and less than 10 m3 ha 1 in southern sweden the orig setting in northern sweden ranged from 20 to 267 m3 ha 1 table 6 indicating a positive bias of 20 compared to the nfi data opt and optw in northern sweden had a positive bias of 41 and 43 respectively in central sweden orig had a negative bias of 11 which was reduced to 4 for southern sweden in central sweden opt ranged from 45 to 354 m3 ha 1 and had a positive bias of 24 whereas optw ranged from 45 to 352 m3 ha 1 with a positive bias of 23 opt and optw deviated strongly also from the nfi data in southern sweden by 31 and 29 respectively 3 2 4 mixed forest the original model parameters for mixed forest displayed agreement with the observational data for all studied regions opt and optw differed by 5 m3 ha 1 in northern sweden and central sweden and less than 10 m3 ha 1 in southern sweden table 7 in northern sweden orig deviated by 6 from the nfi data whereas opt deviated by 15 and optw by 16 the model accuracy was reduced for orig in central sweden with a bias of 13 compared to the nfi data whereas opt and optw improved the results bias of 5 and 3 respectively the orig setting agreed with the observational data regarding standing volume for southern sweden with a bias of 4 table 7 whereas opt and optw deviated more strongly with a bias of 40 and 38 respectively 3 3 evaluation of stand scale simulations 3 3 1 evaluation of simulated forest structure variables for norunda both height and diameter were relatively well captured for norway spruce within the mixed stand using the opt parameters but the density was underestimated the total simulated volume was 25 lower than observed primarily as a result of a low simulated height and diameter of scots pine table 8 this result indicates a discrepancy between the simulated productive capacity of scots pine calibrated at the regional scale for central sweden opt and the observed productive capacity for the species at the norunda site the simulated mean annual increment mai remained even but showed a tendency towards culmination 110 years after establishment fig a2 appendix a the simulated standing volume in the norway spruce monoculture in hyltemossa was 25 lower than the observed the simulated mai of the stand did not culminate within the period of study displaying a growth trend similar to observed for monocultures of norway spruce in southern sweden on sites of high quality fig a2 appendix a the high planting density caused competition within the simulated stand and elicited self thinning which offset the increase in standing volume over time by 2017 94 m3 of stemwood volume had been lost to natural mortality excluding thinnings in addition the simulated leaf area index was underestimated by 2 m2 m 2 resulting in a lower light use within the simulated stand which limited carbon sequestration and growth table 8 3 3 2 evaluation of simulated carbon fluxes net ecosystem exchange norunda norunda was observed to be a source of carbon for all years with an average net flux of 343 g c m 2 year 1 for the 2015 2019 period hereafter referred to as period average carbon emissions ranged from 259 g c m 2 in 2019 to 483 g c m 2 in 2016 presenting a total range of 224 g c m 2 year 1 for the studied period with an interannual variation of 91 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 for all years the site was a carbon sink in spring and the uptake was offset by high respiration during summer and autumn months fig 3 lpj guess forced with station based climate data simulated an average modelled net carbon flux of 103 g c m 2 year 1 for 2015 2019 with a range for the studied period of 280 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 the modelled interannual variation was 106 g c m 2 year 1 the modelled nee broadly agreed with the observed during spring months but the model overestimated carbon uptake during summers fig 3 leading to higher rmsd values fig 6 in 2018 the annual precipitation dropped to 456 mm which was 19 lower compared to the value for the climate normal period 1990 2020 565 mm year 1 the mean air temperature for the summer was 17 9 ᵒc whereas the period average for 2015 2019 was 16 1 ᵒc fig a4 appendix a lpj guess correctly estimated nee in 2018 as positive but underestimated its magnitude fig 5 net ecosystem exchange hyltemossa hyltemossa had an observed average annual net carbon flux of 175 g c m 2 which varied from 363 g c m 2 year 1 2017 to 13 g c m 2 year 1 2019 a range of 349 g c m 2 year 1 over the studied period with an interannual variation of 144 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 for three out of the six years the sink strength of the ecosystem was larger in spring mam than in summer jja fig 3 both spring and summer seasons displayed a net carbon uptake with the exception of the summer of 2019 when the norway spruce forest stand was a carbon source for jja releasing 77 g c m 2 fig 3 the period average nee was not accurately captured by lpj guess simulated as 19 g c m 2 year 1 individual years ranged from 143 g c m 2 year 1 2016 to 106 g c m 2 year 1 2015 presenting a simulated interannual variation of 93 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 stand observations indicated that photosynthesis started earlier during the years than in the modelled stand modelled nee in february was positive for all years whereas a net carbon uptake was commonly observed for this month for the studied period fig 3 gross primary production ecosystem respiration norunda the observed average gross primary production for the norunda site 2015 2019 was 1310 g c m 2 year 1 and varied from 1138 g c m 2 year 1 2017 to 1448 g c m 2 year 1 2015 fig 5 a range of 310 g c m 2 year 1 the interannual variation was 131 g c m 2 year 1 average reco for the corresponding period was 1514 g c m 2 year 1 with a between year variation of 168 g c m 2 year 1 ranging from 1333 g c m 2 year 1 2017 to 1753 g c m 2 year 1 a total range of 420 g c m 2 year 1 2016 model results for gross primary production were close to observed for norunda fig 4 the simulated period average gpp was 1423 g c m 2 year 1 on average 9 higher than observed and varied between 1304 g c m 2 year 1 2018 and 1583 g c m 2 year 1 2015 presenting a range for the period of 279 g c m 2 year 1 the interannual variation was 110 g c m 2 year 1 the ratio of modelled npp to gpp was on average 0 25 and varied from 0 17 2018 to 0 31 2019 modelled reco period average was 1416 g c m 2 year 1 6 below the observed average and ranged from 1298 g c m 2 year 1 2016 to 1540 g c m 2 year 1 2015 a range of 242 g c m 2 year 1 the modelled between year variation was 110 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 the modelled soil water content swc in the top 50 cm soil layer broadly agreed with the observed during summers and autumns of most years fig a3 appendix a modelled reco peaked in late july 2018 as a result of a sudden increase in soil water content following a period of drought inconsistent with the trends within the observational data fig 4 gross primary production ecosystem respiration hyltemossa the observed gpp was on average 1804 g c m 2 year 1 2015 2019 and varied from 1517 g c m 2 year 1 2018 to 1994 g c m 2 year 1 2017 a range of 477 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 the between year variation was 198 g c m 2 year 1 reco was on average 1591 g c m 2 year 1 2015 2019 and varied between 1352 g c m 2 year 1 2018 to 1850 g c m 2 year 1 2019 a range of 498 g c m 2 year 1 with an interannual variation of 195 g c m 2 year 1 the modelled gpp period average was 1525 g c m 2 year 1 which was 15 below the observed gpp period average and varied from 1371 g c m 2 year 1 2018 to 1625 g c m 2 year 1 2016 a range of 219 g c m 2 year 1 fig 5 the modelled interannual variation was 103 g c m 2 year 1 the ratio of npp to gpp was 0 41 for the period 2015 2019 varying from 0 36 2018 to 0 45 2019 the range of annual flux values within the observational data for gpp and reco were larger for hyltemossa than for norunda over the observed period fig 5 the modelled period average reco was 1506 g c m 2 year 1 with a range of 377 g c m 2 for the studied period simulated reco was 5 lower than observed for the studied period and varied from 1320 g c m 2 in 2018 to 1697 g c m 2 in 2015 presenting an interannual variation of 134 g c m 2 year 1 the model accurately captured the reduction in reco during 2018 with a negative bias of 2 for this year fig 4 4 discussion 4 1 general overview this study provided an evaluation of the dvm lpj guess for managed forests in the nemoral and boreal zones of sweden an updated parameterization of norway spruce and scots pine based on data from central sweden generated regional averages of standing volume in monocultures in southern and central sweden that were closer to observed values the new parameters did however not work well for northern sweden or for mixed stands the regional scale evaluation was complemented by an assessment of the model s capacity to simulate the structure of two forest stands and associated interannual variation of carbon fluxes simulated annual values of nee were outside of the range of uncertainty presented in the ec data indicating a mismatch in the representation of site specific conditions the model produced acceptable predictions of the magnitude of gpp for norunda but underestimated gpp for hyltemossa fig 5 disagreement between observed and simulated stand variables further suggest potential for additional tuning and site specific configuration to account for differences in site quality at the stand scale 4 2 model application at the regional scale 4 2 1 northern sweden with the new parameters opt the model became better suited for application at the regional scale in southern and central sweden representing monocultures for age classes relevant to commercial forestry where stand rotations do not commonly exceed 100 years for scots pine and norway spruce the simulations of conifers in northern sweden were however not representative of the average regional standing volume in monocultures or mixed coniferous stands several aspects may have contributed to the discrepancy in this study we excluded gridcells within alpine regions in northwestern sweden due to the coarse size of a gridcell 50 50 km some portions of low productive forest land may then also have been omitted contributing in part to the overestimation of the simulated standing volume per hectare in comparison with nfi data the sensitivity analysis of the species specific parameters was performed for a county in central sweden however the new parameter settings include a decrease in k latosa with increasing latitude based on evidence from available literature mencuccini and grace 1995 a representative setting for leaflong for northern sweden would likely further improve model results however uncertainty regarding the minimum nitrogen content in older needles prevented an increase of leaflong to the observed 8 to 12 years reich et al 2014 furthermore to have a firm control of the modeling processes this study did not include the simulation of random stand replacing disturbances during the simulation of managed forests commonly set with a return time of 100 to 400 years lindeskog et al 2021 gustafson et al 2021 enabling this setting may provide results closer to observed specifically for regions with extensive forest cover such as northern sweden the tendency to overestimate biomass production at high latitudes may also result from inadequate descriptions of relevant additional processes that inhibit tree growth these could include a limiting effect of cold conditions on the synthesis of wood or a simulated loss of carbon representing the exchange of carbohydrates for the uptake of nitrogen through mycorrhizal symbiosis as well as an inhibition of water uptake due to frozen soils in spring and autumn months gustafson et al 2021 4 2 2 the influence of changed soil conditions accounting for variation in soil type optw had limited influence on the simulated standing volume for a forest type within the landscape as optw outputs resembled those from opt for all studied regions regarding estimated standing volume the comparison of simulations to highlight the influence of soil type on standing volume indicated that greater proportions of finer grain size material within a soil increases standing volume fig a1 appendix 1 the small difference between the till like fine sand and till like coarse sand soil type may possibly be explained by their similar water holding capacity table 1 determining the influence of individual soil parameters on biomass growth and structure within additional analyses in future studies could provide further valuable information on the influence of soil hydrology on forest growth and productivity the relative contribution of each soil type to the generated standing volume in optw did also depend on the assumptions made regarding their proportion within a gridcell for these simulations table a3 the assumed proportions were largely based on the site requirements of each tree species and the silvicultural recommendations of establishing scots pine on soils with higher sand content compared to norway spruce the small variations in productivity among the two model simulations opt and optw however imply a robustness when accounting for only one dominating soil type across a grid when the objective is to adequately represent a regional average standing volume apart from both climate and soil texture soil nutrient content soil depth and the movement of groundwater also influence growth and productivity within a stand skovsgaard and vanclay 2013 bergh et al 2005 significant variations in site productivity can exist for the same type of soil norway spruce established on a till dominated by fine sand has an estimated site index varying from 30 0 m to 38 0 m at 100 years at the research site tönnersjöheden in southern sweden johansson pers comm our modeling approach relying on variation in soil texture and climate is therefore not sufficient for capturing the variation in site conditions for individual forest stands additional model development adding processes and parameter settings for aspects which further influence productivity would be needed to account for differences in site quality such aspects could include variations in soil depth among sites or additional soil layers lasota et al 2016 bergh et al 2005 however the benefit of adding functionality to the model needs to be considered in relation to the uncertainty introduced by additional parameters and equations which may influence the robustness of the model wramneby et al 2008 4 2 3 age related aspects the standing volume was overestimated for the two oldest age classes by opt and optw compared with the nfi data for all three regions for the norway spruce monoculture forest type however the development of the simulated mai for norway spruce established in a monoculture in örebro county displayed a similar trend as described for stands of norway spruce in the southern boreal zone in sweden indicating a representative stand development over time bergh et al 2005 within commercial forestry older forest stands are commonly situated on soils with low inherent productive capacity whereas stands situated on fertile soils generally have a shorter rotation period bergh et al 2005 roberge et al 2016 high yielding forest stands are therefore less likely to contribute to the regional volume estimate for higher age classes we did not account for this in our model simulations the estimated volume for the youngest age class deviated from the observed both within monocultures and mixed forest types for several regions the modelled plants have a height of 2 m and are initiated directly after clear cut which we consider the main cause for the overestimation of standing volume for this age class furthermore the stand regeneration phase is associated with some challenges which are currently not included in the model such as failed regeneration due to browsing frost damage to buds or damage due to pathogens such as the pine weevil bergqvist et al 2014 wallertz and petersson 2011 holmström et al 2018 gustafson et al 2021 incorporation of these growth reducing factors and alteration to the tree allometry following planting would improve the representation of forest stands and their growth within the establishment and early growth phase 0 20 years 4 2 4 mixed coniferous forest the model results for the orig setting for mixed birch norway spruce forest matched the observed data relatively well for all regions furthermore the original model parameters generated a standing volume of mixed coniferous forest comparable to observational data for southern and central sweden likely due to a conservative growth response of norway spruce in orig table 5 in combination with a greater than observed growth of scots pine in orig table 4 the new parameterization opt resulted in higher standing volume of mixed coniferous stands at ages above 60 years in comparison to nfi data we checked if this result was due to reduced thinning since the mixed forest was simulated with a setting for variable thinning to maintain an even proportion 50 50 of the carbon biomass of each species within the stands but found no such indications the average removal of volume was similar but slightly below that of pure scots pine for higher age classes and similar to norway spruce for younger age classes the modelled environment is less complex than an actual ecosystem with more distinct characteristics of tree species hou et al 2013 the unexpected overestimation could be attributed to reduced competition within simulated mixed stands with the opt parameterization with modelled species being able to exploit resources more efficiently due to clear differences in functional traits kahmen et al 2006 4 3 model application at the stand scale 4 3 1 forest stand variables the setting opt generated model results for stand variables which were inconsistent with site data with an underestimation of simulated standing volume for both norunda and hyltemossa table 8 our model results indicated an initiation of self thinning due to a high initial stand density for the norway spruce stand at the hyltemossa site which reduced the stand volume increment however the simulated growth was consistent with the observed trend for forest stands of high site productivity in southern sweden fig a2 appendix a the observational data indicated a sustained carbon sequestration and growth in norway spruce even at high stand densities fig a2 appendix a similarly to this study lindeskog et al 2021 modelled the standing volume for norway spruce and beech fagus sylvatica monoculture stands for 16 sites in germany using the lpj guess forest management module the study found representative model results for stands with low standing volume but a negative bias of 50 or more for stands with high standing volume the authors pointed to the possibility of including additional plant physiological processes such as hardening and dehardening as a potential way to account for differences in productivity lindeskog et al 2021 another option apart from the aspects mentioned above concerning soil characteristics and hydrology could be to further tune the two species specific allometric parameters k allom2 and k allom3 smith et al 2001 2014 these parameters influence the mean height and diameter within a stand height k allom2 diameter k allom3 bellassen et al 2010 showed that several forest variables were sensitive to changes in parameter values within similar biomass allometric equations implemented in the orchidee dvm adapted for forest management an initial assessment in our study showed improved estimates of stand height and density of scots pine for the norunda site when optimized against observational data table 8 we decided however not to use site specific calibration of these parameters due to lack of additional independent stand data for validation 4 3 2 norunda carbon fluxes the modelled interannual variation of gpp for 2015 2019 of 110 g c m 2 was similar to the observed value of 131 g c m 2 year 1 for the mixed stand at the norunda site the modelled ratio of npp gpp was on average 0 25 for 2015 2019 and was identical compared to a given estimate for scots pine in the boreal zone at the observed stand height makela and valentine 2001 however the model simulations of nee indicated norunda to be an average sink of 103 g c m 2 year 1 for the period 2015 2019 which disagreed with the observational data showing the site to be a source of 343 g c m 2 year 1 previous empirical studies have suggested soil heterotrophic emissions from the site in the range of 240 g c m 2 yr 1 lagergren et al 2019 soil measurements at the site have indicated low soil nitrogen n content which both restricts stand photosynthesis and increases competition for available n among soil microorganisms the selective decomposition of old soil organic matter by microbes to make additional nitrogen available is therefore considered a plausible main cause for the net co2 emissions from the site shahbaz et al 2022 these aspects not captured by the model may therefore partly explain the discrepancy between simulated and observed reco furthermore the norunda site has been shown to have very large within canopy variability of co2 fluxes during nighttime with strong horizontal and vertical advection occurring during clear summer nights with stable conditions strong advection can lead to either underestimation or overestimation of co2 and therefore influence the estimation of nighttime nee within the observational data feigenwinter et al 2010 the modelled between year variation of nee 106 g c m 2 year 1 was an accurate estimate of the observed within the stand 91 g c m 2 year 1 the interannual variation of the site was slightly higher than in a scots pine stand within a comparable climate in southern finland of 77 g c m 2 suni et al 2003 empirical studies have found old forest stands to be carbon sinks or close to carbon neutral in the boreal zone indicating that the model represents the average net carbon balance of this age class well given the current management settings see below luyssaert et al 2008 4 3 3 hyltemossa carbon fluxes the modelled average nee estimate for 2015 to 2019 was 19 g c m 2 whereas the observed average for the period was 175 g c m 2 for the hyltemossa site the annual modelled estimate of gpp was lower than observed and the modelled lai was reduced causing lower light absorption and interception within the stand an increase of modelled gpp would raise both npp and modelled autotrophic respiration and consequently annual reco which was underestimated for the site by 5 the average ratio of npp to gpp in the norway spruce stand was 0 40 for 2015 2019 which agreed with the ratio of npp gpp for norway spruce within the boreal zone given in harkonen et al 2010 indicating a proportional contribution of the autotrophic respiration component to modelled gpp for the site an increase in modelled gpp to the observed value would result in an accurate estimate of nee assuming this ratio remains constant previous model studies using the forest management module of lpj guess have shown high estimates for modelled soil carbon stocks compared to observations which may cause higher than observed heterotrophic respiration lindeskog et al 2021 in the model simulation for hyltemossa forest management was initiated in 1892 by clear felling to allow for the known occurrence of one completed rotation period of norway spruce forest before the initiation of the current forest stand in 1982 records and maps exist which show established forest in 1938 but the land area had however most likely been managed for a longer period of time o dwyer et al 2021 the accurate recreation of the historical management was important for generating representative soil carbon emissions initializing management in the early 1920s would have transformed the stand to a weaker carbon source due to increased rh data not shown furthermore utilizing the original parameter settings for norway spruce during spin up is important as the new parameters opt are not intended for simulating uneven aged natural forest observational data to enable direct comparisons between modelled and observed rh are currently lacking for hyltemossa such an effort would involve directly measuring the soil emissions within the stand using a closed dynamic system in conjunction with trenching of roots to disentangle the components of autotrophic root respiration and heterotrophic respiration from reco schindlbacher et al 2009 4 4 model uncertainty development lpj guess has been developed with a key aim of modeling natural and managed forest ecosystems at regional to global scales smith et al 2014 the process based modeling approach supports the view of the forest as a complex dynamic system messier et al 2013 and the model can be considered a working hypothesis of forest structure and functioning korzukhin et al 1996 previous lpj guess evaluation studies of forest growth and standing stock in sweden have focused on simulations at the national scale without distinguishing the age classes of specific forest types lagergren et al 2012 we implemented a set of new parameters for the two most common coniferous species in sweden with an evaluation at the regional scale which improved the predictions for monocultures in central and southern sweden the original parameters were intended for simulation of uneven aged potential natural vegetation pnv but the simulation of managed even aged forest landscapes presents new and differing conditions for the competition of light water and nutrients the new optimized parameters have been developed to represent managed forest and are not intended for the simulation of pnv with lpj guess the development of the mai and pai over time both for monocultural forests in örebro fig 2 and for the central and southern swedish sites fig a2 appendix a indicated a growth pattern representative of temperate and boreal forest stands in sweden the increase in standing volume of the norway spruce monoculture at hyltemossa was reduced due to high natural mortality in the stand indicating a potential for further tuning to improve the rate of self thinning for stands experiencing similar conditions in this study 4 model vegetation parameters for norway spruce and scots pine were optimized against county level nfi data using climate data input at the landscape scale an optimization at the landscape scale is less likely to capture the stand level characteristics of each tree species attempts to achieve greater biological realism in model simulations would benefit from additional tuning at the site scale using local climate model data input and representations of site quality including variations in soil depth and the movement of groundwater given that scots pine typically is found on poorer soils in sweden resulting in less productive stands we would expect that an attempt to compensate for this at the landscape scale with changing turnover sap would lead to a negative directional change in turnover sap which is what we also observed within the sensitivity analysis table a1 appendix a we have with the current approach explored the possibility of accounting for differences in site productivity by using different soil types in the simulations but different soils produced similar estimates fig a1 appendix a in general the observational data at the stand scale derived with the daytime method suggested improved model performance compared to observational data based on the nighttime method fig a7 appendix a we have here chosen to present the model results primarily with a comparison to the daytime method due to a greater similarity between the mechanistic modeling of npp in lpj guess based on photosynthesis to the daytime method of lasslop et al 2010 the discrepancy in annual and monthly values between the daytime method and the nighttime method in gpp and reco highlights the fact that the exchange of carbon between the vegetation and the atmosphere is a complex phenomenon fig a7 appendix a lagergren et al 2008 the improvements made to the model can present opportunities for more detailed studies of forest ecosystem services such as carbon sequestration at large spatial scales allowing for better assessments of policy relevant forest based mitigation strategies over long timescales 5 conclusions lpj guess with an operational forest management module is useful for studying the long term influence of changed climate conditions on managed forest ecosystems and predict the direction of ecosystem responses to large scale changes in forest management regimes the new species specific parameters presented herein are suitable for application to simulate norway spruce and scots pine in monocultures but are not intended for simulation of potential natural vegetation lpj guess is in its current form limited in fully accounting for differences in site quality at the scale of individual forest stands the results highlight the potential to further incorporate additional characteristics of site quality which could benefit model accuracy including further tuning of species specific parameters at the site scale further analysis of the influence of specific soil parameters on forest growth could provide valuable insight into the role of the soil in stand growth additional model development to better capture local conditions could include a more detailed description of soil layers and associated effects on nutrient storage soil water freezing and thawing the movement of water

24246,complex collective motion patterns can emerge from very simple local interactions among individual agents however it is still unclear how and why the interactions among individuals lead to the emergence of collective motion modeling is an effective way to understand the mechanisms that govern collective animal motions in this work to avoid imposing fixed sets of rules on collective motion models a priori as classical approaches do we propose a new method of modeling collective motion for fish schooling via multi agent reinforcement learning we model each fish individual as an artificial learning agent whose policy is acquired by using mean field q learning mfq the observation of each fish agent is represented as a multi channel image where each channel describes a different feature such as an agent s position or an agent s orientation the policy of an agent is approximated with a neural network trained with the mfq algorithm during which agents are rewarded or penalized according to the number of neighbors and consecutive collisions between individuals we study the dynamics of collective motion that emerge from the learned policy the experimental results show that the learned policy can produce collective motion in groups of various sizes in addition three different collective motion patterns observed in nature emerged during the training process the learned policy can help us gain new insight into how and why individual interactions lead to collective motion this study also demonstrates that multi agent reinforcement learning has great potential to be a new approach for analysis and modeling of collective motion keywords collective motion collective behavior animal behavior multi agent reinforcement learning reinforcement learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction collective motion is a common and interesting phenomenon in nature it has received considerable attention in theoretical biology ethology cognition and ecology one of the most noticeable characteristics of animal groups is their ability to generate various complex swarming motion patterns extensive research recognizes that collective motion is self organized and mainly results from local interactions between individuals who lack the ability to understand or directly control the collective schaerf et al 2017 modeling is a good way to understand the mechanisms that govern collective animal motions fish are a common model organism for the study of collective motion because they are swarming animals and extremely easy to obtain in the past few decades many collective motion models have been proposed which can be mainly divided into two categories group based models and agent based models group based models kolpas et al 2007 yates et al 2009 bode et al 2010 jhawar et al 2020 jhawar and guttal 2020 are very successful at describing macroscopic properties such as phase transitions and metastable states but they usually ignore the specific interactions among individuals agent based models reynolds 1987 vicsek et al 1995 katz et al 2011 gautrais et al 2012 mwaffo et al 2015 can integrate the detailed properties of an individual into the model when they describe the interactions among individuals the main idea of agent based models is that individuals are reduced to featureless particles the linear velocity of each particle is usually assumed to be constant and its behavior can only be controlled by changing its heading angle the heading angle is affected by a fixed set of rules alignment cohesion and separation the three rules enable individuals in a group to maintain their orientation in the same direction keeping the distance among each other relatively compact while avoiding collisions these rules can be implemented by various models which are mainly divided into two categories self propelled particles spp models couzin et al 2002 ginelli and chaté 2010 hemelrijk and hildenbrandt 2012 vicsek and zafeiris 2012 deutsch et al 2012 and social forces sf models lukeman et al 2010 herbert read et al 2011 hinz and de polavieja 2017 wright et al 2019 shaebani et al 2020 in spp models fish individuals change their motion in response to others according to an alignment component a cohesion component and a collision avoidance component similarly in the sf models the fish are viewed as newtonian particles subject to social and physical forces ensuring group cohesion and reflecting the interaction e g drag with the environment collignon et al 2016 although the two models differ both fundamentally rely on a fixed set of rules and assume that the rules are known in advance obtaining such rules is very challenging often requiring deep insight and rich domain knowledge usually many complex factors will affect collective motion so it is unrealistic to take all possible factors into account when creating a set of rules further the rules are created by experts that likely have biases which may cause the collective motion patterns to be not properly explained instead individuals in collective motion should be viewed as agents whose policy is learned from interacting with their environment and neighbors therefore to overcome those static rules some researchers have begun to use reinforcement learning rl to model collective motion morihiro et al 2008 shimada et al 2018 ried et al 2019 lópez incera et al 2020 costa et al 2020 for example an earlier rl based collective motion model for the self organized grouping of individuals was proposed in 2008 morihiro et al 2008 in which the reward function was constructed based on the distances between individuals shimada et al 2018 took into account not only the distances between individuals but also the directions of individuals when they designed the reward function specifically they developed three metrics to measure the difference between the behavior of reynolds boids model reynolds 1987 and the behavior of the rl based model conceptually similar work has also been carried out by costa et al 2020 in which they obtained a collective motion model based on rl by maximizing the group level objective function total reward during a simulated episode representing the desired collective configuration they showed that collective motion models learned through different reward functions can make fish schools form different motion patterns these approaches obtained rl based models by shaping reward functions with implicit assumptions without directly providing information relating to the underlying forces of the three rules of alignment cohesion and separation while these learned models have provided useful insights they cannot guarantee that the assumed behavior is accurate at the individual level and moreover they do not seem to address its origin i e why individuals would respond in one way or another the increased likelihood of survival in the presence of predators is recognized as one of the benefits of collective motion for animals hence some researchers proposed predator prey models morihiro et al 2008 hahn et al 2019 sunehag et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in which a predator and prey were placed in an environment where the predator attempted to catch the prey at the end of each timestep prey are rewarded to encourage policies that allow them to survive as long as possible simulation results showed that this simple reward led to emergent flocking behavior in contrast durve et al 2020 designed a reward function where agents that lose adjacent neighbors from within their perceptual field are penalized results showed that collective motion emerges spontaneously in a rl process from the minimization of the rate of neighbor loss in these studies however the observation or state of an agent was usually represented with high level variables such as the angle between the current moving direction of the focal agent and the average direction of its neighbors or the poses position and orientation of the k nearest neighbors however there is a large difference between such representation and the real sensory perception of an agent furthermore most existing rl based approaches obtain an agent s policy by using independent single agent reinforcement learning algorithms in a multi agent setting in which other agents are considered as part of the environment this straightforward approach has the problem of causing non stationarity in the state transitions as an agent tries to adapt its actions in certain states other agents are doing the same but they are considered as part of the environment for the first agent since the states of the agent are not independent we cannot develop a policy that depends only on the observed states because the markov property for each agent is lost to solve this environmental uncertainty independent single agent reinforcement learning algorithms were used in a multi agent setting leading to multi agent reinforcement learning marl in recent years there have been many successful uses of multi agent reinforcement learning marl such as in poker games moravčík et al 2017 brown and sandholm 2018 dota 2 berner et al 2019 and starcraft ii vinyals et al 2019 as an animal group can be viewed as a multi agent system where individuals can be modeled as agents we hypothesize that group behaviors like fish schooling should result from the responses to very generic benefits in a spatial environment so multi agent reinforcement learning algorithms should be a potentially effective method to model collective motion in fish schools in this paper we propose a new method to model the collective motion in fish schools in which the fish individuals are modeled as artificial learning agents who can learn their movement policy through interacting with the environment the proposed method uses mean field theory mft to simplify the interactions between agents in order to model fish sensory ability in a more detailed and realistic way we use an image like representation multi channel image to describe the observation of a fish agent the policy of a fish agent is approximated with a neural network trained by mfq which is good at handling rl tasks with large numbers of agents in the training fish agents are rewarded or penalized according to the number of neighbors and consecutive collisions among fish agents in our model of collective motion the interaction rules with neighbors are not fixed in advance instead the fish agents develop them based on their past experiences in contrast to other learning based works we avoid hand crafted shaping rewards specific actions or dynamics that would directly encourage coordination across agents and we also analyze the properties of the collective motion patterns that emerge from the learned policy of fish agents in a word we aim to illustrate that multi agent reinforcement learning has the potential to be a new approach for the analysis and modeling of collective motion and can generate new insight 2 mfq based method for modeling collective motion well known complex collective motion can emerge from simple local interactions of agents who lack the ability to observe or directly control the collective and the local interactions of agents can be viewed as the policies that agents use to respond to their observations so modeling collective motion can be simplified to finding the agents policies that can generate complex collective motion patterns commonly observed in nature we attempt to obtain the policies of agents that generate collective motion patterns via rl in the rl framework agents interact with the environment in a closed loop manner and learn by maximizing the accumulative reward obtained from their interactions with the environment to this end we describe six components 1 the markov decision process model 2 the kinematic model of the fish agent and the environment 3 the observation model of the fish agent 4 the representation of the fish agent s action 5 the reward function and policy representation and 6 the mfq based learning algorithm in the following subsections furthermore we give three indicators to quantify and analyze the properties of collective motion 2 1 problem formulation in this paper we try to address the problem of obtaining agents policies that generate the desired collective patterns using a reinforcement learning framework therefore we need to develop an mdp to describe the collective motion of fish schools in this paper each individual in the swarm is modeled as an artificial learning agent which has its own local sensory capability and decision making capability on how to respond to the sensory input in addition we assume that 1 all agents in the swarm are identical 2 they have the same dynamics observation capabilities and action capabilities and 3 every agent can only partially observe the global swarm system state due to its limited sensory capability note that since all agents in the swarm are homogeneous the state space the action space the transition model the observation model and the policy for an agent are assumed to be invariant to the permutations of the agents and define individual model a in the following we describe the components of a multi agent markov decision process including the individual model and the swarm model below the individual model describes the homogeneous agent common architecture and is defined as a tuple a s i o i a i p i π i where i represents each individual agent s i the agent s local state space a part of the global state of the swarm system o i the agent s local observation space a i the agent s action space p i a mapping s i a i s i 1 0 the local state transition model of the agent such as the agent s kinematics model r i a mapping o i a i n r i the agent level reward function which can only access the agent s local observation π i a mapping o i a i 0 1 the local policy of the agent that is its decision depends on its current neighborhood only and not on the whole swarm state based on the individual model a the swarm model is defined as a tuple w n a s p o r γ where n the number of agents in the swarm a above individual models s the swarm s global state space a joint space s i n swarm state s s 1 s n s s 1 s i j 1 n p the mapping s a s 0 the swarm s global state transition model o the mapping s 1 n o i agent s observation model which determines the local observation o j o i for agent j at given swarm state s s r the mapping s a r the swarm level global reward function which can access the global state γ discount factor γ 0 1 like swarmdps the proposed mdp with the individual model exploits the system symmetries and provides a more compact system representation especially when the number of agents in a swarm is large based on the proposed mdp we can use multi agent deep reinforcement learning to find a local policy that can produce collective motion specifically since collective motion is viewed as the result of cooperative tasks among individuals finding a local policy can be formulated as an optimization problem which maximizes the total accumulative reward it is defined as eq 1 1 max π i j π i max π i e t 0 r s t a t s t 1 j 1 n r i o t j a t π i where r and r i are the swarm level function and individual level reward function respectively e is expectation operation a t is joint action at time step t a t π i o t 1 π i o t n it should be pointed out that eq 1 may have a swarm level reward function an individual level reward function or both in a task in mdps a swarm level reward function can be used to describe the system level goal of a task such as the desired collective motion pattern 2 2 a kinematic model of the fish agent and the environment in real life a fish can freely swim by beating its fins in certain three dimensional spaces such as ponds rivers lakes or marine environments and fish schooling usually consists of many fish of the same species with approximately the same body size and age hemelrijk and kunz 2005 for simplicity we define fish schools as many homogenous fish agents moving together with movements in a two dimensional box with periodic boundary conditions that means that if an agent leaves the box to the right it will immediately enter it again from the left same for the other direction or around the top and bottom let us define a global reference frame x and y in a horizontal plane with length expressed in an arbitrary unit which we call body length bl in this reference frame the state of an agent j is represented by its position x j y j and orientation ϕ j that is s j x j y j ϕ j s i x y ϕ l 3 0 x x m a x 0 y y m a x 0 ϕ 2 π the linear and angular velocities of agent j are represented by v j and ω j respectively thus a fish agent moving in the 2d plane can be modeled as a sample unicycle see de souza et al 2021 for more detail so the kinematic model of a fish agent j can be given by eq 2 2 x j v j cos ϕ j y j v j sin ϕ j ϕ j ω j it is assumed that the fish agent has first order kinematics during movement that is the position and orientation of the fish agent are determined by its own speed and angular velocity respectively a fish agent s state is updated at discrete time steps where the operator m o d is used to implement periodic boundary conditions it is defined as eq 3 3 x t 1 j x t j v j cos ϕ t j mod x max y t 1 j y t j v j sin ϕ t j mod y max ϕ t 1 j ϕ t j ω j mod 2 π 2 3 the fish agent s local observation model it has been hypothesized that vision is a primary mode of perception for fish while fish can achieve a field of vision close to 360 by beating their tail their perceptual distance is limited mccomb and kajiura 2008 thus we can think of the perceptual area of a fish agent as a circle of radius l see fig 1 here we assume that the fish agent can perceive spatial information position and orientation which contains the location relationship information between the focal agents and its neighbors within its perceptual area as grid type information is more convenient to feed into the neural network for simplicity we approximate the perceptual field with a square of side l located at the focal agent s position here we use k k image like representation with multiple channels to encode the spatial information as shown in fig 1 right panel the parameter k is usually set with an odd number to keep the focus agent in the middle of the grid every channel can represent a different feature where the first channel is a binary matrix with 1 indicating the position of agents the focal agent itself and its neighbors and 0 otherwise the value of each cell pixel in the first channel can be determined with eq 4 4 o j 0 r c i 0 r x i x j l k 2 l k 1 a n d c y i y j l k 2 l k 1 i 1 n where o j 0 r c represents the value of the pixel r c in the first channel for focal agent j l is the focal agent perceptual range x j y j is the position of the focal agent j similarly x i y i is the position of the neighbor i within the perceptual area of the focal agent j is the floor round operator i is the indicator operator which takes on a value of 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise the second channel represents the orientation of agents the agent itself and its neighbors similarly the value of each cell pixel in the first channel can be determined with eq 5 5 o j 0 r c ϕ i i 0 r x i x j l k 2 l k 1 a n d c y i y j l k 2 l k 1 i 1 n where ϕ i is the orientation of the neighbor j in addition we also assume that the fish agent can remember certain non spatial information such as its id representing its observation information last action last reward and so on so an agent s observation includes spatial information and non spatial information for non spatial information we use a one dimensional vector to represent it 2 4 representation of fish agent s action as described in section 2 2 a fish agent can control its own linear velocity and angular velocity like most existing collective behavior models here the linear velocity of the fish agent is considered constant thus the angular velocity becomes the only control input that can change its orientation since fish have a limited turning angle we assume that the angular velocity lies within the range ω m a x ω m a x we discretize the action space ω m a x ω m a x into m equally sized intervals as shown in fig 2 the parameter m is usually set with an odd number to keep the current orientation in the middle of the action space the blue arrow is the orientation of the focal fish agent at the current time step 2 5 reward function the reward function plays an important role in rl that determines what the agent s motivations are i e how the agent ought to behave if the reward function is designed properly the agents will learn better and faster collective motion in fish schools may have many benefits such as access to information via local enhancement detecting predators with the many eyes effect and group defense against predators via the confusion effect which are recognized by most biologists from this perspective the more neighbors a fish has the more benefits it gains so the number of neighbors should be included as a factor in the reward function further as collisions are rare in real life the number of collisions also should be included as another factor of the reward function thus we can express the individual level reward function for agent j as follows as eq 6 r i o t j a t r i o t j a t 1 a t j a t n 6 k n n n o t j k c n c o t j where n n o t j is a function that determines the number of neighbors in a given local observation o t j similarly n c o t j is a function that determines the continuous collision number of the agent j in given observation history k n and k c are the coefficients of the number of neighbors and the number of collisions respectively it should be noted that while a rl model may contain a swarm level reward function we do not use one in this paper as imposing direct rules to force collective motion is contrary to our original objective 2 6 mfq based learning algorithm as described in section 2 2 fish schooling usually contains dozens or even hundreds of individual fish and each individual fish is modeled as a learning agent therefore obtaining the fish s policy is an rl problem with many agents which is very intractable due to the curse of dimensionality and the exponential growth of agent interactions fortunately the mean field q learning mfq proposed by yang et al 2018 is very good at handling complex rl with many agents therefore we here use the mfq algorithm to find a shared local policy for agents that can generate collective motion in the mfq based learning algorithm the interactions within the population of fish agents are approximated by those between the focal fish agent and the average effect from the neighboring agents that is the influence of all neighboring fish agents on the focal fish agent is approximated to that of the virtual mean fish agent on the focal fish agent in most multi agent reinforcement learning the joint action grows proportionally with respect to the number of fish agents n to address this mfq uses the q function which uses the factorized pairwise local interactions as shown in eq 7 7 q j s a 1 n j k η j q j s a j a k where n j is the number of neighbors of fish agent j and η j is the index set of neighboring fish agents next the pairwise local interactions can be further approximated under certain conditions by using the mean field theory it is defined as eq 8 1 n j k η j q j s a j a k q j s a j 1 n j k η j a k 8 q j s a j a j where a j is the mean action over the neighborhood of the focal fish agent j so the mean action a j can be viewed as the action of the virtual fish agent thus many pairwise interactions can be simplified to those between the focal agent and the virtual fish agent it is worth noting that a k is a one hot vector encoding and a j is a vector of fractions corresponding to the probability that each action may be executed by a fish agent once we obtain the mean field q function q j its corresponding policy can be obtained according to eq 9 so with the mean field approximation the marl problem is converted into finding the optimal mean field q j if q j is parameterized with the weights ϕ j it is trained by minimizing the loss function with gradient based optimizers where y j is the target mean field value calculated with the target q function q j parameterized with the weights ϕ j eq 10 9 π j a j s a j exp β q j s a j a j a j a exp β q j s a j a j 10 l ϕ j q ϕ j j s a j a j y j 2 the mean field q function q j called the evaluation network is approximated with a neural network similarly the target q function q j is approximated with another neural network to reduce the correlation of data the two neural networks have the same structure with three data streams in their first half see fig 3 the first stream handles the fish agent s spatial observation using convolutional layers the second stream deals with non spatial features containing the last action the last reward using a fully connected layer and the third stream encodes the mean action information coming from the virtual fish in the second half the three parts are concatenated together then passed forward to two fully connected layers and finally output a single q value it is worth noting that the mean action in the figure is the mean action of all neighboring fish agents within the perceptual range of the fish agent and we assume that the neighbors within the perceptual range of the focal fish agent will not change greatly in two adjacent time steps therefore the mean action of the neighbors at the previous moment is used as an input into the neural network for training the pseudo code of the mfq based learning algorithm for fish agents is shown as algorithm 1 in the beginning the algorithm initializes the evaluation network q j and target network q j with random weights at each time step the algorithm does the following things first the fish agents receive their observations next the fish agents sample actions from the evaluation network q j according to their observations and previous mean action then the environment performs the actions of agents simultaneously and generates interaction data current observations current actions new observations and rewards which is saved into the replay buffer finally the algorithm optimizes the evaluation network q with minibatch sgd or adam and uses a soft update to update network q j 2 7 indicators for properties of collective motion the order parameter average number of neighbors and average nearest neighbor ratio are indicators often used to analyze the properties of collective motion each of which we describe below 1 order parameter alignment the order parameter is an index to quantify the degree of order in the collective motion it is used to evaluate the alignment of each fish agent in the school the order parameter is defined as eq 11 11 φ t 1 n i 1 n v i v i where n is the number of agents v i represents the velocity vector of agent i v i represents the euclidean norm of the velocity vector of agent i t represents the t th time step the order parameter goes from 0 to 1 where φ 0 means that the orientations of the agents are disordered and φ 1 means that the agents are aligned 1 average number of neighbors cohesion the average number of neighbors is used to evaluate the cohesion of the fish agent school it is defined as eq 12 12 m 1 n i 1 n m i where m i is the number of neighbors of the ith agent n is the number of agents 1 average nearest neighbor ratio density the nearest neighbor distance nnd is used as a measure of the spatial relationship to explore the distribution pattern of plant or animal populations clark and evans 1954 inspired by the above we apply the average nearest neighbor ratio a n n r between fish agents to evaluate the density and distribution of its neighbors defined in eq 13 13 a n n r d a c t u a l d e x p e c t 14 d a c t u a l i 1 n d i n 15 d e x p e c t 0 5 n a where d a c t u a l is the actual average nearest neighbor distance as defined in eq 14 d e x p e c t e d is the average distance when neighbors surrounding the agent are evenly distributed as defined in eq 15 d i is the distance between the i th agent and its nearest neighboring agent n is the number of neighboring agents and a is the area of the perceptual range of the agent if a n n r 1 it means that the density and distribution of its neighbors is higher than would be expected by random chance 3 simulation results 3 1 experiments setting in our experiments fish agents move in a 60 60bl body length 2d box with periodic boundary conditions and no obstacles as shown in fig 4 for simplicity we assume the living environment of fish has uniform physiochemical properties the linear velocity of each fish agent is fixed to 3bl s the angular velocity is bounded between π 3 π 3 and discretized into 361 equal parts with each part representing an action i e 361 actions thus we have 361 discretized actions and the observation radius of each fish agent was set to 4bl with no noise in the agent s observations and at each time step each agent chooses one of the 361 actions based on its observations particularly common at the beginning of training some fish agents may encounter consecutive collisions with their neighbors termed an agent jam in an agent jam many fish agents cannot move forward causing the training process to halt when this occurs the simulation is restarted if the fish agent continues to collide with fish agents up to 10 times in a row then the fish agent s position is reset to a new random collision free position 3 2 training process the overview of training can be defined as follows in the beginning all neural networks of the mfq are initialized with random values then fish agents interact with their neighbors and the environment to produce interaction experiences when the interaction experiences in the buffer reach a defined amount the training process is activated here we set the learning rate to 0 0001 γ 0 95 batch size of 64 and the size of the replay buffer is fixed to 1024 for the reward function eq 6 we set the coefficient k n 0 1 and k c 0 1 during training the complete process of interaction between fish agents and the environment has the structure displayed in fig 5 where with the number of n 140 fish agents we execute training of 120 episodes during which the fish agents develop new behaviors to get the reward at the beginning of each episode all fish agents are placed at random positions and orientations the termination condition of each episode is when the number of specified time steps i e 400 steps is reached at each time step every fish agent first evaluates its surroundings then receives its corresponding observation the observation of itself and the mean action of its neighbors serve as inputs for the current evaluation network which outputs an action for each fish agent once all agents actions are obtained the environment performs them simultaneously finally all agents interaction experiences are placed into the replay buffer during the training session we utilize the average reward that fish agents receive at each time step to evaluate the success of the learning process as shown in fig 6 the average reward at each time step increases gradually as the number of training episodes grows specifically the reward goes from 0 04 to 0 82 which demonstrates that the performance of the fish agent s policy gradually improves the insets in fig 6 are some snapshots of fish agents movement in the training process occurring in the last few moments of the corresponding episode from fig 6 we can observe that the fish agents move randomly and obtain a lower reward in the early phase of the training while the fish agents eventually learn to form groups and receive a higher reward in the later phase of the training as described in 2 6 since the number of fish agents is too large and every fish agent learns simultaneously the learning may encounter non stationarity of environment and high computational complexity this may lead to the non convergence of the model however in fig 6 we see that the fish agents can overcome learning difficulties by using mfq so that each fish agent is maximizing its own expected reward and eventually learns to school 3 3 agents can learn schooling like behaviors in order to verify whether the learned policy can generate collective motion we equipped 140 fish agents with the learned policy and placed them in the environment initial conditions i e location and directions were randomly generated for all fish agents then the fish agents moved according to their policy fig 7 is a collection of snapshots of agents configuration at various time steps t within an episode in fig 7 we can see that fish agents autonomously formed a highly parallel group from the initially disordered configuration that is the learned policy can produce collective motion patterns observed in nature verifying the effectiveness of mfq based methods for modeling collective motion 3 4 collective motion dynamics we analyze the properties of the collective motion that emerged from the learned policy of fish agents in this section we focus on three main properties of the school namely alignment cohesion and density we quantify and analyze these properties with the order parameter the average number of neighbors and the average nearest neighbor ratio 3 4 1 analysis of collective motion during training this section shows the order parameter the average number of neighbors and the average nearest neighbor ratio vary for fish agents as training progresses in fig 8 a we show the evolution of the order parameter as training is advancing the order parameter rapidly increases in the early phases of training and then it fluctuates between 0 8 and 0 95 after about the 8th episode this implies that the fish agent school eventually achieves a highly ordered configuration where fish agents can follow and align with the neighboring fish agents for collective motion what is more noteworthy is that we did not explicitly specify the fish agents with information on how to align thus the alignment was spontaneously induced by the collective motion of the fish agents fig 8 b shows the evolution of the average number of neighbors as the training processes we also observe that the average number of neighbors gradually increases and finally stabilizes in the range of 6 10 this reflects that the fish agents have learned a policy of collective motion that forms a cohesive school as shown in fig 8 c the average nearest neighbor ratio gradually decreases with respect to the number of training episodes from about 1 3 to around 0 47 the value of the annr is higher in the beginning because the fish agents are just starting to learn to increase the number of neighbors around themselves as the training progresses the fish agents start to form a cohesive school the average number of neighbors stabilizes which leads to a decrease in annr 3 4 2 analysis on collective motion produced by the learned policy this section verifies whether the collective motion generated by the learned policy is consistent with the collective motion characteristics of natural fish schools since three indicators the order parameter the average number of neighbors and the average nearest neighbor ratio can measure the key features of collective motion here we use them to analyze the collective motion produced by the learned policy specifically we conducted an experiment in which 140 fish agents were created and equipped with the learned policy at each time step every fish agent obtains information about its surrounding environment and receives an action e g a change in the fish agent s turning angle according to the learned policy during the experiment we monitor the order parameter the average number of neighbors and the average nearest neighbor ratio shown as fig 9 we can see the order parameter of the fish agent school gradually increases as the number of time steps grows in fig 9 a at the beginning of the test the fish agents are randomly initialized in the environment which leads to order parameters of only 0 25 after about 20 steps the order parameters stabilize above 0 9 indicating that the fish learn to select actions that follow their neighbors and form a highly ordered school the evolution of the average number of neighbors throughout the test is given in fig 9 b the learned policy is such that the average number of neighbors increases until the school stabilizes this implies that a cohesive school can emerge as a consequence of the interactions between the fish agents using the learned policy as shown in fig 9 c the average nearest neighbor ratio gradually decreases with respect to the number of time steps from about 0 97 to around 0 62 this reflects that the fish agent school formed by the fish agent through learned policy not only exhibits alignment and cohesion but also has a higher concentration of neighbors in terms of the three indicators this verifies that the collective motion derived from the learned policy is similar to the collective motion patterns observed in real fish 3 5 learned policy can be deployed in groups of different sizes to evaluate how our method changes with group size we repeated our methods with 20 50 80 110 140 and 170 fish agents the order parameters average number of neighbors and average nearest neighbor ratio of different groups are shown in fig 10 we can see that for all group sizes the order parameter increases as time progresses and eventually plateaus at a high degree of order close to a value of 0 95 similarly for all group sizes the average number of neighbors increases as the time step grows and the average nearest neighbor ratio decrease as the time step grows this demonstrates that the learned policy can produce collective motion for different group sizes in fig 10 a we can see that smaller groups have a lower average order parameter but higher variance for example the order parameter of groups with 20 agents fluctuates around 0 83 and has a very high variance smaller groups have higher average nearest neighbor ratio and variance which may be because fish agents rarely encounter each other when the group size is small leading to unstable group configurations for larger groups with n 110 140 and 170 the order parameters rise quickly and finally stabilize at about 0 9 with small variances because the average nearest neighbor ratio decreased quickly stabilizing at about 0 62 this indicates that larger groups more easily achieve collective motion and stay in stable group configurations 3 6 agents acquire different collective motion patterns as we all know the collective pattern of fish agent schools is related to the collective motion policy of fish agents one of the most common collective patterns is called highly parallel and can easily be generated by the learned policy however we also observed two other collective patterns during the training process as shown in fig 11 in addition to the highly parallel pattern mentioned above we also observed rotating full core milling and rotating hollow core milling patterns which can also be observed in real fish schools these patterns typically occur when fish schools are foraging avoiding predators etc which may be an evolutionary behavior of animals in nature the two collective patterns of rotating full core milling and rotating hollow core milling are acquired at episode 64 and 84 in our training respectively this phenomenon was spontaneously induced by the collective motion of the fish agent school without any additional intervention this indicates that our proposed method has the potential to acquire policies generating various patterns of fish collective motion observed in real life 4 discussion in this study we have introduced a marl based approach to modeling the collective motion of fish schools and demonstrate its effectiveness first the choice of the markov decision process mdp used to describe collective motion is not trivial while there exists several kinds of mdps for multi agent settings we propose a new multi agent markov decision process mdp inspired by swarmdps huttenrauch et al 2017 both are represented with an individual model and a swarm model the agent in the system is homogeneous which have a more compact system representation than distributed and centralized mdp while the two models are similar they differ in that the swarmdps 1 do not have an individual level reward function and 2 only provide a transition density function for the global state system our proposed mdp provides individual level and swarm level reward functions the individual level reward function can be used to describe the private or local benefits for an agent while the swarm level reward function provides us an option to describe the swarm s task in a bird s eye view furthermore our proposed mdp provides individual level and swarm level state transition models the individual level state transition model describes the agent s local state transition without regard to other agents or environmental constraints while the swarm level state transition model describes the state transition of the whole swarm system which may include agents interactions constraints or other factors i e noise since the policy of fish agents essentially maps the agent s observation into a probability distribution over an agent s potential actions the agent s observation representation is a key component in obtaining the policy by learning in this paper the observation of the fish agents is represented with a multi channel image where the image channels can contain different features agents position and orientation based on a local view of an agent but most existing studies describe an agent s observation with high level variables such as the angle between its current direction and the average direction of its neighbors or the poses of the k nearest neighbors while this makes policy mapping simpler and easier to learn it is also unrealistic in contrast our image like observation for one fish agent is closer to the sensory perception of real fish but is more difficult to implement particularly as the number of fish agents increase fortunately our proposed mfq based method can easily overcome this and our results show that the fish agents can still learn a policy that produces collective motion in a rl setting agents not only interact with the environment but also with each other thus large number of agents worsen the computational complexity of learning resulting in models that are unstable and fail to converge matignon et al 2012 in this paper we use mfq to train collective motion models so that the interactions within the population of fish agents are approximated by those between the focal fish agent and the average effect from the neighboring agents as the mfq iteratively learns each agent s best response to the mean effect from its neighbors effectively transforming the many entity problem into a two entity problem thus with mfq the computational complexity of learning becomes independent of the number of agents it should be noted that we approximate an inherently continuous time process of fish schooling movement into discrete time intervals for ease of computation at each time step each individual fish perceives the spatial location orientation and position of its neighbors it s observation determines its action and performs it assuming the action does not result in a with another individual to simplify the mathematical treatment we assume that all fish agents universally undergo synchronous updating meaning that all fish agents perceive their spatial information simultaneously and undertake their actions at the same time examining the three different collective patterns founding during the training process we found that the highly parallel pattern is more likely to appear when the number of fish agents is small and the rotating full core milling pattern and the rotating hollow core milling pattern are more likely to appear when the number of fish agents is large therefore we presume that the rotating full core milling pattern and the rotating hollow core milling pattern in fish agent schools may be evolutionary behaviors to reduce collisions with their neighbors fish schools could form the rotating hollow core milling pattern when encountering predators in the real life and could form the rotating full core milling pattern when foraging in the nature furthermore it is noteworthy that the policies that produced the three collective patterns are obtained with the same neural network in the same environment but in different training phases which indicates that our proposed method has the potential to acquire the policies generating various patterns of fish schooling observed in nature however due to the nature of neural network modeling we only obtain a policy at the end of training that consistently produces the collective pattern of highly parallel we suspect that the other two policies are lost due to the phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting of neural networks french 1999 catastrophic forgetting is when a connectionist networks forget all previously learned information in the process of learning new information neural networks are particularly prone to catastrophic forgetting a known weakness of such models as they are unable to learn multiple tasks sequentially if we had a mechanism to record the policies of all collective patterns utilized in the course of training then the learned policy needed to generate the different collective patterns would be obtained in summary reinforcement learning rl has made significant progress in recent years and it has achieved great success in solving various sequential decision making problems mnih et al 2015 silver et al 2016 multi agent reinforcement learning marl is the integration of multi agent systems and reinforcement learning that only enables the agent to learn by itself by interacting with the environment in a trial and error way but also solves the problems of convergence and the curse of dimensionality swarming animals can be viewed as a multi agent system and using marl allows individuals to be modeled as agents with behavioral learning processes realistic to real animals without the need for pre specified interaction rules so it is a natural way to use marl to study the swarming behavior of such a system and also a behavioral learning simulation approach that is closer to real animals furthermore it is a promising way to allow the agent to autonomously discover previously unknown rules thus multi agent reinforcement learning can be a potentially powerful tool to model analyze and understand the behavior of complicated fish schooling 5 conclusion in this paper we developed an mfq based method to model collective motion for fish schooling specifically we modeled a fish as a learning agent whose policy was employed as an effective brain to each agent in the collective motion model the policy can be obtained via the mfq algorithm even though the observation was represented with a multi channel image containing more low level details and the reward function was designed only with the number of neighbors and consecutive collisions between individuals the results showed that the learned policy can produce collective motion even in groups of different sizes the properties of collective motion that emerged from the learned policy were similar to those of classical collective motion to the best of our knowledge there are no previous studies that model the collective motion of fish schools using multi agent reinforcement learning algorithms improving upon classic models our marl based model does not directly provide or impose interaction rules between individuals in advance but allows them to emerge as the result of learning in a given task environment thus such a marl based model allows us to directly test whether the benefits are a possible causal explanation for the observed behavior interestingly three different collective motion patterns which can be seen in nature were observed during the training process however the concrete reasons for these phenomena are still unclear as the interpretability of neural networks considered a black box approach is not straightforward and is a hot topic and an active area of research in the field of machine learning therefore the mechanistic reasons behind the emergence of these three collective patterns is the subject of future research credit authorship contribution statement xin wang conceptualization methodology software formal

24246,complex collective motion patterns can emerge from very simple local interactions among individual agents however it is still unclear how and why the interactions among individuals lead to the emergence of collective motion modeling is an effective way to understand the mechanisms that govern collective animal motions in this work to avoid imposing fixed sets of rules on collective motion models a priori as classical approaches do we propose a new method of modeling collective motion for fish schooling via multi agent reinforcement learning we model each fish individual as an artificial learning agent whose policy is acquired by using mean field q learning mfq the observation of each fish agent is represented as a multi channel image where each channel describes a different feature such as an agent s position or an agent s orientation the policy of an agent is approximated with a neural network trained with the mfq algorithm during which agents are rewarded or penalized according to the number of neighbors and consecutive collisions between individuals we study the dynamics of collective motion that emerge from the learned policy the experimental results show that the learned policy can produce collective motion in groups of various sizes in addition three different collective motion patterns observed in nature emerged during the training process the learned policy can help us gain new insight into how and why individual interactions lead to collective motion this study also demonstrates that multi agent reinforcement learning has great potential to be a new approach for analysis and modeling of collective motion keywords collective motion collective behavior animal behavior multi agent reinforcement learning reinforcement learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction collective motion is a common and interesting phenomenon in nature it has received considerable attention in theoretical biology ethology cognition and ecology one of the most noticeable characteristics of animal groups is their ability to generate various complex swarming motion patterns extensive research recognizes that collective motion is self organized and mainly results from local interactions between individuals who lack the ability to understand or directly control the collective schaerf et al 2017 modeling is a good way to understand the mechanisms that govern collective animal motions fish are a common model organism for the study of collective motion because they are swarming animals and extremely easy to obtain in the past few decades many collective motion models have been proposed which can be mainly divided into two categories group based models and agent based models group based models kolpas et al 2007 yates et al 2009 bode et al 2010 jhawar et al 2020 jhawar and guttal 2020 are very successful at describing macroscopic properties such as phase transitions and metastable states but they usually ignore the specific interactions among individuals agent based models reynolds 1987 vicsek et al 1995 katz et al 2011 gautrais et al 2012 mwaffo et al 2015 can integrate the detailed properties of an individual into the model when they describe the interactions among individuals the main idea of agent based models is that individuals are reduced to featureless particles the linear velocity of each particle is usually assumed to be constant and its behavior can only be controlled by changing its heading angle the heading angle is affected by a fixed set of rules alignment cohesion and separation the three rules enable individuals in a group to maintain their orientation in the same direction keeping the distance among each other relatively compact while avoiding collisions these rules can be implemented by various models which are mainly divided into two categories self propelled particles spp models couzin et al 2002 ginelli and chaté 2010 hemelrijk and hildenbrandt 2012 vicsek and zafeiris 2012 deutsch et al 2012 and social forces sf models lukeman et al 2010 herbert read et al 2011 hinz and de polavieja 2017 wright et al 2019 shaebani et al 2020 in spp models fish individuals change their motion in response to others according to an alignment component a cohesion component and a collision avoidance component similarly in the sf models the fish are viewed as newtonian particles subject to social and physical forces ensuring group cohesion and reflecting the interaction e g drag with the environment collignon et al 2016 although the two models differ both fundamentally rely on a fixed set of rules and assume that the rules are known in advance obtaining such rules is very challenging often requiring deep insight and rich domain knowledge usually many complex factors will affect collective motion so it is unrealistic to take all possible factors into account when creating a set of rules further the rules are created by experts that likely have biases which may cause the collective motion patterns to be not properly explained instead individuals in collective motion should be viewed as agents whose policy is learned from interacting with their environment and neighbors therefore to overcome those static rules some researchers have begun to use reinforcement learning rl to model collective motion morihiro et al 2008 shimada et al 2018 ried et al 2019 lópez incera et al 2020 costa et al 2020 for example an earlier rl based collective motion model for the self organized grouping of individuals was proposed in 2008 morihiro et al 2008 in which the reward function was constructed based on the distances between individuals shimada et al 2018 took into account not only the distances between individuals but also the directions of individuals when they designed the reward function specifically they developed three metrics to measure the difference between the behavior of reynolds boids model reynolds 1987 and the behavior of the rl based model conceptually similar work has also been carried out by costa et al 2020 in which they obtained a collective motion model based on rl by maximizing the group level objective function total reward during a simulated episode representing the desired collective configuration they showed that collective motion models learned through different reward functions can make fish schools form different motion patterns these approaches obtained rl based models by shaping reward functions with implicit assumptions without directly providing information relating to the underlying forces of the three rules of alignment cohesion and separation while these learned models have provided useful insights they cannot guarantee that the assumed behavior is accurate at the individual level and moreover they do not seem to address its origin i e why individuals would respond in one way or another the increased likelihood of survival in the presence of predators is recognized as one of the benefits of collective motion for animals hence some researchers proposed predator prey models morihiro et al 2008 hahn et al 2019 sunehag et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in which a predator and prey were placed in an environment where the predator attempted to catch the prey at the end of each timestep prey are rewarded to encourage policies that allow them to survive as long as possible simulation results showed that this simple reward led to emergent flocking behavior in contrast durve et al 2020 designed a reward function where agents that lose adjacent neighbors from within their perceptual field are penalized results showed that collective motion emerges spontaneously in a rl process from the minimization of the rate of neighbor loss in these studies however the observation or state of an agent was usually represented with high level variables such as the angle between the current moving direction of the focal agent and the average direction of its neighbors or the poses position and orientation of the k nearest neighbors however there is a large difference between such representation and the real sensory perception of an agent furthermore most existing rl based approaches obtain an agent s policy by using independent single agent reinforcement learning algorithms in a multi agent setting in which other agents are considered as part of the environment this straightforward approach has the problem of causing non stationarity in the state transitions as an agent tries to adapt its actions in certain states other agents are doing the same but they are considered as part of the environment for the first agent since the states of the agent are not independent we cannot develop a policy that depends only on the observed states because the markov property for each agent is lost to solve this environmental uncertainty independent single agent reinforcement learning algorithms were used in a multi agent setting leading to multi agent reinforcement learning marl in recent years there have been many successful uses of multi agent reinforcement learning marl such as in poker games moravčík et al 2017 brown and sandholm 2018 dota 2 berner et al 2019 and starcraft ii vinyals et al 2019 as an animal group can be viewed as a multi agent system where individuals can be modeled as agents we hypothesize that group behaviors like fish schooling should result from the responses to very generic benefits in a spatial environment so multi agent reinforcement learning algorithms should be a potentially effective method to model collective motion in fish schools in this paper we propose a new method to model the collective motion in fish schools in which the fish individuals are modeled as artificial learning agents who can learn their movement policy through interacting with the environment the proposed method uses mean field theory mft to simplify the interactions between agents in order to model fish sensory ability in a more detailed and realistic way we use an image like representation multi channel image to describe the observation of a fish agent the policy of a fish agent is approximated with a neural network trained by mfq which is good at handling rl tasks with large numbers of agents in the training fish agents are rewarded or penalized according to the number of neighbors and consecutive collisions among fish agents in our model of collective motion the interaction rules with neighbors are not fixed in advance instead the fish agents develop them based on their past experiences in contrast to other learning based works we avoid hand crafted shaping rewards specific actions or dynamics that would directly encourage coordination across agents and we also analyze the properties of the collective motion patterns that emerge from the learned policy of fish agents in a word we aim to illustrate that multi agent reinforcement learning has the potential to be a new approach for the analysis and modeling of collective motion and can generate new insight 2 mfq based method for modeling collective motion well known complex collective motion can emerge from simple local interactions of agents who lack the ability to observe or directly control the collective and the local interactions of agents can be viewed as the policies that agents use to respond to their observations so modeling collective motion can be simplified to finding the agents policies that can generate complex collective motion patterns commonly observed in nature we attempt to obtain the policies of agents that generate collective motion patterns via rl in the rl framework agents interact with the environment in a closed loop manner and learn by maximizing the accumulative reward obtained from their interactions with the environment to this end we describe six components 1 the markov decision process model 2 the kinematic model of the fish agent and the environment 3 the observation model of the fish agent 4 the representation of the fish agent s action 5 the reward function and policy representation and 6 the mfq based learning algorithm in the following subsections furthermore we give three indicators to quantify and analyze the properties of collective motion 2 1 problem formulation in this paper we try to address the problem of obtaining agents policies that generate the desired collective patterns using a reinforcement learning framework therefore we need to develop an mdp to describe the collective motion of fish schools in this paper each individual in the swarm is modeled as an artificial learning agent which has its own local sensory capability and decision making capability on how to respond to the sensory input in addition we assume that 1 all agents in the swarm are identical 2 they have the same dynamics observation capabilities and action capabilities and 3 every agent can only partially observe the global swarm system state due to its limited sensory capability note that since all agents in the swarm are homogeneous the state space the action space the transition model the observation model and the policy for an agent are assumed to be invariant to the permutations of the agents and define individual model a in the following we describe the components of a multi agent markov decision process including the individual model and the swarm model below the individual model describes the homogeneous agent common architecture and is defined as a tuple a s i o i a i p i π i where i represents each individual agent s i the agent s local state space a part of the global state of the swarm system o i the agent s local observation space a i the agent s action space p i a mapping s i a i s i 1 0 the local state transition model of the agent such as the agent s kinematics model r i a mapping o i a i n r i the agent level reward function which can only access the agent s local observation π i a mapping o i a i 0 1 the local policy of the agent that is its decision depends on its current neighborhood only and not on the whole swarm state based on the individual model a the swarm model is defined as a tuple w n a s p o r γ where n the number of agents in the swarm a above individual models s the swarm s global state space a joint space s i n swarm state s s 1 s n s s 1 s i j 1 n p the mapping s a s 0 the swarm s global state transition model o the mapping s 1 n o i agent s observation model which determines the local observation o j o i for agent j at given swarm state s s r the mapping s a r the swarm level global reward function which can access the global state γ discount factor γ 0 1 like swarmdps the proposed mdp with the individual model exploits the system symmetries and provides a more compact system representation especially when the number of agents in a swarm is large based on the proposed mdp we can use multi agent deep reinforcement learning to find a local policy that can produce collective motion specifically since collective motion is viewed as the result of cooperative tasks among individuals finding a local policy can be formulated as an optimization problem which maximizes the total accumulative reward it is defined as eq 1 1 max π i j π i max π i e t 0 r s t a t s t 1 j 1 n r i o t j a t π i where r and r i are the swarm level function and individual level reward function respectively e is expectation operation a t is joint action at time step t a t π i o t 1 π i o t n it should be pointed out that eq 1 may have a swarm level reward function an individual level reward function or both in a task in mdps a swarm level reward function can be used to describe the system level goal of a task such as the desired collective motion pattern 2 2 a kinematic model of the fish agent and the environment in real life a fish can freely swim by beating its fins in certain three dimensional spaces such as ponds rivers lakes or marine environments and fish schooling usually consists of many fish of the same species with approximately the same body size and age hemelrijk and kunz 2005 for simplicity we define fish schools as many homogenous fish agents moving together with movements in a two dimensional box with periodic boundary conditions that means that if an agent leaves the box to the right it will immediately enter it again from the left same for the other direction or around the top and bottom let us define a global reference frame x and y in a horizontal plane with length expressed in an arbitrary unit which we call body length bl in this reference frame the state of an agent j is represented by its position x j y j and orientation ϕ j that is s j x j y j ϕ j s i x y ϕ l 3 0 x x m a x 0 y y m a x 0 ϕ 2 π the linear and angular velocities of agent j are represented by v j and ω j respectively thus a fish agent moving in the 2d plane can be modeled as a sample unicycle see de souza et al 2021 for more detail so the kinematic model of a fish agent j can be given by eq 2 2 x j v j cos ϕ j y j v j sin ϕ j ϕ j ω j it is assumed that the fish agent has first order kinematics during movement that is the position and orientation of the fish agent are determined by its own speed and angular velocity respectively a fish agent s state is updated at discrete time steps where the operator m o d is used to implement periodic boundary conditions it is defined as eq 3 3 x t 1 j x t j v j cos ϕ t j mod x max y t 1 j y t j v j sin ϕ t j mod y max ϕ t 1 j ϕ t j ω j mod 2 π 2 3 the fish agent s local observation model it has been hypothesized that vision is a primary mode of perception for fish while fish can achieve a field of vision close to 360 by beating their tail their perceptual distance is limited mccomb and kajiura 2008 thus we can think of the perceptual area of a fish agent as a circle of radius l see fig 1 here we assume that the fish agent can perceive spatial information position and orientation which contains the location relationship information between the focal agents and its neighbors within its perceptual area as grid type information is more convenient to feed into the neural network for simplicity we approximate the perceptual field with a square of side l located at the focal agent s position here we use k k image like representation with multiple channels to encode the spatial information as shown in fig 1 right panel the parameter k is usually set with an odd number to keep the focus agent in the middle of the grid every channel can represent a different feature where the first channel is a binary matrix with 1 indicating the position of agents the focal agent itself and its neighbors and 0 otherwise the value of each cell pixel in the first channel can be determined with eq 4 4 o j 0 r c i 0 r x i x j l k 2 l k 1 a n d c y i y j l k 2 l k 1 i 1 n where o j 0 r c represents the value of the pixel r c in the first channel for focal agent j l is the focal agent perceptual range x j y j is the position of the focal agent j similarly x i y i is the position of the neighbor i within the perceptual area of the focal agent j is the floor round operator i is the indicator operator which takes on a value of 1 if its argument is true and 0 otherwise the second channel represents the orientation of agents the agent itself and its neighbors similarly the value of each cell pixel in the first channel can be determined with eq 5 5 o j 0 r c ϕ i i 0 r x i x j l k 2 l k 1 a n d c y i y j l k 2 l k 1 i 1 n where ϕ i is the orientation of the neighbor j in addition we also assume that the fish agent can remember certain non spatial information such as its id representing its observation information last action last reward and so on so an agent s observation includes spatial information and non spatial information for non spatial information we use a one dimensional vector to represent it 2 4 representation of fish agent s action as described in section 2 2 a fish agent can control its own linear velocity and angular velocity like most existing collective behavior models here the linear velocity of the fish agent is considered constant thus the angular velocity becomes the only control input that can change its orientation since fish have a limited turning angle we assume that the angular velocity lies within the range ω m a x ω m a x we discretize the action space ω m a x ω m a x into m equally sized intervals as shown in fig 2 the parameter m is usually set with an odd number to keep the current orientation in the middle of the action space the blue arrow is the orientation of the focal fish agent at the current time step 2 5 reward function the reward function plays an important role in rl that determines what the agent s motivations are i e how the agent ought to behave if the reward function is designed properly the agents will learn better and faster collective motion in fish schools may have many benefits such as access to information via local enhancement detecting predators with the many eyes effect and group defense against predators via the confusion effect which are recognized by most biologists from this perspective the more neighbors a fish has the more benefits it gains so the number of neighbors should be included as a factor in the reward function further as collisions are rare in real life the number of collisions also should be included as another factor of the reward function thus we can express the individual level reward function for agent j as follows as eq 6 r i o t j a t r i o t j a t 1 a t j a t n 6 k n n n o t j k c n c o t j where n n o t j is a function that determines the number of neighbors in a given local observation o t j similarly n c o t j is a function that determines the continuous collision number of the agent j in given observation history k n and k c are the coefficients of the number of neighbors and the number of collisions respectively it should be noted that while a rl model may contain a swarm level reward function we do not use one in this paper as imposing direct rules to force collective motion is contrary to our original objective 2 6 mfq based learning algorithm as described in section 2 2 fish schooling usually contains dozens or even hundreds of individual fish and each individual fish is modeled as a learning agent therefore obtaining the fish s policy is an rl problem with many agents which is very intractable due to the curse of dimensionality and the exponential growth of agent interactions fortunately the mean field q learning mfq proposed by yang et al 2018 is very good at handling complex rl with many agents therefore we here use the mfq algorithm to find a shared local policy for agents that can generate collective motion in the mfq based learning algorithm the interactions within the population of fish agents are approximated by those between the focal fish agent and the average effect from the neighboring agents that is the influence of all neighboring fish agents on the focal fish agent is approximated to that of the virtual mean fish agent on the focal fish agent in most multi agent reinforcement learning the joint action grows proportionally with respect to the number of fish agents n to address this mfq uses the q function which uses the factorized pairwise local interactions as shown in eq 7 7 q j s a 1 n j k η j q j s a j a k where n j is the number of neighbors of fish agent j and η j is the index set of neighboring fish agents next the pairwise local interactions can be further approximated under certain conditions by using the mean field theory it is defined as eq 8 1 n j k η j q j s a j a k q j s a j 1 n j k η j a k 8 q j s a j a j where a j is the mean action over the neighborhood of the focal fish agent j so the mean action a j can be viewed as the action of the virtual fish agent thus many pairwise interactions can be simplified to those between the focal agent and the virtual fish agent it is worth noting that a k is a one hot vector encoding and a j is a vector of fractions corresponding to the probability that each action may be executed by a fish agent once we obtain the mean field q function q j its corresponding policy can be obtained according to eq 9 so with the mean field approximation the marl problem is converted into finding the optimal mean field q j if q j is parameterized with the weights ϕ j it is trained by minimizing the loss function with gradient based optimizers where y j is the target mean field value calculated with the target q function q j parameterized with the weights ϕ j eq 10 9 π j a j s a j exp β q j s a j a j a j a exp β q j s a j a j 10 l ϕ j q ϕ j j s a j a j y j 2 the mean field q function q j called the evaluation network is approximated with a neural network similarly the target q function q j is approximated with another neural network to reduce the correlation of data the two neural networks have the same structure with three data streams in their first half see fig 3 the first stream handles the fish agent s spatial observation using convolutional layers the second stream deals with non spatial features containing the last action the last reward using a fully connected layer and the third stream encodes the mean action information coming from the virtual fish in the second half the three parts are concatenated together then passed forward to two fully connected layers and finally output a single q value it is worth noting that the mean action in the figure is the mean action of all neighboring fish agents within the perceptual range of the fish agent and we assume that the neighbors within the perceptual range of the focal fish agent will not change greatly in two adjacent time steps therefore the mean action of the neighbors at the previous moment is used as an input into the neural network for training the pseudo code of the mfq based learning algorithm for fish agents is shown as algorithm 1 in the beginning the algorithm initializes the evaluation network q j and target network q j with random weights at each time step the algorithm does the following things first the fish agents receive their observations next the fish agents sample actions from the evaluation network q j according to their observations and previous mean action then the environment performs the actions of agents simultaneously and generates interaction data current observations current actions new observations and rewards which is saved into the replay buffer finally the algorithm optimizes the evaluation network q with minibatch sgd or adam and uses a soft update to update network q j 2 7 indicators for properties of collective motion the order parameter average number of neighbors and average nearest neighbor ratio are indicators often used to analyze the properties of collective motion each of which we describe below 1 order parameter alignment the order parameter is an index to quantify the degree of order in the collective motion it is used to evaluate the alignment of each fish agent in the school the order parameter is defined as eq 11 11 φ t 1 n i 1 n v i v i where n is the number of agents v i represents the velocity vector of agent i v i represents the euclidean norm of the velocity vector of agent i t represents the t th time step the order parameter goes from 0 to 1 where φ 0 means that the orientations of the agents are disordered and φ 1 means that the agents are aligned 1 average number of neighbors cohesion the average number of neighbors is used to evaluate the cohesion of the fish agent school it is defined as eq 12 12 m 1 n i 1 n m i where m i is the number of neighbors of the ith agent n is the number of agents 1 average nearest neighbor ratio density the nearest neighbor distance nnd is used as a measure of the spatial relationship to explore the distribution pattern of plant or animal populations clark and evans 1954 inspired by the above we apply the average nearest neighbor ratio a n n r between fish agents to evaluate the density and distribution of its neighbors defined in eq 13 13 a n n r d a c t u a l d e x p e c t 14 d a c t u a l i 1 n d i n 15 d e x p e c t 0 5 n a where d a c t u a l is the actual average nearest neighbor distance as defined in eq 14 d e x p e c t e d is the average distance when neighbors surrounding the agent are evenly distributed as defined in eq 15 d i is the distance between the i th agent and its nearest neighboring agent n is the number of neighboring agents and a is the area of the perceptual range of the agent if a n n r 1 it means that the density and distribution of its neighbors is higher than would be expected by random chance 3 simulation results 3 1 experiments setting in our experiments fish agents move in a 60 60bl body length 2d box with periodic boundary conditions and no obstacles as shown in fig 4 for simplicity we assume the living environment of fish has uniform physiochemical properties the linear velocity of each fish agent is fixed to 3bl s the angular velocity is bounded between π 3 π 3 and discretized into 361 equal parts with each part representing an action i e 361 actions thus we have 361 discretized actions and the observation radius of each fish agent was set to 4bl with no noise in the agent s observations and at each time step each agent chooses one of the 361 actions based on its observations particularly common at the beginning of training some fish agents may encounter consecutive collisions with their neighbors termed an agent jam in an agent jam many fish agents cannot move forward causing the training process to halt when this occurs the simulation is restarted if the fish agent continues to collide with fish agents up to 10 times in a row then the fish agent s position is reset to a new random collision free position 3 2 training process the overview of training can be defined as follows in the beginning all neural networks of the mfq are initialized with random values then fish agents interact with their neighbors and the environment to produce interaction experiences when the interaction experiences in the buffer reach a defined amount the training process is activated here we set the learning rate to 0 0001 γ 0 95 batch size of 64 and the size of the replay buffer is fixed to 1024 for the reward function eq 6 we set the coefficient k n 0 1 and k c 0 1 during training the complete process of interaction between fish agents and the environment has the structure displayed in fig 5 where with the number of n 140 fish agents we execute training of 120 episodes during which the fish agents develop new behaviors to get the reward at the beginning of each episode all fish agents are placed at random positions and orientations the termination condition of each episode is when the number of specified time steps i e 400 steps is reached at each time step every fish agent first evaluates its surroundings then receives its corresponding observation the observation of itself and the mean action of its neighbors serve as inputs for the current evaluation network which outputs an action for each fish agent once all agents actions are obtained the environment performs them simultaneously finally all agents interaction experiences are placed into the replay buffer during the training session we utilize the average reward that fish agents receive at each time step to evaluate the success of the learning process as shown in fig 6 the average reward at each time step increases gradually as the number of training episodes grows specifically the reward goes from 0 04 to 0 82 which demonstrates that the performance of the fish agent s policy gradually improves the insets in fig 6 are some snapshots of fish agents movement in the training process occurring in the last few moments of the corresponding episode from fig 6 we can observe that the fish agents move randomly and obtain a lower reward in the early phase of the training while the fish agents eventually learn to form groups and receive a higher reward in the later phase of the training as described in 2 6 since the number of fish agents is too large and every fish agent learns simultaneously the learning may encounter non stationarity of environment and high computational complexity this may lead to the non convergence of the model however in fig 6 we see that the fish agents can overcome learning difficulties by using mfq so that each fish agent is maximizing its own expected reward and eventually learns to school 3 3 agents can learn schooling like behaviors in order to verify whether the learned policy can generate collective motion we equipped 140 fish agents with the learned policy and placed them in the environment initial conditions i e location and directions were randomly generated for all fish agents then the fish agents moved according to their policy fig 7 is a collection of snapshots of agents configuration at various time steps t within an episode in fig 7 we can see that fish agents autonomously formed a highly parallel group from the initially disordered configuration that is the learned policy can produce collective motion patterns observed in nature verifying the effectiveness of mfq based methods for modeling collective motion 3 4 collective motion dynamics we analyze the properties of the collective motion that emerged from the learned policy of fish agents in this section we focus on three main properties of the school namely alignment cohesion and density we quantify and analyze these properties with the order parameter the average number of neighbors and the average nearest neighbor ratio 3 4 1 analysis of collective motion during training this section shows the order parameter the average number of neighbors and the average nearest neighbor ratio vary for fish agents as training progresses in fig 8 a we show the evolution of the order parameter as training is advancing the order parameter rapidly increases in the early phases of training and then it fluctuates between 0 8 and 0 95 after about the 8th episode this implies that the fish agent school eventually achieves a highly ordered configuration where fish agents can follow and align with the neighboring fish agents for collective motion what is more noteworthy is that we did not explicitly specify the fish agents with information on how to align thus the alignment was spontaneously induced by the collective motion of the fish agents fig 8 b shows the evolution of the average number of neighbors as the training processes we also observe that the average number of neighbors gradually increases and finally stabilizes in the range of 6 10 this reflects that the fish agents have learned a policy of collective motion that forms a cohesive school as shown in fig 8 c the average nearest neighbor ratio gradually decreases with respect to the number of training episodes from about 1 3 to around 0 47 the value of the annr is higher in the beginning because the fish agents are just starting to learn to increase the number of neighbors around themselves as the training progresses the fish agents start to form a cohesive school the average number of neighbors stabilizes which leads to a decrease in annr 3 4 2 analysis on collective motion produced by the learned policy this section verifies whether the collective motion generated by the learned policy is consistent with the collective motion characteristics of natural fish schools since three indicators the order parameter the average number of neighbors and the average nearest neighbor ratio can measure the key features of collective motion here we use them to analyze the collective motion produced by the learned policy specifically we conducted an experiment in which 140 fish agents were created and equipped with the learned policy at each time step every fish agent obtains information about its surrounding environment and receives an action e g a change in the fish agent s turning angle according to the learned policy during the experiment we monitor the order parameter the average number of neighbors and the average nearest neighbor ratio shown as fig 9 we can see the order parameter of the fish agent school gradually increases as the number of time steps grows in fig 9 a at the beginning of the test the fish agents are randomly initialized in the environment which leads to order parameters of only 0 25 after about 20 steps the order parameters stabilize above 0 9 indicating that the fish learn to select actions that follow their neighbors and form a highly ordered school the evolution of the average number of neighbors throughout the test is given in fig 9 b the learned policy is such that the average number of neighbors increases until the school stabilizes this implies that a cohesive school can emerge as a consequence of the interactions between the fish agents using the learned policy as shown in fig 9 c the average nearest neighbor ratio gradually decreases with respect to the number of time steps from about 0 97 to around 0 62 this reflects that the fish agent school formed by the fish agent through learned policy not only exhibits alignment and cohesion but also has a higher concentration of neighbors in terms of the three indicators this verifies that the collective motion derived from the learned policy is similar to the collective motion patterns observed in real fish 3 5 learned policy can be deployed in groups of different sizes to evaluate how our method changes with group size we repeated our methods with 20 50 80 110 140 and 170 fish agents the order parameters average number of neighbors and average nearest neighbor ratio of different groups are shown in fig 10 we can see that for all group sizes the order parameter increases as time progresses and eventually plateaus at a high degree of order close to a value of 0 95 similarly for all group sizes the average number of neighbors increases as the time step grows and the average nearest neighbor ratio decrease as the time step grows this demonstrates that the learned policy can produce collective motion for different group sizes in fig 10 a we can see that smaller groups have a lower average order parameter but higher variance for example the order parameter of groups with 20 agents fluctuates around 0 83 and has a very high variance smaller groups have higher average nearest neighbor ratio and variance which may be because fish agents rarely encounter each other when the group size is small leading to unstable group configurations for larger groups with n 110 140 and 170 the order parameters rise quickly and finally stabilize at about 0 9 with small variances because the average nearest neighbor ratio decreased quickly stabilizing at about 0 62 this indicates that larger groups more easily achieve collective motion and stay in stable group configurations 3 6 agents acquire different collective motion patterns as we all know the collective pattern of fish agent schools is related to the collective motion policy of fish agents one of the most common collective patterns is called highly parallel and can easily be generated by the learned policy however we also observed two other collective patterns during the training process as shown in fig 11 in addition to the highly parallel pattern mentioned above we also observed rotating full core milling and rotating hollow core milling patterns which can also be observed in real fish schools these patterns typically occur when fish schools are foraging avoiding predators etc which may be an evolutionary behavior of animals in nature the two collective patterns of rotating full core milling and rotating hollow core milling are acquired at episode 64 and 84 in our training respectively this phenomenon was spontaneously induced by the collective motion of the fish agent school without any additional intervention this indicates that our proposed method has the potential to acquire policies generating various patterns of fish collective motion observed in real life 4 discussion in this study we have introduced a marl based approach to modeling the collective motion of fish schools and demonstrate its effectiveness first the choice of the markov decision process mdp used to describe collective motion is not trivial while there exists several kinds of mdps for multi agent settings we propose a new multi agent markov decision process mdp inspired by swarmdps huttenrauch et al 2017 both are represented with an individual model and a swarm model the agent in the system is homogeneous which have a more compact system representation than distributed and centralized mdp while the two models are similar they differ in that the swarmdps 1 do not have an individual level reward function and 2 only provide a transition density function for the global state system our proposed mdp provides individual level and swarm level reward functions the individual level reward function can be used to describe the private or local benefits for an agent while the swarm level reward function provides us an option to describe the swarm s task in a bird s eye view furthermore our proposed mdp provides individual level and swarm level state transition models the individual level state transition model describes the agent s local state transition without regard to other agents or environmental constraints while the swarm level state transition model describes the state transition of the whole swarm system which may include agents interactions constraints or other factors i e noise since the policy of fish agents essentially maps the agent s observation into a probability distribution over an agent s potential actions the agent s observation representation is a key component in obtaining the policy by learning in this paper the observation of the fish agents is represented with a multi channel image where the image channels can contain different features agents position and orientation based on a local view of an agent but most existing studies describe an agent s observation with high level variables such as the angle between its current direction and the average direction of its neighbors or the poses of the k nearest neighbors while this makes policy mapping simpler and easier to learn it is also unrealistic in contrast our image like observation for one fish agent is closer to the sensory perception of real fish but is more difficult to implement particularly as the number of fish agents increase fortunately our proposed mfq based method can easily overcome this and our results show that the fish agents can still learn a policy that produces collective motion in a rl setting agents not only interact with the environment but also with each other thus large number of agents worsen the computational complexity of learning resulting in models that are unstable and fail to converge matignon et al 2012 in this paper we use mfq to train collective motion models so that the interactions within the population of fish agents are approximated by those between the focal fish agent and the average effect from the neighboring agents as the mfq iteratively learns each agent s best response to the mean effect from its neighbors effectively transforming the many entity problem into a two entity problem thus with mfq the computational complexity of learning becomes independent of the number of agents it should be noted that we approximate an inherently continuous time process of fish schooling movement into discrete time intervals for ease of computation at each time step each individual fish perceives the spatial location orientation and position of its neighbors it s observation determines its action and performs it assuming the action does not result in a with another individual to simplify the mathematical treatment we assume that all fish agents universally undergo synchronous updating meaning that all fish agents perceive their spatial information simultaneously and undertake their actions at the same time examining the three different collective patterns founding during the training process we found that the highly parallel pattern is more likely to appear when the number of fish agents is small and the rotating full core milling pattern and the rotating hollow core milling pattern are more likely to appear when the number of fish agents is large therefore we presume that the rotating full core milling pattern and the rotating hollow core milling pattern in fish agent schools may be evolutionary behaviors to reduce collisions with their neighbors fish schools could form the rotating hollow core milling pattern when encountering predators in the real life and could form the rotating full core milling pattern when foraging in the nature furthermore it is noteworthy that the policies that produced the three collective patterns are obtained with the same neural network in the same environment but in different training phases which indicates that our proposed method has the potential to acquire the policies generating various patterns of fish schooling observed in nature however due to the nature of neural network modeling we only obtain a policy at the end of training that consistently produces the collective pattern of highly parallel we suspect that the other two policies are lost due to the phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting of neural networks french 1999 catastrophic forgetting is when a connectionist networks forget all previously learned information in the process of learning new information neural networks are particularly prone to catastrophic forgetting a known weakness of such models as they are unable to learn multiple tasks sequentially if we had a mechanism to record the policies of all collective patterns utilized in the course of training then the learned policy needed to generate the different collective patterns would be obtained in summary reinforcement learning rl has made significant progress in recent years and it has achieved great success in solving various sequential decision making problems mnih et al 2015 silver et al 2016 multi agent reinforcement learning marl is the integration of multi agent systems and reinforcement learning that only enables the agent to learn by itself by interacting with the environment in a trial and error way but also solves the problems of convergence and the curse of dimensionality swarming animals can be viewed as a multi agent system and using marl allows individuals to be modeled as agents with behavioral learning processes realistic to real animals without the need for pre specified interaction rules so it is a natural way to use marl to study the swarming behavior of such a system and also a behavioral learning simulation approach that is closer to real animals furthermore it is a promising way to allow the agent to autonomously discover previously unknown rules thus multi agent reinforcement learning can be a potentially powerful tool to model analyze and understand the behavior of complicated fish schooling 5 conclusion in this paper we developed an mfq based method to model collective motion for fish schooling specifically we modeled a fish as a learning agent whose policy was employed as an effective brain to each agent in the collective motion model the policy can be obtained via the mfq algorithm even though the observation was represented with a multi channel image containing more low level details and the reward function was designed only with the number of neighbors and consecutive collisions between individuals the results showed that the learned policy can produce collective motion even in groups of different sizes the properties of collective motion that emerged from the learned policy were similar to those of classical collective motion to the best of our knowledge there are no previous studies that model the collective motion of fish schools using multi agent reinforcement learning algorithms improving upon classic models our marl based model does not directly provide or impose interaction rules between individuals in advance but allows them to emerge as the result of learning in a given task environment thus such a marl based model allows us to directly test whether the benefits are a possible causal explanation for the observed behavior interestingly three different collective motion patterns which can be seen in nature were observed during the training process however the concrete reasons for these phenomena are still unclear as the interpretability of neural networks considered a black box approach is not straightforward and is a hot topic and an active area of research in the field of machine learning therefore the mechanistic reasons behind the emergence of these three collective patterns is the subject of future research credit authorship contribution statement xin wang conceptualization methodology software formal

24247,in this paper a stochastic nutrient plankton model with regime switching is proposed where the regime switching plankton mortality is described by a continuous time markov chain with different states we study the effects of regime switching plankton mortality on the distribution of plankton biomass as well as the persistence and extinction of plankton populations moreover we show that there exists a unique stationary distribution in the model which is ergodic indicating that the plankton populations will survive forever by applying a sophisticated sensitivity analysis technique we found that the phytoplankton biomass is highly sensitive to the grazing rate by zooplankton and least sensitive to the re mineralization of dead biomass of plankton into nutrients concentration the numerical results show that the persistence and extinction of plankton populations is sensitive to variations of nutrient input we find that the noise can enhance the oscillations of plankton biomass and the regime switching plankton mortality has capacity to decrease the amplitudes of the oscillations in the bloom phase our findings emphasize that the regime switching plankton mortality contributes to the survival of plankton populations in the aquatic system keywords nutrient input regime switching plankton mortality stochastic permanence stationary distribution sensitivity data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction phytoplankton blooms are the rapid accumulation of algae to sufficient numbers sometimes millions of cells per litre resulting in severe negative consequences such as oxygen depletion fish mortality and human illness anderson 1997 results from both the experimental and field observations demonstrated that planktonic ecosystems are affected by many factors such as light burson et al 2019 temperature righetti et al 2019 nutrients burson et al 2018 and zooplankton huisman et al 2018 the complexity of planktonic ecosystems contributes to the difficulty in preventing the occurrence of massive phytoplankton blooms dai et al 2019 for instance the results reported by jiang et al 2015 suggest that phytoplankton community in different areas of lake erie show different sensitivities to nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in fact blooms are likely to be occurred in response to a combination of climatic and hydrographic events and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics results in the unpredictable algal blooms anderson et al 2002 mcgowan et al 2017 bruno et al 1989 actually the growth responses of plankton are inevitably affected by random fluctuations freund et al 2006 which result in the stochastic scale and timing of blooms for example it may occur in bays or estuaries to thousands of square kilometres and last in a few weeks to years anderson 1997 the appearance of algal blooms is often considered as one of the key signals of eutrophication huppert et al 2002 indicating the balance between the processes of algae production the broken consumption cloern 2001 the growing evidences support that the phytoplankton blooms are generally followed by a sudden termination within a few days aberle et al 2007 abada et al 2021 which demonstrates that mortality rates are higher during the decline phase in comparison to the development phase of blooms garcés et al 2005 still the underlying cause remains a mystery in recent years the sudden collapse of phytoplankton blooms has drawn increasing attention among the research scientists abada et al 2021 reported that the no secretion by algae and the dramatic decrease in dissolved oxygen levels attributes to higher phytoplankton mortality and further promote the collapse of the entire algal population specifically the findings of børsheim et al 2005 demonstrated that phytoplankton mortality varies between 8 to 18 of present biomass per day in the development phase and reaches 45 in the bloom phase then followed by a collapse of the bloom indicating that phytoplankton mortality is an important factor regulating bloom termination phytoplankton mortality has been measured in several experimental studies the mortality of natural single alexandrium spp cells during the development maintenance and decline phases of blooms were studied by garcés et al 2005 using a dilution experiment their results indicate that the mortality rates of alexandrium taylori one of single alexandrium spp ranged from 0 2 to 0 65 d 1 with the highest mortality rates during the decline phase this might be the fast growing algae causes dramatic decrease in dissolved oxygen levels due to the metabolism of algae cloern 2001 additionally the decreased light penetration in the bottom of water also results in the decrease of oxygen production møhlenberg 1999 furthermore as the decomposition of dead algae quickly results in depletion of dissolved oxygen and creates a hypoxic or anoxic dead zone lacking sufficient oxygen to support the aquatic organisms anderson 1997 chislock et al 2013 the zooplankton mortality varies substantially in the decline phase of bloom events after the massive death of algae lin et al 2014 boyd et al 1975 measured the average density of anabaena variabilis filaments and the concentration of dissolved oxygen before and after the phytoplankton die off their findings showed that the average density of anabaena variabilis filaments increases from 2440 cells ml 1 to 3600 cells ml 1 in the development phase with the peaks reaching 37300 cells ml 1 and then suddenly decreases to less than 1000 cells ml 1 in the following days while the concentration of dissolved oxygen dramatically decreases from 9 mg l to 0 15 mg l the sharp increase in plankton mortality during the decline phase can be described by the so called colored noise specifically the telegraph noise that can be represented by a finite state markov chain switching between two or more environmental regimes liu and wang 2010 du et al 2004 usually the switching among different environments is memoryless and the waiting time for next switch follows exponential distribution zou and wang 2014 luo and mao 2007 li et al 2009 over the last few decades a number of stochastic models have been used to explore the dynamics of phytoplankton growth additionally stochastic noise has been proven to suppress or express exponential growth in population dynamics mao et al 2002 deng et al 2008 in addition to the white noise the aquatic ecosystems are greatly affected by colored noise for example the growth environment in winter will be much different from those in summer resulting in the seasonal changes in the diversity of phytoplankton in fact the changes between different regimes can be described by the markov chain and their effects on population dynamics have been extensively explored yu et al 2019 studied a nutrient plankton food chain model with regime switching and found that the markov chain is beneficial for the survival of plankton the study of chen et al 2020 demonstrated that the markov chain will balance the density of the population under different regimes although considerable efforts have been devoted to understanding the factors regulating the development of phytoplankton blooms the dynamical behaviors induced by regime switching plankton mortality remains largely unexplored in the study of plankton dynamics constant phytoplankton mortality is commonly used however the constant phytoplankton mortality could not explain the sudden decline of phytoplankton blooms considering the variability in the mortality of phytoplankton as observed in the previous experimental studies it is unrealistic to represent the phytoplankton mortality by a constant in this paper we describe the regime switching plankton mortality by using a continuous time markov chain with different states and present a stochastic nutrient plankton model to investigate the effects of regime switching plankton mortality on the phytoplankton growth dynamics the rest of the paper is organized as follows the mathematical model is presented in the very next section in section 3 the dynamical behaviors of the proposed model are investigated some numerical simulations are performed in section 4 to explore the model s dynamics and complexity in the aquatic system we also done sensitivity analysis that will help in finding out the crucial parameters causing terminating the planktonic bloom in section 5 we discuss the implications of the results obtained in this study lastly some conclusions are provided in section 6 2 the mathematical model in recent years nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton type food web models have been widely employed in aquatic ecosystem studies with basic assumptions that the phytoplankton absorbs nutrients and is grazed upon by the herbivorous zooplankton mitra 2009 jang et al 2006 in aquatic ecosystems a number of factors such as light and temperature are responsible for the growth of phytoplankton to avoid any model complexity here we do not consider the effects of light and temperature on the phytoplankton growth and assume that the growth of phytoplankton fully depends on the availability of nutrients whereas all other environmental factors e g light temperature etc are assumed to be sufficiently abundant here we modify the aquatic planktonic ecosystem model presented by ruan 2001 which has been widely implemented the model is composed of nutrient phytoplankton and zooplankton the nutrient concentration consists of nutrient input nutrient washout and its uptake by phytoplankton further the process of nutrient regeneration due to bacterial decomposition of the dead biomass of plankton is involved which has been widely reported guo et al 2020 ruan 1993 zhuang et al 2021 the phytoplankton biomass is determined by two parts the growth caused by the conversion of nutrients and the loss caused by predation and natural death in addition the predation is described by the beddington deangelis functional response beddington 1975 deangelis et al 1975 the zooplankton biomass is determined by the growth caused by the conversion of phytoplankton and the loss caused by natural death at any time t 0 let n t p t and z t represent the nutrient concentration phytoplankton density and zooplankton density respectively the model is formulated based on the following assumptions 1 phytoplankton growth is assumed to depend on nutrient concentration and zooplankton predation 2 the nutrient uptake by phytoplankton follows logistic law and the predation is described by the beddington deangelis form beddington 1975 deangelis et al 1975 β p z 1 m z n p where β represents the consumption rate and m and n denote the mutual interference between zooplankton and the phytoplankton saturation constant respectively 3 following ruan 1993 we consider constant nutrient input and washout rates as s 0 and d to the lake ecosystem respectively let α stands for the maximal nutrient uptake by the phytoplankton 4 both phytoplankton and zooplankton die naturally in the aquatic ecosystem at the constant rates c and b respectively 5 the dead biomass of phytoplankton zooplankton is termed as detritus by the ecologists worldwide indeed the dead biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton are first converted into detritus then they are decomposed by micro organisms and at the end of the process nutrients are regenerated to avoid any model complexity we did not consider here an explicit dynamics of detritus in the nutrient plankton model thakur et al 2021 6 we consider that the nutrients are partially recycled from the dead biomass of plankton by bacterial decomposition for simplicity we neglect the time required to regenerate nutrient and consider the nutrient recycling as an instantaneous term we denote by h and δ as the nutrient recycling rates from the dead biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton respectively 7 indeed the aquatic ecosystems are inevitably affected by random perturbations coming from the environment in this context the environmental variables can act as noise sources because of their random fluctuations which results in a stochastic dynamics to the plankton model denaro et al 2013 valenti et al 2016 in line with the previous studies zhao 2016 zou and wang 2014 luo and mao 2007 we use here the white noise to represent the random fluctuations in the natural world based on the above assumptions a model schematic diagram is shown in fig 1 in the figure the dashed lines reflect the fact that the dead biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton are not directly converting into the nutrients instead they are firstly converting into an intermediate substance detritus and then into nutrient concentration we come up with the following stochastic nutrient plankton model 1 d n t d s 0 n t α p t n t h p t δ z t d t σ 1 n t d b 1 t d p t α p t n t c p t β p t z

for i 1 2 3 in addition model 1 shares common biological meaning with other phytoplankton growth models the biological meanings of variables and parameters involved in the model 1 are listed in table 1 note that the constant plankton mortality is well accepted in most of the aquatic ecosystem models however in natural aquatic ecosystems the peak of phytoplankton biomass is generally followed by a sudden decline within a few days and then it moves to the next bloom cycle more importantly several empirical evidences supported that the plankton mortality varies in different phases of blooms for example choi et al 2017 measured the loss of biomass of alexandrium fundyense in the bloom and decline phases the results showed that the peak concentrations of alexandrium fundyense reaches 1 1 0 6 cells l 1 in the bloom phase and then dramatically decreases in the decline phase and eventually drop to less than 1000 cells l 1 furthermore boyd et al 1975 measured the average density of anabaena variabilis filaments and the concentration of dissolved oxygen in different phases of bloom the experimental evidence showed that the average density of anabaena variabilis filaments increases from 3600 cells ml 1 to 37300 cells ml 1 in the bloom phase and then sharply decreases to less than 1000 cells ml 1 in the decline phase of bloom while the concentration of dissolved oxygen dramatically decreases from 9 mg l to 0 15 mg l resulting in the massive death of aerobic organisms obviously the plankton mortality shows significant differences between the bloom and decline phases of bloom events thus the shifting plankton mortality can be described as a random switching between two or more environmental regimes liu and wang 2010 du et al 2004 keeping in mind the experimental evidences børsheim et al 2005 boyd et al 1975 we describe the regime switching plankton mortality as a continuous time markov chain with different states and denote the mortality of phytoplankton and zooplankton as c 1 c 2 and b 1 b 2 respectively thus the presented model accounted for both colored and white noise is shown as follows 2 d n t d r t s 0 r t n t α r t p t n t h r t p t δ r t z t d t

represents a continuous time markov chain with state space s 1 2 n 1 n throughout this paper the processes b i t and r t are defined on a complete probability space ω f f t t 0 p and r t is independent of b i t i 1 2 3 from biological points of view initial value n 0 p 0 z 0 r 3 and all parameters are assumed to be positive the model 2 shares common biological meaning with the previous model 1 denoting r n as the positive cone in r n for a vector f f 1 f 2 f n we denote by f ˆ min k s f k f ˇ max k s f k let r t be a right continuous markov chain with state space s 1 2 n 1 n and q i

i j s and q i j 0 if i j while q i i i j q i j in addition we suppose that the markov chain r t is irreducible and independent of the brownian motion b l t l 1 2 3 hence the markov chain r t is ergodic and has a unique stationary distribution π π 1 π 2 π n which is the solution of the following equation π q 0 i s π i 1 a n d π i 0 i s by now we have developed a nutrient plankton model for the effects of regime switching plankton mortality on the phytoplankton growth dynamics 3 the main results in view of gray et al 2011 for any given initial value n 0 p 0 z 0 r 0 r 3 s the stochastic model 2 has a unique positive solution n t p t z t r t for all t 0 further according to lemma 2 3 in zhao 2016 the following relations hold almost surely 3 lim t sup n t p t z t lim t 1 t 0 t σ 1 r s

model 2 we present the following theorem theorem 3 1 for any initial value there exist χ 0 and ɛ 0 1 such that lim t sup p n t p t z t n 2 t p 2 t z 2 t χ ɛ that is the solution of model 2 is stochastically ultimately bounded the proof is given in appendix a theorem 3 1 shows that the solutions of model 2 are bounded for sufficiently large time 3 2 stochastic permanence let h max d ˇ c ˇ h ˆ b ˇ δ ˆ for the stochastic permanence of the model 2 we have the following result lemma 3 1 if κ is a positive constant such that 0 κ 1 2 max σ ˇ 1 2 σ ˇ 2 2 σ ˇ 3 2 d ˆ s ˆ 0 h then the solution of model 2 has the following property lim t sup e x t κ π where π 3 κ 4 ρ f 1 f 2 2 4 ρ f 1 max 1 2 f 1 f 2 f 2 2 4 f 1 ρ 2 f 1 f 1 κ d ˆ s ˆ 0 h κ 1 2 max σ ˇ 1 2 σ ˇ 2 2 σ ˇ 3 2 ρ 0 f 2 κ h max σ ˇ 1 2

ˆ 0 h then the solution of model 2 is stochastically permanent the proof is given in appendix c theorem 3 2 provides that the model 2 is stochastically permanent if the environmental fluctuation is less than the threshold that is we can control the noise intensity to ensure the stochastic permanence 3 3 the persistence and extinction of plankton in this subsection we will prove the extinction and persistence of plankton in the aquatic system for the sake of convenience we introduce the following notations for all k s γ k α k c k h k d k v k η k α k b k δ k d k v k r 0 s k s π k v k d k s 0 k c k 1 2 σ 2 2 k r 1 s k s π k b k 1 2 σ 3 2 k β k n k where v k is the solution of eq 5 we make the following assumption assumption 1 q i j 0 i j i j s to begin with we present two lemmas as follows lemma 3 2 the linear system 5 d k v k l s q k l v l α k 0 k s admits a unique solution v v 1 v 2 v n t the proof is given in appendix d to deduce the following lemma we present two auxiliary results in appendix e lemma 3 3 for model 2 if lim t p t 0 a s then lim t z t 0 a s the proof is given in appendix f from the above auxiliary results we present the following theorem regarding the persistence and extinction of plankton theorem 3 3 if min k s c k h k d k 0 and min k s b k δ k d k 0 then the solution n t p t z t r t of model 2 has the following properties i if r 0 s 0 then lim t p t 0 lim t

d lim t z t 0 a s that is phytoplankton is persistent in mean and zooplankton extinct from the aquatic system the proof is given in appendix g theorem 3 3 indicates that the extinction and persistence in mean of plankton depend on r 0 s and r 1 s for r 0 s 0 both phytoplankton and zooplankton extinct for sufficiently large time meanwhile when r 0 s 0 and r 1 s 0 the phytoplankton is persistent in mean and zooplankton extinct from the aquatic system 3 4 ergodicity of model 2 in this subsection we will derive conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution of model 2 following yu et al 2019 and zhu and yin 2007 we present the theorem below theorem 3 4 let assumption 1 holds if for given initial condition n 0 p 0 z 0 r 0 r 3 s min d ˆ c ˆ h ˇ b ˆ δ ˇ 1 2 max σ ˆ 1 2 σ ˆ 2 2 σ ˆ 3 2 and r 2 s 0 then the stochastic process n t p t z t r t defined by the solution of model 2 is ergodic and has a unique stationary distribution in r 3 s the proof is given in appendix h theorem 3 4 provides the sufficient condition for the existence of ergodic stationary distribution it shows that if the intensities of the white noises are within the threshold and r 2 s 0 the stochastic process n t p t z t r t is ergodic and admits a unique stationary distribution next we investigate the explicit lower bound for phytoplankton to this we give the following assumption from eq 4 assumption 2 for arbitrary 0 ι 1 there exists a set ω ι ω with p ω ι 1 ι and a constant f f ι such that for ω ω ι and t f lim sup t 1 t 0 t β ˆ p s d s lim t 1 t 0 t b r s 1 2 σ 3 2 r s d s ι now we present the following theorem theorem 3 5 let assumptions 1 and 2 hold if min d ˆ c ˆ h ˇ b ˆ δ ˇ 1 2 max σ ˆ 1 2 σ ˆ 2 2 σ ˆ 3 2 then for model 2 whenever r 2 s β ˇ β ˆ m ˆ there exists a constant ς such that lim inf t 1 t 0 t p s d s ς 0 lim inf t 1 t 0 t z s d s r 2 s β ˇ β ˆ m ˆ a s that is both phytoplankton and zooplankton are persistent in mean for the proof see appendix i biologically theorem 3 5 tells that if the environmental noise is within the threshold and r 2 s β ˇ β ˆ m ˆ then both phytoplankton and zooplankton will survive forever 4 numerical simulations in this section we present some numerical results to further investigate how regime switching plankton mortality affect the distribution of plankton biomass in the aquatic system unless otherwise mentioned the parameter values used for numerical results will be the same as in table 1 moreover we assume that the transition rate from state 1 to state 2 is the same as the transition rate from state 2 to state 1 we choose q 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 the nutrient input s 0 consumption rate β phytoplankton mortality c and zooplankton mortality b are the mainly control parameters 4 1 sensitivity analysis in comparison with the effects of simply varying the parameters to look at the outcome of the model the techniques of sensitivity analysis are mathematically more sophisticated here we use a basic differential analysis approach to determine the semi relative and logarithmic sensitivity solutions of the model 1 for both the plankton populations in the absence of environmental noise bortz and nelson 2004 misra et al 2016 note that the semi relative sensitivity of the model solutions for a variable x to a parameter y is given by y x t y y and is computed by formally differentiating the model 1 without environmental noise with respect to y and interchanging the order of time and parameter derivative since we have 3 state variables we get a system of 3 equations for the sensitivity functions x y t y x y t y 6 d d t x t y f x x t y f y with initial conditions x 0 y 0 here f x represents the jacobian of the model 1 without environmental noise and f y is the derivative of the right side of model 1 which is represented by f t x y with respect to y to get the sensitivity functions first we solve model 6 for x y t y by coupling it with the original model 1 without environmental noise total 3 3 equations the values of the sensitivity functions provide the rates of change of the variables with respect to the change in the chosen parameter y as time progresses for example p β 80 0 5 0 112 means that the derivative of p with respect to β at t 80 days and β 0 5 per day is 0 112 μ g day l finally the semi relative sensitivity solutions are calculated by simply multiplying the unmodified sensitivity functions by the parameter y i e y x y t y which provides the amount the state will change when the parameter y is doubled i e a perturbation on the order of y the sensitivities of plankton densities are plotted for seven most sensitive relevant parameters s 0 α β h δ c and b fig 2 among these parameters only s 0 can be influenced by human activities from the graph it is clear that the perturbations of the parameters exhibit their greatest influences early in the simulation with a large initial expected variation in the plankton densities it is clear that the doubling of s 0 and α will yield sudden increase of plankton densities by time around t 43 days there is a huge increase in the density of phytoplankton at 43 days followed by a sudden huge decrease just after few days such decrease in density of phytoplankton is due to the less availability of the nutrients as they are uptaken by the phytoplankton on the other hand on doubling the uptake rate of phytoplankton by zooplankton β the biomass of phytoplankton decreases whereas that of zooplankton increases in the initial phase of time but as time flows the biomass of zooplankton decreases and of the phytoplankton boosts up again we see an increment in the zooplankton and decrement in the phytoplankton biomasses with passages of time on doubling the mortality rate of phytoplankton c the biomasses of both the plankton significantly changes in the aquatic system the densities of phytoplankton increases whereas of the zooplankton decreases significantly at the initial stage on doubling the mortality rate of the latter the plankton densities in the aquatic system are least sensitive to the re mineralization of dead biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton however different parameters have different strength of influences s 0 has its greatest influence on phytoplankton as well as zooplankton densities it is to be noted here that these outcomes greatly depend on the parameterization of the model next we look at the logarithmic sensitivity solutions l o g x l o g y t y x t y x y t y with respect to all of the previously mentioned parameters fig 2 b these quantities are dimensionless and indicate what percentage change of the variables can be expected from a doubling of a parameter y thus to get a complete idea about the sensitivity of the solutions on a particular parameter it is best to calculate semi relative as well as logarithmic sensitivity solutions fig 2 b shows that doubling of the parameters s 0 α h δ and b results in 34 62 34 62 1 42 1 42 and 98 01 increment in the density of phytoplankton respectively at the end of 80 days on the other hand the density of phytoplankton reduces by 112 7 and 19 22 on doubling the parameters β and c respectively at 80 days similarly the figure displays that at the end of 80 days the zooplankton density reduced by 71 46 128 1 and 48 06 on doubling the parameters β c and b respectively further it is apparent from the figure that the zooplankton density boosts up by 235 7 190 4 7 275 and 7 275 at the end of 80 days on doubling the values of model parameters s 0 α h and δ further we see the mean value of the solution of the deterministic model by choosing constant plankton mortality rate and fixing β c b 0 5 with respect to nutrient input in fig 3 obviously the mean of plankton biomass increases with an increase in the nutrient input level as the nutrient input exceeds a threshold value the plankton populations can coexist in the aquatic system 4 2 effects of regime shifting plankton mortality fig 4 gives three different types of the model model 1 model 2 without noise and model 2 for their sensitivity to changes in the nutrient input since the concentration of available nutrient is one of the decisive factors controlling phytoplankton productivity häder and gao 2015 instead of increasing and decreasing parameter values by a defined percentage the entire range of possible values of nutrient input is determined by previous studies the other parameter values used for the model analysis are same as in table 1 the sensitivity analysis is conducted through changing the nutrient input to observe its effects on the biomass of plankton populations the analysis show that the persistence and extinction of plankton populations can be divided into three stages see fig 4 when the nutrient input is low under the white dash line both phytoplankton and zooplankton populations will die out eventually with an increase in the nutrient input phytoplankton population is persistent and zooplankton population tends to extinct above the white dash line and below the red dash line after the nutrient input exceeds the critical value above red dash line both phytoplankton and zooplankton populations can coexist forever moreover it is worthy to note that nutrient input enhances the amplitude of the oscillation because higher plankton biomass is achieved on increasing the nutrient input the results from fig 4 imply that the persistence and extinction of plankton populations are sensitive to the variations of nutrient inputs additionally fig 4 shows an another important result when the white noise is applied on the deterministic model figs 4 a and 4 b showcases that the plankton density always oscillates instead of maintaining a certain level further we describe the shifting plankton mortality with the right continuous markov chain r t on state space s 1 2 and the low mortality of plankton is set at 0 4 d 1 while the high mortality of plankton is set at 0 7 d 1 figs 4 c and 4 d display the solution of model 2 without noise and the results indicate that the plankton biomass oscillates in a smaller range but shows obvious switching between different states clearly the switching phenomenon is induced by shifting plankton mortality in addition figs 4 e and 4 f are given to investigate the effect of regime switching plankton mortality on the plankton biomass distribution in a stochastic environment it is obvious from figs 4 e and 4 f that the oscillation range of plankton biomass becomes large and the switching between different states also becomes more pronounced apparently the regime switching plankton mortality significantly affect the planktonic ecosystem in a stochastic environment in the study of stochastic population dynamics persistence and extinction are important topics from theorem 3 3 we know that the extinction and persistence in mean of plankton depend on r 0 s and r 1 s for β s 0 0 5 we get r 0 s 0 195 0 which means that both phytoplankton and zooplankton extinct according to theorem 3 3 i see fig 5 a next we fix β 0 2 s 0 1 and get that r 0 s 0 2050 0 r 1 s 0 195 0 which represent the fact that phytoplankton is persistent in mean and zooplankton is extinct according to theorem 3 3 ii see fig 5 b the results from figs 5 a 5 b reveal that higher nutrient input and less consumption of phytoplankton by zooplankton contribute to the survival of phytoplankton population in the aquatic system again we pick β 0 5 s 0 12 and get r 2 s 3 32202 β ˆ β ˇ m ˆ 1 25 0 according to theorems 3 4 3 5 the model 2 is persistent in mean and shows a unique stationary distribution i e the plankton species can survive forever see fig 5 c in order to investigate the distributions of phytoplankton biomass in different states we choose s 0 8 β 0 5 in model 2 and show the path of markov chain in fig 6 a additionally fig 6 b displays the sample paths for the phytoplankton population in state 1 state 2 and hybrid model respectively apparently phytoplankton population extinct in state 1 but is persistent in state 2 as well as hybrid model moreover the distributions of phytoplankton biomass in state 1 state 2 and hybrid model demonstrate that the markov chain contributes to the enhancement in the oscillation cycles of the plankton see fig 6 c fig 6 d displays the distribution of phytoplankton biomass with respect to nutrient input s 0 which indicates that the increasing nutrient input leads to a significant increase in the variance of phytoplankton biomass fig 7 shows the mean and the variance of plankton biomass under three conditions for s 0 1 2 10 the results imply that both the variance and the mean of plankton biomass show overall an increasing trend as nutrient input increases when plankton community suffered from nutrient deficiency the mean and the variance of phytoplankton biomass are lower for the shifting plankton mortality than that for the constant plankton mortality but the variance of phytoplankton biomass in model 2 shows comparatively a large increasing trend in contrast the zooplankton tends to be extinct when the nutrient input is low moreover with an increase in the nutrient input the variances of plankton biomass with shifting plankton mortality show a faster increasing trend obviously the regime switching plankton mortality significantly increases the ranges of distribution and oscillation intensity of phytoplankton biomass which suggests that such plankton mortality is beneficial for the survival of phytoplankton under high nutrient level plethora of research studies supported the fact that the growth rate of phytoplankton may not be able to maintain a high level of plankton in the aquatic system due to the zooplankton grazing and the intraspecific competition among the plankton for the available resources such as light and nutrient sommer 1991 sommer 2012 the results from fig 7 imply that when the nutrient input exceeds a critical level zooplankton appear in the aquatic system and the mean and the variance of phytoplankton biomass show relatively slower increasing trends while the mean of zooplankton biomass has a larger increasing trend a possible explanation behind this behavior of plankton might be the predation by zooplankton and the competition for resources by phytoplankton at last we give the sample paths of model 2 for plankton in fig 8 which reveals that the increasing input of nutrients leads to a marked increase in the amplitude of planktonic oscillations 5 discussion the sudden changes in plankton mortality have been observed in several experimental studies thus considering the impact of shifting plankton mortality on population growth of planktonic algae in crucial in this study a nutrient plankton model considering shifting plankton mortality is developed the theoretical results imply that when the minimum plankton mortality is beyond a threshold value the extinction and persistence in mean of plankton depend on r 0 s and r 1 s it is observed that the model 2 possesses an ergodic stationary distribution that is ergodic indicating that the plankton populations can survive forever moving beyond the theoretical analysis several numerical simulations have been carried out to explore the plankton dynamics our sensitivity results indicated that the biomasses of planktons in the aquatic system are highly sensitive to the input rates of nutrients grazing rate of phytoplankton by zooplankton and the mortality rates of planktons these results emphasize that one must focus on the control of the input rate of nutrients coming to the lakes from outsides during the bloom phase furthermore three different types of the model model 1 model 2 without noise and model 2 for their sensitivity to changes in the nutrient input is shown in fig 4 it has been well documented that the nutrient availability is directly related to the phytoplankton growth häder and gao 2015 elliott et al 2006 and the distribution of phytoplankton biomass is sensitive to nutrient input elliott et al 2006 fig 4 clearly showed that when the nutrient input is less than a certain level both phytoplankton and zooplankton populations tend to extinct if the nutrient input is between the white and red dash lines phytoplankton population is persistent and zooplankton population disappear from the aquatic system as the nutrient input exceeds the red dash line both phytoplankton and zooplankton populations can coexist forever fig 4 suggested that nutrient input plays an important role in determining the survival of plankton the persistence and extinction of plankton populations are sensitive to variations of nutrient input here our findings are concurred with the results reported by elliott et al 2006 additionally fig 4 shows a comparison of the plankton biomass in three different models the differences in dynamics depending on the of models are governed by nutrient input the results from sherratt and smith 2008 supported that the population density always shows the oscillatory behavior due to the existence of noise and other factors as shown in figs 4 a 4 b the plankton population density is always oscillating instead of maintaining a certain level owing to the existence of environmental noise which is consistent with the findings of sherratt and smith 2008 by contrast for the model 2 without noise see figs 4 c 4 d the oscillation intensity of plankton biomass remains lower than that in figs 4 a 4 b due to the lack of environmental noise however the distribution of plankton biomass is switching between different states which is not observed in figs 4 a 4 b one possible explanation is that the increasing plankton mortality leads to a sudden collapse of plankton populations figs 4 e 4 f showcase that the switching becomes more pronounced due to the coupling between noise and shifting plankton mortality and the oscillation intensity of the plankton biomass is significantly stronger than figs 4 c 4 d these results further indicate that the noise can enhance the oscillation of plankton biomass and the high plankton mortality in the decline phase results in a dramatic collapse in the phytoplankton population which agree with the experimental results mentioned in børsheim et al 2005 choi et al 2017 and boyd et al 1975 in the study of stochastic population dynamics the persistence and extinction of interacting populations are the most important topics liu and wang 2010 de la hoz and vadillo 2012 from the biological points of view the stochastic persistence means that the population will survive forever fig 5 displays the persistence and extinction of the plankton populations in the model 2 apparently the plankton populations will survive forever under certain conditions see fig 5 c besides the stochastic persistence of the model we have studied how shifting plankton mortality affects the survival of phytoplankton population in the aquatic habitat see fig 6 fig 6 b depicted that the phytoplankton population is extinct in state 1 but is persistent in state 2 when the nutrient input is low the phytoplankton population in hybrid model is persistent it is inferred from fig 6 b that under the influence of the markov chain although the phytoplankton population tends to extinct in one state it still has a chance to be persistent under high nutrient input the regime switching plankton mortality can enhance the oscillation intensity of phytoplankton density that is to say the model with regime switching plankton mortality is more beneficial for the survival of plankton populations in comparison to the case when plankton mortality is constant see fig 6 c while comparing with the regime switching plankton mortality nutrient has been proved to be an important factor influencing the growth of phytoplankton in the aquatic system the distribution of phytoplankton biomass with respect to nutrient input suggested that the increasing nutrient level enhances the biomass of phytoplankton in the model see fig 6 d the capability of nutrient loading in stimulating the growth of phytoplankton is well demonstrated in ramin et al 2012 indeed extensive researches have established that the total phytoplankton biomass may be ultimately responsive to the changes in nutrient availability carpenter et al 2016 salmaso 2010 and that the external nutrient loading is a significant factor which is positively related to the total phytoplankton biomass ramin et al 2012 our simulation results revealed that the nutrient input shows a positive control on the mean as well as variance of the phytoplankton biomass see fig 7 additionally the nutrient input can significantly increase the zooplankton biomass as the increase of phytoplankton biomass due to nutrient input provides sufficient food for the grazer zooplankton however the growth rate of phytoplankton shows a decreasing trend after the nutrient input exceeds a threshold value it is well documented that the phytoplankton abundance is moderately increasing rather than being maintained at a high level following the nutrient enrichment in the aquatic system ramin et al 2012 moreover fig 7 showed that the plankton biomass in model 2 has the highest mean as well as variance values in contrast to model 1 and the model 2 without noise this suggests that the shifting plankton mortality is more beneficial for the survival of plankton population in the aquatic system in comparison to case when the plankton experiences constant mortality this might be due to the sudden collapse of algal population that makes it possible to create a suitable environment for plankton to grow and provide chance for their survival 6 conclusion a stochastic nutrient plankton model incorporating regime switching plankton mortality is implemented here several theoretical and numerical analyses are presented aiming to understand how shifting plankton mortality affect the phytoplankton growth dynamics analytically we derived the threshold value for the survival of plankton species and obtained conditions under which the model is persistent or one of the plankton populations goes to extinction further we showed that the model 2 admits an ergodic stationary distribution in addition the numerical results revealed that the coupling between noise and regime switching plankton mortality are not only capable of enhancing oscillatory behavior of plankton populations but also decrease the amplitude of the plankton oscillations in the bloom phase our simulation results indicated that nutrient loading in the aquatic system is an important factor in controlling phytoplankton biomass whereas the regime switching plankton mortality provided higher survival chance for plankton populations it is worth noting that the importance of our proposed model is then not the precision with which it predicted specific events within a particular lake ocean but its contribution to the studies on how the regime switching plankton mortality influences phytoplankton growth in the lakes and oceans additionally the results obtained in this study may provide a reasonable explanation for the observed sharp collapse of a phytoplankton bloom in the experiments further it is worthy to note that considering the explicit role of detritus the dead biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton in the model 2 will mimic a more realistic situation of the nutrient plankton model in our future work we will investigate the dynamics of nutrient plankton model with explicit role of detritus and will explore more rich and complex dynamics of the planktonic bloom credit authorship contribution statement qing guo

24247,in this paper a stochastic nutrient plankton model with regime switching is proposed where the regime switching plankton mortality is described by a continuous time markov chain with different states we study the effects of regime switching plankton mortality on the distribution of plankton biomass as well as the persistence and extinction of plankton populations moreover we show that there exists a unique stationary distribution in the model which is ergodic indicating that the plankton populations will survive forever by applying a sophisticated sensitivity analysis technique we found that the phytoplankton biomass is highly sensitive to the grazing rate by zooplankton and least sensitive to the re mineralization of dead biomass of plankton into nutrients concentration the numerical results show that the persistence and extinction of plankton populations is sensitive to variations of nutrient input we find that the noise can enhance the oscillations of plankton biomass and the regime switching plankton mortality has capacity to decrease the amplitudes of the oscillations in the bloom phase our findings emphasize that the regime switching plankton mortality contributes to the survival of plankton populations in the aquatic system keywords nutrient input regime switching plankton mortality stochastic permanence stationary distribution sensitivity data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction phytoplankton blooms are the rapid accumulation of algae to sufficient numbers sometimes millions of cells per litre resulting in severe negative consequences such as oxygen depletion fish mortality and human illness anderson 1997 results from both the experimental and field observations demonstrated that planktonic ecosystems are affected by many factors such as light burson et al 2019 temperature righetti et al 2019 nutrients burson et al 2018 and zooplankton huisman et al 2018 the complexity of planktonic ecosystems contributes to the difficulty in preventing the occurrence of massive phytoplankton blooms dai et al 2019 for instance the results reported by jiang et al 2015 suggest that phytoplankton community in different areas of lake erie show different sensitivities to nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations in fact blooms are likely to be occurred in response to a combination of climatic and hydrographic events and the nonlinearity of ecological dynamics results in the unpredictable algal blooms anderson et al 2002 mcgowan et al 2017 bruno et al 1989 actually the growth responses of plankton are inevitably affected by random fluctuations freund et al 2006 which result in the stochastic scale and timing of blooms for example it may occur in bays or estuaries to thousands of square kilometres and last in a few weeks to years anderson 1997 the appearance of algal blooms is often considered as one of the key signals of eutrophication huppert et al 2002 indicating the balance between the processes of algae production the broken consumption cloern 2001 the growing evidences support that the phytoplankton blooms are generally followed by a sudden termination within a few days aberle et al 2007 abada et al 2021 which demonstrates that mortality rates are higher during the decline phase in comparison to the development phase of blooms garcés et al 2005 still the underlying cause remains a mystery in recent years the sudden collapse of phytoplankton blooms has drawn increasing attention among the research scientists abada et al 2021 reported that the no secretion by algae and the dramatic decrease in dissolved oxygen levels attributes to higher phytoplankton mortality and further promote the collapse of the entire algal population specifically the findings of børsheim et al 2005 demonstrated that phytoplankton mortality varies between 8 to 18 of present biomass per day in the development phase and reaches 45 in the bloom phase then followed by a collapse of the bloom indicating that phytoplankton mortality is an important factor regulating bloom termination phytoplankton mortality has been measured in several experimental studies the mortality of natural single alexandrium spp cells during the development maintenance and decline phases of blooms were studied by garcés et al 2005 using a dilution experiment their results indicate that the mortality rates of alexandrium taylori one of single alexandrium spp ranged from 0 2 to 0 65 d 1 with the highest mortality rates during the decline phase this might be the fast growing algae causes dramatic decrease in dissolved oxygen levels due to the metabolism of algae cloern 2001 additionally the decreased light penetration in the bottom of water also results in the decrease of oxygen production møhlenberg 1999 furthermore as the decomposition of dead algae quickly results in depletion of dissolved oxygen and creates a hypoxic or anoxic dead zone lacking sufficient oxygen to support the aquatic organisms anderson 1997 chislock et al 2013 the zooplankton mortality varies substantially in the decline phase of bloom events after the massive death of algae lin et al 2014 boyd et al 1975 measured the average density of anabaena variabilis filaments and the concentration of dissolved oxygen before and after the phytoplankton die off their findings showed that the average density of anabaena variabilis filaments increases from 2440 cells ml 1 to 3600 cells ml 1 in the development phase with the peaks reaching 37300 cells ml 1 and then suddenly decreases to less than 1000 cells ml 1 in the following days while the concentration of dissolved oxygen dramatically decreases from 9 mg l to 0 15 mg l the sharp increase in plankton mortality during the decline phase can be described by the so called colored noise specifically the telegraph noise that can be represented by a finite state markov chain switching between two or more environmental regimes liu and wang 2010 du et al 2004 usually the switching among different environments is memoryless and the waiting time for next switch follows exponential distribution zou and wang 2014 luo and mao 2007 li et al 2009 over the last few decades a number of stochastic models have been used to explore the dynamics of phytoplankton growth additionally stochastic noise has been proven to suppress or express exponential growth in population dynamics mao et al 2002 deng et al 2008 in addition to the white noise the aquatic ecosystems are greatly affected by colored noise for example the growth environment in winter will be much different from those in summer resulting in the seasonal changes in the diversity of phytoplankton in fact the changes between different regimes can be described by the markov chain and their effects on population dynamics have been extensively explored yu et al 2019 studied a nutrient plankton food chain model with regime switching and found that the markov chain is beneficial for the survival of plankton the study of chen et al 2020 demonstrated that the markov chain will balance the density of the population under different regimes although considerable efforts have been devoted to understanding the factors regulating the development of phytoplankton blooms the dynamical behaviors induced by regime switching plankton mortality remains largely unexplored in the study of plankton dynamics constant phytoplankton mortality is commonly used however the constant phytoplankton mortality could not explain the sudden decline of phytoplankton blooms considering the variability in the mortality of phytoplankton as observed in the previous experimental studies it is unrealistic to represent the phytoplankton mortality by a constant in this paper we describe the regime switching plankton mortality by using a continuous time markov chain with different states and present a stochastic nutrient plankton model to investigate the effects of regime switching plankton mortality on the phytoplankton growth dynamics the rest of the paper is organized as follows the mathematical model is presented in the very next section in section 3 the dynamical behaviors of the proposed model are investigated some numerical simulations are performed in section 4 to explore the model s dynamics and complexity in the aquatic system we also done sensitivity analysis that will help in finding out the crucial parameters causing terminating the planktonic bloom in section 5 we discuss the implications of the results obtained in this study lastly some conclusions are provided in section 6 2 the mathematical model in recent years nutrient phytoplankton zooplankton type food web models have been widely employed in aquatic ecosystem studies with basic assumptions that the phytoplankton absorbs nutrients and is grazed upon by the herbivorous zooplankton mitra 2009 jang et al 2006 in aquatic ecosystems a number of factors such as light and temperature are responsible for the growth of phytoplankton to avoid any model complexity here we do not consider the effects of light and temperature on the phytoplankton growth and assume that the growth of phytoplankton fully depends on the availability of nutrients whereas all other environmental factors e g light temperature etc are assumed to be sufficiently abundant here we modify the aquatic planktonic ecosystem model presented by ruan 2001 which has been widely implemented the model is composed of nutrient phytoplankton and zooplankton the nutrient concentration consists of nutrient input nutrient washout and its uptake by phytoplankton further the process of nutrient regeneration due to bacterial decomposition of the dead biomass of plankton is involved which has been widely reported guo et al 2020 ruan 1993 zhuang et al 2021 the phytoplankton biomass is determined by two parts the growth caused by the conversion of nutrients and the loss caused by predation and natural death in addition the predation is described by the beddington deangelis functional response beddington 1975 deangelis et al 1975 the zooplankton biomass is determined by the growth caused by the conversion of phytoplankton and the loss caused by natural death at any time t 0 let n t p t and z t represent the nutrient concentration phytoplankton density and zooplankton density respectively the model is formulated based on the following assumptions 1 phytoplankton growth is assumed to depend on nutrient concentration and zooplankton predation 2 the nutrient uptake by phytoplankton follows logistic law and the predation is described by the beddington deangelis form beddington 1975 deangelis et al 1975 β p z 1 m z n p where β represents the consumption rate and m and n denote the mutual interference between zooplankton and the phytoplankton saturation constant respectively 3 following ruan 1993 we consider constant nutrient input and washout rates as s 0 and d to the lake ecosystem respectively let α stands for the maximal nutrient uptake by the phytoplankton 4 both phytoplankton and zooplankton die naturally in the aquatic ecosystem at the constant rates c and b respectively 5 the dead biomass of phytoplankton zooplankton is termed as detritus by the ecologists worldwide indeed the dead biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton are first converted into detritus then they are decomposed by micro organisms and at the end of the process nutrients are regenerated to avoid any model complexity we did not consider here an explicit dynamics of detritus in the nutrient plankton model thakur et al 2021 6 we consider that the nutrients are partially recycled from the dead biomass of plankton by bacterial decomposition for simplicity we neglect the time required to regenerate nutrient and consider the nutrient recycling as an instantaneous term we denote by h and δ as the nutrient recycling rates from the dead biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton respectively 7 indeed the aquatic ecosystems are inevitably affected by random perturbations coming from the environment in this context the environmental variables can act as noise sources because of their random fluctuations which results in a stochastic dynamics to the plankton model denaro et al 2013 valenti et al 2016 in line with the previous studies zhao 2016 zou and wang 2014 luo and mao 2007 we use here the white noise to represent the random fluctuations in the natural world based on the above assumptions a model schematic diagram is shown in fig 1 in the figure the dashed lines reflect the fact that the dead biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton are not directly converting into the nutrients instead they are firstly converting into an intermediate substance detritus and then into nutrient concentration we come up with the following stochastic nutrient plankton model 1 d n t d s 0 n t α p t n t h p t δ z t d t σ 1 n t d b 1 t d p t α p t n t c p t β p t z

for i 1 2 3 in addition model 1 shares common biological meaning with other phytoplankton growth models the biological meanings of variables and parameters involved in the model 1 are listed in table 1 note that the constant plankton mortality is well accepted in most of the aquatic ecosystem models however in natural aquatic ecosystems the peak of phytoplankton biomass is generally followed by a sudden decline within a few days and then it moves to the next bloom cycle more importantly several empirical evidences supported that the plankton mortality varies in different phases of blooms for example choi et al 2017 measured the loss of biomass of alexandrium fundyense in the bloom and decline phases the results showed that the peak concentrations of alexandrium fundyense reaches 1 1 0 6 cells l 1 in the bloom phase and then dramatically decreases in the decline phase and eventually drop to less than 1000 cells l 1 furthermore boyd et al 1975 measured the average density of anabaena variabilis filaments and the concentration of dissolved oxygen in different phases of bloom the experimental evidence showed that the average density of anabaena variabilis filaments increases from 3600 cells ml 1 to 37300 cells ml 1 in the bloom phase and then sharply decreases to less than 1000 cells ml 1 in the decline phase of bloom while the concentration of dissolved oxygen dramatically decreases from 9 mg l to 0 15 mg l resulting in the massive death of aerobic organisms obviously the plankton mortality shows significant differences between the bloom and decline phases of bloom events thus the shifting plankton mortality can be described as a random switching between two or more environmental regimes liu and wang 2010 du et al 2004 keeping in mind the experimental evidences børsheim et al 2005 boyd et al 1975 we describe the regime switching plankton mortality as a continuous time markov chain with different states and denote the mortality of phytoplankton and zooplankton as c 1 c 2 and b 1 b 2 respectively thus the presented model accounted for both colored and white noise is shown as follows 2 d n t d r t s 0 r t n t α r t p t n t h r t p t δ r t z t d t

represents a continuous time markov chain with state space s 1 2 n 1 n throughout this paper the processes b i t and r t are defined on a complete probability space ω f f t t 0 p and r t is independent of b i t i 1 2 3 from biological points of view initial value n 0 p 0 z 0 r 3 and all parameters are assumed to be positive the model 2 shares common biological meaning with the previous model 1 denoting r n as the positive cone in r n for a vector f f 1 f 2 f n we denote by f ˆ min k s f k f ˇ max k s f k let r t be a right continuous markov chain with state space s 1 2 n 1 n and q i

i j s and q i j 0 if i j while q i i i j q i j in addition we suppose that the markov chain r t is irreducible and independent of the brownian motion b l t l 1 2 3 hence the markov chain r t is ergodic and has a unique stationary distribution π π 1 π 2 π n which is the solution of the following equation π q 0 i s π i 1 a n d π i 0 i s by now we have developed a nutrient plankton model for the effects of regime switching plankton mortality on the phytoplankton growth dynamics 3 the main results in view of gray et al 2011 for any given initial value n 0 p 0 z 0 r 0 r 3 s the stochastic model 2 has a unique positive solution n t p t z t r t for all t 0 further according to lemma 2 3 in zhao 2016 the following relations hold almost surely 3 lim t sup n t p t z t lim t 1 t 0 t σ 1 r s

model 2 we present the following theorem theorem 3 1 for any initial value there exist χ 0 and ɛ 0 1 such that lim t sup p n t p t z t n 2 t p 2 t z 2 t χ ɛ that is the solution of model 2 is stochastically ultimately bounded the proof is given in appendix a theorem 3 1 shows that the solutions of model 2 are bounded for sufficiently large time 3 2 stochastic permanence let h max d ˇ c ˇ h ˆ b ˇ δ ˆ for the stochastic permanence of the model 2 we have the following result lemma 3 1 if κ is a positive constant such that 0 κ 1 2 max σ ˇ 1 2 σ ˇ 2 2 σ ˇ 3 2 d ˆ s ˆ 0 h then the solution of model 2 has the following property lim t sup e x t κ π where π 3 κ 4 ρ f 1 f 2 2 4 ρ f 1 max 1 2 f 1 f 2 f 2 2 4 f 1 ρ 2 f 1 f 1 κ d ˆ s ˆ 0 h κ 1 2 max σ ˇ 1 2 σ ˇ 2 2 σ ˇ 3 2 ρ 0 f 2 κ h max σ ˇ 1 2

ˆ 0 h then the solution of model 2 is stochastically permanent the proof is given in appendix c theorem 3 2 provides that the model 2 is stochastically permanent if the environmental fluctuation is less than the threshold that is we can control the noise intensity to ensure the stochastic permanence 3 3 the persistence and extinction of plankton in this subsection we will prove the extinction and persistence of plankton in the aquatic system for the sake of convenience we introduce the following notations for all k s γ k α k c k h k d k v k η k α k b k δ k d k v k r 0 s k s π k v k d k s 0

lemma 3 2 the linear system 5 d k v k l s q k l v l α k 0 k s admits a unique solution v v 1 v 2 v n t the proof is given in appendix d to deduce the following lemma we present two auxiliary results in appendix e lemma 3 3 for model 2 if lim t p t 0 a s then lim t z t 0 a s the proof is given in appendix f from the above auxiliary results we present the following theorem regarding the persistence and extinction of plankton theorem 3 3 if min k s c k h k d k 0 and min k s b k δ k d k 0 then the solution n t p t z t r t of model 2 has the following properties i if r 0 s 0 then lim t p t 0 lim t

in mean of plankton depend on r 0 s and r 1 s for r 0 s 0 both phytoplankton and zooplankton extinct for sufficiently large time meanwhile when r 0 s 0 and r 1 s 0 the phytoplankton is persistent in mean and zooplankton extinct from the aquatic system 3 4 ergodicity of model 2 in this subsection we will derive conditions for the existence and uniqueness of the stationary distribution of model 2 following yu et al 2019 and zhu and yin 2007 we present the theorem below theorem 3 4 let assumption 1 holds if for given initial condition n 0 p 0 z 0 r 0 r 3 s min d ˆ c ˆ h ˇ b ˆ δ ˇ 1 2 max σ ˆ 1 2 σ ˆ 2 2 σ ˆ 3 2 and r 2 s 0 then the stochastic process n t p t z t r t defined by the solution of model 2 is ergodic and has a unique stationary distribution in r 3 s the proof is given in appendix h theorem 3 4 provides the sufficient condition for the existence of ergodic stationary distribution it shows that if the intensities of the white noises are within the threshold and r 2 s 0 the stochastic process n t p t z t r t is ergodic and admits a unique stationary distribution next we investigate the explicit lower bound for phytoplankton to this we give the following assumption from eq 4 assumption 2 for arbitrary 0 ι 1 there exists a set ω ι ω with p ω ι 1 ι and a constant f f ι such that for ω ω ι and t f lim sup t 1 t 0 t β ˆ p s d s lim t 1 t 0 t b r s 1 2 σ 3 2 r s d s ι now we present the following theorem theorem 3 5 let assumptions 1 and 2 hold if min d ˆ c ˆ h ˇ b ˆ δ ˇ 1 2 max σ ˆ 1 2 σ ˆ 2 2 σ ˆ 3 2 then for model 2 whenever r 2 s β ˇ β ˆ m ˆ there exists a constant ς such that lim inf t 1 t 0 t p s d s ς 0 lim inf t 1 t 0 t z s d s r 2 s β ˇ β ˆ m ˆ a s that is both phytoplankton and zooplankton are persistent in mean for the proof see appendix i biologically theorem 3 5 tells that if the environmental noise is within the threshold and r 2 s β ˇ β ˆ m ˆ then both phytoplankton and zooplankton will survive forever 4 numerical simulations in this section we present some numerical results to further investigate how regime switching plankton mortality affect the distribution of plankton biomass in the aquatic system unless otherwise mentioned the parameter values used for numerical results will be the same as in table 1 moreover we assume that the transition rate from state 1 to state 2 is the same as the transition rate from state 2 to state 1 we choose q 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 the nutrient input s 0 consumption rate β phytoplankton mortality c and zooplankton mortality b are the mainly control parameters 4 1 sensitivity analysis in comparison with the effects of simply varying the parameters to look at the outcome of the model the techniques of sensitivity analysis are mathematically more sophisticated here we use a basic differential analysis approach to determine the semi relative and logarithmic sensitivity solutions of the model 1 for both the plankton populations in the absence of environmental noise bortz and nelson 2004 misra et al 2016 note that the semi relative sensitivity of the model solutions for a variable x to a parameter y is given by y x t y y and is computed by formally differentiating the model 1 without environmental noise with respect to y and interchanging the order of time and parameter derivative since we have 3 state variables we get a system of 3 equations for the sensitivity functions x y t y x y t y 6 d d t x t y f x x t y f y with initial conditions x 0 y 0 here f x represents the jacobian of the model 1 without environmental noise and f y is the derivative of the right side of model 1 which is represented by f t x y with respect to y to get the sensitivity functions first we solve model 6 for x y t y by coupling it with the original model 1 without environmental noise total 3 3 equations the values of the sensitivity functions provide the rates of change of the variables with respect to the change in the chosen parameter y as time progresses for example p β 80 0 5 0 112 means that the derivative of p with respect to β at t 80 days and β 0 5 per day is 0 112 μ g day l finally the semi relative sensitivity solutions are calculated by simply multiplying the unmodified sensitivity functions by the parameter y i e y x y t y which provides the amount the state will change when the parameter y is doubled i e a perturbation on the order of y the sensitivities of plankton densities are plotted for seven most sensitive relevant parameters s 0 α β h δ c and b fig 2 among these parameters only s 0 can be influenced by human activities from the graph it is clear that the perturbations of the parameters exhibit their greatest influences early in the simulation with a large initial expected variation in the plankton densities it is clear that the doubling of s 0 and α will yield sudden increase of plankton densities by time around t 43 days there is a huge increase in the density of phytoplankton at 43 days followed by a sudden huge decrease just after few days such decrease in density of phytoplankton is due to the less availability of the nutrients as they are uptaken by the phytoplankton on the other hand on doubling the uptake rate of phytoplankton by zooplankton β the biomass of phytoplankton decreases whereas that of zooplankton increases in the initial phase of time but as time flows the biomass of zooplankton decreases and of the phytoplankton boosts up again we see an increment in the zooplankton and decrement in the phytoplankton biomasses with passages of time on doubling the mortality rate of phytoplankton c the biomasses of both the plankton significantly changes in the aquatic system the densities of phytoplankton increases whereas of the zooplankton decreases significantly at the initial stage on doubling the mortality rate of the latter the plankton densities in the aquatic system are least sensitive to the re mineralization of dead biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton however different parameters have different strength of influences s 0 has its greatest influence on phytoplankton as well as zooplankton densities it is to be noted here that these outcomes greatly depend on the parameterization of the model next we look at the logarithmic sensitivity solutions l o g x l o g y t y x t y x y t y with respect to all of the previously mentioned parameters fig 2 b these quantities are dimensionless and indicate what percentage change of the variables can be expected from a doubling of a parameter y thus to get a complete idea about the sensitivity of the solutions on a particular parameter it is best to calculate semi relative as well as logarithmic sensitivity solutions fig 2 b shows that doubling of the parameters s 0 α h δ and b results in 34 62 34 62 1 42 1 42 and 98 01 increment in the density of phytoplankton respectively at the end of 80 days on the other hand the density of phytoplankton reduces by 112 7 and 19 22 on doubling the parameters β and c respectively at 80 days similarly the figure displays that at the end of 80 days the zooplankton density reduced by 71 46 128 1 and 48 06 on doubling the parameters β c and b respectively further it is apparent from the figure that the zooplankton density boosts up by 235 7 190 4 7 275 and 7 275 at the end of 80 days on doubling the values of model parameters s 0 α h and δ further we see the mean value of the solution of the deterministic model by choosing constant plankton mortality rate and fixing β c b 0 5 with respect to nutrient input in fig 3 obviously the mean of plankton biomass increases with an increase in the nutrient input level as the nutrient input exceeds a threshold value the plankton populations can coexist in the aquatic system 4 2 effects of regime shifting plankton mortality fig 4 gives three different types of the model model 1 model 2 without noise and model 2 for their sensitivity to changes in the nutrient input since the concentration of available nutrient is one of the decisive factors controlling phytoplankton productivity häder and gao 2015 instead of increasing and decreasing parameter values by a defined percentage the entire range of possible values of nutrient input is determined by previous studies the other parameter values used for the model analysis are same as in table 1 the sensitivity analysis is conducted through changing the nutrient input to observe its effects on the biomass of plankton populations the analysis show that the persistence and extinction of plankton populations can be divided into three stages see fig 4 when the nutrient input is low under the white dash line both phytoplankton and zooplankton populations will die out eventually with an increase in the nutrient input phytoplankton population is persistent and zooplankton population tends to extinct above the white dash line and below the red dash line after the nutrient input exceeds the critical value above red dash line both phytoplankton and zooplankton populations can coexist forever moreover it is worthy to note that nutrient input enhances the amplitude of the oscillation because higher plankton biomass is achieved on increasing the nutrient input the results from fig 4 imply that the persistence and extinction of plankton populations are sensitive to the variations of nutrient inputs additionally fig 4 shows an another important result when the white noise is applied on the deterministic model figs 4 a and 4 b showcases that the plankton density always oscillates instead of maintaining a certain level further we describe the shifting plankton mortality with the right continuous markov chain r t on state space s 1 2 and the low mortality of plankton is set at 0 4 d 1 while the high mortality of plankton is set at 0 7 d 1 figs 4 c and 4 d display the solution of model 2 without noise and the results indicate that the plankton biomass oscillates in a smaller range but shows obvious switching between different states clearly the switching phenomenon is induced by shifting plankton mortality in addition figs 4 e and 4 f are given to investigate the effect of regime switching plankton mortality on the plankton biomass distribution in a stochastic environment it is obvious from figs 4 e and 4 f that the oscillation range of plankton biomass becomes large and the switching between different states also becomes more pronounced apparently the regime switching plankton mortality significantly affect the planktonic ecosystem in a stochastic environment in the study of stochastic population dynamics persistence and extinction are important topics from theorem 3 3 we know that the extinction and persistence in mean of plankton depend on r 0 s and r 1 s for β s 0 0 5 we get r 0 s 0 195 0 which means that both phytoplankton and zooplankton extinct according to theorem 3 3 i see fig 5 a next we fix β 0 2 s 0 1 and get that r 0 s 0 2050 0 r 1 s 0 195 0 which represent the fact that phytoplankton is persistent in mean and zooplankton is extinct according to theorem 3 3 ii see fig 5 b the results from figs 5 a 5 b reveal that higher nutrient input and less consumption of phytoplankton by zooplankton contribute to the survival of phytoplankton population in the aquatic system again we pick β 0 5 s 0 12 and get r 2 s 3 32202 β ˆ β ˇ m ˆ 1 25 0 according to theorems 3 4 3 5 the model 2 is persistent in mean and shows a unique stationary distribution i e the plankton species can survive forever see fig 5 c in order to investigate the distributions of phytoplankton biomass in different states we choose s 0 8 β 0 5 in model 2 and show the path of markov chain in fig 6 a additionally fig 6 b displays the sample paths for the phytoplankton population in state 1 state 2 and hybrid model respectively apparently phytoplankton population extinct in state 1 but is persistent in state 2 as well as hybrid model moreover the distributions of phytoplankton biomass in state 1 state 2 and hybrid model demonstrate that the markov chain contributes to the enhancement in the oscillation cycles of the plankton see fig 6 c fig 6 d displays the distribution of phytoplankton biomass with respect to nutrient input s 0 which indicates that the increasing nutrient input leads to a significant increase in the variance of phytoplankton biomass fig 7 shows the mean and the variance of plankton biomass under three conditions for s 0 1 2 10 the results imply that both the variance and the mean of plankton biomass show overall an increasing trend as nutrient input increases when plankton community suffered from nutrient deficiency the mean and the variance of phytoplankton biomass are lower for the shifting plankton mortality than that for the constant plankton mortality but the variance of phytoplankton biomass in model 2 shows comparatively a large increasing trend in contrast the zooplankton tends to be extinct when the nutrient input is low moreover with an increase in the nutrient input the variances of plankton biomass with shifting plankton mortality show a faster increasing trend obviously the regime switching plankton mortality significantly increases the ranges of distribution and oscillation intensity of phytoplankton biomass which suggests that such plankton mortality is beneficial for the survival of phytoplankton under high nutrient level plethora of research studies supported the fact that the growth rate of phytoplankton may not be able to maintain a high level of plankton in the aquatic system due to the zooplankton grazing and the intraspecific competition among the plankton for the available resources such as light and nutrient sommer 1991 sommer 2012 the results from fig 7 imply that when the nutrient input exceeds a critical level zooplankton appear in the aquatic system and the mean and the variance of phytoplankton biomass show relatively slower increasing trends while the mean of zooplankton biomass has a larger increasing trend a possible explanation behind this behavior of plankton might be the predation by zooplankton and the competition for resources by phytoplankton at last we give the sample paths of model 2 for plankton in fig 8 which reveals that the increasing input of nutrients leads to a marked increase in the amplitude of planktonic oscillations 5 discussion the sudden changes in plankton mortality have been observed in several experimental studies thus considering the impact of shifting plankton mortality on population growth of planktonic algae in crucial in this study a nutrient plankton model considering shifting plankton mortality is developed the theoretical results imply that when the minimum plankton mortality is beyond a threshold value the extinction and persistence in mean of plankton depend on r 0 s and r 1 s it is observed that the model 2 possesses an ergodic stationary distribution that is ergodic indicating that the plankton populations can survive forever moving beyond the theoretical analysis several numerical simulations have been carried out to explore the plankton dynamics our sensitivity results indicated that the biomasses of planktons in the aquatic system are highly sensitive to the input rates of nutrients grazing rate of phytoplankton by zooplankton and the mortality rates of planktons these results emphasize that one must focus on the control of the input rate of nutrients coming to the lakes from outsides during the bloom phase furthermore three different types of the model model 1 model 2 without noise and model 2 for their sensitivity to changes in the nutrient input is shown in fig 4 it has been well documented that the nutrient availability is directly related to the phytoplankton growth häder and gao 2015 elliott et al 2006 and the distribution of phytoplankton biomass is sensitive to nutrient input elliott et al 2006 fig 4 clearly showed that when the nutrient input is less than a certain level both phytoplankton and zooplankton populations tend to extinct if the nutrient input is between the white and red dash lines phytoplankton population is persistent and zooplankton population disappear from the aquatic system as the nutrient input exceeds the red dash line both phytoplankton and zooplankton populations can coexist forever fig 4 suggested that nutrient input plays an important role in determining the survival of plankton the persistence and extinction of plankton populations are sensitive to variations of nutrient input here our findings are concurred with the results reported by elliott et al 2006 additionally fig 4 shows a comparison of the plankton biomass in three different models the differences in dynamics depending on the of models are governed by nutrient input the results from sherratt and smith 2008 supported that the population density always shows the oscillatory behavior due to the existence of noise and other factors as shown in figs 4 a 4 b the plankton population density is always oscillating instead of maintaining a certain level owing to the existence of environmental noise which is consistent with the findings of sherratt and smith 2008 by contrast for the model 2 without noise see figs 4 c 4 d the oscillation intensity of plankton biomass remains lower than that in figs 4 a 4 b due to the lack of environmental noise however the distribution of plankton biomass is switching between different states which is not observed in figs 4 a 4 b one possible explanation is that the increasing plankton mortality leads to a sudden collapse of plankton populations figs 4 e 4 f showcase that the switching becomes more pronounced due to the coupling between noise and shifting plankton mortality and the oscillation intensity of the plankton biomass is significantly stronger than figs 4 c 4 d these results further indicate that the noise can enhance the oscillation of plankton biomass and the high plankton mortality in the decline phase results in a dramatic collapse in the phytoplankton population which agree with the experimental results mentioned in børsheim et al 2005 choi et al 2017 and boyd et al 1975 in the study of stochastic population dynamics the persistence and extinction of interacting populations are the most important topics liu and wang 2010 de la hoz and vadillo 2012 from the biological points of view the stochastic persistence means that the population will survive forever fig 5 displays the persistence and extinction of the plankton populations in the model 2 apparently the plankton populations will survive forever under certain conditions see fig 5 c besides the stochastic persistence of the model we have studied how shifting plankton mortality affects the survival of phytoplankton population in the aquatic habitat see fig 6 fig 6 b depicted that the phytoplankton population is extinct in state 1 but is persistent in state 2 when the nutrient input is low the phytoplankton population in hybrid model is persistent it is inferred from fig 6 b that under the influence of the markov chain although the phytoplankton population tends to extinct in one state it still has a chance to be persistent under high nutrient input the regime switching plankton mortality can enhance the oscillation intensity of phytoplankton density that is to say the model with regime switching plankton mortality is more beneficial for the survival of plankton populations in comparison to the case when plankton mortality is constant see fig 6 c while comparing with the regime switching plankton mortality nutrient has been proved to be an important factor influencing the growth of phytoplankton in the aquatic system the distribution of phytoplankton biomass with respect to nutrient input suggested that the increasing nutrient level enhances the biomass of phytoplankton in the model see fig 6 d the capability of nutrient loading in stimulating the growth of phytoplankton is well demonstrated in ramin et al 2012 indeed extensive researches have established that the total phytoplankton biomass may be ultimately responsive to the changes in nutrient availability carpenter et al 2016 salmaso 2010 and that the external nutrient loading is a significant factor which is positively related to the total phytoplankton biomass ramin et al 2012 our simulation results revealed that the nutrient input shows a positive control on the mean as well as variance of the phytoplankton biomass see fig 7 additionally the nutrient input can significantly increase the zooplankton biomass as the increase of phytoplankton biomass due to nutrient input provides sufficient food for the grazer zooplankton however the growth rate of phytoplankton shows a decreasing trend after the nutrient input exceeds a threshold value it is well documented that the phytoplankton abundance is moderately increasing rather than being maintained at a high level following the nutrient enrichment in the aquatic system ramin et al 2012 moreover fig 7 showed that the plankton biomass in model 2 has the highest mean as well as variance values in contrast to model 1 and the model 2 without noise this suggests that the shifting plankton mortality is more beneficial for the survival of plankton population in the aquatic system in comparison to case when the plankton experiences constant mortality this might be due to the sudden collapse of algal population that makes it possible to create a suitable environment for plankton to grow and provide chance for their survival 6 conclusion a stochastic nutrient plankton model incorporating regime switching plankton mortality is implemented here several theoretical and numerical analyses are presented aiming to understand how shifting plankton mortality affect the phytoplankton growth dynamics analytically we derived the threshold value for the survival of plankton species and obtained conditions under which the model is persistent or one of the plankton populations goes to extinction further we showed that the model 2 admits an ergodic stationary distribution in addition the numerical results revealed that the coupling between noise and regime switching plankton mortality are not only capable of enhancing oscillatory behavior of plankton populations but also decrease the amplitude of the plankton oscillations in the bloom phase our simulation results indicated that nutrient loading in the aquatic system is an important factor in controlling phytoplankton biomass whereas the regime switching plankton mortality provided higher survival chance for plankton populations it is worth noting that the importance of our proposed model is then not the precision with which it predicted specific events within a particular lake ocean but its contribution to the studies on how the regime switching plankton mortality influences phytoplankton growth in the lakes and oceans additionally the results obtained in this study may provide a reasonable explanation for the observed sharp collapse of a phytoplankton bloom in the experiments further it is worthy to note that considering the explicit role of detritus the dead biomasses of phytoplankton and zooplankton in the model 2 will mimic a more realistic situation of the nutrient plankton model in our future work we will investigate the dynamics of nutrient plankton model with explicit role of detritus and will explore more rich and complex dynamics of the planktonic bloom credit authorship contribution statement qing guo

fisheries mississippi river population ecology data availability dataset used is freely available reference in paper and code is shared in public github repository 1 introduction gizzard shad dorosoma cepedianum is a laterally compressed deep bodied fish species that occupies numerous aquatic systems throughout central southern and eastern regions of the united states pierce et al 1981 vanni et al 2005 they have the potential to reach high abundances in more eutrophic habitats such as reservoirs leading to its dominance within fish assemblages because of this gizzard shad have the potential to influence freshwater systems in several ways first young shad often serve as a critical food source for many fish species including those of commercial and recreational importance such as walleye sander vitreus and largemouth bass micropterus salmoides jester et al 1972 thus gizzard shad can serve as an important trophic link within aquatic food webs second because detritus can serve as a primary food source throughout much of gizzard shad development i e from the age 0 stage onward these fish can transport nutrients from benthic regions into pelagic habitats mather et al 1995 schaus and vanni 2000 vanni et al 2005 this process can result in an increase in the nutrients available to organisms within the water column leading to increases in phytoplankton biomass algal blooms and due to these conditions shifts in freshwater community structure aday et al 2003 schaus and vanni 2000 finally the fact that detritus can comprise a substantial portion of gizzard shad diet also makes this species an important connection between terrestrial inputs and aquatic processes schaus and vanni 2000 given its potentially important role in aquatic ecosystems interest has intensified in understanding gizzard shad populations interactions within and between species throughout interconnected environments can have important consequences for fish populations across space and time thorp et al 2006 for gizzard shad previous work has indicated that fish densities can play an important role in both the growth and survival patterns observed in populations of these fish for example buynak et al 1992 reported an inverse relationship between densities and the lengths of age 0 gizzard shad similarly welker et al 1994 found that high densities of age 0 shad were associated with reduced survival under both field and semi natural conditions finally michaletz 2010 reported that the densities of age 0 gizzard shad were negatively correlated with survival in two missouri lakes these patterns were attributed to intraspecific competition among young shad for prey zooplankton resources together these studies suggest that gizzard shad density has important impacts on life history patterns in this species although substantial empirical work on gizzard shad biology has accumulated over the decades few if any studies have attempted to use these data to model population dynamics in this species work by catalano and allen 2010 2011 used empirically based simulations of gizzard shad to assess population level responses in this species as part of this process the authors investigated population structure using fish lengths but did not consider the effects of gizzard shad densities on population patterns here we introduce an integral projection model ipm for gizzard shad based on empirical data with density dependent survival in age 0 fish we then compare model outcomes to the dynamics reported for this fish species in a well studied navigational pool of the illinois river specifically the la grange reach results from this work indicate that our model could be an important tool for predicting gizzard shad population patterns in aquatic habitats across north america 2 model development 2 1 gizzard shad life history mature gizzard shad tend to mate between may and june although this can vary based on water temperatures bodola 1955 males and females aggregate and then broadcast gametes into the surrounding water fertilized eggs then settle and adhere to the bottom substrates after a period of days eggs hatch and fish develop from the larval stage to juveniles and eventually to adults in many habitats individuals can reach sexual maturity within a year bodola 1955 as gizzard shad mature their diet preferences typically shift from phytoplankton and zooplankton early in development to detritus and zooplankton as adults given the large number of eggs produced by shad females often 100 000 year jons and miranda 1997 intraspecific competition can be intense during early developmental stages in this species leading to density dependent mortality michaletz 2010 the strength of competition may then subside as fish transition to feeding on different food types during later stages of development 2 2 equations we used an ipm to describe the life history of female gizzard shad in the upper mississippi river system umrs 33 u s code section 652 1986 ipms were first introduced by easterling easterling et al 2000 as a generalization of stage based matrix population models since that time ipms have been used to describe a wide range of organisms briggs et al 2010 ellner et al 2016 merow et al 2014 rees et al 2014 but have only recently been used to model fish populations for example erickson et al 2017 liao et al 2019 white et al 2016 and pollesch et al 2022 fish are an ideal group to investigate using this approach as many species have been well studied and are therefore associated with robust information about life history traits i e growth and reproduction gizzard shad are one such species and have been the subject of numerous laboratory and field studies over the decades making it a logical choice for ipms in our model specifically we incorporate data from studies on 1 egg production in different size classes of adults 2 density dependent survival of age 0 shad and 3 length distributions of gizzard shad in the umrs that span nearly thirty years table 1 in a traditional matrix population model caswell 2001 the annual abundance of gizzard shad can be separated into a finite number of disjoint subgroups by factors such as age length and developmental stage within each subgroup individual fish can be assumed to exhibit the same survival growth and fecundity these parameters are used to build a transition matrix that updates the current state of the population at time t to the future state at t 1 through matrix multiplication increasing the number of subgroups also increases the number of parameters that require estimation when generating the transition matrix conversely the annual update in gizzard shad abundance for an ipm is described by the integral kernel this kernel can be created from continuous functions for survival growth and fecundity and therefore ipms almost always require fewer estimated parameters briggs et al 2010 when the integral kernel is applied to the current length distribution n z t and integrated over the length l u the result is the next length distribution n z t 1 n z t 1 describes the number of individuals of length z in the interval a b at time t 1 for the numerical simulations in section 4 the length vector will be discretized as a result n z t becomes a vector and the integral kernel acts on n z t like a large approximating transition matrix in the following sections we detail the functions used to create the integral kernel for the gizzard shad ipm see fig 1 2 2 1 growth and survival for an individual of length z at time t p z z δ z is the probability that the individual remains alive at time t 1 and has grown to a size to the interval z z δ z we define p z z s z g z z where s z is the annual adult survival probability and the growth g z z describes the annual length transitions similar to models for invasive carp erickson et al 2017 the survival is represented as a logistic function 1 s z s min s max s min 1 e β s ln z ln α s with four parameters the minimum survival rate s min a maximum survival rate s max an intercept parameter α s and a slope parameter β s the growth function is a two variable normal distribution centered around a modified von bertalanffy function of the length at time t erickson et al 2017 consequently if l is maximum asymptotic length and k g is the individual growth rate of gizzard shad then the growth kernel g z z prob z z l k g normalpdf μ g σ g where μ g l 1 e k g z t e k g and σ g is the standard deviation 2 2 2 fecundity f z z δ z is the number of new offspring in the length interval z z δ z present at time t 1 per length z individual at time t the fecundity kernel is 2 f z z p egg z ν s 0 d t c 1 z where p is the probability of female reproduction egg z is the mean number of eggs produced by a fish of length z ν is the probability that an egg is viable s 0 d t is the density dependent probability of surviving to age 1 and c 1 z is the length distribution of new recruits at age 1 when they are first censused in the model the mean number of eggs produced by females of a certain length is a three parameter logistic function 3 egg z egg max 1 e β e ln z ln α e the probability of gizzard shad survival during their first year can depend on many factors michaletz 2010 including predation temperature the mean total length of fish and the density of age 0 fish in this study we focused only on the density factor and assumed the probability of survival of age 0 fish is the exponential function 4 s 0 d t a 0 e b 0 d t where a 0 is the intercept b 0 the decay rate and d t is the density at time t of age 0 gizzard shad per 1000 m 3 d t 1 0 3 l u p egg z ν n z t d z we tested a number of other models and found the exponential decay model to be the most robust based on aic scores finally eq 2 is constructed from multiplying the total number of eggs that survive to be an age 1 fish with a normal distribution of length c 1 z normalpdf μ r σ r where μ r is the mean length of age 1 gizzard shad and σ r is the standard deviation 2 3 dynamical model the population at time t 1 is the sum of the contributions from each individual alive at time t 5 n z t 1 l u k z z n z t d

upper mississippi river restoration monitors the umrs to provide an understanding of the system s ecology resource changes and inform management bouska et al 2018 maher et al 2015 in order to achieve this goal numerous features of the umrs such as aquatic vegetation bathymetry fish land use land cover and water quality are surveyed in particular reaches along the upper mississippi river ltrm fish surveys are conducted at five locations along the main channel of the upper mississippi river pools 4 8 13 26 and the open river reach and at one location along the illinois river la grange reach fig 2 a fish are captured using a multiple gear approach which includes netting and electrofishing in order to monitor the responses and status of fish communities along these two waterways over time gutreuter et al 1995 specific capture methodologies protocols and modifications to the ltrm can be found in gutreuter et al 1995 and ickes and burkhardt 2002 and the dataset can be access online ltrm 2022 in terms of gizzard shad fish traits have been recorded since 1989 with approximately 3000 collections occurring per year along the mississippi river fig 2 b for the la grange reach of the illinois river gizzard shad have been sampled and measured since 1990 with approximately 500 collections occurring per year to parameterize our model we used gizzard shad data collected from the 5 sites pools 4 8 13 26 and open river reach along the mississippi river fig 2 a we then validated our model using empirical information collected from the la grange reach of the illinois river we undertook this approach as the la grange reach is upstream from the mississippi river making it a more distinct location compared to the other sites 3 1 1 fecundity and recruitment female gizzard shad begin reproducing at approximately 140 mm in length and egg numbers tend to increase with fish size jons and miranda 1997 the logistic parameters for the mean number of eggs produced by females of a certain length were obtained by fitting the three parameter logistic function eq 3 to the data for batch fecundity versus length jons and miranda 1997 fig 3 a fish survival to age 1 was assumed to be dependent on the density of age 0 gizzard shad fig 3 b parameters for the exponentially decaying age 0 survival function eq 4 were determined by fitting eq 4 to the survival means for 2003 2007 cohorts of gizzard shad in five missouri reservoirs michaletz 2010 to complete the recruitment process we assign a length to the recruited individuals by simulating a gaussian random variable with mean μ r and standard deviation σ r the parameters for the size distribution of age 1 fish were gleaned from a study of gizzard shad located in large impoundments michaletz 2017 and the historical 1990 2020 ltrm dataset ltrm 2022 from the main channel of the umrs discussed in section 3 1 3 1 2 growth and survival of adults the parameters for the growth function were chosen as the mean values published on a study of gizzard shad located in large impoundments in missouri u s a michaletz 2017 the association between adult lengths and survival have not been well resolved in gizzard shad leading us to make a few assumptions first we assume that the probability of adult survival is related to the length by a four parameter logistic function eq 1 an investigation of gizzard shad in lake erie bodola 1955 provided the minimum and maximum survival rate of adults we used a least squares method to estimate the α s and β s parameters that minimize the total square distance between the pre carp ltrm length distribution in the main channel of the umrs observed and the predicted model distribution n z t during an 8 year period occurring 100 years after initialization observed length distributions of gizzard shad sampled from the main channel of the mississippi river fig 2 b have similar profiles however some variation does exist this may be attributed to changes in factors such as hydrology water quality and the occurrence of submersed aquatic vegetation we averaged the simulated length distributions over an 8 year period in order to reduce contributions from these environmental factors the slope parameter β s was found to be large in magnitude resulting in a primarily two valued survival probability gizzard shad less than α s mm in length have a very low survival rate s min and lengths larger than α s mm approach the maximum survival rate s max this survival pattern has been reported for several fish species and can arise due to a number of biotic i e predation and or abiotic i e temperature factors pepin et al 1992 nowlin et al 2006 4 analysis and results we numerically solved the integral model using the midpoint rule with large approximating matrices burden and faires 2005 the midpoint rule has been commonly used for integral projection models because of its simplicity and effectiveness ellner and rees 2006 ramula et al 2009 merow et al 2014 during the course of model development we explored different step sizes for the midpoint rule and found that about 50 points provided numerically stable results we integrated over lengths from 0 mm to 500 mm the upper limit was chosen based upon numerical stability and consistency of the system e g avoiding eviction or the loss of individuals due to numerical errors williams et al 2012 4 1 initial conditions we assumed that the initial density of gizzard shad was d 0 1487 93 fish the average annual density of gizzard shad caught with all gear types represented in the ltrm fish program in la grange reach from 1993 2020 the probability of an individual being length z at time t 0 was assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 5 l and standard deviation σ g as a result we initialized our model with length distribution 6 n z 0 d 0 norm 0 5 l σ g 1487 93 norm 197 15 25 the model was coded in r r core team 2017 and the scripts are published on jp s github page https github com jppeirce 4 1 1 effect of density dependence on the survival probability of the age 0 cohort in the simulated solutions to the ipm the density of age 0 fish are strongly influenced by the density of gizzard shad at subsequent developmental stages when adult densities are large there may be more fish of longer lengths that can produce a greater number of eggs assuming that there are not additional food resources and egg larval predators present a greater number of eggs leads to a higher density of age 0 fish and reflectively a reduction in the survival to age 1 if reduced survival continues over subsequent years the overall density of fish within the population may decline and result in a smaller number of longer length fish that are reproducing fewer fish spawning could result in a smaller age 0 class which in turn could enhance survival probability in this cohort through reduced competition we would then expect the overall density of fish to increase over the following years until large numbers of eggs are again produced by larger adult fish this oscillatory pattern is reflected in our model by the time dependent survival probability of age 0 recruits fig 4 4 1 2 periodic orbit and validation with external dataset the total number of gizzard shad in our simulation reached a stable periodic orbit fig 5 a within 50 years after simulating an additional 50 years we fit a periodic function to the annual density of gizzard shad and determined the period of approximately 8 74 years fig 5 b illustrates the periodic length dynamics within the gizzard shad population during a 9 year window of the periodic orbit as a validation of the model the simulated length distributions during a periodic orbit fig 5 b have similarities to fish lengths observed from the la grange reach fig 6 in addition the ebb and flow of the frequency of the age 1 cohort can be observed and is associated with the density dependent survival function for age 0 fish explained in section 4 1 1 5 discussion gizzard shad are common in freshwater systems of north america where they contribute to the integrity of aquatic communities given this it is important to understand population patterns within this species herein we use both ltrm data and parameters gleaned from other empirical studies to develop an integral projection model for gizzard shad and test model outputs against patterns reported from a well studied population of this species from the la grange reach of the illinois river after fitting two adult survival parameters using ltrm data from the main channel of the mississippi river we compared a simulated length distribution with empirical data collected from the la grange reach of the illinois river from 1992 to 2020 the resulting simulated length distributions fig 5 b reflected many of the patterns observed in gizzard shad captured from the la grange reach over the same timeframe fig 6 for example the predicted transition from bimodal length distributions to a single peak in smaller gizzard shad in our simulations was reflected in the empirical data from 1996 to 2000 this trend was also observed from 2004 2008 it should be noted that there were also discrepancies between model simulations and the empirical data in particular we did not notice a distinct single peak in intermediate sized fish from field collections even though this was predicted by our model temporal and spatial variations in the la grange reach environment and the subsequent effect on growth within the shad population may help explain why certain trends in our ipm outputs were not well represented in the field collections the average over 1 period simulated length frequency compared well with the overall length frequencies of gizzard shad sampled in la grange reach from 1992 2020 fig 7 our simulated size frequencies of gizzard shad captured the general trends seen in fish collected from the study site that being said the model did predict a slightly higher density of adult lengths and fewer juvenile smaller lengths than in the empirical data this may be explained by gear type and capture method which vary from site to site potentially introducing bias in the observed length distributions year to year in addition studies also indicate that environmental stochasticity and food variability may alter recruitment densities which are difficult to measure accurately michaletz 2010 okamoto et al 2016 rose 2000 future investigations may use spring water temperature measurements from the ltrm water quality component to modify the adult survival function eq 1 to be temperature dependent although our model uses the density of age 0 gizzard shad to affect the survival probability in their first year we assumed constant viability at subsequent developmental stages which may also be sensitive to density related factors however currently there is little information available on the role that density plays in the life history responses of adult gizzard shad the location of the maximum length and the variation in the length of new recruits recorded in the ltrm data indicates that there may be smaller age 0 fish in la grange reach than in the study location michaletz 2017 used to parameterize the model gaining an understanding of how length distributions of gizzard shad emerge under density dependent survival in the age 0 class serve as a foundation for investigating density effects at subsequent stages in the life cycle in addition this single species model could also be expanded to incorporate interspecific interactions between gizzard shad and species such as invasive carp which appear to negatively impact gizzard shad life histories through competition for resources credit authorship contribution statement j peirce

aggregate and then broadcast gametes into the surrounding water fertilized eggs then settle and adhere to the bottom substrates after a period of days eggs hatch and fish develop from the larval stage to juveniles and eventually to adults in many habitats individuals can reach sexual maturity within a year bodola 1955 as gizzard shad mature their diet preferences typically shift from phytoplankton and zooplankton early in development to detritus and zooplankton as adults given the large number of eggs produced by shad females often 100 000 year jons and miranda 1997 intraspecific competition can be intense during early developmental stages in this species leading to density dependent mortality michaletz 2010 the strength of competition may then subside as fish transition to feeding on different food types during later stages of development 2 2 equations we used an ipm to describe the life history of female gizzard shad in the upper mississippi river system umrs 33 u s code section 652 1986 ipms were first introduced by easterling easterling et al 2000 as a generalization of stage based matrix population models since that time ipms have been used to describe a wide range of organisms briggs et al 2010 ellner et al 2016 merow et al 2014 rees et al 2014 but have only recently been used to model fish populations for example erickson et al 2017 liao et al 2019 white et al 2016 and pollesch et al 2022 fish are an ideal group to investigate using this approach as many species have been well studied and are therefore associated with robust information about life history traits i e growth and reproduction gizzard shad are one such species and have been the subject of numerous laboratory and field studies over the decades making it a logical choice for ipms in our model specifically we incorporate data from studies on 1 egg production in different size classes of adults 2 density dependent survival of age 0 shad and 3 length distributions of gizzard shad in the umrs that span nearly thirty years table 1 in a traditional matrix population model caswell 2001 the annual abundance of gizzard shad can be separated into a finite number of disjoint subgroups by factors such as age length and developmental stage within each subgroup individual fish can be assumed to exhibit the same survival growth and fecundity these parameters are used to build a transition matrix that updates the current state of the population at time t to the future state at t 1 through matrix multiplication increasing the number of subgroups also increases the number of parameters that require estimation when generating the transition matrix conversely the annual update in gizzard shad abundance for an ipm is described by the integral kernel this kernel can be created from continuous functions for survival growth and fecundity and therefore ipms almost always require fewer estimated parameters briggs et al 2010 when the integral kernel is applied to the current length distribution n z t and integrated over the length l u the result is the next length distribution n z t 1 n z t 1 describes the number of individuals of length z in the interval a b at time t 1 for the numerical simulations in section 4 the length vector will be discretized as a result n z t becomes a vector and the integral kernel acts on n z t like a large approximating transition matrix in the following sections we detail the functions used to create the integral kernel for the gizzard shad ipm see fig 1 2 2 1 growth and survival for an individual of length z at time t p z z δ z is the probability that the individual remains alive at time t 1 and has grown to a size to the interval z z δ z we define p z z s z g z z where s z is the annual adult survival probability and the growth g z z describes the annual length transitions similar to models for invasive carp erickson et al 2017 the survival is represented as a logistic function 1 s z s min s max s min 1 e β s ln z ln α s with four parameters the minimum survival rate s min a maximum survival rate s max an intercept parameter α s and a slope parameter β s the growth function is a two variable normal distribution centered around a modified von bertalanffy function of the length at time t erickson et al 2017 consequently if l is maximum asymptotic length and k g is the individual growth rate of gizzard shad then the growth kernel g z z prob z z l k g normalpdf μ g σ g where μ g l 1 e k g z t e k g and σ g is the standard deviation 2 2 2 fecundity f z z δ z is the number of new offspring in the length interval z z δ z present at time t 1 per length z individual at time t the fecundity kernel is 2 f z z p egg z ν s 0 d t c 1 z where p is the probability of female reproduction egg z is the mean number of eggs produced by a fish of length z ν is the probability that an egg is viable s 0 d t is the density dependent probability of surviving to age 1 and c 1 z is the length distribution of new recruits at age 1 when they are first censused in the model the mean number of eggs produced by females of a certain length is a three parameter logistic function 3 egg z egg max 1 e β e ln z ln α e the probability of gizzard shad survival during their first year can depend on many factors michaletz 2010 including predation temperature the mean total length of fish and the density of age 0 fish in this study we focused only on the density factor and assumed the probability of survival of age 0 fish is the exponential function 4 s 0 d t a 0 e b 0 d t where a 0 is the intercept b 0 the decay rate and d t is the density at time t of age 0 gizzard shad per 1000 m 3 d t 1 0 3 l u p egg z ν n z t d z we tested a number of other models and found the exponential decay model to be the most robust based on aic scores finally eq 2 is constructed from multiplying the total number of eggs that survive to be an age 1 fish with a normal distribution of length c 1 z normalpdf μ r σ r where μ r is the mean length of age 1 gizzard shad and σ r is the standard deviation 2 3 dynamical model the population at time t 1 is the sum of the contributions from each individual alive at time t 5 n z t 1 l u k z z n z t d

upper mississippi river restoration monitors the umrs to provide an understanding of the system s ecology resource changes and inform management bouska et al 2018 maher et al 2015 in order to achieve this goal numerous features of the umrs such as aquatic vegetation bathymetry fish land use land cover and water quality are surveyed in particular reaches along the upper mississippi river ltrm fish surveys are conducted at five locations along the main channel of the upper mississippi river pools 4 8 13 26 and the open river reach and at one location along the illinois river la grange reach fig 2 a fish are captured using a multiple gear approach which includes netting and electrofishing in order to monitor the responses and status of fish communities along these two waterways over time gutreuter et al 1995 specific capture methodologies protocols and modifications to the ltrm can be found in gutreuter et al 1995 and ickes and burkhardt 2002 and the dataset can be access online ltrm 2022 in terms of gizzard shad fish traits have been recorded since 1989 with approximately 3000 collections occurring per year along the mississippi river fig 2 b for the la grange reach of the illinois river gizzard shad have been sampled and measured since 1990 with approximately 500 collections occurring per year to parameterize our model we used gizzard shad data collected from the 5 sites pools 4 8 13 26 and open river reach along the mississippi river fig 2 a we then validated our model using empirical information collected from the la grange reach of the illinois river we undertook this approach as the la grange reach is upstream from the mississippi river making it a more distinct location compared to the other sites 3 1 1 fecundity and recruitment female gizzard shad begin reproducing at approximately 140 mm in length and egg numbers tend to increase with fish size jons and miranda 1997 the logistic parameters for the mean number of eggs produced by females of a certain length were obtained by fitting the three parameter logistic function eq 3 to the data for batch fecundity versus length jons and miranda 1997 fig 3 a fish survival to age 1 was assumed to be dependent on the density of age 0 gizzard shad fig 3 b parameters for the exponentially decaying age 0 survival function eq 4 were determined by fitting eq 4 to the survival means for 2003 2007 cohorts of gizzard shad in five missouri reservoirs michaletz 2010 to complete the recruitment process we assign a length to the recruited individuals by simulating a gaussian random variable with mean μ r and standard deviation σ r the parameters for the size distribution of age 1 fish were gleaned from a study of gizzard shad located in large impoundments michaletz 2017 and the historical 1990 2020 ltrm dataset ltrm 2022 from the main channel of the umrs discussed in section 3 1 3 1 2 growth and survival of adults the parameters for the growth function were chosen as the mean values published on a study of gizzard shad located in large impoundments in missouri u s a michaletz 2017 the association between adult lengths and survival have not been well resolved in gizzard shad leading us to make a few assumptions first we assume that the probability of adult survival is related to the length by a four parameter logistic function eq 1 an investigation of gizzard shad in lake erie bodola 1955 provided the minimum and maximum survival rate of adults we used a least squares method to estimate the α s and β s parameters that minimize the total square distance between the pre carp ltrm length distribution in the main channel of the umrs observed and the predicted model distribution n z t during an 8 year period occurring 100 years after initialization observed length distributions of gizzard shad sampled from the main channel of the mississippi river fig 2 b have similar profiles however some variation does exist this may be attributed to changes in factors such as hydrology water quality and the occurrence of submersed aquatic vegetation we averaged the simulated length distributions over an 8 year period in order to reduce contributions from these environmental factors the slope parameter β s was found to be large in magnitude resulting in a primarily two valued survival probability gizzard shad less than α s mm in length have a very low survival rate s min and lengths larger than α s mm approach the maximum survival rate s max this survival pattern has been reported for several fish species and can arise due to a number of biotic i e predation and or abiotic i e temperature factors pepin et al 1992 nowlin et al 2006 4 analysis and results we numerically solved the integral model using the midpoint rule with large approximating matrices burden and faires 2005 the midpoint rule has been commonly used for integral projection models because of its simplicity and effectiveness ellner and rees 2006 ramula et al 2009 merow et al 2014 during the course of model development we explored different step sizes for the midpoint rule and found that about 50 points provided numerically stable results we integrated over lengths from 0 mm to 500 mm the upper limit was chosen based upon numerical stability and consistency of the system e g avoiding eviction or the loss of individuals due to numerical errors williams et al 2012 4 1 initial conditions we assumed that the initial density of gizzard shad was d 0 1487 93 fish the average annual density of gizzard shad caught with all gear types represented in the ltrm fish program in la grange reach from 1993 2020 the probability of an individual being length z at time t 0 was assumed to be normally distributed with mean 0 5 l and standard deviation σ g as a result we initialized our model with length distribution 6 n z 0 d 0 norm 0 5 l σ g 1487 93 norm 197 15 25 the model was coded in r r core team 2017 and the scripts are published on jp s github page https github com jppeirce 4 1 1 effect of density dependence on the survival probability of the age 0 cohort in the simulated solutions to the ipm the density of age 0 fish are strongly influenced by the density of gizzard shad at subsequent developmental stages when adult densities are large there may be more fish of longer lengths that can produce a greater number of eggs assuming that there are not additional food resources and egg larval predators present a greater number of eggs leads to a higher density of age 0 fish and reflectively a reduction in the survival to age 1 if reduced survival continues over subsequent years the overall density of fish within the population may decline and result in a smaller number of longer length fish that are reproducing fewer fish spawning could result in a smaller age 0 class which in turn could enhance survival probability in this cohort through reduced competition we would then expect the overall density of fish to increase over the following years until large numbers of eggs are again produced by larger adult fish this oscillatory pattern is reflected in our model by the time dependent survival probability of age 0 recruits fig 4 4 1 2 periodic orbit and validation with external dataset the total number of gizzard shad in our simulation reached a stable periodic orbit fig 5 a within 50 years after simulating an additional 50 years we fit a periodic function to the annual density of gizzard shad and determined the period of approximately 8 74 years fig 5 b illustrates the periodic length dynamics within the gizzard shad population during a 9 year window of the periodic orbit as a validation of the model the simulated length distributions during a periodic orbit fig 5 b have similarities to fish lengths observed from the la grange reach fig 6 in addition the ebb and flow of the frequency of the age 1 cohort can be observed and is associated with the density dependent survival function for age 0 fish explained in section 4 1 1 5 discussion gizzard shad are common in freshwater systems of north america where they contribute to the integrity of aquatic communities given this it is important to understand population patterns within this species herein we use both ltrm data and parameters gleaned from other empirical studies to develop an integral projection model for gizzard shad and test model outputs against patterns reported from a well studied population of this species from the la grange reach of the illinois river after fitting two adult survival parameters using ltrm data from the main channel of the mississippi river we compared a simulated length distribution with empirical data collected from the la grange reach of the illinois river from 1992 to 2020 the resulting simulated length distributions fig 5 b reflected many of the patterns observed in gizzard shad captured from the la grange reach over the same timeframe fig 6 for example the predicted transition from bimodal length distributions to a single peak in smaller gizzard shad in our simulations was reflected in the empirical data from 1996 to 2000 this trend was also observed from 2004 2008 it should be noted that there were also discrepancies between model simulations and the empirical data in particular we did not notice a distinct single peak in intermediate sized fish from field collections even though this was predicted by our model temporal and spatial variations in the la grange reach environment and the subsequent effect on growth within the shad population may help explain why certain trends in our ipm outputs were not well represented in the field collections the average over 1 period simulated length frequency compared well with the overall length frequencies of gizzard shad sampled in la grange reach from 1992 2020 fig 7 our simulated size frequencies of gizzard shad captured the general trends seen in fish collected from the study site that being said the model did predict a slightly higher density of adult lengths and fewer juvenile smaller lengths than in the empirical data this may be explained by gear type and capture method which vary from site to site potentially introducing bias in the observed length distributions year to year in addition studies also indicate that environmental stochasticity and food variability may alter recruitment densities which are difficult to measure accurately michaletz 2010 okamoto et al 2016 rose 2000 future investigations may use spring water temperature measurements from the ltrm water quality component to modify the adult survival function eq 1 to be temperature dependent although our model uses the density of age 0 gizzard shad to affect the survival probability in their first year we assumed constant viability at subsequent developmental stages which may also be sensitive to density related factors however currently there is little information available on the role that density plays in the life history responses of adult gizzard shad the location of the maximum length and the variation in the length of new recruits recorded in the ltrm data indicates that there may be smaller age 0 fish in la grange reach than in the study location michaletz 2017 used to parameterize the model gaining an understanding of how length distributions of gizzard shad emerge under density dependent survival in the age 0 class serve as a foundation for investigating density effects at subsequent stages in the life cycle in addition this single species model could also be expanded to incorporate interspecific interactions between gizzard shad and species such as invasive carp which appear to negatively impact gizzard shad life histories through competition for resources credit authorship contribution statement j peirce

agrocampus ouest nantes france decod ecosystem dynamics and sustainability ifremer inrae institut agro agrocampus ouest nantes france species distribution models sdm are commonly used to identify potential habitats when fitting them to heterogeneous opportunistically collated presence absence data imbalance in the number of presence and absence observations often occurs which could influence results to robustly identify potential habitats for blackspot seabream pagellus bogaraveo throughout its distribution area in the northeast atlantic and the western mediterranean sea we used an ensemble species distribution modelling esdm approach modelling gridded presence absence data with environmental predictors for two types of occurrence data sets the first data set displayed the observed unbalanced spatially heterogeneous presence absence ratio and the second a balanced presence absence ratio the data covered the full distribution area including the european atlantic shelf the azorean region and the western mediterranean sea across these regions populations display variable status the main environmental predictors for potential habitats were bathymetry and annual maximum sst the fitted ensemble compromise esdm was projected over the whole grid to create a habitat suitability map this map exhibited higher probabilities of presence for the balanced ratio data set a binary presence absence map was then generated using optimized presence probability thresholds for four validation indices using the true skill statistic to optimize the threshold the surface areas of the binary presence absence map was 53 smaller for the balanced data set than for the observed unbalanced data set however the choice of validation index had an even greater impact up to 15 000 this indicates that studies using opportunistic data for sdm fitting need to pay attention to the effects of presence absence data imbalance and the choice of validation index to fully evaluate

data 1 introduction actual and potential areas of species distribution can be investigated via ecological niche modelling soberón and nakamura 2009 a species niche is defined as a subset of environmental conditions under which populations of a species have positive growth rates soberón and nakamura 2009 the habitat is then the geographical translation of these environmental conditions the fundamental niche is the theoretical combination of environmental variable that allows for physiological processes feeding growth reproduction to take place hutchinson 1978 essential fish habitats defined as areas or volumes of water and bottom substrates that provide the most favourable habitats for fish populations to spawn feed and mature throughout their full life cycle are thus the geographical translation of the optimal part of the fundamental niche of a species helaouët and beaugrand 2009 valanis et al 2008 the realized niche is the subset of environmental conditions the species is actually using soberón and nakamura 2009 species may occur outside the fundamental niche during migrations in contrast the realized niche might be reduced when densities are low because of intensive predation or fishing helaouët and beaugrand 2009 the realized habitat of a species can then be defined as the geographical translation of the realized niche of a species it differs from the species distribution since all locations displaying the environmental conditions of the realized niche might not be occupied simultaneously especially if the species distribution is wide species distribution models sdms have been used in conservation biology to describe the habitat distribution of organisms in both marine and terrestrial systems laman et al 2018 elith and leathwick 2009 valanis et al 2008 they are grounded in the concept of ecological niche hutchinson 1957 they have been widely used since 2005 and have reached high statistical sophistication in recent years schickele et al 2020 jiménez and soberón 2020 robinson et al 2017 ecological assumptions implied when using sdms are that there is niche conservatism crisp et al 1981 and unlimited dispersal abilities wiens et al 2009 and that biotic interactions do not influence large scale distributions gleason 1926 guisan and thuiller 2005 schickele et al 2020 among the numerous statistical sdms approaches developed to map fish habitats ensemble species distribution modelling esdm also referred to as ensemble niche modelling thuillier et al 2016 which combines the use of several sdm categories appears to be a good compromise in terms of programming skills required computation time and consistency of the results schickele et al 2020 mateo et al 2019 data availability is often opportunistic so that neither the fundamental habitat nor the realized species habitat is entirely represented by sdms indeed the theoretical entire range of fundamental environmental conditions of a species is never fully known and available presence records will never cover the full habitat ecologists thus generally refer to sdm output as potential niche and habitat of the species of interest schickele et al 2020 helaouët and beaugrand 2009 several data filtration and selection processes as well as physiological prospects for example optimal environmental ranges for spawning or egg development can then help approaching the species realized or essential habitat schickele et al 2020 helaouët and beaugrand 2009 implementing sdms especially in the case of widely distributed species such as the blackspot seabream pagellus bogaraveo brünnich 1768 often requires combining heterogeneous multiple data sets schickele et al 2020 fithian et al 2015 in the case of presence absence data two types of biases have then to be taken into account first detectability might vary among sampling techniques used to collect data kellner and swihart 2014 second variations in prevalence i e the number of presence records among sampled points might reflect primarily variations in abundance rather than habitat suitability when data are missing on the detection probability of sampling techniques taking into account detection might not always improve sdm performance welsh et al 2013 and these two biasing effects detectability and variations in prevalence might be difficult to disentangle in the case of presence only data a common practice is to generate pseudo absence data schickele et al 2020 in this case the number of generated pseudo absences is generally set equal to the number of presences montgomery 2005 for actual presence absence data prevalence will vary in space in particular for large study areas this raises questions given spatial predictions from sdms are known to be sensitive to sample prevalence jiménez valverde 2021 the general aim of this study was to investigate the potential habitat of the blackspot seabream and its occupancy level in three regions in the northeast atlantic atlantic european shelf the azorean region and the mediterranean sea occupancy levels were presumed to differ between regions because of the contrasted population status and variable degree of fishery exploitation to evaluate the impact of heterogeneous prevalence in the data and obtain robust results we compared esdm models using 1 all available presence absence records i e prevalence varying over the distribution area of blackspot seabream 2 the same number of presence and absence record i e constant prevalence over the distribution area 2 material and methods 2 1 case study the blackspot seabream used to be a widely distributed and abundant species of the north eastern atlantic shelf from the faroe islands down to gibraltar the azores and the western mediterranean sea desbrosses 1932 sanz fernández et al 2019 pinho et al 2014 erzini et al 2006 spedicato et al 2002 d onghia et al 2010 2012 in fact it was also referred to as la dorade commune understand the common seabream by french authors in the early 1900s desbrosses 1932 olivier 1928 increase in fishing effort in the bay of biscay north eastern atlantic shelf in the 1960s linked to stock declines of other species of fisheries interest such as hake associated to its susceptibility to overexploitation led to a brutal collapse of this blackspot seabream stock 20 years later in 1975 1985 and low stock size ever since see fig 1a lorance 2011 guichet et al 1971 dardignac 1988 blackspot seabream displays three characteristics that make it susceptible to over exploitation francis and clark 2005 first its biological productivity is low individuals reaching 70 cm long in 25 to 30 years and females being mostly the older individuals since the species is hermaphroditic protandrous with changing sex from male to female guéguen 1969 lorance 2011 second blackspot seabream is easy to capture during its seasonal migrations because of its aggregative behaviour afonso et al 2012 2014 indeed adults carry out geographic and depth seasonal migrations from coastal waters where they reproduce and where juveniles are found down to 700 m and up to several hundreds of km away from the coast morato et al 2001 mytilineou et al 2005 accordingly in the bay of biscay individuals present to the west of brittany 48 n were found to overwinter in the cantabrian sea 43 n gueguen 1974 in azorean waters juveniles which are only found in coastal areas migrate to isolated seamounts when reaching adult stage sometimes more than 400 km away hareide and garnes 2001 lastly the species has a high commercial value owing to its organoleptic quality comparable to gilthead seabream and sea bass rincón et al 2016 overall available stock assessments and landings of commercial fisheries suggest that populations from the european shelf are at low level with small recent catches 2018 2021 compared to past levels anterior to 1980 while populations from the azorean region are in better condition with current fisheries being sustainable ices 2021 fig 1 historically before 1980 catches from the northeast atlantic shelf constituted the bulk of landings reaching up to more than 20000 t per year fig 1a with the bay of biscay being the main fishing area in comparison levels of gilthead seabream catches were similar back then while currently hake is the most fished species in the bay of biscay with around 30000 t landed per year followed by monkfish 8000 t per year sole 3000 t per year and seabass 2000 t per year official nominal catches 2006 2019 version 15 10 2021 accessed 05 05 2022 via https ices dk data dataset collections pages fish catch and stock assessment aspx ices from the 1990s catches from the northern atlantic came mostly from the iberian coast and the strait of gibraltar and were at similar level than catches from the azorean area fig 1a reported catches from the mediterranean sea are probably not realistic because in this region 5000 t to 10000 t of fish have been landed as unidentified sparid fish or similar labelling and this might have comprised catch statistics of blackspot seabream fao gfcm 2021 therefore the increased reported landings in recent years fig 1b may be due to improved reporting of landings by species quotas as well as other management measures such as minimum landing size and closed fishing seasons are implemented in all areas pinho et al 2014 lorance 2011 indeed fishing has been shown to be the main factor accounting for variations in the species stock abundance with values reaching up to 73 of the variations in stock abundance nowadays around gibraltar sanz fernández et al 2019 in the case of poor stock status the species distribution might contract within its essential habitats that thus needs to be identified to enable targeted conservation management measures to be implemented 2 2 data 2 2 1 species observations presence absence records of blackspot seabream were compiled from trawling and longline scientific surveys evhoe

environmental variables investigated is provided in sup mat 1 the mean maximum minimum and standard deviation of environmental variables were computed for each grid cell n 6465 2 3 methods the general workflow used in this study is presented in fig 3 model reporting was done following recommendations by zurell et al 2020 2 3 1 study area three regions were modelled corresponding to the three main areas of distribution of the blackspot seabream the northeast atlantic shelf the azorean region and the western mediterranean basin fig 2 a spatial grid of 0 1 x 0 1 cells 44851 in total was created covering the three regions this resolution was chosen accounting for the need for local and general overviews of species habitat as well as computation time 2 3 2 occurrence data compilation gridding and selection for each grid cell with data n 6465 the number of presence and absence records was counted the occurrence data set displayed over and under sampled areas fig 2 in order to take into account this heterogeneity occurrence records were compiled into presence absence records cells with at least one presence were considered as presence cells cells with only absence records were considered as absence cells and the remaining cells were considered as non sampled cells and were not used for model fitting in order to maintain an homogeneous distributions of sampled cells along environmental gradients continuous environmental variables were discretized into 60 classes each which appeared to be a good compromise to create relevant classes for all environmental variables over the whole grid domain when a given combination of environmental variable classes corresponded to several presence cells only one presence cell was kept similarly for absence cells when a given combination corresponded to several presence and absence cells one presence and one absence cell was kept thus the number of data points used for model fitting depended on the environmental predictors included in a particular model table 2 since the ratio between the number of presence and absence grid cells still varied among regions after the gridding process two approaches were tested in the first case observed ratio data set all available presence absence grid cells were kept in the next steps of the analysis in the second case balanced ratio data set the same number of absence and presence grid cells was used for all regions by randomly selecting absence grid cells among all available absence cells the second approach corresponds to the common practice for presence only data for which pseudo absence data are created montgomery 2005 see fig 3 step 1 2 3 3 selection of environmental predictors given the observation of heterogeneous responses to some of the environmental variables according to the region azores atlantic shelf and mediterranean sea see sup mat 2 a categorical predictor was added for region to identify the most parsimonious environmental data set explaining the blackspot seabream distribution pairwise correlations between all environmental variables were investigated with a pearson s correlation test using as correlation threshold r 0 7 schickele et al 2020 dormann et al 2013 when several environmental variables were highly correlated we retained the environmental variable with the highest relative importance schickele et al 2020 leroy et al 2014 sup mat 3 as the previous selection step led to a high number 9 of remaining environmental predictors for both occurrence data sets multiple models were fitted with decreasing number of predictors 9 to 2 predictors removing sequentially the predictor with the smallest relative importance to balance model fit and model complexity meynard et al 2019 see fig 3 step 1 next for each of the eight combinations of predictors and each occurrence data set type observed ratio and balanced ratio one occurrence data set was created for calibration 16 data sets 2 3 4 species distribution model categories and settings the following eight sdm categories were implemented in r using the biomod2 package thuillier et al 2003 2016 with default parameter settings generalised linear model glm generalised boosting model gbm generalized additive model gam artificial neural network ann model flexible discriminant analysis fda random forest rf classification tree analysis cta and surface range envelope sre model valanis et al 2008 thuiller et al 2009 albouy et al 2012 clairbaux et al 2019 pecchi et al 2019 for each sdm category and data set a 3 fold cross validation procedure was performed 2 3 5 sdm category selection and compromise we used the true skill statistics index tss allouche et al 2006 to quantify the performance of each of the eight fitted sdms for each calibration data set see fig 3 step 2 it was calculated as tss sensitivity proportion of presence cells classified correctly specificity proportion of correct absence cells 1 a sdm was selected for ensemble modelling if it had tss 0 5 a compromise the ensemble species distribution model esdm of the presence probability was then calculated as the mean of probabilities of retained sdms weighted by their tss value presence probability uncertainty was quantified using the coefficient of variation from cross validation results individual sdm response curves to environmental predictors as well as the esdm resulting presence probabilities according to the different predictors schickele et al 2020 are presented in sup mat 4 and 5 2 3 6 binary habitat maps and predictors selection to define habitat suitability maps for each of the 16 calibrated ensemble models 2 data sets x 8 predictors combination with 2 to 9 predictors presence probabilities were projected over the whole domain including the cells not included in the calibration process extrapolation for the non sampled cells then in order to create binary presence absence maps the habitat suitability maps presence probabilities were compared to all observed presence and absence compiled cells not only those used for model fitting threshold values for binary projections of presence and absence were calculated based on a set of indices as recommended by robinson et al 2017 namely the hit rate proportion of correctly classified presence cells the true skill statistics tss allouche et al 2006 the cbi computed with the ecospat boyce function of the ecospat package on r hirzel et al 2006 and the overall accuracy sum of the proportion of correctly classified presence and absence cells allouche et al 2006 more precisely each validation index was maximized varying threshold values for binary projections of presence and absence from 0 to 1 with a 0 001 interval with the optimize function in r each maximized index value thus corresponded to a distinct optimized threshold value for each data set type the best calibrated esdm was chosen as the one showing the lowest number of predictors and the highest validation index values to combine validation index values their values were re scaled between 0 lowest index value obtained across esdm outputs with 2 9 predictors and 1 highest index value in the case of the balanced ratio data set as absence cells selection might have impacted ensemble model performance in the previous steps 10 data sets with the chosen number of predictors and varying absence cells were randomly selected and the average of habitat suitability maps re calibration was used for further validation lastly for each data set type and validation index the surface of potential habitat was calculated 3 results 3 1 data characteristics in total 106 457 occurrence records were compiled among which 6465 presence records corresponding to 782 cells where the species was present and 5683 cells where it was recorded as absent fig 2 table 1 the proportion of presence cells among sampled cells was highly heterogeneous between regions as well as the number of records per cell respectively 7 8 to 30 5 and 14 to 35 records per cell see table 1 3 2 esdm outputs and habitat suitability maps after predictor selection using pairwise correlation analysis nine predictors were retained for the ensemble modelling procedure region ne atlantic azores mediterranean sea sea bottom type mean and standard deviation of bathymetry m annual maximum sea surface temperature sst c annual mean and minimum absolute current velocity m s 1 annual standard deviation of salinity and annual standard deviation of bottom temperature c sup mat 3 mean bathymetry and maximum sst had the highest explanatory power for both data sets both variables contributing equally table 2 the main difference between ensemble models for the two data set types was that for the observed ratio data set heterogeneous ratios of presence and absence over the model domain the categorical predictor region had a high relative importance which was not the case for the balanced ratio data set balanced number of presence and absence grid cells in each region table 2 sup mat 6 sdm categories ann gbm and rf were selected in most cases tss 0 5 while the selection of the other sdm categories varied according to the number of predictors and the data set type used table 2 sup mat 6 tss values were higher for the observed ratio data set for all models two to nine predictors with values around 0 7 for the balanced ratio data set and around 0 9 for the observed ratio data set table 2 sup mat 6 as a result of the data selection procedure the data set size decreased with decreasing number of predictors leading to low data set sizes for models with less than five predictors table 2 comparing projected habitat suitability maps presence probabilities per grid cell over the whole domain between data set types it appeared that a balanced ratio between presence and absence data led to overall higher presence probabilities and hence a much wider potential habitat in the ne atlantic region and in the mediterranean sea region compared to the results obtained with the observed ratio data set while the projected presence probabilities appeared rather similar for the azores region figs 4 and 5 the visual difference was confirmed by the mean projected presence probability over the whole domain being 0 16 0 19 for the balanced ratio data set and only 0 07 0 09 for the observed ratio data set fig 4 differences between projected presence probabilities obtained with the balanced ratio data set and the observed ratio data set were the highest in the ne atlantic with respective values of 0 19 0 21 and 0 06 0 07 and the lowest in the azores with both values equal to 0 07 0 10 fig 4 for both data set types coefficients of variation of presence probabilities did not exceed 0 25 fig 5 overall the choice of data set type impacted presence probability values but did not impact consistently which predictors were selected except for the region predictor nor the general shape of the response curve for each predictor except for maximum annual sst for which the relationship was dome shaped for balanced ratio data set and more flat for the observed ratio data set table 2 and sup mat 4 3 3 binary habitat maps 3 3 1 predictors comparison of the three validation index values between esdms using 2 to 9 predictors normalized between 0 an 1 0 being the smallest index value across the set of predictors and 1 being the highest led to select the esdm with six predictors for both data set types indeed these models displayed among the best index values for the smallest number of predictors fig 6 the best predictors for the balanced ratio data set were mean bathymetry annual maximum sst standard deviation sd of bathymetry sd of mean annual bottom temperature sd of mean annual bottom salinity and minimum annual absolute current velocity for the observed ratio data set predictor region was selected instead of minimum annual absolute current velocity table 2 sup mat 6 the region predictor had a 9 contribution to the explained variance and compared to the balanced ratio data set contribution of other variables was lower for bathymetry and higher for all other variables 3 3 2 indices and threshold optimization validation index values accuracy hit rate cbi and tss were slightly higher for the observed ratio data set than for the balanced ratio data set sup mat 8 variations in estimated habitat area between validation indices were higher than between data set types fig 7 overall the choice of threshold value used for transforming presence probabilities into binary habitat maps strongly influenced results for the whole area and for each of the regions fig 8 for regional habitat area estimation separate threshold values were obtained by maximizing index values regionally maximizing the hit rate led to the lowest threshold values for the whole area and each region and subsequently the largest habitat areas cbi and accuracy led to the smallest habitat areas especially for the ne atlantic region for which the observed presence absence ratio was low for the whole area averaged across the two data types the habitat areas for hit rate and tss were 14849 and 1280 larger than for cbi respectively comparing results between the two data sets showed that the balanced data set let to smaller habitat areas for the majority of indices for the whole area and each of the three regions figs 7 and 8 for the whole area the difference balanced observed observed ranged between 53 for tss and 4 for cbi for the azores the difference ranged between 3 for accuracy and 27 for tss for the mediterranean sea between 36 for tss and 0 for cbi and for the ne atlantic region between 28 for accuracy and 23 for cbi thus the choice of validation index had a much greater impact than the data set type though the later was also important for certain indices 3 3 3 binary habitat maps visual comparison of binary presence absence habitat maps threshold optimized according to tss index between data set types showed that for the balanced ratio data set some locations from which the species had been reported were missed particularly to the west of ireland and along the mediterranean coast figs 2 and 9 overall it appears that the potential habitat of the species covers a large area around seamounts in the azores region a wide area on the ne atlantic shelf and a narrower are on the mediterranean shelf fig 9 4 discussion in this study to obtain robust estimates of the potential habitat of blackspot seabream across its wide distribution area exhibiting varying exploitation status an ensemble species distribution modelling approach and two data sets with different prevalence levels were used the identified potential habitats included islands contours and seamounts in the azores region the ne atlantic shelf south of 48 n with smaller areas further north and the northern shores of the western mediterranean sea with more extended areas in the strait of gibraltar in the gulf of lions and along the italian coast potential habitats of blackspot seabream were best explained by bathymetry down to 700 1000 m and sst annual maximum sst generally greater than 16 c as well as bottom temperature salinity and region as secondary predictors independent of the prevalence level in the data set except for region further the general shape of the response curves for each predictor were similar for the two data sets except for max sst see response curves in sup mat 4 other studies have reported the same main factors influencing the species distribution and abundance with occurrences reported in areas with bottom depths between 100 m and 700 m mytilineou et al 2014 burgos et al 2013 menezes and giacomello 2013 d onghia et al 2010 gueguen 1974 and environmental conditions linked to temperature and salinity influencing stock variations sanz fernández et al 2019 the general importance of the region predictor can be explained by regional differences in biophysical conditions while the difference in importance of this predictor for the two prevalence data sets is most likely caused by differences in the prevalence in the observed ratio data sets table 2 these regional discrepancies in prevalence might be explained by the differences in population status with the northeast atlantic population being most depleted it is less likely caused by differences in detectability by the employed sampling methods which could however be explored by comparing several methods for the same area and using models integrating detectability fithian et al 2015 fletcher et al 2016 2019 in the bay of biscay which is in the centre of the northeast atlantic region the esdm suggested that the potential habitat covered a large part of the continental shelf indeed the species used to occur over most of this shelf before the population collapsed in the late 1970s in the azorean region which has been termed an oceanic seamount ecosystem silva and pinho 2007 the species occurs around islands with juveniles distributed in near coast habitats as in the bay of biscay and adults spread from the coast to island slopes and isolated seamounts juveniles never occur at sea mounts pinho et al 2014 depth was identified as the main factor for explaining blackspot seabream abundance and size composition on azorean seamounts santos et al 2021 in the same area morato et al 2001 showed that the species feeds on both pelagic and benthic preys and suggested that its food supply on seamounts may depend upon oceanic production that drifts past seamounts which in turn makes bottom slope a factor for the species distribution as current strength and therefore the amount of prey advected increase with slope at the scale of the environment perceived by individual fish similar hydrological conditions in particular strong and variable tidal currents resulting from the interaction of oceanic water masses koslow 1996 lorance et al 2002 prevail at seamounts and along the continental slope where blackspot seabream also occurs at this fine scale the species shows diel vertical migrations afonso et al 2012 which may suggest a behaviour similar to that of deeper living seamount aggregators which share with blackspot seabream a high lipid content and strong swimming abilities which are both related to high metabolism koslow 1996 overall the habitat characteristics of fish displaying this type of behaviour include sloping sea bottom and related variations in current speed which generate also temperature variations and is in line with habitats variables found to be predictors of blackspot seabream presence absence in this study the ratio between presence and absence cells in the data impacted strongly the projected probabilities of presence imposing a balanced ratio between the number of presence and absence cells for model calibration led to higher presence probabilities on average compared to using the observed ratio data set with a large majority of absence cells 0 16 0 19 and 0 07 0 09 respectively thus including primarily absence cells in model calibration reduced estimated presence probabilities the habitat suitability map for the balanced ratio data set indicated wide potential habitats over the ne atlantic shelf and along the western mediterranean and azores coasts while potential habitats were smaller using the observed ratio data set the habitat size was reversed between the two data sets for the corresponding presence absence maps with larger binary habitats for the observed ratio data set due to a smaller optimized threshold value these binary maps obtained by applying a optimized presence probability threshold are probably closer to the realized habitat of the species as it involved the full presence absence data to set the threshold values the binary presence habitat was notably smaller over the european shelf where one regional population is depleted the past high abundance of the species throughout the bay of biscay olivier 1928 desbrosses 1932 guichet et al 1971 indicates that this area was suitable for the species 100 to 50 years ago the increase of fishing effort on the species at the same period lorance 2011 must indeed have been the main trigger for the species decreased abundance leading to a concentration of the remaining individuals into the most suitable habitats in this region along the coast around isobath 100 m and on the continental slope the present study suggests that current environmental factors remain suitable for the species although environmental changes have occurred since notably a temperature rise of 0 2 c decade for the period 1965 2004 in the 0 200 m water column layer michel et al 2009 valencia et al 2019 the observed presence absence ratio data set had higher validation indices for the fitted model compared to the balanced ratio data set further the corresponding binary habitat map included more areas outside the sampled area for example it predicted the species presence close to the west of ireland where the species did indeed occur in the past gueguen 1974 and more widely along the western mediterranean coast where it is present nowadays spedicato et al 2002 the use of different validation indices hit rate tss cbi and accuracy led to different threshold values for transforming the probability of presence into binary habitat and subsequently different habitat surface areas overall the difference in the size of estimated habitat area was larger between validation indices when between data set types differences in predicted habitat areas according to the selected thresholding method have been reported by various authors nenzén and araújo 2011 jiménez valverde and lobo 2007 liu et al 2005 2016 in our case given the species low prevalence absence cell records had a large impact on the estimated threshold when maximizing using the accuracy index leading to habitats mostly restrained to the cells where species observations had been made hence being closer to the only partial observed distribution although its use has been recommended in the case of unbalanced prevalence leroy et al 2018 the use of the cbi index led to the same effect in contrast using the tss index for setting the probability threshold value involved balancing correct predictions of both presence and absence cells and hence seemed more likely to lead to binary habitats closer to the species potential habitats the difference between habitat areas derived using tss optimized threshold values for balanced and observed unbalanced data sets depended strongly on the region used for optimization the largest negative difference was observed for the whole area 53 while it was negligible 2 for the ne atlantic region and positive 27 for the azores unbalanced prevalence has been reported to artificially increase the tss value leroy et al 2018 which implies that the balanced data set should have provided a better understanding of blackspot seabream potential habitats contrary to this expectation it seems that in our case using a bigger data set with unbalanced presence absence cells was more informative than using a smaller data set with a selected number of balanced presence absence cells several studies have shown that the use of presence true absence data are generally better than presence only data with or without using pseudo absences and that presence only models generally under estimate the species presence in locations where is has not been sampled dorazio 2014 meynard et al 2019 wisz and guisan 2009 our study is in accordance with this general result in addition it showed that the proportion of absences data matters the difference between the estimated area of the blackspot seabream potential habitat obtained with the observed ratio data set and the balanced ratio data set for the same threshold value increased with the decreasing proportion of presence data in the observed data from the azores to the ne atlantic which in turn corresponds to decreasing stock status of blackspot seabream in summary the results of this study provided evidence that when using opportunistic data for sdm fitting attention needs to be paid to the effects of presence absence data imbalance as well as the choice of validation indices to fully evaluate uncertainty of estimated

agrocampus ouest nantes france decod ecosystem dynamics and sustainability ifremer inrae institut agro agrocampus ouest nantes france species distribution models sdm are commonly used to identify potential habitats when fitting them to heterogeneous opportunistically collated presence absence data imbalance in the number of presence and absence observations often occurs which could influence results to robustly identify potential habitats for blackspot seabream pagellus bogaraveo throughout its distribution area in the northeast atlantic and the western mediterranean sea we used an ensemble species distribution modelling esdm approach modelling gridded presence absence data with environmental predictors for two types of occurrence data sets the first data set displayed the observed unbalanced spatially heterogeneous presence absence ratio and the second a balanced presence absence ratio the data covered the full distribution area including the european atlantic shelf the azorean region and the western mediterranean sea across these regions populations display variable status the main environmental predictors for potential habitats were bathymetry and annual maximum sst the fitted ensemble compromise esdm was projected over the whole grid to create a habitat suitability map this map exhibited higher probabilities of presence for the balanced ratio data set a binary presence absence map was then generated using optimized presence probability thresholds for four validation indices using the true skill statistic to optimize the threshold the surface areas of the binary presence absence map was 53 smaller for the balanced data set than for the observed unbalanced data set however the choice of validation index had an even greater impact up to 15 000 this indicates that studies using opportunistic data for sdm fitting need to pay attention to the effects of presence absence data imbalance and the choice of validation index to fully evaluate

data 1 introduction actual and potential areas of species distribution can be investigated via ecological niche modelling soberón and nakamura 2009 a species niche is defined as a subset of environmental conditions under which populations of a species have positive growth rates soberón and nakamura 2009 the habitat is then the geographical translation of these environmental conditions the fundamental niche is the theoretical combination of environmental variable that allows for physiological processes feeding growth reproduction to take place hutchinson 1978 essential fish habitats defined as areas or volumes of water and bottom substrates that provide the most favourable habitats for fish populations to spawn feed and mature throughout their full life cycle are thus the geographical translation of the optimal part of the fundamental niche of a species helaouët and beaugrand 2009 valanis et al 2008 the realized niche is the subset of environmental conditions the species is actually using soberón and nakamura 2009 species may occur outside the fundamental niche during migrations in contrast the realized niche might be reduced when densities are low because of intensive predation or fishing helaouët and beaugrand 2009 the realized habitat of a species can then be defined as the geographical translation of the realized niche of a species it differs from the species distribution since all locations displaying the environmental conditions of the realized niche might not be occupied simultaneously especially if the species distribution is wide species distribution models sdms have been used in conservation biology to describe the habitat distribution of organisms in both marine and terrestrial systems laman et al 2018 elith and leathwick 2009 valanis et al 2008 they are grounded in the concept of ecological niche hutchinson 1957 they have been widely used since 2005 and have reached high statistical sophistication in recent years schickele et al 2020 jiménez and soberón 2020 robinson et al 2017 ecological assumptions implied when using sdms are that there is niche conservatism crisp et al 1981 and unlimited dispersal abilities wiens et al 2009 and that biotic interactions do not influence large scale distributions gleason 1926 guisan and thuiller 2005 schickele et al 2020 among the numerous statistical sdms approaches developed to map fish habitats ensemble species distribution modelling esdm also referred to as ensemble niche modelling thuillier et al 2016 which combines the use of several sdm categories appears to be a good compromise in terms of programming skills required computation time and consistency of the results schickele et al 2020 mateo et al 2019 data availability is often opportunistic so that neither the fundamental habitat nor the realized species habitat is entirely represented by sdms indeed the theoretical entire range of fundamental environmental conditions of a species is never fully known and available presence records will never cover the full habitat ecologists thus generally refer to sdm output as potential niche and habitat of the species of interest schickele et al 2020 helaouët and beaugrand 2009 several data filtration and selection processes as well as physiological prospects for example optimal environmental ranges for spawning or egg development can then help approaching the species realized or essential habitat schickele et al 2020 helaouët and beaugrand 2009 implementing sdms especially in the case of widely distributed species such as the blackspot seabream pagellus bogaraveo brünnich 1768 often requires combining heterogeneous multiple data sets schickele et al 2020 fithian et al 2015 in the case of presence absence data two types of biases have then to be taken into account first detectability might vary among sampling techniques used to collect data kellner and swihart 2014 second variations in prevalence i e the number of presence records among sampled points might reflect primarily variations in abundance rather than habitat suitability when data are missing on the detection probability of sampling techniques taking into account detection might not always improve sdm performance welsh et al 2013 and these two biasing effects detectability and variations in prevalence might be difficult to disentangle in the case of presence only data a common practice is to generate pseudo absence data schickele et al 2020 in this case the number of generated pseudo absences is generally set equal to the number of presences montgomery 2005 for actual presence absence data prevalence will vary in space in particular for large study areas this raises questions given spatial predictions from sdms are known to be sensitive to sample prevalence jiménez valverde 2021 the general aim of this study was to investigate the potential habitat of the blackspot seabream and its occupancy level in three regions in the northeast atlantic atlantic european shelf the azorean region and the mediterranean sea occupancy levels were presumed to differ between regions because of the contrasted population status and variable degree of fishery exploitation to evaluate the impact of heterogeneous prevalence in the data and obtain robust results we compared esdm models using 1 all available presence absence records i e prevalence varying over the distribution area of blackspot seabream 2 the same number of presence and absence record i e constant prevalence over the distribution area 2 material and methods 2 1 case study the blackspot seabream used to be a widely distributed and abundant species of the north eastern atlantic shelf from the faroe islands down to gibraltar the azores and the western mediterranean sea desbrosses 1932 sanz fernández et al 2019 pinho et al 2014 erzini et al 2006 spedicato et al 2002 d onghia et al 2010 2012 in fact it was also referred to as la dorade commune understand the common seabream by french authors in the early 1900s desbrosses 1932 olivier 1928 increase in fishing effort in the bay of biscay north eastern atlantic shelf in the 1960s linked to stock declines of other species of fisheries interest such as hake associated to its susceptibility to overexploitation led to a brutal collapse of this blackspot seabream stock 20 years later in 1975 1985 and low stock size ever since see fig 1a lorance 2011 guichet et al 1971 dardignac 1988 blackspot seabream displays three characteristics that make it susceptible to over exploitation francis and clark 2005 first its biological productivity is low individuals reaching 70 cm long in 25 to 30 years and females being mostly the older individuals since the species is hermaphroditic protandrous with changing sex from male to female guéguen 1969 lorance 2011 second blackspot seabream is easy to capture during its seasonal migrations because of its aggregative behaviour afonso et al 2012 2014 indeed adults carry out geographic and depth seasonal migrations from coastal waters where they reproduce and where juveniles are found down to 700 m and up to several hundreds of km away from the coast morato et al 2001 mytilineou et al 2005 accordingly in the bay of biscay individuals present to the west of brittany 48 n were found to overwinter in the cantabrian sea 43 n gueguen 1974 in azorean waters juveniles which are only found in coastal areas migrate to isolated seamounts when reaching adult stage sometimes more than 400 km away hareide and garnes 2001 lastly the species has a high commercial value owing to its organoleptic quality comparable to gilthead seabream and sea bass rincón et al 2016 overall available stock assessments and landings of commercial fisheries suggest that populations from the european shelf are at low level with small recent catches 2018 2021 compared to past levels anterior to 1980 while populations from the azorean region are in better condition with current fisheries being sustainable ices 2021 fig 1 historically before 1980 catches from the northeast atlantic shelf constituted the bulk of landings reaching up to more than 20000 t per year fig 1a with the bay of biscay being the main fishing area in comparison levels of gilthead seabream catches were similar back then while currently hake is the most fished species in the bay of biscay with around 30000 t landed per year followed by monkfish 8000 t per year sole 3000 t per year and seabass 2000 t per year official nominal catches 2006 2019 version 15 10 2021 accessed 05 05 2022 via https ices dk data dataset collections pages fish catch and stock assessment aspx ices from the 1990s catches from the northern atlantic came mostly from the iberian coast and the strait of gibraltar and were at similar level than catches from the azorean area fig 1a reported catches from the mediterranean sea are probably not realistic because in this region 5000 t to 10000 t of fish have been landed as unidentified sparid fish or similar labelling and this might have comprised catch statistics of blackspot seabream fao gfcm 2021 therefore the increased reported landings in recent years fig 1b may be due to improved reporting of landings by species quotas as well as other management measures such as minimum landing size and closed fishing seasons are implemented in all areas pinho et al 2014 lorance 2011 indeed fishing has been shown to be the main factor accounting for variations in the species stock abundance with values reaching up to 73 of the variations in stock abundance nowadays around gibraltar sanz fernández et al 2019 in the case of poor stock status the species distribution might contract within its essential habitats that thus needs to be identified to enable targeted conservation management measures to be implemented 2 2 data 2 2 1 species observations presence absence records of blackspot seabream were compiled from trawling and longline scientific surveys evhoe

environmental variables investigated is provided in sup mat 1 the mean maximum minimum and standard deviation of environmental variables were computed for each grid cell n 6465 2 3 methods the general workflow used in this study is presented in fig 3 model reporting was done following recommendations by zurell et al 2020 2 3 1 study area three regions were modelled corresponding to the three main areas of distribution of the blackspot seabream the northeast atlantic shelf the azorean region and the western mediterranean basin fig 2 a spatial grid of 0 1 x 0 1 cells 44851 in total was created covering the three regions this resolution was chosen accounting for the need for local and general overviews of species habitat as well as computation time 2 3 2 occurrence data compilation gridding and selection for each grid cell with data n 6465 the number of presence and absence records was counted the occurrence data set displayed over and under sampled areas fig 2 in order to take into account this heterogeneity occurrence records were compiled into presence absence records cells with at least one presence were considered as presence cells cells with only absence records were considered as absence cells and the remaining cells were considered as non sampled cells and were not used for model fitting in order to maintain an homogeneous distributions of sampled cells along environmental gradients continuous environmental variables were discretized into 60 classes each which appeared to be a good compromise to create relevant classes for all environmental variables over the whole grid domain when a given combination of environmental variable classes corresponded to several presence cells only one presence cell was kept similarly for absence cells when a given combination corresponded to several presence and absence cells one presence and one absence cell was kept thus the number of data points used for model fitting depended on the environmental predictors included in a particular model table 2 since the ratio between the number of presence and absence grid cells still varied among regions after the gridding process two approaches were tested in the first case observed ratio data set all available presence absence grid cells were kept in the next steps of the analysis in the second case balanced ratio data set the same number of absence and presence grid cells was used for all regions by randomly selecting absence grid cells among all available absence cells the second approach corresponds to the common practice for presence only data for which pseudo absence data are created montgomery 2005 see fig 3 step 1 2 3 3 selection of environmental predictors given the observation of heterogeneous responses to some of the environmental variables according to the region azores atlantic shelf and mediterranean sea see sup mat 2 a categorical predictor was added for region to identify the most parsimonious environmental data set explaining the blackspot seabream distribution pairwise correlations between all environmental variables were investigated with a pearson s correlation test using as correlation threshold r 0 7 schickele et al 2020 dormann et al 2013 when several environmental variables were highly correlated we retained the environmental variable with the highest relative importance schickele et al 2020 leroy et al 2014 sup mat 3 as the previous selection step led to a high number 9 of remaining environmental predictors for both occurrence data sets multiple models were fitted with decreasing number of predictors 9 to 2 predictors removing sequentially the predictor with the smallest relative importance to balance model fit and model complexity meynard et al 2019 see fig 3 step 1 next for each of the eight combinations of predictors and each occurrence data set type observed ratio and balanced ratio one occurrence data set was created for calibration 16 data sets 2 3 4 species distribution model categories and settings the following eight sdm categories were implemented in r using the biomod2 package thuillier et al 2003 2016 with default parameter settings generalised linear model glm generalised boosting model gbm generalized additive model gam artificial neural network ann model flexible discriminant analysis fda random forest rf classification tree analysis cta and surface range envelope sre model valanis et al 2008 thuiller et al 2009 albouy et al 2012 clairbaux et al 2019 pecchi et al 2019 for each sdm category and data set a 3 fold cross validation procedure was performed 2 3 5 sdm category selection and compromise we used the true skill statistics index tss allouche et al 2006 to quantify the performance of each of the eight fitted sdms for each calibration data set see fig 3 step 2 it was calculated as tss sensitivity proportion of presence cells classified correctly specificity proportion of correct absence cells 1 a sdm was selected for ensemble modelling if it had tss 0 5 a compromise the ensemble species distribution model esdm of the presence probability was then calculated as the mean of probabilities of retained sdms weighted by their tss value presence probability uncertainty was quantified using the coefficient of variation from cross validation results individual sdm response curves to environmental predictors as well as the esdm resulting presence probabilities according to the different predictors schickele et al 2020 are presented in sup mat 4 and 5 2 3 6 binary habitat maps and predictors selection to define habitat suitability maps for each of the 16 calibrated ensemble models 2 data sets x 8 predictors combination with 2 to 9 predictors presence probabilities were projected over the whole domain including the cells not included in the calibration process extrapolation for the non sampled cells then in order to create binary presence absence maps the habitat suitability maps presence probabilities were compared to all observed presence and absence compiled cells not only those used for model fitting threshold values for binary projections of presence and absence were calculated based on a set of indices as recommended by robinson et al 2017 namely the hit rate proportion of correctly classified presence cells the true skill statistics tss allouche et al 2006 the cbi computed with the ecospat boyce function of the ecospat package on r hirzel et al 2006 and the overall accuracy sum of the proportion of correctly classified presence and absence cells allouche et al 2006 more precisely each validation index was maximized varying threshold values for binary projections of presence and absence from 0 to 1 with a 0 001 interval with the optimize function in r each maximized index value thus corresponded to a distinct optimized threshold value for each data set type the best calibrated esdm was chosen as the one showing the lowest number of predictors and the highest validation index values to combine validation index values their values were re scaled between 0 lowest index value obtained across esdm outputs with 2 9 predictors and 1 highest index value in the case of the balanced ratio data set as absence cells selection might have impacted ensemble model performance in the previous steps 10 data sets with the chosen number of predictors and varying absence cells were randomly selected and the average of habitat suitability maps re calibration was used for further validation lastly for each data set type and validation index the surface of potential habitat was calculated 3 results 3 1 data characteristics in total 106 457 occurrence records were compiled among which 6465 presence records corresponding to 782 cells where the species was present and 5683 cells where it was recorded as absent fig 2 table 1 the proportion of presence cells among sampled cells was highly heterogeneous between regions as well as the number of records per cell respectively 7 8 to 30 5 and 14 to 35 records per cell see table 1 3 2 esdm outputs and habitat suitability maps after predictor selection using pairwise correlation analysis nine predictors were retained for the ensemble modelling procedure region ne atlantic azores mediterranean sea sea bottom type mean and standard deviation of bathymetry m annual maximum sea surface temperature sst c annual mean and minimum absolute current velocity m s 1 annual standard deviation of salinity and annual standard deviation of bottom temperature c sup mat 3 mean bathymetry and maximum sst had the highest explanatory power for both data sets both variables contributing equally table 2 the main difference between ensemble models for the two data set types was that for the observed ratio data set heterogeneous ratios of presence and absence over the model domain the categorical predictor region had a high relative importance which was not the case for the balanced ratio data set balanced number of presence and absence grid cells in each region table 2 sup mat 6 sdm categories ann gbm and rf were selected in most cases tss 0 5 while the selection of the other sdm categories varied according to the number of predictors and the data set type used table 2 sup mat 6 tss values were higher for the observed ratio data set for all models two to nine predictors with values around 0 7 for the balanced ratio data set and around 0 9 for the observed ratio data set table 2 sup mat 6 as a result of the data selection procedure the data set size decreased with decreasing number of predictors leading to low data set sizes for models with less than five predictors table 2 comparing projected habitat suitability maps presence probabilities per grid cell over the whole domain between data set types it appeared that a balanced ratio between presence and absence data led to overall higher presence probabilities and hence a much wider potential habitat in the ne atlantic region and in the mediterranean sea region compared to the results obtained with the observed ratio data set while the projected presence probabilities appeared rather similar for the azores region figs 4 and 5 the visual difference was confirmed by the mean projected presence probability over the whole domain being 0 16 0 19 for the balanced ratio data set and only 0 07 0 09 for the observed ratio data set fig 4 differences between projected presence probabilities obtained with the balanced ratio data set and the observed ratio data set were the highest in the ne atlantic with respective values of 0 19 0 21 and 0 06 0 07 and the lowest in the azores with both values equal to 0 07 0 10 fig 4 for both data set types coefficients of variation of presence probabilities did not exceed 0 25 fig 5 overall the choice of data set type impacted presence probability values but did not impact consistently which predictors were selected except for the region predictor nor the general shape of the response curve for each predictor except for maximum annual sst for which the relationship was dome shaped for balanced ratio data set and more flat for the observed ratio data set table 2 and sup mat 4 3 3 binary habitat maps 3 3 1 predictors comparison of the three validation index values between esdms using 2 to 9 predictors normalized between 0 an 1 0 being the smallest index value across the set of predictors and 1 being the highest led to select the esdm with six predictors for both data set types indeed these models displayed among the best index values for the smallest number of predictors fig 6 the best predictors for the balanced ratio data set were mean bathymetry annual maximum sst standard deviation sd of bathymetry sd of mean annual bottom temperature sd of mean annual bottom salinity and minimum annual absolute current velocity for the observed ratio data set predictor region was selected instead of minimum annual absolute current velocity table 2 sup mat 6 the region predictor had a 9 contribution to the explained variance and compared to the balanced ratio data set contribution of other variables was lower for bathymetry and higher for all other variables 3 3 2 indices and threshold optimization validation index values accuracy hit rate cbi and tss were slightly higher for the observed ratio data set than for the balanced ratio data set sup mat 8 variations in estimated habitat area between validation indices were higher than between data set types fig 7 overall the choice of threshold value used for transforming presence probabilities into binary habitat maps strongly influenced results for the whole area and for each of the regions fig 8 for regional habitat area estimation separate threshold values were obtained by maximizing index values regionally maximizing the hit rate led to the lowest threshold values for the whole area and each region and subsequently the largest habitat areas cbi and accuracy led to the smallest habitat areas especially for the ne atlantic region for which the observed presence absence ratio was low for the whole area averaged across the two data types the habitat areas for hit rate and tss were 14849 and 1280 larger than for cbi respectively comparing results between the two data sets showed that the balanced data set let to smaller habitat areas for the majority of indices for the whole area and each of the three regions figs 7 and 8 for the whole area the difference balanced observed observed ranged between 53 for tss and 4 for cbi for the azores the difference ranged between 3 for accuracy and 27 for tss for the mediterranean sea between 36 for tss and 0 for cbi and for the ne atlantic region between 28 for accuracy and 23 for cbi thus the choice of validation index had a much greater impact than the data set type though the later was also important for certain indices 3 3 3 binary habitat maps visual comparison of binary presence absence habitat maps threshold optimized according to tss index between data set types showed that for the balanced ratio data set some locations from which the species had been reported were missed particularly to the west of ireland and along the mediterranean coast figs 2 and 9 overall it appears that the potential habitat of the species covers a large area around seamounts in the azores region a wide area on the ne atlantic shelf and a narrower are on the mediterranean shelf fig 9 4 discussion in this study to obtain robust estimates of the potential habitat of blackspot seabream across its wide distribution area exhibiting varying exploitation status an ensemble species distribution modelling approach and two data sets with different prevalence levels were used the identified potential habitats included islands contours and seamounts in the azores region the ne atlantic shelf south of 48 n with smaller areas further north and the northern shores of the western mediterranean sea with more extended areas in the strait of gibraltar in the gulf of lions and along the italian coast potential habitats of blackspot seabream were best explained by bathymetry down to 700 1000 m and sst annual maximum sst generally greater than 16 c as well as bottom temperature salinity and region as secondary predictors independent of the prevalence level in the data set except for region further the general shape of the response curves for each predictor were similar for the two data sets except for max sst see response curves in sup mat 4 other studies have reported the same main factors influencing the species distribution and abundance with occurrences reported in areas with bottom depths between 100 m and 700 m mytilineou et al 2014 burgos et al 2013 menezes and giacomello 2013 d onghia et al 2010 gueguen 1974 and environmental conditions linked to temperature and salinity influencing stock variations sanz fernández et al 2019 the general importance of the region predictor can be explained by regional differences in biophysical conditions while the difference in importance of this predictor for the two prevalence data sets is most likely caused by differences in the prevalence in the observed ratio data sets table 2 these regional discrepancies in prevalence might be explained by the differences in population status with the northeast atlantic population being most depleted it is less likely caused by differences in detectability by the employed sampling methods which could however be explored by comparing several methods for the same area and using models integrating detectability fithian et al 2015 fletcher et al 2016 2019 in the bay of biscay which is in the centre of the northeast atlantic region the esdm suggested that the potential habitat covered a large part of the continental shelf indeed the species used to occur over most of this shelf before the population collapsed in the late 1970s in the azorean region which has been termed an oceanic seamount ecosystem silva and pinho 2007 the species occurs around islands with juveniles distributed in near coast habitats as in the bay of biscay and adults spread from the coast to island slopes and isolated seamounts juveniles never occur at sea mounts pinho et al 2014 depth was identified as the main factor for explaining blackspot seabream abundance and size composition on azorean seamounts santos et al 2021 in the same area morato et al 2001 showed that the species feeds on both pelagic and benthic preys and suggested that its food supply on seamounts may depend upon oceanic production that drifts past seamounts which in turn makes bottom slope a factor for the species distribution as current strength and therefore the amount of prey advected increase with slope at the scale of the environment perceived by individual fish similar hydrological conditions in particular strong and variable tidal currents resulting from the interaction of oceanic water masses koslow 1996 lorance et al 2002 prevail at seamounts and along the continental slope where blackspot seabream also occurs at this fine scale the species shows diel vertical migrations afonso et al 2012 which may suggest a behaviour similar to that of deeper living seamount aggregators which share with blackspot seabream a high lipid content and strong swimming abilities which are both related to high metabolism koslow 1996 overall the habitat characteristics of fish displaying this type of behaviour include sloping sea bottom and related variations in current speed which generate also temperature variations and is in line with habitats variables found to be predictors of blackspot seabream presence absence in this study the ratio between presence and absence cells in the data impacted strongly the projected probabilities of presence imposing a balanced ratio between the number of presence and absence cells for model calibration led to higher presence probabilities on average compared to using the observed ratio data set with a large majority of absence cells 0 16 0 19 and 0 07 0 09 respectively thus including primarily absence cells in model calibration reduced estimated presence probabilities the habitat suitability map for the balanced ratio data set indicated wide potential habitats over the ne atlantic shelf and along the western mediterranean and azores coasts while potential habitats were smaller using the observed ratio data set the habitat size was reversed between the two data sets for the corresponding presence absence maps with larger binary habitats for the observed ratio data set due to a smaller optimized threshold value these binary maps obtained by applying a optimized presence probability threshold are probably closer to the realized habitat of the species as it involved the full presence absence data to set the threshold values the binary presence habitat was notably smaller over the european shelf where one regional population is depleted the past high abundance of the species throughout the bay of biscay olivier 1928 desbrosses 1932 guichet et al 1971 indicates that this area was suitable for the species 100 to 50 years ago the increase of fishing effort on the species at the same period lorance 2011 must indeed have been the main trigger for the species decreased abundance leading to a concentration of the remaining individuals into the most suitable habitats in this region along the coast around isobath 100 m and on the continental slope the present study suggests that current environmental factors remain suitable for the species although environmental changes have occurred since notably a temperature rise of 0 2 c decade for the period 1965 2004 in the 0 200 m water column layer michel et al 2009 valencia et al 2019 the observed presence absence ratio data set had higher validation indices for the fitted model compared to the balanced ratio data set further the corresponding binary habitat map included more areas outside the sampled area for example it predicted the species presence close to the west of ireland where the species did indeed occur in the past gueguen 1974 and more widely along the western mediterranean coast where it is present nowadays spedicato et al 2002 the use of different validation indices hit rate tss cbi and accuracy led to different threshold values for transforming the probability of presence into binary habitat and subsequently different habitat surface areas overall the difference in the size of estimated habitat area was larger between validation indices when between data set types differences in predicted habitat areas according to the selected thresholding method have been reported by various authors nenzén and araújo 2011 jiménez valverde and lobo 2007 liu et al 2005 2016 in our case given the species low prevalence absence cell records had a large impact on the estimated threshold when maximizing using the accuracy index leading to habitats mostly restrained to the cells where species observations had been made hence being closer to the only partial observed distribution although its use has been recommended in the case of unbalanced prevalence leroy et al 2018 the use of the cbi index led to the same effect in contrast using the tss index for setting the probability threshold value involved balancing correct predictions of both presence and absence cells and hence seemed more likely to lead to binary habitats closer to the species potential habitats the difference between habitat areas derived using tss optimized threshold values for balanced and observed unbalanced data sets depended strongly on the region used for optimization the largest negative difference was observed for the whole area 53 while it was negligible 2 for the ne atlantic region and positive 27 for the azores unbalanced prevalence has been reported to artificially increase the tss value leroy et al 2018 which implies that the balanced data set should have provided a better understanding of blackspot seabream potential habitats contrary to this expectation it seems that in our case using a bigger data set with unbalanced presence absence cells was more informative than using a smaller data set with a selected number of balanced presence absence cells several studies have shown that the use of presence true absence data are generally better than presence only data with or without using pseudo absences and that presence only models generally under estimate the species presence in locations where is has not been sampled dorazio 2014 meynard et al 2019 wisz and guisan 2009 our study is in accordance with this general result in addition it showed that the proportion of absences data matters the difference between the estimated area of the blackspot seabream potential habitat obtained with the observed ratio data set and the balanced ratio data set for the same threshold value increased with the decreasing proportion of presence data in the observed data from the azores to the ne atlantic which in turn corresponds to decreasing stock status of blackspot seabream in summary the results of this study provided evidence that when using opportunistic data for sdm fitting attention needs to be paid to the effects of presence absence data imbalance as well as the choice of validation indices to fully evaluate uncertainty of estimated
