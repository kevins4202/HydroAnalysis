11195,a simple root zone salt balance model was developed for long term soil salt prediction a groundwater balance module was integrated to obtain the water flux at the bottom of the root zone since groundwater level is easily and reliably measured data an assumption that the net percolation at the bottom of root zone equals to the net recharge from root zone to unconfined groundwater system was used which makes capillary rise and infiltration water leaching of root zone obtainable the model accuracy and limitation were evaluated by comparing the simulation results with those from hydrus 1d under various soil texture and bottom boundary conditions the mean relative error mre of soil salt content ranged from 6 25 to 9 95 and the root mean square error rmse from 0 02 kg 100 kg to 0 05 kg 100 kg which suggest the model accuracy the determination coefficient r 2 of the cumulative percolation at the bottom of root zone and recharge to groundwater at the end of each calculation period was 0 99 which validates the model assumption the model was then applied to predict soil salinity in the longsheng irrigation district of hetao irrigation district china the soil salinity and water table depth data from 1999 to 2016 were used to calibrate and validate the model parameters the mre values of water table depth and average soil salt content were 10 08 and 10 84 and rmse values 0 37 m and 0 04 kg 100 kg in the validation period subsequently the validated model was used to simulate the soil salinity in future 100 years under various water saving conditions water table depth and autumn irrigation for salt leaching were the two major factors to control soil salinity the required autumn irrigation to keep root zone in mild salinity level 0 3 kg 100 kg can decrease by 25 1 mm with 0 1 m water table depth increase while it should increase by 64 mm with 1 0 kg m3 groundwater salinity increase in the crop growing season moderate groundwater exploitation to increase water table depth is recommended to save autumn irrigation water and control soil salinity keywords soil salinity prediction soil salt balance hetao irrigation district autumn irrigation water table depth 1

retirement mao et al 2017 schoups et al 2005 wu et al 2009 the key to the success of management strategies is to reduce input salt and to raise the outflow in the subsoil singh 2015 2017 applying additional water to drive salt out of root zone has been proved as an effective way however it is difficult to determine the amount of leaching water as it is influenced by various factors e g climate conditions soil characteristics irrigation schedules irrigation water salinity and water table depth ritzema 2006 rozema and flowers 2008 this problem may be resolved by using efficient and reliable models that can predict long term soil salinity at the regional scale the site of this study is the hetao irrigation district located in the upper reaches of the yellow river the saline cultivated land occupies more than 50 of the total irrigated cropland 5 7 109 m2 feng et al 2005 to relieve soil salinization autumn irrigation is taken after harvest for washing soil salt out and it consumes more than 30 of total irrigation water from the yellow river hao 2016 given that regulation agencies decreased the diversion allocation from the yellow river from 5 4 billion m3 to 4 billion m3 in recent years water saving and salinity control have been the main concerns for sustainable agriculture development it is necessary to estimate the amount of appropriated autumn irrigation and to optimize irrigation schedule so that the salt accumulated in the crop growing season can be washed out thoroughly thus it is a great challenge to investigate the soil salt dynamics under different irrigation management strategies many soil salt models have been developed to calculate root zone salt dynamics including numerical models and mass balance models the numerical models including hydrus šimůnek et al 2013 swap kroes and dam 2003 enviro gro pang and letey 1998 and q3d zhu et al 2012 have solid theoretical foundation and are widely used for simulating water flow and solute transport in the subsurface systems however for the numerical models fine spatial discretization and small time step are always needed to obtain accurate results which may result in high computational cost especially for long term and large scale modeling setting up the numerical models also requires intensive hydrogeological information which is not always available in practice zhu et al 2013 soil salt mass balance models are not subject to the problems above for numerical models there are two kinds of soil salt balance models the first kind is multi reservoir model with subsurface system divided into multiple reservoirs and each reservoir is a simulation layer e g saltmod oosterbaan 1998 and oasis mod askri et al 2010 another is simple root zone model which considers water and salt balance in the divided layers of root zone e g tetrans corwin and waggoner 1990 saltirsoil visconti et al 2011 watsuit rhoades and merrill 1976 corwin et al 2007 and salt storage model ritzema 2006 the development and application of these salt mass balance models are listed in table 1 the multi reservoir models usually consider water flow and salt transport from the root zone to groundwater system they have solid foundation to calculate the percolation and capillary rise the root zone models focus on the major processes that impact water flow and salt dynamics in the root zone for example tetrans and saltirsoil contain two modules to represent soil water balance and soil salt balance the tipping bucket method kendy et al 2003 is used to simulate infiltration redistribution and drainage processes however water can only be drained downward or directly depleted in the soil water module while ignoring the upward soil water movement corwin et al 2007 mao et al 2018b it is thus difficult for these models to predict salt accumulation in areas with strong evapotranspiration under shallow water table depth due to capillary rise accurate estimation of the water flux at the bottom of root zone is necessary for calculating the soil salt dynamics the salt storage model ritzema 2006 considered capillary rise with the assumption that salt concentration of capillary rise equals to that of percolation this assumption is suitable for areas where the groundwater is fully fed by percolation from the root zone with no seepage from elsewhere ritzema 2006 however the assumption has been challenged in arid and semi arid agricultural areas where seepage from irrigation canal or from an irrigated field towards fallow land is unavoidable in this study a simple root zone salt balance model integrated with a groundwater balance module was developed three parameters were needed by the soil salt balance model to calculate root zone salt content while the water flux at the bottom of the root zone are available from the groundwater balance module which makes it suitable for real world application with limited data the groundwater balance module was used to obtain the water flux at the bottom of the root zone by assuming that the net percolation at the bottom of root zone equals to the net recharge from root zone to shallow unconfined aquifer this makes the model validation be easily carried out with the indicator of groundwater level which is very reliably measured data the model accuracy and limitation were evaluated by comparing the results with those from hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 a real world application of the developed model at the longsheng irrigation district in the hetao irrigation district was presented the major impact factors and measurements to control soil salinity were also discussed 2 model description 2 1 model development the concept and flow chart of the developed model are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively the model included a root zone salt balance module and a groundwater balance module as shown in fig 1 a the model was developed based on the salt mass balance considering three major sources of salt input i e irrigation water precipitation and capillary rise and three major sources of salt output i e uptake by crop leaching to subsoil by irrigation and precipitation the percolation from irrigation or precipitation and the capillary rise were considered in the groundwater balance module those items were assumed to be equal to those at the bottom of root zone the model first ran the groundwater balance module to obtain the percolation from irrigation or precipitation and the capillary rise then it started running the salt balance module to calculate the salt concentration at the bottom of the root zone and average salt content in the root zone the model flowchart can be found in fig 1 b 2 1 1 groundwater balance module there were seven items considered in the developed model for simulating groundwater level which were seepage from canals percolation from irrigation and precipitation lateral flow of groundwater drainage capillary rise from groundwater system and pumping water the equations are as follows 1 q c a n l q i r r i q p r e c r l d q e w δ q 2 q c a n l η j 3 q irri α i 4 q prec λ p 5 q e ε exp d h e t 0 6 δ q δ h μ where qcanl is the seepage water from canal system m qirri and qprec are the percolation from irrigation and precipitation m rl is the lateral flow to aquifer m d is the drainage to ditches or pipe drains m qe is the capillary rise from groundwater aquifer m assuming that it depends on the water table depth and atmospheric evaporation capacity w is the pumping water m δq is the groundwater storage change m η is the recharge coefficient of canal seepage j is water diversion m α is the recharge coefficient of irrigation i and p are irrigation and precipitation m λ is the recharge coefficient of precipitation ε and d are the capillary rise coefficients h is the average water table depth m et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration m δh is the water table change m μ is the specific yield it should be noted that qirri qprec and qe were the variables we concerned in the groundwater balance module which were subsequently needed by the root zone salt balance module 2 1 2 root zone salt balance module the salt entering into the root zone included salt from irrigation precipitation and capillary rise the salt discharged from the root zone included leaching of irrigation precipitation and salt uptake by crops it was the average salt content of the root zone that was calculated by the developed model and the salt balance equations are as follows 7 s irri s prec s e s d irri s d prec s crop δ s 8 s i r r i i c i r r i 9 s p r e c p c p r e c 10 s

capillary rise respectively kg m2 sd irri and sd prec are salt leaching from the root zone by irrigation and precipitation kg m2 scrop is salt uptake by crop kg m2 δs is the salt storage change in the root zone kg m2 cirri cprec and ce are the salt concentration of irrigation precipitation and capillary rise water kg m3 cd irri and cd prec are the salt concentration of the percolation water at the bottom of root zone due to irrigation and precipitation kg m3 δsc is the change of soil salt content in the root zone kg 100 kg ρ is the soil bulk density kg m3 hr is the root zone depth m the cd i i irri prec terms mainly depended on the salt concentration of soil solution and the irrigation water or precipitation in the following ways ritzema 2006 oosterbaan 1998 14 c d i c i 1 f c t f i irri

the salt concentration of irrigation or precipitation kg m3 ct is the salt concentration of soil solution at the beginning of the period kg m3 f is the leaching efficiency sca is the root zone salt content at the beginning period kg 100 kg θtc is the coefficient transforming soil salt content to salt concentration this parameter is defined as field capacity in the salt storage model ritzema 2006 and is set as half of the saturated water content in saltmod oosterbaan 1998 in the proposed model the physical meaning of θtc was the average volumetric water content of root zone within the simulation duration however the proposed model did not calculate the soil water content so it was defined as a coefficient herein since the model cannot calculate the salt concentration of capillary rise directly it assumed that the average salt concentration of capillary rise was proportional to the average salt concentration of the percolation water at the bottom of root zone during the simulation period 16 c e β c d where β is the salt concentration conversion coefficient of capillary rise since β is difficult to be measured the parameter value was discussed in the case study as shown in section 3 cd is the average salt concentration of the percolation water at the bottom of root zone which is calculated as follows 17 c d i irri prec c d i q i i irri prec q i since items qirri qprec and qe have been obtained by the groundwater balance module three more parameters i e f θ tc and β were required in the root zone salt balance module three metrics were used to evaluate the model performance i e the mean relative error mre the root mean square error rmse and the determination coefficient r 2 which can be found in ren et al 2016 2 2 model evaluation and application cases two cases were adopted to evaluate the model accuracy and limitation as well as its application in real world complicated conditions case 1 was a synthetic case with two purposes one was to test the model accuracy for calculating salt concentration at the bottom of the root zone in salt balance module by comparing the results with those obtained from hydrus 1d another was to test the model assumption that the net percolation at the bottom of root zone was equal to the net recharge from the root zone to groundwater table case 2 was a real world application in longsheng irrigation district to investigate the model suitability in complex conditions various scenarios considering the water saving policy were set to discuss the future soil salt dynamics and soil salinity control measurements the results and discussion were presented in section 3 2 2 1 case 1 synthetic case for model evaluation this case considered vertical salt transport subject to a changing upper boundary condition by comparing the results of the proposed model with those obtained by using hydrus 1d the soil column was 20 m in length with a top soil layer of 3 m in thickness overlaying a sandy layer of 17 m in thickness and four different soil types i e sandy loam loam clay loam and silt were applied in the top soil layer respectively the soil hydraulic parameters of the four soil types given by carsel and parrish 1988 are listed in table 2 and they were used by hydrus 1d fig 2 a shows the daily irrigation and potential evaporation e p and transpiration t p in this case the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 was calculated by the actual daily meteorological data of linhe weather station shown in fig 3 using fao 56 penman monteith equation then the potential evapotranspiration et p was adopted by multiplying the et 0 with the crop coefficient the potential evaporation e p and transpiration t p were calculated by partitioning et p using beer s law šimůnek et al 2013 the details can be found in the supplementary document the root zone was 0 6 m in depth the column bottom was prescribed as four scenarios of changing head boundary condition marked as w1 w2 w3 and w4 shown in fig 2 b the average water table of w1 w2 w3 and w4 was located at the depth of 1 4 m 1 9 m 2 4 m and 2 9 m from the soil surface respectively so there were 16 scenarios totally the initial salt concentration within the top 0 6 m was 8 kg m3 while it was 2 kg m3 for groundwater and the salt concentration changed linearly from 8 0 to 2 0 kg m3 from the depth of 0 6 m to water table the salt concentration of irrigation water was 2 kg m3 the simulation period lasted 2140 days there were 20 calculation periods divided based on the upper boundary condition which assumed the first 153 days as crop growing season and next 61 days as no crop it should be noted that there is no measured data used in this case and the simulation results from hydrus 1d is used as comparison benchmark for evaluation 2 2 2 case 2 real world application in an arid agricultural district longsheng irrigation district is located in the central region of the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia china fig 3 its area is 3 667 107 m2 10 5 km long from north to south and 3 8 km wide from east to west mao et al 2017 the average annual precipitation and pan evaporation with 20 cm diameter from 1981 to 2010 were 148 8 mm and 2327 mm respectively the top soil within the depth of 5 m is sand mixed with clay and the top soil is underlain by a sand layer with the thickness of 95 m mao et al 2017 the water table depth and soil salinity from 1999 to 2016 were used to calibrate and validate the developed model there were 10 monitoring wells and 10 soil sampling locations from 1999 to 2006 with water table depth observed every 5 days and soil salinity measured 4 times every year there were 14 observation points from 2009 to 2010 and the water table depth and soil salinity were measured once every 10 days from may to november during the latest three years from 2014 to 2016 there were 10 monitoring wells and 24 soil samples measured by our research group also there is a conventional groundwater observation well 122 in the area with water table depth observed every 5 days by irrigation bureau of hetao irrigation district and data from 2002 to 2013 were collected the data used in the developed model were averaged over space the water diversion of xiji canal was monitored from 1999 to 2015 by irrigation bureau of hetao irrigation district and the average salt concentration of irrigation was 0 5434 kg m3 the precipitation during 1999 to 2016 was from the linhe weather station the evaporation from a 20 cm evaporation pan e pan was measured the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 was then estimated multiplying the e pan with the coefficient 0 56 cobaner 2013 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 gundekar et al 2008 hao 2016 the precipitation et 0 and water diversion used in the model are shown in fig 4 three periods per year were used in the simulation based on the climate and land use conditions at the study site which were the period of crop growing from may to september the autumn irrigation period from october to november and the no crop growing period from december to the next april yang et al 2017 the seasonal averaged precipitation et 0 and water diversion were used in the simulation given the plan of using groundwater for irrigation in the hetao irrigation district the water table depth irrigation schemes and salt concentration of irrigation water will be changed thus the validated model was used to predict the future soil salt dynamics under various scenarios with different water table depths different autumn irrigation schemes different groundwater salinity for irrigation in the crop growing season the water table depths were set as 1 7 m 2 1 m and 2 5 m respectively the 1 7 m was same as the current condition and 2 5 m was the average water table depth in this area with groundwater irrigation hao 2016 yang et al 2017 and 2 1 m was between the two values of 1 7 m and 2 5 m five different autumn irrigation schemes were set as 209 6 mm 189 mm 168 mm 147 mm and 126 mm which were 100 90 80 70 and 60 of the current irrigation water respectively according to mao et al 2018a the salinity of groundwater pumped for irrigation in the crop growing season is below 3 0 kg m3 three scenarios with groundwater salinity of 1 0 kg m3 2 0 kg m3 and 3 0 kg m3 were set and the current irrigation salinity of 0 5434 kg m3 was used as a reference the initial root zone salt content in all the simulation scenarios was set as 0 148 kg 100 kg which was the average over the measurements in 2015 and 2016 the precipitation et 0 and irrigation scheme in the crop growing season were used as the average over precipitation et 0 and irrigation scheme from 2003 to 2016 the simulation period was for 100 years it should be noted that this long term simulation is hypothetical because these variables including precipitation et 0 and irrigation vary in space and time in reality 3 results and discussion 3 1 model accuracy of the root zone salt balance module since the accuracy of the model depended on how precisely we can describe the salt content of root zone and the salt concentration at the bottom of root zone four scenarios with different soil types at the bottom boundary w2 of case 1 were used to test salt balance module showing in eqs 7 16 the water flux at the bottom of root zone calculated by hydrus 1d was directly applied in the soil salt balance module in the simulation the values of the three parameters f β θtc for the four different soil types are listed in table 2 the f indicated the depletion of salt concentration in the leaching process which was obtained by reference values from 0 15 to 1 0 mao et al 2017 and determined by soil types zhu 1981 the β was the ratio of salt concentration of capillary rise to that of percolation as evaluated by the simulation results of hydrus 1d and θtc was close to the average volumetric water content in the root zone obtained by hydrus 1d the simulated salt concentrations at the bottom of root zone in the calculation period and average salt content of root zone with different scenarios were compared with those from hydrus 1d as shown in figs 5 and 6 the average salt content within the root zone given by hydrus 1d was used as comparison benchmark to evaluate the model accuracy the developed model can estimate the salt concentration of percolation and capillary rise and capture the salt content change process well the mre of salt concentration of percolation or capillary rise simulated by the developed model ranged from 5 26 to 0 41 and the corresponding rmse from 2 00 kg m3 to 4 65 kg m3 and r 2 0 50 the mre of salt content of root zone ranged from 6 25 to 9 95 and the corresponding rmse from 0 02 kg 100 kg to 0 05 kg 100 kg and r 2 from 0 59 to 0 82 these results indicate that the developed model can match hydrus 1d precisely with only three parameters and the root zone salt balance module is credible the detailed values of the three evaluation metrics mre rmse and r 2 can be found in the supplementary document 3 2 model comparison and limitation since the model was developed with the assumption that the percolation at the bottom of root zone equals to the recharge from root zone to groundwater system sixteen scenarios of case 1 with four soil types and four bottom boundary conditions were used to 1 investigate to what extent the assumption was valuable in the simulation with shallow water table in agricultural areas and to 2 examine the model capacity using water table depth as an indicator to obtain the percolation and capillary rise at the bottom of root zone and to 3 test model accuracy to predict root zone soil salinity under different bottom conditions the groundwater balance module was run to obtain the parameters i e μ α ε and d shown in eqs 3 5 and 6 the parameters used by the developed model under the 16 scenarios are listed in table 3 the simulated water table depth from the developed model and hydrus 1d with loam soil under four bottom boundary scenarios are shown in fig 7 a d all water table depth comparison results under the 16 scenarios are demonstrated in fig 8 a the change amplitude of simulated water table depth was larger than that in hydrus 1d which greatly depended on the specific yield the mre of water table depth ranged from 9 62 to 13 43 and most were smaller than 10 rmse from 0 18 m to 0 93 m and r 2 from 0 44 to 0 79 with most r 2 values larger than 0 60 the percolation to groundwater and discharge of capillary rise from groundwater with loam soil under four bottom boundary scenarios were compared with those at the bottom of root zone in hydrus 1d as shown in fig 7 e h the comparison of water flux under the 16 scenarios are plotted in fig 8 b it can be found that the percolation and capillary rise in every simulation period predicted by the developed model were highly consistent with those from hydrus 1d with the r 2 being 0 94 and 0 95 respectively the mre values of percolation ranged from 1 13 to 19 36 most of them are smaller than 10 and the rmse values were around 10 0 mm with the r 2 values more than 0 85 the mre of capillary rise ranged from 11 37 to 19 36 rmse from 0 49 mm to 18 11 mm and r 2 larger than 0 90 except sandy loam under w1 the predicted average salt content of root zone under different water table depths of loam soil were compared with those from hydrus 1d as illustrated in fig 7 i l the comparison of average salt content of root zone under the 16 scenarios are plotted in fig 8 c the salt content of root zone at the end of each calculation period predicted by the developed model were close to those from hydrus 1d with r 2 being 0 92 the mre values ranged from 9 67 to 6 60 smaller than 10 the rmse values from 0 01 to 0 08 kg 100 kg and the r 2 values from 0 65 to 0 93 which demonstrate the good performance of the developed model in predicting salt content of root zone the detailed values of the three evaluation metrics mre rmse and r 2 can be found in the supplementary document the cumulative water flux at the bottom of root zone at the depth of 0 6 m and at the water table under various soil types and bottom boundary conditions simulated by hydrus 1d were further compared as shown in fig 9 fig 9 a shows the results of different soil types with bottom boundary w2 and fig 9 b shows the results of four different water table depths with soil type of clay loam the values of cumulative percolation at the bottom of root zone were close to the cumulative recharge from root zone to the water table comparison of the cumulative percolation at the bottom of root zone and cumulative recharge from root zone to groundwater at the end of each calculation period are shown in fig 9 c which showed good correlation with r 2 being 0 99 the results show that the average water flux at the bottom of root zone equals to that at the water table and the model development assumption is applicable however from fig 9 a and b it can also be found that the cumulative water flux at the bottom of root zone fluctuated more strongly than that at the water table a relative larger difference can be found with the deeper water table as shown in fig 9 b the reason is that the bottom of root zone is closer to the ground surface which is more sensitive to the upper boundary condition it takes longer time for the infiltration arriving at the deeper water table which shows more steady increase of the cumulative water flux so larger error will be induced when small time step is used the model is suitable for large time steps with complete infiltration to ensure that the cumulative water flux at the bottom of root zone equals that at the water table 3 3 model parameters analysis the parameters for groundwater balance module and root zone salt balance module under the 16 scenarios of case 1 are shown in table 3 the parameters for groundwater balance module were mainly impacted by soil types rather than by the bottom boundary conditions the irrigation recharge coefficients of sandy loam loam clay loam and silt decreased in sequence while the capillary rise coefficient ε increased in that order ε values in the no crop growing season were smaller than those in crop growing season which are consistent with the findings reported in literature ayars et al 2005 gao et al 2017 liu et al 2006 yang et al 2011 the leaching efficiency f of sandy loam was 0 50 and 0 90 for loam clay loam and silt which are within the range of 0 15 1 00 reported in literature mao et al 2017 the salt concentration conversion coefficient of capillary rise β for different soil types was very similar and was 1 06 for most conditions which is close to the assumption of the salt storage model that salt concentration of capillary rise equals to that of percolation ritzema 2006 the coefficient transforming soil salt content to salt concentration θtc of sandy loam loam clay loam and silt was about 0 11 0 19 0 23 and 0 22 respectively the sandier soil type and deeper water table had smaller θtc values as a summary the f and θtc were relatively stable concerning soil types and the β was relatively stable fluctuating around 1 00 3 4 model calibration and validation in longsheng irrigation district the measured water table depth and soil salinity data from 1999 to 2008 were used to calibrate the developed model and the cross validation period was from 2009 to 2016 the simulated and measured water table depth in the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 10 a the mre values of water table depth were 6 96 and 10 08 rmse values 0 33 m and 0 37 m and r 2 values 0 71 and 0 78 in the calibration and validation periods respectively which indicate that the groundwater balance module can reasonably capture the water table depth the validated parameters of the groundwater balance module are listed in table 4 the specific yield was 0 07 which is consistent with the result of zhang 2011 in the same study area and close to the average specific yield of yongji sub district in hetao irrigation district with the value 0 056 yang et al 2017 the recharge coefficient of canal seepage η was 0 17 which ranges between 0 16 to 0 40 in other areas of hetao irrigation district xu et al 2010 xue et al 2017 yue et al 2016 the recharge coefficients of irrigation in the crop growth period and autumn irrigation period were 0 20 and 0 45 respectively and the recharge coefficient of precipitation was 0 12 these values are close to the results obtained by zhang 2011 and yang et al 2017 the drainage in the crop growing period and autumn irrigation period was about 1 9 and 1 7 of water diversion which is consistent with the ratio of drainage water to the water diversion in the hetao irrigation district hao 2016 the capillary rise ranged from 100 to 188 mm in the year of 1999 to 2016 which is in accordance with the results that the annual contribution of groundwater to evapotranspiration ranges from 156 4 to 173 mm in its neighboring regions xue et al 2017 yue et al 2016 the parameters of soil salt balance model were further calibrated and validated by comparing the salt content of root zone with the corresponding measured data from 1999 to 2016 the salt uptake by crop in the model were set as 0 0225 kg m2 according to hao 2016 the simulated and measured soil salt content in the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 10 b the mre values were 17 38 and 10 84 rmse values 0 04 kg 100 kg and 0 04 kg 100 kg and r2 values 0 64 and 0 31 in the calibration and validation periods respectively these results imply that the modeling are acceptable considering the limited number of samples and the strong variability of soil salt in space and time due to the climate and irrigation conditions they confirm that the developed model is practical for predicting long term soil salinity in the arid area with shallow water table depth the validated parameters concerning the soil salt balance module are listed in table 4 the three parameters f β θtc were 0 50 0 99 and 0 23 the f value used in the model agrees with the recommended value zhu 1981 mao et al 2017 the θtc was 0 23 which is close to average root zone moisture content 0 21 in the year of 2009 and 2010 zhang 2011 β was 0 99 which is consistent with the verification results of the soils based on hydrus 1d shown in table 3 as a summary the developed model performed well for calculating long term soil salinity 3 5 long term soil salinity dynamics prediction under water saving conditions the calibrated model of longsheng irrigation district was further used to predict the soil salinity dynamics in the next 100 years under the current and future changing irrigation conditions for implementing the better water resources management for sustainable development of agriculture the soil salt content dynamics under the different water table depths are shown in fig 11 a the root zone was in a desalination state with all three water table depths and the desalination was more obvious with the deeper water table the soil salt contents after 100 years were 77 34 50 22 and 42 29 of the current soil content at the end of crop growing period with the water table depth of 1 7 m 2 1 m and 2 5 m respectively it demonstrates that the current irrigation at the study area is reasonable for sustainable development of agriculture from the perspective of controlling soil salinization it also confirms that increasing water table depth to reduce capillary rise is an effective way to control soil salinization in arid area with shallow water table depth fig 11 b shows the soil salt content dynamics under different autumn irrigation schemes the soil salt achieved a steady state at the end of the simulation with input salts being equal to the output visconti et al 2011 according to the classification criteria of saline land from wang 1993 and mao et al 2017 in the future 100 years the soil salinity of root zone was categorized as the non saline salt content 0 2 kg 100 kg land under the current or 90 of current autumn irrigation the soil salinity of root zone increased with the decrease of autumn irrigation water and it varied slowly from non saline land to mild saline 0 2 kg 100 kg salt content 0 3 kg 100 kg land with 80 autumn irrigation of the current level to middle saline 0 3 kg 100 kg salt content 0 5 kg 100 kg land with 70 autumn irrigation of the current level and to strongly saline 0 5 kg 100 kg salt content 1 0 kg 100 kg land with 60 autumn irrigation of the current level therefore the autumn irrigation schedule is the key to control the soil salinity in the root zone fig 11 c shows the soil salt content dynamics under different salt concentration of irrigation groundwater in the crop growing season the root zone salt content and its amplitude of different periods in a year increased with groundwater salinity according to the prediction results shown in fig 11 c the soil salinity of root zone would vary slowly from non saline land to mild middle and strongly saline land in the future 100 years with groundwater salinity 1 0 kg m3 2 0 kg m3 and 3 0 kg m3 respectively influence of groundwater salinity on soil salinity in the root zone cannot be ignored given that decreasing autumn irrigation is an effective way for saving irrigation water fig 12 shows the required amount of reasonable autumn irrigation water which can sustain root zone within mild salinity level 0 3 kg 100 kg under different water table depth and groundwater salinity calculated by the model a logarithmic relationship was observed between the required autumn irrigation water amount and water table depth fig 12 a which indicates that shallower water table requires more autumn irrigation water it can be found from fig 12 b that when groundwater salinity increased by 1 0 kg m3 the amount of required autumn irrigation would increase by about 64 mm 78 mm with water table depths vary from 1 70 m to 2 90 m under the current conditions the amount of autumn irrigation can be decreased by 25 1 mm with 0 1 m water table depth increase and the amount of autumn irrigation should increase 64 mm with 1 0 kg m3 groundwater salinity increase 4 conclusions a simple root zone salt balance model was developed for predicting long term soil salinity by integrating a groundwater balance module to obtain water flux at the bottom of root zone in arid shallow water table areas the performance of the developed model was evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained by hydrus 1d the model was applied to soil salinity prediction in longsheng irrigation district of hetao irrigation district the major conclusions were drawn as follows 1 water table depth is a reliable and effective indicator to obtain the water flux at the bottom of root zone through groundwater balance module in shallow water table depth area with a large time step 2 the model requires three parameters to simulate soil salt balance the parameters f and θtc are relatively stable concerning soil types and β is fluctuating around 1 00 3 water table depth and autumn irrigation amount are the two major factors to control soil salinity increasing water table depth or increasing the autumn irrigation can alleviate the problem of soil salinity moderate groundwater exploitation to increase water table depth is an effective and practical way to save autumn irrigation water and to control soil salinity 4 the required autumn irrigation varies with water table depth and groundwater salinity in the crop growing season and it can decrease by 25 1 mm with 0 1 m water table depth increase and should increase by 64 mm with 1 0 kg m3 groundwater salinity increase 5 since the model assumption of accumulative water flux at the bottom of root zone equaling to that at the water table is valid within a large time step the model is limited to be used for large time step soil salinity simulation

11195,a simple root zone salt balance model was developed for long term soil salt prediction a groundwater balance module was integrated to obtain the water flux at the bottom of the root zone since groundwater level is easily and reliably measured data an assumption that the net percolation at the bottom of root zone equals to the net recharge from root zone to unconfined groundwater system was used which makes capillary rise and infiltration water leaching of root zone obtainable the model accuracy and limitation were evaluated by comparing the simulation results with those from hydrus 1d under various soil texture and bottom boundary conditions the mean relative error mre of soil salt content ranged from 6 25 to 9 95 and the root mean square error rmse from 0 02 kg 100 kg to 0 05 kg 100 kg which suggest the model accuracy the determination coefficient r 2 of the cumulative percolation at the bottom of root zone and recharge to groundwater at the end of each calculation period was 0 99 which validates the model assumption the model was then applied to predict soil salinity in the longsheng irrigation district of hetao irrigation district china the soil salinity and water table depth data from 1999 to 2016 were used to calibrate and validate the model parameters the mre values of water table depth and average soil salt content were 10 08 and 10 84 and rmse values 0 37 m and 0 04 kg 100 kg in the validation period subsequently the validated model was used to simulate the soil salinity in future 100 years under various water saving conditions water table depth and autumn irrigation for salt leaching were the two major factors to control soil salinity the required autumn irrigation to keep root zone in mild salinity level 0 3 kg 100 kg can decrease by 25 1 mm with 0 1 m water table depth increase while it should increase by 64 mm with 1 0 kg m3 groundwater salinity increase in the crop growing season moderate groundwater exploitation to increase water table depth is recommended to save autumn irrigation water and control soil salinity keywords soil salinity prediction soil salt balance hetao irrigation district autumn irrigation water table depth 1

retirement mao et al 2017 schoups et al 2005 wu et al 2009 the key to the success of management strategies is to reduce input salt and to raise the outflow in the subsoil singh 2015 2017 applying additional water to drive salt out of root zone has been proved as an effective way however it is difficult to determine the amount of leaching water as it is influenced by various factors e g climate conditions soil characteristics irrigation schedules irrigation water salinity and water table depth ritzema 2006 rozema and flowers 2008 this problem may be resolved by using efficient and reliable models that can predict long term soil salinity at the regional scale the site of this study is the hetao irrigation district located in the upper reaches of the yellow river the saline cultivated land occupies more than 50 of the total irrigated cropland 5 7 109 m2 feng et al 2005 to relieve soil salinization autumn irrigation is taken after harvest for washing soil salt out and it consumes more than 30 of total irrigation water from the yellow river hao 2016 given that regulation agencies decreased the diversion allocation from the yellow river from 5 4 billion m3 to 4 billion m3 in recent years water saving and salinity control have been the main concerns for sustainable agriculture development it is necessary to estimate the amount of appropriated autumn irrigation and to optimize irrigation schedule so that the salt accumulated in the crop growing season can be washed out thoroughly thus it is a great challenge to investigate the soil salt dynamics under different irrigation management strategies many soil salt models have been developed to calculate root zone salt dynamics including numerical models and mass balance models the numerical models including hydrus šimůnek et al 2013 swap kroes and dam 2003 enviro gro pang and letey 1998 and q3d zhu et al 2012 have solid theoretical foundation and are widely used for simulating water flow and solute transport in the subsurface systems however for the numerical models fine spatial discretization and small time step are always needed to obtain accurate results which may result in high computational cost especially for long term and large scale modeling setting up the numerical models also requires intensive hydrogeological information which is not always available in practice zhu et al 2013 soil salt mass balance models are not subject to the problems above for numerical models there are two kinds of soil salt balance models the first kind is multi reservoir model with subsurface system divided into multiple reservoirs and each reservoir is a simulation layer e g saltmod oosterbaan 1998 and oasis mod askri et al 2010 another is simple root zone model which considers water and salt balance in the divided layers of root zone e g tetrans corwin and waggoner 1990 saltirsoil visconti et al 2011 watsuit rhoades and merrill 1976 corwin et al 2007 and salt storage model ritzema 2006 the development and application of these salt mass balance models are listed in table 1 the multi reservoir models usually consider water flow and salt transport from the root zone to groundwater system they have solid foundation to calculate the percolation and capillary rise the root zone models focus on the major processes that impact water flow and salt dynamics in the root zone for example tetrans and saltirsoil contain two modules to represent soil water balance and soil salt balance the tipping bucket method kendy et al 2003 is used to simulate infiltration redistribution and drainage processes however water can only be drained downward or directly depleted in the soil water module while ignoring the upward soil water movement corwin et al 2007 mao et al 2018b it is thus difficult for these models to predict salt accumulation in areas with strong evapotranspiration under shallow water table depth due to capillary rise accurate estimation of the water flux at the bottom of root zone is necessary for calculating the soil salt dynamics the salt storage model ritzema 2006 considered capillary rise with the assumption that salt concentration of capillary rise equals to that of percolation this assumption is suitable for areas where the groundwater is fully fed by percolation from the root zone with no seepage from elsewhere ritzema 2006 however the assumption has been challenged in arid and semi arid agricultural areas where seepage from irrigation canal or from an irrigated field towards fallow land is unavoidable in this study a simple root zone salt balance model integrated with a groundwater balance module was developed three parameters were needed by the soil salt balance model to calculate root zone salt content while the water flux at the bottom of the root zone are available from the groundwater balance module which makes it suitable for real world application with limited data the groundwater balance module was used to obtain the water flux at the bottom of the root zone by assuming that the net percolation at the bottom of root zone equals to the net recharge from root zone to shallow unconfined aquifer this makes the model validation be easily carried out with the indicator of groundwater level which is very reliably measured data the model accuracy and limitation were evaluated by comparing the results with those from hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2013 a real world application of the developed model at the longsheng irrigation district in the hetao irrigation district was presented the major impact factors and measurements to control soil salinity were also discussed 2 model description 2 1 model development the concept and flow chart of the developed model are shown in fig 1 a and b respectively the model included a root zone salt balance module and a groundwater balance module as shown in fig 1 a the model was developed based on the salt mass balance considering three major sources of salt input i e irrigation water precipitation and capillary rise and three major sources of salt output i e uptake by crop leaching to subsoil by irrigation and precipitation the percolation from irrigation or precipitation and the capillary rise were considered in the groundwater balance module those items were assumed to be equal to those at the bottom of root zone the model first ran the groundwater balance module to obtain the percolation from irrigation or precipitation and the capillary rise then it started running the salt balance module to calculate the salt concentration at the bottom of the root zone and average salt content in the root zone the model flowchart can be found in fig 1 b 2 1 1 groundwater balance module there were seven items considered in the developed model for simulating groundwater level which were seepage from canals percolation from irrigation and precipitation lateral flow of groundwater drainage capillary rise from groundwater system and pumping water the equations are as follows 1 q c a n l q i r r i q p r e c r l d q e w δ q 2 q c a n l η j 3 q irri α i 4 q prec λ p 5 q e ε exp d h e t 0 6 δ q δ h μ where qcanl is the seepage water from canal system m qirri and qprec are the percolation from irrigation and precipitation m rl is the lateral flow to aquifer m d is the drainage to ditches or pipe drains m qe is the capillary rise from groundwater aquifer m assuming that it depends on the water table depth and atmospheric evaporation capacity w is the pumping water m δq is the groundwater storage change m η is the recharge coefficient of canal seepage j is water diversion m α is the recharge coefficient of irrigation i and p are irrigation and precipitation m λ is the recharge coefficient of precipitation ε and d are the capillary rise coefficients h is the average water table depth m et 0 is the reference crop evapotranspiration m δh is the water table change m μ is the specific yield it should be noted that qirri qprec and qe were the variables we concerned in the groundwater balance module which were subsequently needed by the root zone salt balance module 2 1 2 root zone salt balance module the salt entering into the root zone included salt from irrigation precipitation and capillary rise the salt discharged from the root zone included leaching of irrigation precipitation and salt uptake by crops it was the average salt content of the root zone that was calculated by the developed model and the salt balance equations are as follows 7 s irri s prec s e s d irri s d prec s crop δ s 8 s i r r i i c i r r i 9 s p r e c p c p r e c 10 s

capillary rise respectively kg m2 sd irri and sd prec are salt leaching from the root zone by irrigation and precipitation kg m2 scrop is salt uptake by crop kg m2 δs is the salt storage change in the root zone kg m2 cirri cprec and ce are the salt concentration of irrigation precipitation and capillary rise water kg m3 cd irri and cd prec are the salt concentration of the percolation water at the bottom of root zone due to irrigation and precipitation kg m3 δsc is the change of soil salt content in the root zone kg 100 kg ρ is the soil bulk density kg m3 hr is the root zone depth m the cd i i irri prec terms mainly depended on the salt concentration of soil solution and the irrigation water or precipitation in the following ways ritzema 2006 oosterbaan 1998 14 c d i c i 1 f c t f i irri

the salt concentration of irrigation or precipitation kg m3 ct is the salt concentration of soil solution at the beginning of the period kg m3 f is the leaching efficiency sca is the root zone salt content at the beginning period kg 100 kg θtc is the coefficient transforming soil salt content to salt concentration this parameter is defined as field capacity in the salt storage model ritzema 2006 and is set as half of the saturated water content in saltmod oosterbaan 1998 in the proposed model the physical meaning of θtc was the average volumetric water content of root zone within the simulation duration however the proposed model did not calculate the soil water content so it was defined as a coefficient herein since the model cannot calculate the salt concentration of capillary rise directly it assumed that the average salt concentration of capillary rise was proportional to the average salt concentration of the percolation water at the bottom of root zone during the simulation period 16 c e β c d where β is the salt concentration conversion coefficient of capillary rise since β is difficult to be measured the parameter value was discussed in the case study as shown in section 3 cd is the average salt concentration of the percolation water at the bottom of root zone which is calculated as follows 17 c d i irri prec c d i q i i irri prec q i since items qirri qprec and qe have been obtained by the groundwater balance module three more parameters i e f θ tc and β were required in the root zone salt balance module three metrics were used to evaluate the model performance i e the mean relative error mre the root mean square error rmse and the determination coefficient r 2 which can be found in ren et al 2016 2 2 model evaluation and application cases two cases were adopted to evaluate the model accuracy and limitation as well as its application in real world complicated conditions case 1 was a synthetic case with two purposes one was to test the model accuracy for calculating salt concentration at the bottom of the root zone in salt balance module by comparing the results with those obtained from hydrus 1d another was to test the model assumption that the net percolation at the bottom of root zone was equal to the net recharge from the root zone to groundwater table case 2 was a real world application in longsheng irrigation district to investigate the model suitability in complex conditions various scenarios considering the water saving policy were set to discuss the future soil salt dynamics and soil salinity control measurements the results and discussion were presented in section 3 2 2 1 case 1 synthetic case for model evaluation this case considered vertical salt transport subject to a changing upper boundary condition by comparing the results of the proposed model with those obtained by using hydrus 1d the soil column was 20 m in length with a top soil layer of 3 m in thickness overlaying a sandy layer of 17 m in thickness and four different soil types i e sandy loam loam clay loam and silt were applied in the top soil layer respectively the soil hydraulic parameters of the four soil types given by carsel and parrish 1988 are listed in table 2 and they were used by hydrus 1d fig 2 a shows the daily irrigation and potential evaporation e p and transpiration t p in this case the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 was calculated by the actual daily meteorological data of linhe weather station shown in fig 3 using fao 56 penman monteith equation then the potential evapotranspiration et p was adopted by multiplying the et 0 with the crop coefficient the potential evaporation e p and transpiration t p were calculated by partitioning et p using beer s law šimůnek et al 2013 the details can be found in the supplementary document the root zone was 0 6 m in depth the column bottom was prescribed as four scenarios of changing head boundary condition marked as w1 w2 w3 and w4 shown in fig 2 b the average water table of w1 w2 w3 and w4 was located at the depth of 1 4 m 1 9 m 2 4 m and 2 9 m from the soil surface respectively so there were 16 scenarios totally the initial salt concentration within the top 0 6 m was 8 kg m3 while it was 2 kg m3 for groundwater and the salt concentration changed linearly from 8 0 to 2 0 kg m3 from the depth of 0 6 m to water table the salt concentration of irrigation water was 2 kg m3 the simulation period lasted 2140 days there were 20 calculation periods divided based on the upper boundary condition which assumed the first 153 days as crop growing season and next 61 days as no crop it should be noted that there is no measured data used in this case and the simulation results from hydrus 1d is used as comparison benchmark for evaluation 2 2 2 case 2 real world application in an arid agricultural district longsheng irrigation district is located in the central region of the hetao irrigation district inner mongolia china fig 3 its area is 3 667 107 m2 10 5 km long from north to south and 3 8 km wide from east to west mao et al 2017 the average annual precipitation and pan evaporation with 20 cm diameter from 1981 to 2010 were 148 8 mm and 2327 mm respectively the top soil within the depth of 5 m is sand mixed with clay and the top soil is underlain by a sand layer with the thickness of 95 m mao et al 2017 the water table depth and soil salinity from 1999 to 2016 were used to calibrate and validate the developed model there were 10 monitoring wells and 10 soil sampling locations from 1999 to 2006 with water table depth observed every 5 days and soil salinity measured 4 times every year there were 14 observation points from 2009 to 2010 and the water table depth and soil salinity were measured once every 10 days from may to november during the latest three years from 2014 to 2016 there were 10 monitoring wells and 24 soil samples measured by our research group also there is a conventional groundwater observation well 122 in the area with water table depth observed every 5 days by irrigation bureau of hetao irrigation district and data from 2002 to 2013 were collected the data used in the developed model were averaged over space the water diversion of xiji canal was monitored from 1999 to 2015 by irrigation bureau of hetao irrigation district and the average salt concentration of irrigation was 0 5434 kg m3 the precipitation during 1999 to 2016 was from the linhe weather station the evaporation from a 20 cm evaporation pan e pan was measured the reference crop evapotranspiration et 0 was then estimated multiplying the e pan with the coefficient 0 56 cobaner 2013 doorenbos and pruitt 1977 gundekar et al 2008 hao 2016 the precipitation et 0 and water diversion used in the model are shown in fig 4 three periods per year were used in the simulation based on the climate and land use conditions at the study site which were the period of crop growing from may to september the autumn irrigation period from october to november and the no crop growing period from december to the next april yang et al 2017 the seasonal averaged precipitation et 0 and water diversion were used in the simulation given the plan of using groundwater for irrigation in the hetao irrigation district the water table depth irrigation schemes and salt concentration of irrigation water will be changed thus the validated model was used to predict the future soil salt dynamics under various scenarios with different water table depths different autumn irrigation schemes different groundwater salinity for irrigation in the crop growing season the water table depths were set as 1 7 m 2 1 m and 2 5 m respectively the 1 7 m was same as the current condition and 2 5 m was the average water table depth in this area with groundwater irrigation hao 2016 yang et al 2017 and 2 1 m was between the two values of 1 7 m and 2 5 m five different autumn irrigation schemes were set as 209 6 mm 189 mm 168 mm 147 mm and 126 mm which were 100 90 80 70 and 60 of the current irrigation water respectively according to mao et al 2018a the salinity of groundwater pumped for irrigation in the crop growing season is below 3 0 kg m3 three scenarios with groundwater salinity of 1 0 kg m3 2 0 kg m3 and 3 0 kg m3 were set and the current irrigation salinity of 0 5434 kg m3 was used as a reference the initial root zone salt content in all the simulation scenarios was set as 0 148 kg 100 kg which was the average over the measurements in 2015 and 2016 the precipitation et 0 and irrigation scheme in the crop growing season were used as the average over precipitation et 0 and irrigation scheme from 2003 to 2016 the simulation period was for 100 years it should be noted that this long term simulation is hypothetical because these variables including precipitation et 0 and irrigation vary in space and time in reality 3 results and discussion 3 1 model accuracy of the root zone salt balance module since the accuracy of the model depended on how precisely we can describe the salt content of root zone and the salt concentration at the bottom of root zone four scenarios with different soil types at the bottom boundary w2 of case 1 were used to test salt balance module showing in eqs 7 16 the water flux at the bottom of root zone calculated by hydrus 1d was directly applied in the soil salt balance module in the simulation the values of the three parameters f β θtc for the four different soil types are listed in table 2 the f indicated the depletion of salt concentration in the leaching process which was obtained by reference values from 0 15 to 1 0 mao et al 2017 and determined by soil types zhu 1981 the β was the ratio of salt concentration of capillary rise to that of percolation as evaluated by the simulation results of hydrus 1d and θtc was close to the average volumetric water content in the root zone obtained by hydrus 1d the simulated salt concentrations at the bottom of root zone in the calculation period and average salt content of root zone with different scenarios were compared with those from hydrus 1d as shown in figs 5 and 6 the average salt content within the root zone given by hydrus 1d was used as comparison benchmark to evaluate the model accuracy the developed model can estimate the salt concentration of percolation and capillary rise and capture the salt content change process well the mre of salt concentration of percolation or capillary rise simulated by the developed model ranged from 5 26 to 0 41 and the corresponding rmse from 2 00 kg m3 to 4 65 kg m3 and r 2 0 50 the mre of salt content of root zone ranged from 6 25 to 9 95 and the corresponding rmse from 0 02 kg 100 kg to 0 05 kg 100 kg and r 2 from 0 59 to 0 82 these results indicate that the developed model can match hydrus 1d precisely with only three parameters and the root zone salt balance module is credible the detailed values of the three evaluation metrics mre rmse and r 2 can be found in the supplementary document 3 2 model comparison and limitation since the model was developed with the assumption that the percolation at the bottom of root zone equals to the recharge from root zone to groundwater system sixteen scenarios of case 1 with four soil types and four bottom boundary conditions were used to 1 investigate to what extent the assumption was valuable in the simulation with shallow water table in agricultural areas and to 2 examine the model capacity using water table depth as an indicator to obtain the percolation and capillary rise at the bottom of root zone and to 3 test model accuracy to predict root zone soil salinity under different bottom conditions the groundwater balance module was run to obtain the parameters i e μ α ε and d shown in eqs 3 5 and 6 the parameters used by the developed model under the 16 scenarios are listed in table 3 the simulated water table depth from the developed model and hydrus 1d with loam soil under four bottom boundary scenarios are shown in fig 7 a d all water table depth comparison results under the 16 scenarios are demonstrated in fig 8 a the change amplitude of simulated water table depth was larger than that in hydrus 1d which greatly depended on the specific yield the mre of water table depth ranged from 9 62 to 13 43 and most were smaller than 10 rmse from 0 18 m to 0 93 m and r 2 from 0 44 to 0 79 with most r 2 values larger than 0 60 the percolation to groundwater and discharge of capillary rise from groundwater with loam soil under four bottom boundary scenarios were compared with those at the bottom of root zone in hydrus 1d as shown in fig 7 e h the comparison of water flux under the 16 scenarios are plotted in fig 8 b it can be found that the percolation and capillary rise in every simulation period predicted by the developed model were highly consistent with those from hydrus 1d with the r 2 being 0 94 and 0 95 respectively the mre values of percolation ranged from 1 13 to 19 36 most of them are smaller than 10 and the rmse values were around 10 0 mm with the r 2 values more than 0 85 the mre of capillary rise ranged from 11 37 to 19 36 rmse from 0 49 mm to 18 11 mm and r 2 larger than 0 90 except sandy loam under w1 the predicted average salt content of root zone under different water table depths of loam soil were compared with those from hydrus 1d as illustrated in fig 7 i l the comparison of average salt content of root zone under the 16 scenarios are plotted in fig 8 c the salt content of root zone at the end of each calculation period predicted by the developed model were close to those from hydrus 1d with r 2 being 0 92 the mre values ranged from 9 67 to 6 60 smaller than 10 the rmse values from 0 01 to 0 08 kg 100 kg and the r 2 values from 0 65 to 0 93 which demonstrate the good performance of the developed model in predicting salt content of root zone the detailed values of the three evaluation metrics mre rmse and r 2 can be found in the supplementary document the cumulative water flux at the bottom of root zone at the depth of 0 6 m and at the water table under various soil types and bottom boundary conditions simulated by hydrus 1d were further compared as shown in fig 9 fig 9 a shows the results of different soil types with bottom boundary w2 and fig 9 b shows the results of four different water table depths with soil type of clay loam the values of cumulative percolation at the bottom of root zone were close to the cumulative recharge from root zone to the water table comparison of the cumulative percolation at the bottom of root zone and cumulative recharge from root zone to groundwater at the end of each calculation period are shown in fig 9 c which showed good correlation with r 2 being 0 99 the results show that the average water flux at the bottom of root zone equals to that at the water table and the model development assumption is applicable however from fig 9 a and b it can also be found that the cumulative water flux at the bottom of root zone fluctuated more strongly than that at the water table a relative larger difference can be found with the deeper water table as shown in fig 9 b the reason is that the bottom of root zone is closer to the ground surface which is more sensitive to the upper boundary condition it takes longer time for the infiltration arriving at the deeper water table which shows more steady increase of the cumulative water flux so larger error will be induced when small time step is used the model is suitable for large time steps with complete infiltration to ensure that the cumulative water flux at the bottom of root zone equals that at the water table 3 3 model parameters analysis the parameters for groundwater balance module and root zone salt balance module under the 16 scenarios of case 1 are shown in table 3 the parameters for groundwater balance module were mainly impacted by soil types rather than by the bottom boundary conditions the irrigation recharge coefficients of sandy loam loam clay loam and silt decreased in sequence while the capillary rise coefficient ε increased in that order ε values in the no crop growing season were smaller than those in crop growing season which are consistent with the findings reported in literature ayars et al 2005 gao et al 2017 liu et al 2006 yang et al 2011 the leaching efficiency f of sandy loam was 0 50 and 0 90 for loam clay loam and silt which are within the range of 0 15 1 00 reported in literature mao et al 2017 the salt concentration conversion coefficient of capillary rise β for different soil types was very similar and was 1 06 for most conditions which is close to the assumption of the salt storage model that salt concentration of capillary rise equals to that of percolation ritzema 2006 the coefficient transforming soil salt content to salt concentration θtc of sandy loam loam clay loam and silt was about 0 11 0 19 0 23 and 0 22 respectively the sandier soil type and deeper water table had smaller θtc values as a summary the f and θtc were relatively stable concerning soil types and the β was relatively stable fluctuating around 1 00 3 4 model calibration and validation in longsheng irrigation district the measured water table depth and soil salinity data from 1999 to 2008 were used to calibrate the developed model and the cross validation period was from 2009 to 2016 the simulated and measured water table depth in the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 10 a the mre values of water table depth were 6 96 and 10 08 rmse values 0 33 m and 0 37 m and r 2 values 0 71 and 0 78 in the calibration and validation periods respectively which indicate that the groundwater balance module can reasonably capture the water table depth the validated parameters of the groundwater balance module are listed in table 4 the specific yield was 0 07 which is consistent with the result of zhang 2011 in the same study area and close to the average specific yield of yongji sub district in hetao irrigation district with the value 0 056 yang et al 2017 the recharge coefficient of canal seepage η was 0 17 which ranges between 0 16 to 0 40 in other areas of hetao irrigation district xu et al 2010 xue et al 2017 yue et al 2016 the recharge coefficients of irrigation in the crop growth period and autumn irrigation period were 0 20 and 0 45 respectively and the recharge coefficient of precipitation was 0 12 these values are close to the results obtained by zhang 2011 and yang et al 2017 the drainage in the crop growing period and autumn irrigation period was about 1 9 and 1 7 of water diversion which is consistent with the ratio of drainage water to the water diversion in the hetao irrigation district hao 2016 the capillary rise ranged from 100 to 188 mm in the year of 1999 to 2016 which is in accordance with the results that the annual contribution of groundwater to evapotranspiration ranges from 156 4 to 173 mm in its neighboring regions xue et al 2017 yue et al 2016 the parameters of soil salt balance model were further calibrated and validated by comparing the salt content of root zone with the corresponding measured data from 1999 to 2016 the salt uptake by crop in the model were set as 0 0225 kg m2 according to hao 2016 the simulated and measured soil salt content in the calibration and validation periods are shown in fig 10 b the mre values were 17 38 and 10 84 rmse values 0 04 kg 100 kg and 0 04 kg 100 kg and r2 values 0 64 and 0 31 in the calibration and validation periods respectively these results imply that the modeling are acceptable considering the limited number of samples and the strong variability of soil salt in space and time due to the climate and irrigation conditions they confirm that the developed model is practical for predicting long term soil salinity in the arid area with shallow water table depth the validated parameters concerning the soil salt balance module are listed in table 4 the three parameters f β θtc were 0 50 0 99 and 0 23 the f value used in the model agrees with the recommended value zhu 1981 mao et al 2017 the θtc was 0 23 which is close to average root zone moisture content 0 21 in the year of 2009 and 2010 zhang 2011 β was 0 99 which is consistent with the verification results of the soils based on hydrus 1d shown in table 3 as a summary the developed model performed well for calculating long term soil salinity 3 5 long term soil salinity dynamics prediction under water saving conditions the calibrated model of longsheng irrigation district was further used to predict the soil salinity dynamics in the next 100 years under the current and future changing irrigation conditions for implementing the better water resources management for sustainable development of agriculture the soil salt content dynamics under the different water table depths are shown in fig 11 a the root zone was in a desalination state with all three water table depths and the desalination was more obvious with the deeper water table the soil salt contents after 100 years were 77 34 50 22 and 42 29 of the current soil content at the end of crop growing period with the water table depth of 1 7 m 2 1 m and 2 5 m respectively it demonstrates that the current irrigation at the study area is reasonable for sustainable development of agriculture from the perspective of controlling soil salinization it also confirms that increasing water table depth to reduce capillary rise is an effective way to control soil salinization in arid area with shallow water table depth fig 11 b shows the soil salt content dynamics under different autumn irrigation schemes the soil salt achieved a steady state at the end of the simulation with input salts being equal to the output visconti et al 2011 according to the classification criteria of saline land from wang 1993 and mao et al 2017 in the future 100 years the soil salinity of root zone was categorized as the non saline salt content 0 2 kg 100 kg land under the current or 90 of current autumn irrigation the soil salinity of root zone increased with the decrease of autumn irrigation water and it varied slowly from non saline land to mild saline 0 2 kg 100 kg salt content 0 3 kg 100 kg land with 80 autumn irrigation of the current level to middle saline 0 3 kg 100 kg salt content 0 5 kg 100 kg land with 70 autumn irrigation of the current level and to strongly saline 0 5 kg 100 kg salt content 1 0 kg 100 kg land with 60 autumn irrigation of the current level therefore the autumn irrigation schedule is the key to control the soil salinity in the root zone fig 11 c shows the soil salt content dynamics under different salt concentration of irrigation groundwater in the crop growing season the root zone salt content and its amplitude of different periods in a year increased with groundwater salinity according to the prediction results shown in fig 11 c the soil salinity of root zone would vary slowly from non saline land to mild middle and strongly saline land in the future 100 years with groundwater salinity 1 0 kg m3 2 0 kg m3 and 3 0 kg m3 respectively influence of groundwater salinity on soil salinity in the root zone cannot be ignored given that decreasing autumn irrigation is an effective way for saving irrigation water fig 12 shows the required amount of reasonable autumn irrigation water which can sustain root zone within mild salinity level 0 3 kg 100 kg under different water table depth and groundwater salinity calculated by the model a logarithmic relationship was observed between the required autumn irrigation water amount and water table depth fig 12 a which indicates that shallower water table requires more autumn irrigation water it can be found from fig 12 b that when groundwater salinity increased by 1 0 kg m3 the amount of required autumn irrigation would increase by about 64 mm 78 mm with water table depths vary from 1 70 m to 2 90 m under the current conditions the amount of autumn irrigation can be decreased by 25 1 mm with 0 1 m water table depth increase and the amount of autumn irrigation should increase 64 mm with 1 0 kg m3 groundwater salinity increase 4 conclusions a simple root zone salt balance model was developed for predicting long term soil salinity by integrating a groundwater balance module to obtain water flux at the bottom of root zone in arid shallow water table areas the performance of the developed model was evaluated by comparing the results with those obtained by hydrus 1d the model was applied to soil salinity prediction in longsheng irrigation district of hetao irrigation district the major conclusions were drawn as follows 1 water table depth is a reliable and effective indicator to obtain the water flux at the bottom of root zone through groundwater balance module in shallow water table depth area with a large time step 2 the model requires three parameters to simulate soil salt balance the parameters f and θtc are relatively stable concerning soil types and β is fluctuating around 1 00 3 water table depth and autumn irrigation amount are the two major factors to control soil salinity increasing water table depth or increasing the autumn irrigation can alleviate the problem of soil salinity moderate groundwater exploitation to increase water table depth is an effective and practical way to save autumn irrigation water and to control soil salinity 4 the required autumn irrigation varies with water table depth and groundwater salinity in the crop growing season and it can decrease by 25 1 mm with 0 1 m water table depth increase and should increase by 64 mm with 1 0 kg m3 groundwater salinity increase 5 since the model assumption of accumulative water flux at the bottom of root zone equaling to that at the water table is valid within a large time step the model is limited to be used for large time step soil salinity simulation

11196,reference evapotranspiration eto is a key component of the hydrological cycle and it plays a vital role in agricultural forest and environmental management this study assesses the capability of hot spot geospatial analysis to determine statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low eto in china over the period of 1970 2014 based on the daily data from 598 weather stations the global controlling factors affecting eto across continental china are investigated using global ordinary least square regression ols model the spatial relationship between eto and climatic variables is explored using local geographic weighted regression gwr model it was found that for china as a whole eto decreased significantly from 1970 to 1993 at a rate of 14 91 mm decade 1 while the trend began increasing by 16 50 mm decade 1 from 1993 to 2014 the hot spot analysis showed that the regional distribution of statistically significant spatial eto clusters remained relatively steady between years from 1970 to 2014 hot regions were identified with high values of annual total eto in north china nc south china sc and the turpan depression of northwest china nwc the cold regions were highly clustered in most parts of northeast china nec and the borders between nwc central china cc and southwest china swc it was also found that statistically significant clusters of hot and cold spots exhibited a migration trend between months the results of the ols analysis suggested that over china the maximum temperature relative humidity and wind speed were the controlling meteorological variables affecting eto based on the results of gwr maximum and minimum temperature were the most influencing climatic variables affecting et0 over china gwr was found to be a more powerful method than ols for modelling eto in china results of this study can be used to help end users planners and policy makers to anticipate their decision making which in turn will improve regional water management in china keywords reference evapotranspiration spatiotemporal variability hot spot analysis ordinary least square regression geographic weighted regression china 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 is a key element to calculate the actual crop evapotranspiration and agricultural water use information about spatial and temporal distribution of the et0 is an essential need to improve the regional water resources management and allocation to crops and municipalities in china et0 is the main driven parameter of crops water balance therefore its spatial and temporal information can assist growers in their irrigation scheduling for maximizing yield changes in temperature precipitation runoff and soil moisture patterns caused by climate change have been reported in a number of previous studies groisman et al 1999 ziegler et al 2003 gao et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 cai et al 2011 ye et al 2014 contrary to the expectation that eto would increase over time both the observed pan evapotranspiration and computed reference evapotranspiration values have decreased in many regions including the united states russia peterson et al 1995 golubev et al 2001 china gong et al 2006 shan et al 2015 feng et al 2017 gao et al 2017 italy moonen et al 2002 australia donohue et al 2010 and japan asanuma and kamimera 2004 the disparity between expectations and observations is known as the evaporation paradox coined by brutsaert and parlange 1998 however since the 1990s studies have reported increasing trends in china zuo et al 2012 iran shadmani et al 2012 tabari et al 2012 and india goyal 2004 therefore a systemic evaluation of the spatial and temporal variability of eto in china is necessary spatial analytical methods and geographic information systems gis are widely used in hydrological research to overcome the limited number and distribution of weather stations many studies have used interpolation methods to describe the spatial distribution of eto these methods include the inverse distance weighted idw method shepard 1968 franke 1982 cornejo 2003 xu et al 2006 li et al 2012 yang et al 2013 fathian and aliyari 2016 lv et al 2016 splines sharma and irmak 2012 sharma et al 2013 and universal kriging basistha et al 2008 thomas 2000 evaluated the spatial and temporal distribution of eto in china using 65 weather stations and it was found that sunshine duration was the most important factor affecting potential evapotranspiration followed by the relative humidity and maximum temperature wang et al 2017 assessed the spatiotemporal variability of eto in china finding that the annual eto decreased over time and was most influenced by wind speed followed by minimum temperature sunshine duration relative humidity and maximum temperature zhang et al 2013 argued that the most influential variable on eto in china is vapor pressure followed by solar radiation air temperature and wind speed similar work has been conducted to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of eto in china cong and yang 2008 gao et al 2006 liu et al 2004 yin et al 2010 traditionally interpolation methods were applied to describe the spatial distribution of et0 the interpolation maps can identify the location of the et0 cluster but cannot determine whether the cluster is statistically significant or not in addition few studies have been performed regarding the spatial clusters of statistically significant high and low values of eto in china and trends of these spatial clusters remain unclear therefore to capture such information the hot spot analysis was used in this study the hot spot analysis also known as getis ord statistic getis and ord 1992 1996 mitchell 2005 ord and getis 1995 peeters et al 2015 is a method for assessing the location related tendency clustering in the attribution of spatial data points or areas by assessing each feature within the context of neighboring features and features in the whole dataset hot spot analysis can be used to detect locations of statistically significant high and low value clusters of a specific phenomenon hot spot analysis has been widely applied in criminal research craglia et al 2000 ceccato and dolmen 2011 food availability leslie et al 2012 incident management analysis songchitruksa and zeng 2010 heat vulnerability monitoring wolf and mcgregor 2013 health care availability zhang et al 2012 disease propagation wang et al 2013 species distributions ma et al 2012 and fire monitoring gajovic and todorovic 2013 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to assess the capability of hot spot analysis to determine statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low eto in china hot spot analysis can provide additional information regarding the variation of eto and offer more localized information significant research has been performed on the relationships between eto and various climatic parameters some studies attribution decreases in wind speed to a decreasing eto trend in australia roderick et al 2007 canada burn and hesch 2007 and in the yellow river basin of china wang et al 2012 other studies concluded that decreases in sunshine duration and solar radiation were mainly responsible for decreasing eto amounts in the unites states peterson et al 1995 west liao river basin gao et al 2017 poyang lake catchment ye et al 2014 and southwest china fan and thomas 2013 other studies concluded that the relative humidity was the dominant factor behind the eto decrease in northwest china huo et al 2013 and in the hai river basin of china zhao et al 2014 however investigations into the mapping of correlation coefficients between eto and different meteorological variables in china has not yet been performed global controlling climatic factors affecting eto across continental china are not available in the literature in addition the spatially varying relationship between eto and climatic variables in china are also scarcely reported the geospatial based method hot spot analysis spatial correlation coefficient mapping ordinary least square regression ols and geographic weighted regression gwr can be used to explore the statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low eto and account for possible spatial relationships between eto and climatic variables in china which may be ignored by the traditional methods in this study the et0 observed was calculated by penman monteith for the 598 weather stations then we used the obtained et0 values as target in ols and gwr to find the most important et0 drivers over the continental china ols was proposed because of its simplicity to map with fewer data and it helps to investigate the global controlling factors affecting et0 across continental china gwr was also introduced in the study as it can be used to explain the spatially varying relationship between et0 and meteorological variables in china in addition we used the hot spot analysis because it helps to assess its capability to determine the statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low et0 values over continental china which is very important for agriculture production and water resource planning the suggested methods in this study can help avoiding data missing gap across china and they are very easy to deploy by end users and water or irrigation professionals the objectives of this study were 1 to assess the capability of the relatively new geospatial methodology of hot spot analysis to detect statistically significant eto clusters within and between the years of 1970 2014 in china 2 to identify the global controlling climatic factors affecting eto across continental china using ols and 3 to explore and analyze the spatially varying relationship between eto and climatic variables in china using gwr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area considering the convenience of policy implementation peng et al 2018 and the integrity of administrative area and the river basin this study divided china into seven regions based on the natural geographical division of luo 1954 as it was shown in fig 1 the seven regions include south china sc east china ec central china cc north china nc northwest china nwc southwest china swc and northeast china nec table 1 summarized the averaged climatic parameters of each region 2 2 data collection daily weather data from 598 weather stations were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma gov cn between 1970 and 2014 the data included daily values of maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity sunlight hours as well as wind speed at a height of 2 m height 2 3 data processing protocol and statistical analysis 2 3 1 eto calculation the fao penman monteith pm equation was used to calculate the daily eto from the data obtained from the weather stations in this study this equation has been widely used for determination of eto values allen et al 1998 the pm equation can be written as 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration in mm day 1 δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve in kpa c 1 rn is the net

temperature which is determined from minimum and maximum temperatures in c u2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m height in m s 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure in kpa and ea is the actual vapor pressure in kpa the average annual and seasonal eto values were determined by calculating daily values for each station spring was defined as march to may summer as june to august autumn as september to november and winter as december to february 2 3 2 trend analysis linear regression has been widely used in trend analysis wang et al 2012 fan and thomas 2013 vicente serrano et al 2014 ye et al 2014 and was used to determine overall trends in eto and other meteorological parameters the significance of the trends in eto was determined using the rank based nonparametric mann kendall mk test developed by mann 1945 and kendall 1975 the mk test is recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo for trend analysis in climate and hydrological research daughney and reeves 2006 modarres and de paulo rodrigues da silva 2007 wang et al 2012 zuo et al 2012 for china as a whole and on a regional scale the mean all china series linear trends were calculated from unweighted monthly and annual means of the corresponding stations 2 3 3 spatial distribution the inverse distance weighted interpolation method idw has been used extensively for spatial analysis of eto li et al 2012 lv et al 2016 and precipitation fathian and aliyari 2016 due to its high accuracy and simplicity bussières and hogg 1989 cornejo 2003 this study applied idw shepard 1968 for the interpolation of the point based eto data the long term average annual seasonal and monthly total of the eto were interpolated using arcgis 10 3 environmental systems research institute redlands usa 2 3 4 hot spot analysis in this study hot spot analysis was used to determine statistically significant spatial clusters of high hot spot and low values cold spot of eto getis and ord 1992 calculations for the hot spot analysis were performed using 2 g i j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j s n j 1 n w i j 2 j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 where g i statistic is calculated for the i th weather station standardized as a z score xj is the eto value of each neighbor wi j is the spatial weight for the target neighbor i and j pair n is the number of weather stations which is 598 in this study x is the average eto value of the 598 weather stations represented as x j 1 n x j n and s is the standard deviation given by s j 1 n x j 2 x 2 n gi statistic reports a z score and p value for each weather station a significant eto hot spot can be identified if a weather station has a high z score and small p value a significant eto cold spot can be detected if a weather station has a negative z score and a small p value the z score represents the statistical significance of the clustering eto distribution in different groups including hot cold and not significant spots the weights were automatically assigned based on the fixed distance band model which was recommended and default conceptualization of spatial relationships for the hot spot analysis each weather station was analyzed within the context of neighboring weather stations neighboring stations within the threshold distance received a weight of one and stations outside the critical distance received a weight of zero the hot spot analysis was performed using the arcgis 10 3 platform for the hot spot analysis of annual et0 gi was calculated in yearly scale for the hot spot analysis of the monthly et0 gi was calculated in monthly scale due to the fact that hot spot maps of et0 showed the weather stations with different conficent level gridding maps was also used for comparison with the hot spot maps in the study 2 3 5 modelling spatial relationships between eto and climatic variables pearson s correlation coefficient can be used to determine the degree to which a variable is linearly related to another in a correlation analysis vicente serrano et al 2014 pearson s correlation coefficient was used in the idw gridding maps to indicate the influence of the various climatic variables on the eto for each station ols regression can be applied to detect the global relationship between the environmental parameters and other observed factors sharma et al 2013 in this study ols regression was used to identify the global relationships between eto and the meteorological variables ols can be given as 3 y β o β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β n x n ε where y is the dependent variable eto β β1 β2 β3 and βn are the coefficients of the independent variables climatic parameters and geographic information and ε is the error term the annual average et0 and climatic variables of the 598 weather stations were used as input of ols the calculations were performed for the 598 weather stations in china at annual time scale in order to determine the best combination of meteorological parameters as input into ols an exploratory regression tool was used unlike the stepwise regression which only looks for high adjusted r square values adjusted r2 the exploratory regression tool has a series of threshold criteria such as the adjusted r2 coefficient p values variance inflation factor vif values corrected akaike information criterion aicc jarque bera p values and spatial autocorrelation p values in order to explore the spatially varying relationship between et0 and meteorological variables in china a semiparametric gaussian geographic weighted regression model sggwr was used in this study which can be expressed as 4 y i k β k u i v i x k i l γ l z l i ε i where x k i is the k th independent variable with the geographically varying coefficient β k u i v i at the i th weather station z l i is the l th independent variable with a globally fixed coefficient γ l εi is the gaussian error at the i th weather station this study used the microsoft windows based application software gwr4 to model the spatially varying relationship between eto and climatic parameters fotheringham et al 2002 nakaya et al 2005 2014 in order to compare the performance of gwr and ols to model the et0 a comparative anova test of the gwr and ols models of the annual et0 in china was performed fotheringham et al 2002 erdoǧan 2010 2 4 statistical performance indices the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r were used to evaluate the performance of the ols and gwr models mae rmse and r are commonly used for model evaluation in eto studies li et al 2014 luo et al 2014 lorite et al 2015 traore et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the statistical index formulas may be written as follows 5 m a e i 1 n x i y i n 6 r m s e i 1 n x i y i 2 n 7 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where xi and yi represent the estimated and observed eto respectively at the i th weather station x and y are the average values of estimated and observed eto respectively and n is the number of weather stations which in this study was 598 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal variability of eto and related meteorological variables 3 1 1 spatial variability of the average annual total eto and related meteorological variables fig 2 showed the spatial distribution of the long term 45 year average annual total reference evapotranspiration and related climatic parameters for 1970 2014 in china fig 2a presented the long term average annual total eto peaked in nc sc and the turpan depression of nwc which ranged from 1200 to 1896 mm year 1 low values of long term average annual total eto was found in nec and the borders between nwc cc and swc ranging from 567 to 800 mm year 1 this agreed with the study of gao et al 2017 which found that the multi year average annual total eto varied from 874 to 1014 mm in the west liao riven basin of china shan et al 2015 also determined that the mean annual total eto ranged from 698 1 to 1419 6 mm in the beijing tianjin sand source control project region of china which was comparable with the values determined in this study from high to low value the long term average annual daily maximum and minimum temperatures and relative humidity showed a south north gradient fig 2b 2c and 2d the long term average annual total sunshine duration revealed a clear decreasing trend from nwc to ec fig 2e the long term average annual daily wind speed was also higher in the northern region than in the southern region of china except in certain parts of nwc and nec where low values were found fig 2f fig 2g presented the spatial distribution of percentage error between et0 values by idw gridding map and et0 by pm method the percentage error of most weather stations was in the range of 1 7 to 2 0 except some in the range of 2 0 to 4 4 et0 values of the 7 regions were overestimated by idw except nc 0 01 in addition percentage error was highest in the nwc while lowest in nc the regions which had many gauges were more reliable than the regions that had very few observations gauge fig 2h indicated the range of average daily et0 value for each weather station it was in the range of 0 28 to 2 44 mm day 1 which was higher in the nwc and nc than in the swc and nec 3 1 2 temporal variability of the average annual total eto fig 3 a i showed the long term average annual total eto in the 7 sub regions of china from 1970 to 2014 the overall trend from 1970 to 2014 increased slightly over time with a slope of 1 96 mm decade 1 which agreed well with table 2 the long term average annual total eto values of the 7 regions showed an increasing trend except in nec and nc sc and ec presented a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 05 with slopes of 7 31 and 5 97 mm decade 1 respectively the annual total eto in nec and nc showed an insignificant decrease over time with slope of 6 67 and 1 45 mm decade 1 respectively fig 3j presented the spatial distribution of et0 trend for the 598 weather stations in china negative et0 trend was mainly distributed in nec nc xinjiang uyghur autonomous region huang huai hai plain and yungui plateau 1 03 0 mm day 1 while positive et0 trend was mainly distributed in sc ec and tibet autonomous region 0 2 17 mm day 1 previous studies have found similar trends consistent with the results of this study goyal 2004 kousari and ahani 2012 shadmani et al 2012 tabari et al 2012 zuo et al 2012 found that the annual total eto in most parts of wei river basin of china exhibited an increasing trend and the eto increased greatly after an abrupt change in 1993 according to zhang et al 2013 the annual total eto of china decreased from 1960 to 1992 but then increased significantly after the inflection point in 1993 however there are other studies that report a decreasing eto trend wang et al 2012 2017 these results are inconsistent with the results in this study which is likely caused by regional and time scale differences the positive trend of the eto in parts of china found in this study was mostly due to the increase of temperature which is consistent with the reports by zhang et al 2013 and goyal 2004 increased wind speed was also responsible for the increasing eto trend this was also reported by tabari et al 2012 and kousari and ahani 2012 as they determined that the wind speed was a major factor influencing the eto in iran according to abtew et al 2011 declining humidity and increasing vapor pressure deficit were the main causes of the increase of evaporation and evapotranspiration in florida from 1992 to 2009 zuo et al 2012 documented the importance of relative humidity and determined that it was one of the most important factors behind the increase of eto in wei river basin of china fig 3a showed that the annual total eto in china had a significant decreasing trend from 1970 to 1993 at a rate of 14 91 mm decade 1 which then increased at a rate of 16 50 mm decade 1 after 1993 which was comparable with zhang et al 2013 and li et al 2014 table 2 showed that the eto trend in ec cc nc nwc and swc also decreased from 1970 to 1992 then increased from 1993 to 2014 however nec witnessed a decrease for both periods while an increasing trend was observed in sc to investigate the temporal trend of the annual total eto between decades in china the overall time course was divided into 4 periods 1970 1980 1970s 1981 1990 1980s 1991 2000 1990s and 2001 2014 2000s as can be seen from table 2 the annual total eto in china showed a decreasing trend in the 1980s and 2000s and an increasing trend in the 1970s and the 1990s sc and swc witnessed an increasing eto trend in the first 3 decades and then decreased in 2000s the annual total eto in nwc decreased in the 1970s and 1980s and increased in the 1990s and 2000s resulting in an overall increasing trend from 1970 to 2014 3 2 hot spot analysis fig 4 showed the gridding maps of the average annual total eto for 1970 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2014 and 1970 2014 during the last four decades the spatial distribution of the average annual total eto in china showed few changes the 2000s had the highest annual total eto ranging from 576 to 2365 mm year 1 which may have been caused by the sharp increase in annual total eto after 1993 the spatial distribution of the annual total eto in the 4 decades agreed well with distribution of the average annual total eto of 1970 2014 which was explained in section 3 1 1 the results of the idw analysis can identify the location of the eto cluster but cannot determine whether it is statistically significant the hot spot analysis of the annual eto was obtained using the arcgis 10 3 interface by applying getis ord statistics hot spot maps of the annual total eto in china over time were also shown in fig 4 it showed that statistically significant clusters of hot and cold spots remained relatively fixed between years from 1970 to 2014 the hot regions were highly clustered in nc sc and the turpan depression of nwc which indicates that a high value of annual total eto were likely to appear in these areas cold regions were found with low values of annual total eto in most parts of nec and at the border between nwc cc and swc it was found that hot regions and cold regions were in good agreement with areas of high and low et0 values by the idw gridding maps since the hot spot map of the annual total eto remained relatively steady over the past 45 years attention should be paid to the intra year spatial distribution by applying getis ord statistics hot spot maps of the long term average monthly total eto were obtained for each month fig 5 it was found that statistically significant clusters of hot and cold spots exhibited a migration trend between months from december to march the hot spots were mainly distributed in sc and swc where the annual total eto was relatively high cold spots were mainly found north of 40 n where the annual total eto was relatively low april was a transition period and after april the hot spots moved northward while the cold spots moved southward in the months of may and june hot clusters of monthly total eto were found in nwc and nc while cold spots were found in ec sc and swc not statistically significant spots were distributed between the hot and cold spots mainly in nec and near the latitude of 64 n from july to september the not statistically significant spots in nec turned to cold spots meanwhile the cold spots in ec and sc became hot spots and the cold spots in swc and cc became not statistically significant spots hot regions were more likely to become areas with high et0 values which was more prone to water shortage and drought for areas where irrigation is needed in hot regions more water would be required during dry season as well as drought resistant crops and planting dates planning could be an effective water management strategy the spatial distribution of hot spot can be used as an important source of information for end users planners and policy makers 3 3 spatial sensitivity analysis to explore possible mechanisms behind the appearance of hot spots in the analysis map pearson s correlation coefficients ordinary least square regressions and global weighted regressions were applied for the climatic parameters pearson s correlation coefficients were calculated at each weather station to provide an indication of relationships between the eto distribution and climatic parameters then gridding maps were obtained using the idw method fig 6 showed the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficients between eto and the various climate factors fig 6a presented the correlation coefficient between eto and maximum temperature which ranged from 0 33 to 0 93 the high value appeared in nwc while low values were observed in swc sc as well as some parts of ec and cc fig 6b showed that the correlation coefficient between eto and the minimum temperature which ranged from 0 26 to 0 91 decreasing from north to south it was found that minimum temperature showed a high coefficient in nec while a low coefficient was found in swc sunshine hours which had a large range from 0 11 to 0 90 exerted more influence in sc compared to swc fig 6c fig 6d indicated that the relative humidity had a close relationship with eto in sc and the northern part of nwc with a correlation coefficient of 0 85 in the middle of swc and the eastern part of nwc the relative humidity and eto had a slightly positive relationship fig 6e showed that the correlation coefficient between the wind speed and eto ranged from 0 29 to 0 67 which exerted more influence in nwc as suggested by allen et al 1998 eto was influenced by a combination of climatic parameters therefore the spatial relationship between eto and various climatic parameters as well as altitude in china was assessed with the ols model the ols regression was performed on the long term average annual eto and on the monthly eto from june to september when high eto values were often observed models for june july august september and the yearly model can be shown as 8 e t o 6 0 092 t max 0 043 r h 0 347 w s 3 915 r 2 0 96 9 e t o 7 0 099 t max 0 038 r h 0 368 w s 3 491 r 2 0 95 10 e t o 8 0 077 t min 0 045 r h 0 238 w s 5 375 r 2 0 93 11 e t o 9 0 060 t min 0 047 r h 0 004 w s 5 287 r 2 0 82 12 e t o y e a r l y 0 082 t max 0 025 r h 0 217 w s 5 287 r 2 0 92 the statistical indices for the ols model ranged between 0 083 and 0 179 mm day 1 mae 0 112 and 0 228 mm day 1 rmse and 0 903 and 0 981 cc which indicated that the ols model was reliable in modelling the long term average annual eto and monthly eto models for estimating et0 for different months were specified which can be used to determine the globally controlling factors affecting et0 across continental china it can be concluded that for june july and the yearly model the most influential factors were wind speed maximum temperature and relative humidity in august and september the wind speed minimum temperature and relative humidity were most important based on the long term average annual et0 data the global least square regression results suggested that the maximum temperature humidity and wind speed were the controlling meteorological variables affecting the et0 in china to determine whether the residual of the ols model satisfied the spatial stationarity the koenker statistic koenker s studentized bruesch pagan statistic koenker 1981 was used the null hypothesis for the test was that the model was stationary in the study the koenker test significantly rejected the null hypothesis which indicated the existence of heteroscedasticity in addition the jarque bara statistic was applied to test the model bias the null hypothesis was that the residuals were normally distributed in this study the jarque bara statistic significantly rejected the null hypothesis indicating that the residual was not normally distributed therefore the statistical results showed that the ols model may not be able to model the global relationship in all regions of china this was because based on the assumption of the ols regression the relationship was constant for each weather station however the eto was affected by different parameters in different regions which may be caused by the spatial effect a local regression technique the geographic weighted regression model gwr can help overcome this problem by allowing the model parameters to vary across space fotheringham et al 2002 therefore the gwr model was applied to model the spatial relationship between the average annual eto and various climatic parameters settings of the gwr4 model was present in the appendix a the output from gwr4 software can be voluminous the main output from gwr4 is a set of local parameter estimates and model diagnostic information for each relation at each weather station due to the output volume of these local parameter estimates and their local standard errors as a convenient indication of the extent of the variability in the local parameter estimates a five number summary of the local parameter estimates was presented in table 3 coefficient of rh and ws for all weather stations were in the range of 0 39 to 0 13 and 0 02 to 0 37 which implied that rh and ws had slightly negative and positive relationship with et0 in china respectively the coefficients of tmax rh and ws 0 082 0 025 and 0 217 in ols model eq 12 fell into the range of results from gwr 0 04 0 89 0 39 0 13 and 0 17 0 41 in order to compare the performance of gwr and ols to model the et0 a comparative anova test of the gwr and ols models of the annual et0 in china was performed fotheringham et al 2002 erdoǧan 2010 the hypothesis for the anova is that the gwr analysis showed no improvement compared with the ols regression the f test value of 9 42 suggested that the gwr had a significant improvement over ols for modelling the et0 in china this indicated that the gwr model was more powerful in modelling the et0 in china fig 7 showed the spatial distribution for the relative contribution of meteorological variable in china by the gwr model fig 7a indicated the contribution of tmax ranged from 0 24 to 52 63 in different areas the high influences to et0 were found in nc cc ningxia and shaanxi province of nwc and eastern tibet of swc while a low contribution level was presented in sc and ec tmin held a large range of 0 09 to 58 05 presenting a high level of contribution in sc ec and nec and insignificantly contributing in huang huai hai plain of nc and tibetan plateau of swc fig 7b rh with a contribution range of 11 50 31 75 significantly impacted nc cc ec liaoning regions of nec and shigatse regions of swc while with only slight contributions in sichuan region xinjiang uyghur autonomous region and most parts of nwc fig 7c sh exerted more influence on et0 in nec sc and ec than nwc with contribution ranging from 0 19 33 56 fig 7d fig 7e indicated that the contribution of ws ranged from 1 59 to 29 93 in different areas the high influences to et0 were found in yungui plateau xinjiang uyghur autonomous region and liaoning region while a low contribution level was presented in ec and sc fig 7f presented the dominant climatic variable of each weather station tmax dominated nwc nc nec swc and northern part of ec tmin controlled cc southern part of ec and eastern part of sc western part of sc and eastern part of swc were dominated by sh which was consistent with the results of fig 6 dominate factors including ws and rh were found in nwc and cc and did not significantly control any regions thomas 2000 indicated that maximum temperature was the primary factor in nec which was in agreement with this study fan and thomas 2013 indicated that sunshine duration exerted the greatest impact on et0 in yunnan province corresponding to eastern part of swc which was aligned with this study li et al 2017 revealed increase of maximum temperature was the major driving force in the increase of et0 in loess plateau of northern shaanxi corresponding to eastern region of nwc which developed highly consistent results to this study according to the study of shan et al 2015 wind speed was the most dominant factor affecting et0 in the beijing tianjin sand source control project region corresponding to the nc which was slightly different with this study this study was also slightly different from the research of gao et al 2017 which revealed that solar radiation was the most dominant factor influencing et0 in west liao river basin corresponding to nec the differences may be due to the varying data sources time series and calculating methods for example in many studies the contribution was often obtained based on the long term climatic data of a certain weather station using stepwise regression method without considering the neighboring environmental factors based on the results of gwr it may be concluded that tmax and tmin were the most influencing climatic variables affecting et0 in china after all a synthesis process of the climatic variables results in the trend of et0 in this study increase of temperature and decline of relative humidity offset the effect of decreasing sunshine hours and wind speed resulting in increasing trend of et0 4 conclusion this study deployed various modelling techniques to spatially analyze et0 over china with the hot spot analysis we found statistical significant with spatial clusters of high and low et0 in china over the period of 1970 2014 in addition the global controlling climatic factors affecting et0 and spatially varying relationship between et0 and climatic factors across continental china were explored using ordinary least square regression ols and geographic weighted regression model gwr respectively the results of hot spot analysis suggested that statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low et0 in china remained relatively steady between years from 1970 to 2014 while exhibited a periodical migration during years furthermore ols suggested that over china the maximum temperature humidity and wind speed were the major climatic variables affecting et0 based on the results of gwr it may be concluded that tmax and tmin were the most influencing climatic variables affecting et0 in china after all a synthesis process of the climatic variables results in the trend of et0 in the study an increase of temperature and decline of relative humidity offset the effect of decreasing sunshine hours and wind speed resulting in increasing trend of et0 finally the results of this study can help policy makers and water planners develop a better understanding of spatiotemporal distribution of et0 and help optimize water allocation and management acknowledgment this work was financially

11196,reference evapotranspiration eto is a key component of the hydrological cycle and it plays a vital role in agricultural forest and environmental management this study assesses the capability of hot spot geospatial analysis to determine statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low eto in china over the period of 1970 2014 based on the daily data from 598 weather stations the global controlling factors affecting eto across continental china are investigated using global ordinary least square regression ols model the spatial relationship between eto and climatic variables is explored using local geographic weighted regression gwr model it was found that for china as a whole eto decreased significantly from 1970 to 1993 at a rate of 14 91 mm decade 1 while the trend began increasing by 16 50 mm decade 1 from 1993 to 2014 the hot spot analysis showed that the regional distribution of statistically significant spatial eto clusters remained relatively steady between years from 1970 to 2014 hot regions were identified with high values of annual total eto in north china nc south china sc and the turpan depression of northwest china nwc the cold regions were highly clustered in most parts of northeast china nec and the borders between nwc central china cc and southwest china swc it was also found that statistically significant clusters of hot and cold spots exhibited a migration trend between months the results of the ols analysis suggested that over china the maximum temperature relative humidity and wind speed were the controlling meteorological variables affecting eto based on the results of gwr maximum and minimum temperature were the most influencing climatic variables affecting et0 over china gwr was found to be a more powerful method than ols for modelling eto in china results of this study can be used to help end users planners and policy makers to anticipate their decision making which in turn will improve regional water management in china keywords reference evapotranspiration spatiotemporal variability hot spot analysis ordinary least square regression geographic weighted regression china 1 introduction reference evapotranspiration et0 is a key element to calculate the actual crop evapotranspiration and agricultural water use information about spatial and temporal distribution of the et0 is an essential need to improve the regional water resources management and allocation to crops and municipalities in china et0 is the main driven parameter of crops water balance therefore its spatial and temporal information can assist growers in their irrigation scheduling for maximizing yield changes in temperature precipitation runoff and soil moisture patterns caused by climate change have been reported in a number of previous studies groisman et al 1999 ziegler et al 2003 gao et al 2006 zhang et al 2009 cai et al 2011 ye et al 2014 contrary to the expectation that eto would increase over time both the observed pan evapotranspiration and computed reference evapotranspiration values have decreased in many regions including the united states russia peterson et al 1995 golubev et al 2001 china gong et al 2006 shan et al 2015 feng et al 2017 gao et al 2017 italy moonen et al 2002 australia donohue et al 2010 and japan asanuma and kamimera 2004 the disparity between expectations and observations is known as the evaporation paradox coined by brutsaert and parlange 1998 however since the 1990s studies have reported increasing trends in china zuo et al 2012 iran shadmani et al 2012 tabari et al 2012 and india goyal 2004 therefore a systemic evaluation of the spatial and temporal variability of eto in china is necessary spatial analytical methods and geographic information systems gis are widely used in hydrological research to overcome the limited number and distribution of weather stations many studies have used interpolation methods to describe the spatial distribution of eto these methods include the inverse distance weighted idw method shepard 1968 franke 1982 cornejo 2003 xu et al 2006 li et al 2012 yang et al 2013 fathian and aliyari 2016 lv et al 2016 splines sharma and irmak 2012 sharma et al 2013 and universal kriging basistha et al 2008 thomas 2000 evaluated the spatial and temporal distribution of eto in china using 65 weather stations and it was found that sunshine duration was the most important factor affecting potential evapotranspiration followed by the relative humidity and maximum temperature wang et al 2017 assessed the spatiotemporal variability of eto in china finding that the annual eto decreased over time and was most influenced by wind speed followed by minimum temperature sunshine duration relative humidity and maximum temperature zhang et al 2013 argued that the most influential variable on eto in china is vapor pressure followed by solar radiation air temperature and wind speed similar work has been conducted to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of eto in china cong and yang 2008 gao et al 2006 liu et al 2004 yin et al 2010 traditionally interpolation methods were applied to describe the spatial distribution of et0 the interpolation maps can identify the location of the et0 cluster but cannot determine whether the cluster is statistically significant or not in addition few studies have been performed regarding the spatial clusters of statistically significant high and low values of eto in china and trends of these spatial clusters remain unclear therefore to capture such information the hot spot analysis was used in this study the hot spot analysis also known as getis ord statistic getis and ord 1992 1996 mitchell 2005 ord and getis 1995 peeters et al 2015 is a method for assessing the location related tendency clustering in the attribution of spatial data points or areas by assessing each feature within the context of neighboring features and features in the whole dataset hot spot analysis can be used to detect locations of statistically significant high and low value clusters of a specific phenomenon hot spot analysis has been widely applied in criminal research craglia et al 2000 ceccato and dolmen 2011 food availability leslie et al 2012 incident management analysis songchitruksa and zeng 2010 heat vulnerability monitoring wolf and mcgregor 2013 health care availability zhang et al 2012 disease propagation wang et al 2013 species distributions ma et al 2012 and fire monitoring gajovic and todorovic 2013 to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to assess the capability of hot spot analysis to determine statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low eto in china hot spot analysis can provide additional information regarding the variation of eto and offer more localized information significant research has been performed on the relationships between eto and various climatic parameters some studies attribution decreases in wind speed to a decreasing eto trend in australia roderick et al 2007 canada burn and hesch 2007 and in the yellow river basin of china wang et al 2012 other studies concluded that decreases in sunshine duration and solar radiation were mainly responsible for decreasing eto amounts in the unites states peterson et al 1995 west liao river basin gao et al 2017 poyang lake catchment ye et al 2014 and southwest china fan and thomas 2013 other studies concluded that the relative humidity was the dominant factor behind the eto decrease in northwest china huo et al 2013 and in the hai river basin of china zhao et al 2014 however investigations into the mapping of correlation coefficients between eto and different meteorological variables in china has not yet been performed global controlling climatic factors affecting eto across continental china are not available in the literature in addition the spatially varying relationship between eto and climatic variables in china are also scarcely reported the geospatial based method hot spot analysis spatial correlation coefficient mapping ordinary least square regression ols and geographic weighted regression gwr can be used to explore the statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low eto and account for possible spatial relationships between eto and climatic variables in china which may be ignored by the traditional methods in this study the et0 observed was calculated by penman monteith for the 598 weather stations then we used the obtained et0 values as target in ols and gwr to find the most important et0 drivers over the continental china ols was proposed because of its simplicity to map with fewer data and it helps to investigate the global controlling factors affecting et0 across continental china gwr was also introduced in the study as it can be used to explain the spatially varying relationship between et0 and meteorological variables in china in addition we used the hot spot analysis because it helps to assess its capability to determine the statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low et0 values over continental china which is very important for agriculture production and water resource planning the suggested methods in this study can help avoiding data missing gap across china and they are very easy to deploy by end users and water or irrigation professionals the objectives of this study were 1 to assess the capability of the relatively new geospatial methodology of hot spot analysis to detect statistically significant eto clusters within and between the years of 1970 2014 in china 2 to identify the global controlling climatic factors affecting eto across continental china using ols and 3 to explore and analyze the spatially varying relationship between eto and climatic variables in china using gwr 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area considering the convenience of policy implementation peng et al 2018 and the integrity of administrative area and the river basin this study divided china into seven regions based on the natural geographical division of luo 1954 as it was shown in fig 1 the seven regions include south china sc east china ec central china cc north china nc northwest china nwc southwest china swc and northeast china nec table 1 summarized the averaged climatic parameters of each region 2 2 data collection daily weather data from 598 weather stations were obtained from the china meteorological data sharing service system http data cma gov cn between 1970 and 2014 the data included daily values of maximum and minimum temperature relative humidity sunlight hours as well as wind speed at a height of 2 m height 2 3 data processing protocol and statistical analysis 2 3 1 eto calculation the fao penman monteith pm equation was used to calculate the daily eto from the data obtained from the weather stations in this study this equation has been widely used for determination of eto values allen et al 1998 the pm equation can be written as 1 e t 0 0 408 δ r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 0 34 u 2 where eto is the reference evapotranspiration in mm day 1 δ is the slope of the vapor pressure curve in kpa c 1 rn is the net radiation at the crop surface in mj m2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density in mj m2 day 1 which is considered as 0 allen et al 1998 γ is the psychrometric constant in kpa c 1 t is the mean air temperature which is determined from minimum and maximum temperatures in c u2 is the wind speed at a height of 2 m height in m s 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure in kpa and ea is the actual vapor pressure in kpa the average annual and seasonal eto values were determined by calculating daily values for each station spring was defined as march to may summer as june to august autumn as september to november and winter as december to february 2 3 2 trend analysis linear regression has been widely used in trend analysis wang et al 2012 fan and thomas 2013 vicente serrano et al 2014 ye et al 2014 and was used to determine overall trends in eto and other meteorological parameters the significance of the trends in eto was determined using the rank based nonparametric mann kendall mk test developed by mann 1945 and kendall 1975 the mk test is recommended by the world meteorological organization wmo for trend analysis in climate and hydrological research daughney and reeves 2006 modarres and de paulo rodrigues da silva 2007 wang et al 2012 zuo et al 2012 for china as a whole and on a regional scale the mean all china series linear trends were calculated from unweighted monthly and annual means of the corresponding stations 2 3 3 spatial distribution the inverse distance weighted interpolation method idw has been used extensively for spatial analysis of eto li et al 2012 lv et al 2016 and precipitation fathian and aliyari 2016 due to its high accuracy and simplicity bussières and hogg 1989 cornejo 2003 this study applied idw shepard 1968 for the interpolation of the point based eto data the long term average annual seasonal and monthly total of the eto were interpolated using arcgis 10 3 environmental systems research institute redlands usa 2 3 4 hot spot analysis in this study hot spot analysis was used to determine statistically significant spatial clusters of high hot spot and low values cold spot of eto getis and ord 1992 calculations for the hot spot analysis were performed using 2 g i j 1 n w i j x j x j 1 n w i j s n j 1 n w i j 2 j 1 n w i j 2 n 1 where g i statistic is calculated for the i th weather station standardized as a z score xj is the eto value of each neighbor wi j is the spatial weight for the target neighbor i and j pair n is the number of weather stations which is 598 in this study x is the average eto value of the 598 weather stations represented as x j 1 n x j n and s is the standard deviation given by s j 1 n x j 2 x 2 n gi statistic reports a z score and p value for each weather station a significant eto hot spot can be identified if a weather station has a high z score and small p value a significant eto cold spot can be detected if a weather station has a negative z score and a small p value the z score represents the statistical significance of the clustering eto distribution in different groups including hot cold and not significant spots the weights were automatically assigned based on the fixed distance band model which was recommended and default conceptualization of spatial relationships for the hot spot analysis each weather station was analyzed within the context of neighboring weather stations neighboring stations within the threshold distance received a weight of one and stations outside the critical distance received a weight of zero the hot spot analysis was performed using the arcgis 10 3 platform for the hot spot analysis of annual et0 gi was calculated in yearly scale for the hot spot analysis of the monthly et0 gi was calculated in monthly scale due to the fact that hot spot maps of et0 showed the weather stations with different conficent level gridding maps was also used for comparison with the hot spot maps in the study 2 3 5 modelling spatial relationships between eto and climatic variables pearson s correlation coefficient can be used to determine the degree to which a variable is linearly related to another in a correlation analysis vicente serrano et al 2014 pearson s correlation coefficient was used in the idw gridding maps to indicate the influence of the various climatic variables on the eto for each station ols regression can be applied to detect the global relationship between the environmental parameters and other observed factors sharma et al 2013 in this study ols regression was used to identify the global relationships between eto and the meteorological variables ols can be given as 3 y β o β 1 x 1 β 2 x 2 β 3 x 3 β n x n ε where y is the dependent variable eto β β1 β2 β3 and βn are the coefficients of the independent variables climatic parameters and geographic information and ε is the error term the annual average et0 and climatic variables of the 598 weather stations were used as input of ols the calculations were performed for the 598 weather stations in china at annual time scale in order to determine the best combination of meteorological parameters as input into ols an exploratory regression tool was used unlike the stepwise regression which only looks for high adjusted r square values adjusted r2 the exploratory regression tool has a series of threshold criteria such as the adjusted r2 coefficient p values variance inflation factor vif values corrected akaike information criterion aicc jarque bera p values and spatial autocorrelation p values in order to explore the spatially varying relationship between et0 and meteorological variables in china a semiparametric gaussian geographic weighted regression model sggwr was used in this study which can be expressed as 4 y i k β k u i v i x k i l γ l z l i ε i where x k i is the k th independent variable with the geographically varying coefficient β k u i v i at the i th weather station z l i is the l th independent variable with a globally fixed coefficient γ l εi is the gaussian error at the i th weather station this study used the microsoft windows based application software gwr4 to model the spatially varying relationship between eto and climatic parameters fotheringham et al 2002 nakaya et al 2005 2014 in order to compare the performance of gwr and ols to model the et0 a comparative anova test of the gwr and ols models of the annual et0 in china was performed fotheringham et al 2002 erdoǧan 2010 2 4 statistical performance indices the mean absolute error mae root mean square error rmse and correlation coefficient r were used to evaluate the performance of the ols and gwr models mae rmse and r are commonly used for model evaluation in eto studies li et al 2014 luo et al 2014 lorite et al 2015 traore et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 the statistical index formulas may be written as follows 5 m a e i 1 n x i y i n 6 r m s e i 1 n x i y i 2 n 7 r i 1 n x i x y i y i 1 n x i x 2 i 1 n y i y 2 where xi and yi represent the estimated and observed eto respectively at the i th weather station x and y are the average values of estimated and observed eto respectively and n is the number of weather stations which in this study was 598 3 results and discussion 3 1 spatiotemporal variability of eto and related meteorological variables 3 1 1 spatial variability of the average annual total eto and related meteorological variables fig 2 showed the spatial distribution of the long term 45 year average annual total reference evapotranspiration and related climatic parameters for 1970 2014 in china fig 2a presented the long term average annual total eto peaked in nc sc and the turpan depression of nwc which ranged from 1200 to 1896 mm year 1 low values of long term average annual total eto was found in nec and the borders between nwc cc and swc ranging from 567 to 800 mm year 1 this agreed with the study of gao et al 2017 which found that the multi year average annual total eto varied from 874 to 1014 mm in the west liao riven basin of china shan et al 2015 also determined that the mean annual total eto ranged from 698 1 to 1419 6 mm in the beijing tianjin sand source control project region of china which was comparable with the values determined in this study from high to low value the long term average annual daily maximum and minimum temperatures and relative humidity showed a south north gradient fig 2b 2c and 2d the long term average annual total sunshine duration revealed a clear decreasing trend from nwc to ec fig 2e the long term average annual daily wind speed was also higher in the northern region than in the southern region of china except in certain parts of nwc and nec where low values were found fig 2f fig 2g presented the spatial distribution of percentage error between et0 values by idw gridding map and et0 by pm method the percentage error of most weather stations was in the range of 1 7 to 2 0 except some in the range of 2 0 to 4 4 et0 values of the 7 regions were overestimated by idw except nc 0 01 in addition percentage error was highest in the nwc while lowest in nc the regions which had many gauges were more reliable than the regions that had very few observations gauge fig 2h indicated the range of average daily et0 value for each weather station it was in the range of 0 28 to 2 44 mm day 1 which was higher in the nwc and nc than in the swc and nec 3 1 2 temporal variability of the average annual total eto fig 3 a i showed the long term average annual total eto in the 7 sub regions of china from 1970 to 2014 the overall trend from 1970 to 2014 increased slightly over time with a slope of 1 96 mm decade 1 which agreed well with table 2 the long term average annual total eto values of the 7 regions showed an increasing trend except in nec and nc sc and ec presented a statistically significant increasing trend p 0 05 with slopes of 7 31 and 5 97 mm decade 1 respectively the annual total eto in nec and nc showed an insignificant decrease over time with slope of 6 67 and 1 45 mm decade 1 respectively fig 3j presented the spatial distribution of et0 trend for the 598 weather stations in china negative et0 trend was mainly distributed in nec nc xinjiang uyghur autonomous region huang huai hai plain and yungui plateau 1 03 0 mm day 1 while positive et0 trend was mainly distributed in sc ec and tibet autonomous region 0 2 17 mm day 1 previous studies have found similar trends consistent with the results of this study goyal 2004 kousari and ahani 2012 shadmani et al 2012 tabari et al 2012 zuo et al 2012 found that the annual total eto in most parts of wei river basin of china exhibited an increasing trend and the eto increased greatly after an abrupt change in 1993 according to zhang et al 2013 the annual total eto of china decreased from 1960 to 1992 but then increased significantly after the inflection point in 1993 however there are other studies that report a decreasing eto trend wang et al 2012 2017 these results are inconsistent with the results in this study which is likely caused by regional and time scale differences the positive trend of the eto in parts of china found in this study was mostly due to the increase of temperature which is consistent with the reports by zhang et al 2013 and goyal 2004 increased wind speed was also responsible for the increasing eto trend this was also reported by tabari et al 2012 and kousari and ahani 2012 as they determined that the wind speed was a major factor influencing the eto in iran according to abtew et al 2011 declining humidity and increasing vapor pressure deficit were the main causes of the increase of evaporation and evapotranspiration in florida from 1992 to 2009 zuo et al 2012 documented the importance of relative humidity and determined that it was one of the most important factors behind the increase of eto in wei river basin of china fig 3a showed that the annual total eto in china had a significant decreasing trend from 1970 to 1993 at a rate of 14 91 mm decade 1 which then increased at a rate of 16 50 mm decade 1 after 1993 which was comparable with zhang et al 2013 and li et al 2014 table 2 showed that the eto trend in ec cc nc nwc and swc also decreased from 1970 to 1992 then increased from 1993 to 2014 however nec witnessed a decrease for both periods while an increasing trend was observed in sc to investigate the temporal trend of the annual total eto between decades in china the overall time course was divided into 4 periods 1970 1980 1970s 1981 1990 1980s 1991 2000 1990s and 2001 2014 2000s as can be seen from table 2 the annual total eto in china showed a decreasing trend in the 1980s and 2000s and an increasing trend in the 1970s and the 1990s sc and swc witnessed an increasing eto trend in the first 3 decades and then decreased in 2000s the annual total eto in nwc decreased in the 1970s and 1980s and increased in the 1990s and 2000s resulting in an overall increasing trend from 1970 to 2014 3 2 hot spot analysis fig 4 showed the gridding maps of the average annual total eto for 1970 1980 1981 1990 1991 2000 2001 2014 and 1970 2014 during the last four decades the spatial distribution of the average annual total eto in china showed few changes the 2000s had the highest annual total eto ranging from 576 to 2365 mm year 1 which may have been caused by the sharp increase in annual total eto after 1993 the spatial distribution of the annual total eto in the 4 decades agreed well with distribution of the average annual total eto of 1970 2014 which was explained in section 3 1 1 the results of the idw analysis can identify the location of the eto cluster but cannot determine whether it is statistically significant the hot spot analysis of the annual eto was obtained using the arcgis 10 3 interface by applying getis ord statistics hot spot maps of the annual total eto in china over time were also shown in fig 4 it showed that statistically significant clusters of hot and cold spots remained relatively fixed between years from 1970 to 2014 the hot regions were highly clustered in nc sc and the turpan depression of nwc which indicates that a high value of annual total eto were likely to appear in these areas cold regions were found with low values of annual total eto in most parts of nec and at the border between nwc cc and swc it was found that hot regions and cold regions were in good agreement with areas of high and low et0 values by the idw gridding maps since the hot spot map of the annual total eto remained relatively steady over the past 45 years attention should be paid to the intra year spatial distribution by applying getis ord statistics hot spot maps of the long term average monthly total eto were obtained for each month fig 5 it was found that statistically significant clusters of hot and cold spots exhibited a migration trend between months from december to march the hot spots were mainly distributed in sc and swc where the annual total eto was relatively high cold spots were mainly found north of 40 n where the annual total eto was relatively low april was a transition period and after april the hot spots moved northward while the cold spots moved southward in the months of may and june hot clusters of monthly total eto were found in nwc and nc while cold spots were found in ec sc and swc not statistically significant spots were distributed between the hot and cold spots mainly in nec and near the latitude of 64 n from july to september the not statistically significant spots in nec turned to cold spots meanwhile the cold spots in ec and sc became hot spots and the cold spots in swc and cc became not statistically significant spots hot regions were more likely to become areas with high et0 values which was more prone to water shortage and drought for areas where irrigation is needed in hot regions more water would be required during dry season as well as drought resistant crops and planting dates planning could be an effective water management strategy the spatial distribution of hot spot can be used as an important source of information for end users planners and policy makers 3 3 spatial sensitivity analysis to explore possible mechanisms behind the appearance of hot spots in the analysis map pearson s correlation coefficients ordinary least square regressions and global weighted regressions were applied for the climatic parameters pearson s correlation coefficients were calculated at each weather station to provide an indication of relationships between the eto distribution and climatic parameters then gridding maps were obtained using the idw method fig 6 showed the spatial distribution of the correlation coefficients between eto and the various climate factors fig 6a presented the correlation coefficient between eto and maximum temperature which ranged from 0 33 to 0 93 the high value appeared in nwc while low values were observed in swc sc as well as some parts of ec and cc fig 6b showed that the correlation coefficient between eto and the minimum temperature which ranged from 0 26 to 0 91 decreasing from north to south it was found that minimum temperature showed a high coefficient in nec while a low coefficient was found in swc sunshine hours which had a large range from 0 11 to 0 90 exerted more influence in sc compared to swc fig 6c fig 6d indicated that the relative humidity had a close relationship with eto in sc and the northern part of nwc with a correlation coefficient of 0 85 in the middle of swc and the eastern part of nwc the relative humidity and eto had a slightly positive relationship fig 6e showed that the correlation coefficient between the wind speed and eto ranged from 0 29 to 0 67 which exerted more influence in nwc as suggested by allen et al 1998 eto was influenced by a combination of climatic parameters therefore the spatial relationship between eto and various climatic parameters as well as altitude in china was assessed with the ols model the ols regression was performed on the long term average annual eto and on the monthly eto from june to september when high eto values were often observed models for june july august september and the yearly model can be shown as 8 e t o 6 0 092 t max 0 043 r h 0 347 w s 3 915 r 2 0 96 9 e t o 7 0 099 t max 0 038 r h 0 368 w s 3 491 r 2 0 95 10 e t o 8 0 077 t min 0 045 r h 0 238 w s 5 375 r 2 0 93 11 e t o 9 0 060 t min 0 047 r h 0 004 w s 5 287 r 2 0 82 12 e t o y e a r l y 0 082 t max 0 025 r h 0 217 w s 5 287 r 2 0 92 the statistical indices for the ols model ranged between 0 083 and 0 179 mm day 1 mae 0 112 and 0 228 mm day 1 rmse and 0 903 and 0 981 cc which indicated that the ols model was reliable in modelling the long term average annual eto and monthly eto models for estimating et0 for different months were specified which can be used to determine the globally controlling factors affecting et0 across continental china it can be concluded that for june july and the yearly model the most influential factors were wind speed maximum temperature and relative humidity in august and september the wind speed minimum temperature and relative humidity were most important based on the long term average annual et0 data the global least square regression results suggested that the maximum temperature humidity and wind speed were the controlling meteorological variables affecting the et0 in china to determine whether the residual of the ols model satisfied the spatial stationarity the koenker statistic koenker s studentized bruesch pagan statistic koenker 1981 was used the null hypothesis for the test was that the model was stationary in the study the koenker test significantly rejected the null hypothesis which indicated the existence of heteroscedasticity in addition the jarque bara statistic was applied to test the model bias the null hypothesis was that the residuals were normally distributed in this study the jarque bara statistic significantly rejected the null hypothesis indicating that the residual was not normally distributed therefore the statistical results showed that the ols model may not be able to model the global relationship in all regions of china this was because based on the assumption of the ols regression the relationship was constant for each weather station however the eto was affected by different parameters in different regions which may be caused by the spatial effect a local regression technique the geographic weighted regression model gwr can help overcome this problem by allowing the model parameters to vary across space fotheringham et al 2002 therefore the gwr model was applied to model the spatial relationship between the average annual eto and various climatic parameters settings of the gwr4 model was present in the appendix a the output from gwr4 software can be voluminous the main output from gwr4 is a set of local parameter estimates and model diagnostic information for each relation at each weather station due to the output volume of these local parameter estimates and their local standard errors as a convenient indication of the extent of the variability in the local parameter estimates a five number summary of the local parameter estimates was presented in table 3 coefficient of rh and ws for all weather stations were in the range of 0 39 to 0 13 and 0 02 to 0 37 which implied that rh and ws had slightly negative and positive relationship with et0 in china respectively the coefficients of tmax rh and ws 0 082 0 025 and 0 217 in ols model eq 12 fell into the range of results from gwr 0 04 0 89 0 39 0 13 and 0 17 0 41 in order to compare the performance of gwr and ols to model the et0 a comparative anova test of the gwr and ols models of the annual et0 in china was performed fotheringham et al 2002 erdoǧan 2010 the hypothesis for the anova is that the gwr analysis showed no improvement compared with the ols regression the f test value of 9 42 suggested that the gwr had a significant improvement over ols for modelling the et0 in china this indicated that the gwr model was more powerful in modelling the et0 in china fig 7 showed the spatial distribution for the relative contribution of meteorological variable in china by the gwr model fig 7a indicated the contribution of tmax ranged from 0 24 to 52 63 in different areas the high influences to et0 were found in nc cc ningxia and shaanxi province of nwc and eastern tibet of swc while a low contribution level was presented in sc and ec tmin held a large range of 0 09 to 58 05 presenting a high level of contribution in sc ec and nec and insignificantly contributing in huang huai hai plain of nc and tibetan plateau of swc fig 7b rh with a contribution range of 11 50 31 75 significantly impacted nc cc ec liaoning regions of nec and shigatse regions of swc while with only slight contributions in sichuan region xinjiang uyghur autonomous region and most parts of nwc fig 7c sh exerted more influence on et0 in nec sc and ec than nwc with contribution ranging from 0 19 33 56 fig 7d fig 7e indicated that the contribution of ws ranged from 1 59 to 29 93 in different areas the high influences to et0 were found in yungui plateau xinjiang uyghur autonomous region and liaoning region while a low contribution level was presented in ec and sc fig 7f presented the dominant climatic variable of each weather station tmax dominated nwc nc nec swc and northern part of ec tmin controlled cc southern part of ec and eastern part of sc western part of sc and eastern part of swc were dominated by sh which was consistent with the results of fig 6 dominate factors including ws and rh were found in nwc and cc and did not significantly control any regions thomas 2000 indicated that maximum temperature was the primary factor in nec which was in agreement with this study fan and thomas 2013 indicated that sunshine duration exerted the greatest impact on et0 in yunnan province corresponding to eastern part of swc which was aligned with this study li et al 2017 revealed increase of maximum temperature was the major driving force in the increase of et0 in loess plateau of northern shaanxi corresponding to eastern region of nwc which developed highly consistent results to this study according to the study of shan et al 2015 wind speed was the most dominant factor affecting et0 in the beijing tianjin sand source control project region corresponding to the nc which was slightly different with this study this study was also slightly different from the research of gao et al 2017 which revealed that solar radiation was the most dominant factor influencing et0 in west liao river basin corresponding to nec the differences may be due to the varying data sources time series and calculating methods for example in many studies the contribution was often obtained based on the long term climatic data of a certain weather station using stepwise regression method without considering the neighboring environmental factors based on the results of gwr it may be concluded that tmax and tmin were the most influencing climatic variables affecting et0 in china after all a synthesis process of the climatic variables results in the trend of et0 in this study increase of temperature and decline of relative humidity offset the effect of decreasing sunshine hours and wind speed resulting in increasing trend of et0 4 conclusion this study deployed various modelling techniques to spatially analyze et0 over china with the hot spot analysis we found statistical significant with spatial clusters of high and low et0 in china over the period of 1970 2014 in addition the global controlling climatic factors affecting et0 and spatially varying relationship between et0 and climatic factors across continental china were explored using ordinary least square regression ols and geographic weighted regression model gwr respectively the results of hot spot analysis suggested that statistically significant spatial clusters of high and low et0 in china remained relatively steady between years from 1970 to 2014 while exhibited a periodical migration during years furthermore ols suggested that over china the maximum temperature humidity and wind speed were the major climatic variables affecting et0 based on the results of gwr it may be concluded that tmax and tmin were the most influencing climatic variables affecting et0 in china after all a synthesis process of the climatic variables results in the trend of et0 in the study an increase of temperature and decline of relative humidity offset the effect of decreasing sunshine hours and wind speed resulting in increasing trend of et0 finally the results of this study can help policy makers and water planners develop a better understanding of spatiotemporal distribution of et0 and help optimize water allocation and management acknowledgment this work was financially

11197,the application of water footprint accounting is mostly done at large scales but the estimation of crop and region specific water footprints for up scaling is dependent on accurate and representative in field measurements of evapotranspiration et yield and irrigation in a field trial we assessed the influence of maize zea mays l et estimates using soil water balance accounting remote sensing with satellite imagery sebal model eddy covariance measurements and three crop models swb cropwat sapwat on water footprint estimates we simultaneously assessed the influence of yield spatial variability as measured by a precision harvester seasonal et estimations differed by as much as 15 for the different methods and yield differed by as much as 42 representing the error which can be introduced as a result of point measurements using a combination of the highest lowest et estimates and the 5th 95th percentile yield water footprint values differed by as much as 100 ranging from 338 680 m3 t 1 applying spatially linked sebal et estimates and precision harvester yield at the 30 30 m scale reduced the range of estimated water footprints to 493 663 m3 t 1 with an average of 547 m3 t 1 this was 15 higher than the water footprint estimated using average sebal et and average yield for the whole pivot 467 m3 t 1 any error introduced at this stage of water footprint accounting can be transferred during up scaling of the results for example based on the minimum and maximum estimated water footprints maize production was expected to consume between 4 4 and 8 3 respectively of the orange river south africa s largest river flow during the season in that region biophysical scientists have the role of providing high quality data for accurate water consumption estimates thereafter their application by various stakeholders should be done with caution keywords crop modelling eddy covariance cropwat remote sensing sebal 1 introduction irrigation is reported to consume 60 70 of freshwater withdrawals globally assouline et al 2015 and increasing demand for water is placing pressure on irrigation to become more efficient water footprint accounting has been identified as a means to improve the management of our water resources but is still undergoing a phase of refinement before the full potential application of water footprint accounting can be understood as agriculture is estimated to be responsible for over 90 of humanity s water footprint aldaya et al 2012 attention has largely focused on this sector blue water refers to surface and belowground water available to multiple users green water is water originating from rainfall that is stored in the soil and available for vegetation growth only aldaya et al 2012 recently the iso 14046 standard on water footprinting was released which does not make use of the concept of green water conceptualizing that green water consumption is linked to land use and natural vegetation uses water anyway water footprint accounting especially according to the water footprint network wfn approach has been criticized primarily because it only considers consumption and does not adequately place the impact on water resources in a local context pfister et al 2011 ridoutt and pfister 2010 wichelns 2010 provision to do so has been addressed through a sustainability impact assessment step in the case of the wfn approach aldaya et al 2012 and through the use of a water stress index in the case of the life cycle assessment approach pfister et al 2009 disagreements on the calculation and application of water footprints remain especially on how to quantify and represent local impact hoekstra 2016 accurate water footprint estimates are dependent on accurate estimates of crop evapotranspiration et volume of irrigation applied and yield attained numerous methods are available to measure or estimate crop et these include physical plot to field scale methods for example weighing lysimeters eddy covariance bowen ratio surface renewal scintillometry and soil water balance accounting as well as crop models for example the cropwat swb and sapwat models which are described later most of these methods typically have the limitation that they cannot fully capture spatial variation of crop water use across and between agricultural fields advances in recent years in the use of remote sensing information makes it now possible to assess crop water use and biomass production spatially for a pixel 30 1000 m of a satellite image of a specific irrigated area the sebal model bastiaanssen et al 2005 for example has been applied operationally for field scale agricultural water management and has been evaluated extensively across the globe in addition to uncertainties with et exact crop yields are sometimes not known and can vary significantly within a field as influenced by factors such as soil fertility gradients non uniform irrigation applications patchy pest and disease outbreaks water logging and other factors farmers also often do not know the exact irrigation volume applied to their fields and differences in uniformity of application can result in some areas of a field receiving more than others further adding to the complexity of estimating blue water consumption similarly linked to irrigation and yield estimates farmers may not know the precise size of their fields potentially introducing more error into these estimates globally maize zea mays l together with wheat triticum aestivum l and rice oryza sativa l provide at least 30 of food calories to more than 4 5 billion people in developing countries shiferaw et al 2011 the global area planted to maize is about 150 million ha and the versatility of this crop allows it to be grown at a wide range of altitudes and latitudes temperature ranges and on many different soils shiferaw et al 2011 maize is the staple diet of many south africans and is produced in each of the country s nine provinces according to grain sa 2013 the estimated area under maize in 2012 2013 was 2 8 million ha with 8 7 242 500 ha of the area under irrigation and the rest under dryland production the average maize yield under irrigation is 10 1 t ha 1 and 3 5 t ha 1 under dryland conditions even though irrigated maize only covers a small area it contributes an estimated 21 5 of the total maize production of south africa approximately 9000 commercial famers produce maize in south africa providing employment to an estimated 128 000 people www daff gov za innopac up ac za docs factsheet maize htm accessed 26 march 2014 if water footprint accounting is to be used effectively in water resources management and conservation it is important to understand how quantitative this approach is and whether it is accurate enough when conducting water footprint assessments different levels of information can be available with which to do the calculations mostly dependent on past research that has been done in a specific region for a specific crop and yield data which can be collected by various agencies such as government institutions co operatives and research and non governmental organisations in this study we compare water footprint estimations for maize acquired using different methods or models to estimate et including remote sensing sebal model the soil water balance equation eddy covariance and crop modelling swb cropwat and sapwat models the influence of the spatial variability of grain yield is also investigated by combining these et estimates with precision harvester grain yield measurements 5th 25th 50th 75th 95th percentiles for the field studied as well as applying remote sensing with satellite imagery to estimate water footprints using spatially linked et and yield it is envisaged that improved understanding on the sensitivity of water footprint accounting to input data can better inform the application of this type of information 2 material and methods 2 1 study location the study site was located near the town of douglas 29 6 0 s 23 44 0 e 1029 masl in the northern cape province of south africa although this province only has an estimated 51 500 ha under irrigated maize 1 85 of south africa s total for irrigated and dryland maize it produced an estimated 651 650 t or 5 7 of south arica s maize in 2013 douglas has a semi arid climate and the region receives an average annual rainfall of approximately 339 mm and average mid day temperatures of 18 4 c apart from the areas under irrigation land is sparsely cultivated and covered with closed to open grassland centre pivot irrigation systems are used almost exclusively to irrigate crops and the water allocation for irrigation is typically in the order of 1000 1100 mm yr 1 2 2 field trial while remote sensing data was acquired for a 60 60 km area a single field under pivot irrigation was studied in great detail maize cv p1184br short season cultivar was planted on 5 december 2012 and monitored between november 2012 and may 2013 for crop model parameterisation purposes soil samples were taken for particle size analysis according to the hydrometer method and bulk density was determined by oven drying soil cores of known volume then dividing the oven dry mass by the volume of the soil samples were taken in close proximity to a neutron water meter nwm monitoring point with an aluminium access tube installed to a depth of 1 2 m using a soil auger soil water content swc was measured at 0 1 m increments at weekly intervals to a depth of 1 2 m leaf area index lai was measured non destructively with a ceptometer accupar lp 80 decagon pullman washington fractional interception fi of photosynthetically active radiation par was determined by comparing above and below canopy par measured with the ceptometer canopy cover cc was calculated from fi by multiplying it by 100 to get a percentage canopy cover data was used to calibrate the swb model described below and for comparison with sebal also described below estimates weather data was obtained from the nearest weather station douglas dehoek to the field studied and irrigation was recorded using a manual rain gauge installed in the field unfortunately irrigation data from the rain gauge was judged to be unreliable after a certain point in time because the maize canopy grew above the gauge from this point irrigation and rainfall i r were estimated by back calculating a cumulative weekly value using real time reference evapotranspiration eto a crop factor kc obtained from the local co operative gwk and the nwm soil water content swc data daily eto was multiplied by the relevant crop specific kc to give an estimation of weekly crop evapotranspiration et for the rest of the growing season the change in swc or δs was determined by subtracting each week s swc reading from the swc of the previous week the input of water i r into the soil profile was then estimated by adding subtracting δs to from estimated et irrigation was determined by subtracting rainfall obtained from weather station from i r the derived i r values were compared to measured rain gauge data from before the maize canopy grew above the gauges and a strong correlation was found r2 0 91 for the comparison between the rain gauge measurements and the derived i r value irrigation was estimated to be 646 mm and this value was used in all the water footprint calculations 2 3 estimation of evapotranspiration 2 3 1 eddy covariance a one sensor eddy covariance system with a csat 3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific usa was installed in the maize field in december 2012 at the time of planting and removed shortly before the maize was harvested in may 2013 the eddy covariance method estimates the sensible heat flux density and combining this with measured net radiation and estimated soil heat flux latent energy and therefore et is estimated as the residual of the energy balance equation savage et al 2010 the eddy covariance system has been widely applied in south africa clulow et al 2012 jarmain et al 2009 savage et al 2010 2 3 2 crop modelling the soil water balance swb model the soil water balance swb model is a mechanistic real time generic crop growth soil water balance and irrigation scheduling model annandale et al 2011 swb was developed based on the newswb model from campbell and diaz 1988 reference daily evapotranspiration eto is estimated using the penman monteith equation according to fao irrigation and drainage series no 56 recommendations allen et al 1998 dry matter production is simulated mechanistically by calculating a daily dry matter increment which is limited by either radiation or water availability phenological development growth and yield of a crop from planting to maturity are mechanistically estimated based on soil water status and environmental conditions water limited growth is estimated using parameters that directly limit biomass accumulation including a crop water stress index annandale et al 2000 the big advantage of this approach over crop factor based approaches to water balance modelling is the feedback between soil water availability and the growth and development of the crop canopy the use of thermal time in swb avoids the need to use different crop factors to express crop development for different planting dates and regions annandale et al 2011 a cascading also called tipping bucket approach was used to simulate water movement and storage within the soil profile an swb simulation for the maize crop was parameterized and calibrated based on data collected from the field trial described above crop parameters used are presented in table 1 the cropwat and sapwat models cropwat was developed by the united nation s food and agricultural organisation fao smith 1992 and has commonly been used in water footprint studies mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 zhuo et al 2016 estimates of crop water and irrigation requirements can be made based on soil climate crop and irrigation management data and calculations are based on fao irrigation and drainage series no 56 allen et al 1998 and series no 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 monthly average data to run the model was obtained from the climwat 2 0 model muñoz and grieser 2006 the nearest climwat database weather station to the study site was identified as postmasburg 28 18 36 s 23 3 35 999 e 1300 masl approximately 100 km away and this data was downloaded and used to run cropwat 8 0 standard database factors were used for a maize crop and loam soil together with the actual planting date the sapwat computer program is a south african irrigation planning and management tool and is a further development of cropwat like cropwat it is not a crop growth model and does not provide real time scheduling advice rather it was developed to establish a decision making procedure for the estimation of crop irrigation requirements by irrigation engineers planners and agriculturalists van heerden et al 2008 building on cropwat work has been done to include more locally relevant input parameters and weather data for south africa monthly average weather data is processed to obtain daily weather data for a specific day of year which is used to run the daily model time step the cropwat and sapwat simulations were set up based on site specific information as indicated in tables 2 and 3 default values were left unchanged 2 3 3 sebal remote sensing evapotranspiration estimates the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 2005 model was used to estimate maize et from satellite imagery and automatic weather station data spatial modelling for the maize production area was done for an area roughly covering 60 km 60 km and a combination of disaster management constellation dmc and visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs data was used dmc captured data in the visible green red and near infrared ranges since land surface thermal data is not captured by dmc this was taken from the viirs sensor dmc data was captured roughly bi weekly and one viirs image per week was downloaded in total 21 dmc and 35 viirs images were used in the spatial modelling from 1 october 2012 to 31 may 2013 the images used are listed injarmain et al 2009 a digital elevation map dem for the douglas study area was taken from shuttle radar topography mission srtm the local co operative gwk made a shape file available outlining all the irrigation pivots of the douglas area and containing information on the crop type for each pivot this shapefile was used to extract data from the irrigated areas meteolook voogt 2006 was used to spatially extrapolate data from south africa s agricultural research council arc dehoek meteorological station 29 6 0 s 23 38 60 e in douglas weather data obtained included hourly daily and weekly data for relative humidity wind speed temperature and solar radiation 2 4 water footprint calculation to estimate the water footprint of the maize crop seasonal et estimates from sebal and crop modelling using swb cropwat and sapwat and precision harvester grain yields 5th 25th 50th 75th 95th percentiles mean were firstly used due to missing data at the beginning and or end of the season total seasonal et estimates were not available for the eddy covariance and soil water balance accounting methods the blue water footprint was calculated using eq 1 1 b l u e w a t e r f o o t p r int minimum t o t a l n e t i r r i g a t i o n actual irrigation r e q u i r e m e n t crop yield the irrigation schedule was determined by the commercial farmer based on weekly soil water content measurements so the total irrigation amount of 646 mm was assumed to represent the numerator in the blue water footprint calculation the green water footprint was calculated as crop et minus the blue water use numerator in blue water footprint calculation divided by yield eq 2 hoekstra et al 2011 2 green waterfootprint crop et blue wateruse crop yield yield distribution for the field as measured by the precision harvester is shown in fig 1 percentile values were calculated from these data to represent the potential error that can be introduced by researchers making point measurements of yield within the field and then extrapolating to the field scale a maximum water footprint representing the most unrepresentatively high value that could still be estimated from site specific data was calculated using the highest yield value and lowest et estimate and in a similar manner a minimum water footprint was calculated using the lowest yield value and highest et estimate mean yield together with the sebal et estimate was used to obtain the most accurate water footprint of this maize crop another source of non uniformity is the irrigation system itself pivot irrigation systems are often assumed to have a uniformity of 90 reinders 2010 and in order to focus on the influence of et and yield irrigation application efficiency was assumed to be 100 for the purposes of this study this issue is re addressed in the discussion section spatial water footprints were also calculated using the equations above together with sebal estimated et and precision harvester yield data in order to match both resolutions the 2 2 m yield data was resampled using bilinear interpolation to a pixel size of 30 30 m to match the pixel size captured from the satellite and for which et were estimated water footprint estimates above 800 m3 tonne 1 were removed from the results and then only the 5th 95th percentile water footprint data were used to estimate the average and range when applying this method 2 5 statistical analyses data comparisons for et estimations were done using weekly cumulative values and the square of the coefficient of determination r2 was used to test correlation 3 results 3 1 estimation of evapotranspiration an example of sebal modelled weekly and seasonal et is presented spatially in fig 2 some spatial variation is clear in both the weekly and seasonal datasets and the histograms show the spread of et estimates within the field weekly et for a week in january 2013 ranged between 30 and 60 mm across the pivot representing a 100 difference some of this variation is attributed to edge effects where the maize crop did not cover the entire pixel in the data assessment below the sebal estimate represents information from the position in the field 30 30 m pixel where the nwm measurements were made and sampling for crop model calibration was done plotting the sebal et against field observations eddy covariance soil water balance equation and crop modelling estimates swb sapwat cropwat of et over time shows that with the exception of a few weeks in january 2013 the sebal estimates exceed the other et method estimates fig 3 both the swb and sapwat et estimates were lower than eddy covariance estimated et for much of the season sebal et typically exceeded other et estimates swb sapwat cropwat throughout the season the very high sapwat et estimates at the beginning of the season prior to complete cc probably represents high soil evaporation assuming here that the eddy covariance technique was the most accurate for estimating et due to the fundamental nature of this approach based on r2 values sebal followed by sapwat cropwat swb and the soil water balance equation method respectively most closely matched eddy covariance s weekly estimates of et fig 4 the highest seasonal crop et estimate was obtained using sebal at 714 mm while the lowest estimate was obtained using the simplest method cropwat at 608 mm fig 5 this represents a 15 difference the sapwat crop et estimate of 617 mm was very similar to cropwat while the estimate obtained using the more mechanistic crop model swb 668 mm only differed from the sebal estimate by 6 unfortunately there were missing measurements for the eddy covariance and soil water balance equation techniques for the beginning of the season so cumulative et is not shown or compared for these methods 3 2 water footprint estimations the highest blue plus green water footprint based on using sebal s et estimation 714 mm for pixel of interest mean of the whole pivot was 701 mm and a 5th percentile yield measured value 10 5 t ha 1 was 680 m3 t 1 while the lowest water footprint based on cropwat s estimation of et 608 mm and a 95th percentile measured yield 18 0 t ha 1 was 338 m3 t 1 fig 6 representing a 100 difference using sebal s et only and the 5th and 95th percentile yields led to water footprint differences of 42 this value will be representative of the other et estimations using swb sapwat and cropwat calculated using these yield values using a mean yield for the field of 15 3 t ha 1 and the mean field sebal seasonal et estimate 701 mm a water footprint for this crop of 458 m3 t 1 is estimated 422 blue 36 green in comparison mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 estimated a global average maize water footprint of 1028 m3 t 1 81 blue 947 green and for irrigated maize specifically an estimate of 889 m3 t 1 was made 595 blue 294 green using the cropwat 8 0 model together with historical yield data for the beijing region china sun et al 2013 estimated the average blue plus green water footprint for maize to be 835 m3 t 1 577 blue 258 green lower estimates for certain seasons considered in the sun et al 2013 study were comparable to the results obtained in this study due to water footprint accounting being relatively new few additional comparisons can be made from other studies for the crop from this trial using mean grain yield data from the precision harvester corrected from 12 5 to 0 moisture and sebal s crop et estimation the water use efficiency is 19 1 kg grain 1 ha 1 mm et 1 this is higher than previously reported values and is attributed to the high yielding cultivar and precision agriculture farming practices for south africa bennie and botha 1986 reported wues of 10 8 12 2 kg grain ha 1 mm et 1 depending on cultivation method from trials conducted in the usa in 1994 and 1995 tolk et al 1999 reported wues ranging from 12 6 to 15 8 kg grain ha 1 mm et 1 in a season with high evaporative demand the authors observed that a mulch layer resulted in a 17 increase in grain yield and a 14 increase in wue compared to bare soil using measured data from a 30 year experiment in the north china plain zhang et al 2011 showed that while eto remained relatively constant between 1979 and 2009 seasonal et of maize gradually increased the authors attribute this to higher leaf stomatal conductance in the newer cultivars as increases in grain yield were relatively larger than increases in et zhang et al 2011 further concluded that new cultivars and improved management could lead to higher production without much increase in water use hatfield et al 2001 reviewed wues for maize produced in a variety of cropping system research trials comparing different management practices a very wide range of maize wues of 2 4 18 9 kg grain 1 ha 1 mm et 1 were observed it was noted by the authors that wue can vary two fold within a field due to soil type differences hatfield et al 2001 concluded that wue can be increased by 25 40 through tillage management practices and by 15 25 by modifying nutrient management practices water footprints can therefore be influenced in equal measure 3 3 remotely sensed water footprints the relationship between the precision harvester yield and sebal et spatial data is provided in fig 7 the coefficient of variation for et was 8 6 while the coefficient of variation for yield 30 30 m scale was much higher at 34 for yield versus et per pixel without removing outliers as done for the water footprint estimation a correlation r2 of 0 35 was observed using spatially linked sebal et estimates and precision harvester yield at the 30 30 m scale fig 7 the mean water footprint for the crop was 547 m3 t 1 501 blue 46 green which is 16 higher than the water footprint estimated using mean sebal et and mean yield for the whole pivot which was 458 m3 t 1 using spatially linked et and yield also resulted in a narrower range of water footprint estimates ranging from 493 to 663 m3 t 1 compared to a range of 389 to 668 m3 t 1 when average et and 5th 95th percentile yield data were used fig 8 3 4 upscaling of water footprint information for having confidence in upscaling a single water footprint value to represent blue and green water consumption at larger scales a number of assumptions need to be made including a the water footprint is representative of any other irrigation systems and or agro ecological conditions soils micro climate management represented in the region and b the correct estimates of yield for the field as a whole and that correct field size is known fig 6 shows that using the different established et estimation techniques tested in this study can potentially result in errors of 6 15 when upscaling the water footprint assuming there is a single correct answer for et and only a single yield value is used for the calculations spot measurements of yield can potentially result in 42 error introduction if one considers the range of yields measured by the precision harvester fig 9 the following exercise is used to demonstrate the impact of different estimates of water use at larger scales based on the maize water footprints obtained in this study approximately 13 500 ha was under maize in the douglas region during the 2012 13 season if we assume an average yield of 15 3 t ha 1 which is a representative yield for the season according to gwk data and a blue water footprint of 422 m3 t 1 this equates to 87 million m3 of water consumption by maize for this season or 6 216 l s 1 if considered over the period 1 december 2012 31 may 2013 in comparison average flow of the orange river at irene station d7h012 29 18285 23 57511 located just downstream of douglas was 1529 million m3 or 109 239 l s 1 for this period maize production therefore uses approximately 5 4 of river water over the growing season however if we use the maximum blue water footprint obtained in this study 615 blue only m3 t 1 this equates to 8 3 of river flow 9076 l s 1 while if we use the minimum blue water footprint 338 blue only m3 t 1 this equates to 4 4 of river flow 5001 l s 1 implying that upscaling of water footprint information must be done with caution 4 discussion estimating et is a challenging exercise with the tools available differing in complexity ease of use and cost the most commonly used method crop modelling is dependent on past field growth analyses and soil water use calculations for parameterisation and calibration uncertainty is introduced from trial measurement error and increased when applying these models for conditions differing from those experienced in the parameterisation calibration trial for this trial simple crop factor models applying average weather data gave values comparable to more costly and time consuming methods using actual seasonal weather conditions sebal eddy covariance with cumulative et estimates only differing by a maximum of 14 it must be cautioned however that this cropping system may represent a best case scenario as the trial was conducted on a well managed input intensive commercial farm water or nutrient limiting conditions such as those often experienced in rain fed and small scale agriculture will potentially lead to less accurate et estimates and larger differences between et estimation methods especially for crop factor type models which do not account for the impact of any limiting factors on crop growth and canopy development remote sensing with sebal led to the highest estimates of seasonal et as using this method involves actual measurements of conditions as they are unfolding in real time including right from the beginning of the season pre emergence until harvest we propose that this is the most robust method to use for et estimates when available as observed in this trial yield variability which could be in response to factors such as heterogeneous soil characteristics has the potential to be large even in a single well managed field yield estimates made by researchers by measuring at several points in the field and then extrapolating to the entire field are therefore prone to this error although it can be addressed through making numerous measurements or dividing the field into zones with different yield potentials for this study the 5th and 95th percentile yields differed by 42 therefore representing an even greater potential source of error for water footprint accounting than using seasonal et estimated with different techniques precision harvesters can accurately estimate yields but these data are not available in most cases researchers have the responsibility of getting yield estimates as accurate as possible so as to limit the introduction of error into water footprint estimates from the denominator in the equation using spatially linked precision harvester yields and et estimations led to a narrower range of water footprints than using 5 95th percentile yield values together with an average et estimation spatially estimated water footprints were also generally higher than water footprints using average et together with 5 25 50 75 and 95th percentile yields one drawback of using remote sensing with pivots is that the field boundary pixels will not always be completely covered by the specific crop in this study data needed to be filtered water footprints 800 m3 t 1 were removed and then only 5 95th percentile data retained to remove unrealistic water footprints but the data filtration approach requires subjective decisions by the researcher advanced gis data processing will in future be required to overcome this issue another source of uncertainty can be irrigation volumes actually applied and uniformity of the irrigation system irrigators often are not able to accurately quantify the amount of water they irrigate more especially in developing countries the application efficiency of pivot irrigation systems as used in this study often assumed to be around 90 by default is possibly closer to a value of 80 for south african conditions according to reinders 2010 this value may therefore represent a source of error similar in magnitude to the estimated seasonal et difference between the methods assessed in this trial while this issue was not covered in this study its influence should be considered in future research including the influence of continuous over or under applications on specific areas of the field on crop yield and the soil water balance influences of irrigation non uniformity on pollution from the field also need to be considered poor crop growth and associated lower et in a region of the field that receives equal irrigation applications to regions with better crop growth will potentially result in more deep drainage beyond the root zone this together with lower fertiliser uptake can lead to higher nutrient pollution and a larger grey water footprint volume of freshwater required to dilute pollutants to ambient levels this was beyond the scope of this paper but should be explored in future research precision irrigation systems which can divide the field into zones and varying irrigation rates for each could play a major role in matching applications with crop uptake reducing the water footprint and associated pollution in the process water footprint estimation inaccuracies at the field scale will potentially be transferred during up scaling exercises unless averages accurately represent the system as a whole due to compensating errors it was observed that using site specific scientifically and physically possible estimates of yield 5 95th percentile and et sebal cropwat for a single field could result in water footprints differing by 100 for the larger study site considered this could lead to estimations that maize uses from 4 4 to 8 3 of flow of the orange river which is a substantial difference the orange river is south africa s largest river so this represents a significant volume of water and a potentially very large discrepancy if these data were to be used for allocation or policy formulation purposes 5 conclusions as water footprinting methodologies become more refined and applications become more specific it is important to understand the influence of et yield and irrigation estimates on water footprint metrics any errors introduced during the estimation of water footprints at field scale will potentially be transferred during the upscaling process biophysical scientists have the responsibility of providing as accurate water footprint estimates as possible whereafter their application should be used with responsibility and caution being fully mindful of the consequences of any limitations in their estimation this study showed that using site specific and physically possible values could still lead to water footprint estimations differing by 100 et estimation according to different methods could in this example potentially introduce 15 error and yield variability 42 error technological advances with monitoring devices such as flowmeters to measure irrigation volumes applied and remote sensing and gis tools to more accurately measure field sizes et and yields will improve the availability of data on agricultural water consumption while water footprinting has played an important role in increasing public awareness of the high amounts of water required in crop production the upscaling and extrapolation of this information must clearly be done with care in the management of water resources especially at larger scales a sound hydrological understanding and water balance method will always be favoured

11197,the application of water footprint accounting is mostly done at large scales but the estimation of crop and region specific water footprints for up scaling is dependent on accurate and representative in field measurements of evapotranspiration et yield and irrigation in a field trial we assessed the influence of maize zea mays l et estimates using soil water balance accounting remote sensing with satellite imagery sebal model eddy covariance measurements and three crop models swb cropwat sapwat on water footprint estimates we simultaneously assessed the influence of yield spatial variability as measured by a precision harvester seasonal et estimations differed by as much as 15 for the different methods and yield differed by as much as 42 representing the error which can be introduced as a result of point measurements using a combination of the highest lowest et estimates and the 5th 95th percentile yield water footprint values differed by as much as 100 ranging from 338 680 m3 t 1 applying spatially linked sebal et estimates and precision harvester yield at the 30 30 m scale reduced the range of estimated water footprints to 493 663 m3 t 1 with an average of 547 m3 t 1 this was 15 higher than the water footprint estimated using average sebal et and average yield for the whole pivot 467 m3 t 1 any error introduced at this stage of water footprint accounting can be transferred during up scaling of the results for example based on the minimum and maximum estimated water footprints maize production was expected to consume between 4 4 and 8 3 respectively of the orange river south africa s largest river flow during the season in that region biophysical scientists have the role of providing high quality data for accurate water consumption estimates thereafter their application by various stakeholders should be done with caution keywords crop modelling eddy covariance cropwat remote sensing sebal 1 introduction irrigation is reported to consume 60 70 of freshwater withdrawals globally assouline et al 2015 and increasing demand for water is placing pressure on irrigation to become more efficient water footprint accounting has been identified as a means to improve the management of our water resources but is still undergoing a phase of refinement before the full potential application of water footprint accounting can be understood as agriculture is estimated to be responsible for over 90 of humanity s water footprint aldaya et al 2012 attention has largely focused on this sector blue water refers to surface and belowground water available to multiple users green water is water originating from rainfall that is stored in the soil and available for vegetation growth only aldaya et al 2012 recently the iso 14046 standard on water footprinting was released which does not make use of the concept of green water conceptualizing that green water consumption is linked to land use and natural vegetation uses water anyway water footprint accounting especially according to the water footprint network wfn approach has been criticized primarily because it only considers consumption and does not adequately place the impact on water resources in a local context pfister et al 2011 ridoutt and pfister 2010 wichelns 2010 provision to do so has been addressed through a sustainability impact assessment step in the case of the wfn approach aldaya et al 2012 and through the use of a water stress index in the case of the life cycle assessment approach pfister et al 2009 disagreements on the calculation and application of water footprints remain especially on how to quantify and represent local impact hoekstra 2016 accurate water footprint estimates are dependent on accurate estimates of crop evapotranspiration et volume of irrigation applied and yield attained numerous methods are available to measure or estimate crop et these include physical plot to field scale methods for example weighing lysimeters eddy covariance bowen ratio surface renewal scintillometry and soil water balance accounting as well as crop models for example the cropwat swb and sapwat models which are described later most of these methods typically have the limitation that they cannot fully capture spatial variation of crop water use across and between agricultural fields advances in recent years in the use of remote sensing information makes it now possible to assess crop water use and biomass production spatially for a pixel 30 1000 m of a satellite image of a specific irrigated area the sebal model bastiaanssen et al 2005 for example has been applied operationally for field scale agricultural water management and has been evaluated extensively across the globe in addition to uncertainties with et exact crop yields are sometimes not known and can vary significantly within a field as influenced by factors such as soil fertility gradients non uniform irrigation applications patchy pest and disease outbreaks water logging and other factors farmers also often do not know the exact irrigation volume applied to their fields and differences in uniformity of application can result in some areas of a field receiving more than others further adding to the complexity of estimating blue water consumption similarly linked to irrigation and yield estimates farmers may not know the precise size of their fields potentially introducing more error into these estimates globally maize zea mays l together with wheat triticum aestivum l and rice oryza sativa l provide at least 30 of food calories to more than 4 5 billion people in developing countries shiferaw et al 2011 the global area planted to maize is about 150 million ha and the versatility of this crop allows it to be grown at a wide range of altitudes and latitudes temperature ranges and on many different soils shiferaw et al 2011 maize is the staple diet of many south africans and is produced in each of the country s nine provinces according to grain sa 2013 the estimated area under maize in 2012 2013 was 2 8 million ha with 8 7 242 500 ha of the area under irrigation and the rest under dryland production the average maize yield under irrigation is 10 1 t ha 1 and 3 5 t ha 1 under dryland conditions even though irrigated maize only covers a small area it contributes an estimated 21 5 of the total maize production of south africa approximately 9000 commercial famers produce maize in south africa providing employment to an estimated 128 000 people www daff gov za innopac up ac za docs factsheet maize htm accessed 26 march 2014 if water footprint accounting is to be used effectively in water resources management and conservation it is important to understand how quantitative this approach is and whether it is accurate enough when conducting water footprint assessments different levels of information can be available with which to do the calculations mostly dependent on past research that has been done in a specific region for a specific crop and yield data which can be collected by various agencies such as government institutions co operatives and research and non governmental organisations in this study we compare water footprint estimations for maize acquired using different methods or models to estimate et including remote sensing sebal model the soil water balance equation eddy covariance and crop modelling swb cropwat and sapwat models the influence of the spatial variability of grain yield is also investigated by combining these et estimates with precision harvester grain yield measurements 5th 25th 50th 75th 95th percentiles for the field studied as well as applying remote sensing with satellite imagery to estimate water footprints using spatially linked et and yield it is envisaged that improved understanding on the sensitivity of water footprint accounting to input data can better inform the application of this type of information 2 material and methods 2 1 study location the study site was located near the town of douglas 29 6 0 s 23 44 0 e 1029 masl in the northern cape province of south africa although this province only has an estimated 51 500 ha under irrigated maize 1 85 of south africa s total for irrigated and dryland maize it produced an estimated 651 650 t or 5 7 of south arica s maize in 2013 douglas has a semi arid climate and the region receives an average annual rainfall of approximately 339 mm and average mid day temperatures of 18 4 c apart from the areas under irrigation land is sparsely cultivated and covered with closed to open grassland centre pivot irrigation systems are used almost exclusively to irrigate crops and the water allocation for irrigation is typically in the order of 1000 1100 mm yr 1 2 2 field trial while remote sensing data was acquired for a 60 60 km area a single field under pivot irrigation was studied in great detail maize cv p1184br short season cultivar was planted on 5 december 2012 and monitored between november 2012 and may 2013 for crop model parameterisation purposes soil samples were taken for particle size analysis according to the hydrometer method and bulk density was determined by oven drying soil cores of known volume then dividing the oven dry mass by the volume of the soil samples were taken in close proximity to a neutron water meter nwm monitoring point with an aluminium access tube installed to a depth of 1 2 m using a soil auger soil water content swc was measured at 0 1 m increments at weekly intervals to a depth of 1 2 m leaf area index lai was measured non destructively with a ceptometer accupar lp 80 decagon pullman washington fractional interception fi of photosynthetically active radiation par was determined by comparing above and below canopy par measured with the ceptometer canopy cover cc was calculated from fi by multiplying it by 100 to get a percentage canopy cover data was used to calibrate the swb model described below and for comparison with sebal also described below estimates weather data was obtained from the nearest weather station douglas dehoek to the field studied and irrigation was recorded using a manual rain gauge installed in the field unfortunately irrigation data from the rain gauge was judged to be unreliable after a certain point in time because the maize canopy grew above the gauge from this point irrigation and rainfall i r were estimated by back calculating a cumulative weekly value using real time reference evapotranspiration eto a crop factor kc obtained from the local co operative gwk and the nwm soil water content swc data daily eto was multiplied by the relevant crop specific kc to give an estimation of weekly crop evapotranspiration et for the rest of the growing season the change in swc or δs was determined by subtracting each week s swc reading from the swc of the previous week the input of water i r into the soil profile was then estimated by adding subtracting δs to from estimated et irrigation was determined by subtracting rainfall obtained from weather station from i r the derived i r values were compared to measured rain gauge data from before the maize canopy grew above the gauges and a strong correlation was found r2 0 91 for the comparison between the rain gauge measurements and the derived i r value irrigation was estimated to be 646 mm and this value was used in all the water footprint calculations 2 3 estimation of evapotranspiration 2 3 1 eddy covariance a one sensor eddy covariance system with a csat 3 sonic anemometer campbell scientific usa was installed in the maize field in december 2012 at the time of planting and removed shortly before the maize was harvested in may 2013 the eddy covariance method estimates the sensible heat flux density and combining this with measured net radiation and estimated soil heat flux latent energy and therefore et is estimated as the residual of the energy balance equation savage et al 2010 the eddy covariance system has been widely applied in south africa clulow et al 2012 jarmain et al 2009 savage et al 2010 2 3 2 crop modelling the soil water balance swb model the soil water balance swb model is a mechanistic real time generic crop growth soil water balance and irrigation scheduling model annandale et al 2011 swb was developed based on the newswb model from campbell and diaz 1988 reference daily evapotranspiration eto is estimated using the penman monteith equation according to fao irrigation and drainage series no 56 recommendations allen et al 1998 dry matter production is simulated mechanistically by calculating a daily dry matter increment which is limited by either radiation or water availability phenological development growth and yield of a crop from planting to maturity are mechanistically estimated based on soil water status and environmental conditions water limited growth is estimated using parameters that directly limit biomass accumulation including a crop water stress index annandale et al 2000 the big advantage of this approach over crop factor based approaches to water balance modelling is the feedback between soil water availability and the growth and development of the crop canopy the use of thermal time in swb avoids the need to use different crop factors to express crop development for different planting dates and regions annandale et al 2011 a cascading also called tipping bucket approach was used to simulate water movement and storage within the soil profile an swb simulation for the maize crop was parameterized and calibrated based on data collected from the field trial described above crop parameters used are presented in table 1 the cropwat and sapwat models cropwat was developed by the united nation s food and agricultural organisation fao smith 1992 and has commonly been used in water footprint studies mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 zhuo et al 2016 estimates of crop water and irrigation requirements can be made based on soil climate crop and irrigation management data and calculations are based on fao irrigation and drainage series no 56 allen et al 1998 and series no 33 doorenbos and kassam 1979 monthly average data to run the model was obtained from the climwat 2 0 model muñoz and grieser 2006 the nearest climwat database weather station to the study site was identified as postmasburg 28 18 36 s 23 3 35 999 e 1300 masl approximately 100 km away and this data was downloaded and used to run cropwat 8 0 standard database factors were used for a maize crop and loam soil together with the actual planting date the sapwat computer program is a south african irrigation planning and management tool and is a further development of cropwat like cropwat it is not a crop growth model and does not provide real time scheduling advice rather it was developed to establish a decision making procedure for the estimation of crop irrigation requirements by irrigation engineers planners and agriculturalists van heerden et al 2008 building on cropwat work has been done to include more locally relevant input parameters and weather data for south africa monthly average weather data is processed to obtain daily weather data for a specific day of year which is used to run the daily model time step the cropwat and sapwat simulations were set up based on site specific information as indicated in tables 2 and 3 default values were left unchanged 2 3 3 sebal remote sensing evapotranspiration estimates the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 2005 model was used to estimate maize et from satellite imagery and automatic weather station data spatial modelling for the maize production area was done for an area roughly covering 60 km 60 km and a combination of disaster management constellation dmc and visible infrared imaging radiometer suite viirs data was used dmc captured data in the visible green red and near infrared ranges since land surface thermal data is not captured by dmc this was taken from the viirs sensor dmc data was captured roughly bi weekly and one viirs image per week was downloaded in total 21 dmc and 35 viirs images were used in the spatial modelling from 1 october 2012 to 31 may 2013 the images used are listed injarmain et al 2009 a digital elevation map dem for the douglas study area was taken from shuttle radar topography mission srtm the local co operative gwk made a shape file available outlining all the irrigation pivots of the douglas area and containing information on the crop type for each pivot this shapefile was used to extract data from the irrigated areas meteolook voogt 2006 was used to spatially extrapolate data from south africa s agricultural research council arc dehoek meteorological station 29 6 0 s 23 38 60 e in douglas weather data obtained included hourly daily and weekly data for relative humidity wind speed temperature and solar radiation 2 4 water footprint calculation to estimate the water footprint of the maize crop seasonal et estimates from sebal and crop modelling using swb cropwat and sapwat and precision harvester grain yields 5th 25th 50th 75th 95th percentiles mean were firstly used due to missing data at the beginning and or end of the season total seasonal et estimates were not available for the eddy covariance and soil water balance accounting methods the blue water footprint was calculated using eq 1 1 b l u e w a t e r f o o t p r int minimum t o t a l n e t i r r i g a t i o n actual irrigation r e q u i r e m e n t crop yield the irrigation schedule was determined by the commercial farmer based on weekly soil water content measurements so the total irrigation amount of 646 mm was assumed to represent the numerator in the blue water footprint calculation the green water footprint was calculated as crop et minus the blue water use numerator in blue water footprint calculation divided by yield eq 2 hoekstra et al 2011 2 green waterfootprint crop et blue wateruse crop yield yield distribution for the field as measured by the precision harvester is shown in fig 1 percentile values were calculated from these data to represent the potential error that can be introduced by researchers making point measurements of yield within the field and then extrapolating to the field scale a maximum water footprint representing the most unrepresentatively high value that could still be estimated from site specific data was calculated using the highest yield value and lowest et estimate and in a similar manner a minimum water footprint was calculated using the lowest yield value and highest et estimate mean yield together with the sebal et estimate was used to obtain the most accurate water footprint of this maize crop another source of non uniformity is the irrigation system itself pivot irrigation systems are often assumed to have a uniformity of 90 reinders 2010 and in order to focus on the influence of et and yield irrigation application efficiency was assumed to be 100 for the purposes of this study this issue is re addressed in the discussion section spatial water footprints were also calculated using the equations above together with sebal estimated et and precision harvester yield data in order to match both resolutions the 2 2 m yield data was resampled using bilinear interpolation to a pixel size of 30 30 m to match the pixel size captured from the satellite and for which et were estimated water footprint estimates above 800 m3 tonne 1 were removed from the results and then only the 5th 95th percentile water footprint data were used to estimate the average and range when applying this method 2 5 statistical analyses data comparisons for et estimations were done using weekly cumulative values and the square of the coefficient of determination r2 was used to test correlation 3 results 3 1 estimation of evapotranspiration an example of sebal modelled weekly and seasonal et is presented spatially in fig 2 some spatial variation is clear in both the weekly and seasonal datasets and the histograms show the spread of et estimates within the field weekly et for a week in january 2013 ranged between 30 and 60 mm across the pivot representing a 100 difference some of this variation is attributed to edge effects where the maize crop did not cover the entire pixel in the data assessment below the sebal estimate represents information from the position in the field 30 30 m pixel where the nwm measurements were made and sampling for crop model calibration was done plotting the sebal et against field observations eddy covariance soil water balance equation and crop modelling estimates swb sapwat cropwat of et over time shows that with the exception of a few weeks in january 2013 the sebal estimates exceed the other et method estimates fig 3 both the swb and sapwat et estimates were lower than eddy covariance estimated et for much of the season sebal et typically exceeded other et estimates swb sapwat cropwat throughout the season the very high sapwat et estimates at the beginning of the season prior to complete cc probably represents high soil evaporation assuming here that the eddy covariance technique was the most accurate for estimating et due to the fundamental nature of this approach based on r2 values sebal followed by sapwat cropwat swb and the soil water balance equation method respectively most closely matched eddy covariance s weekly estimates of et fig 4 the highest seasonal crop et estimate was obtained using sebal at 714 mm while the lowest estimate was obtained using the simplest method cropwat at 608 mm fig 5 this represents a 15 difference the sapwat crop et estimate of 617 mm was very similar to cropwat while the estimate obtained using the more mechanistic crop model swb 668 mm only differed from the sebal estimate by 6 unfortunately there were missing measurements for the eddy covariance and soil water balance equation techniques for the beginning of the season so cumulative et is not shown or compared for these methods 3 2 water footprint estimations the highest blue plus green water footprint based on using sebal s et estimation 714 mm for pixel of interest mean of the whole pivot was 701 mm and a 5th percentile yield measured value 10 5 t ha 1 was 680 m3 t 1 while the lowest water footprint based on cropwat s estimation of et 608 mm and a 95th percentile measured yield 18 0 t ha 1 was 338 m3 t 1 fig 6 representing a 100 difference using sebal s et only and the 5th and 95th percentile yields led to water footprint differences of 42 this value will be representative of the other et estimations using swb sapwat and cropwat calculated using these yield values using a mean yield for the field of 15 3 t ha 1 and the mean field sebal seasonal et estimate 701 mm a water footprint for this crop of 458 m3 t 1 is estimated 422 blue 36 green in comparison mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 estimated a global average maize water footprint of 1028 m3 t 1 81 blue 947 green and for irrigated maize specifically an estimate of 889 m3 t 1 was made 595 blue 294 green using the cropwat 8 0 model together with historical yield data for the beijing region china sun et al 2013 estimated the average blue plus green water footprint for maize to be 835 m3 t 1 577 blue 258 green lower estimates for certain seasons considered in the sun et al 2013 study were comparable to the results obtained in this study due to water footprint accounting being relatively new few additional comparisons can be made from other studies for the crop from this trial using mean grain yield data from the precision harvester corrected from 12 5 to 0 moisture and sebal s crop et estimation the water use efficiency is 19 1 kg grain 1 ha 1 mm et 1 this is higher than previously reported values and is attributed to the high yielding cultivar and precision agriculture farming practices for south africa bennie and botha 1986 reported wues of 10 8 12 2 kg grain ha 1 mm et 1 depending on cultivation method from trials conducted in the usa in 1994 and 1995 tolk et al 1999 reported wues ranging from 12 6 to 15 8 kg grain ha 1 mm et 1 in a season with high evaporative demand the authors observed that a mulch layer resulted in a 17 increase in grain yield and a 14 increase in wue compared to bare soil using measured data from a 30 year experiment in the north china plain zhang et al 2011 showed that while eto remained relatively constant between 1979 and 2009 seasonal et of maize gradually increased the authors attribute this to higher leaf stomatal conductance in the newer cultivars as increases in grain yield were relatively larger than increases in et zhang et al 2011 further concluded that new cultivars and improved management could lead to higher production without much increase in water use hatfield et al 2001 reviewed wues for maize produced in a variety of cropping system research trials comparing different management practices a very wide range of maize wues of 2 4 18 9 kg grain 1 ha 1 mm et 1 were observed it was noted by the authors that wue can vary two fold within a field due to soil type differences hatfield et al 2001 concluded that wue can be increased by 25 40 through tillage management practices and by 15 25 by modifying nutrient management practices water footprints can therefore be influenced in equal measure 3 3 remotely sensed water footprints the relationship between the precision harvester yield and sebal et spatial data is provided in fig 7 the coefficient of variation for et was 8 6 while the coefficient of variation for yield 30 30 m scale was much higher at 34 for yield versus et per pixel without removing outliers as done for the water footprint estimation a correlation r2 of 0 35 was observed using spatially linked sebal et estimates and precision harvester yield at the 30 30 m scale fig 7 the mean water footprint for the crop was 547 m3 t 1 501 blue 46 green which is 16 higher than the water footprint estimated using mean sebal et and mean yield for the whole pivot which was 458 m3 t 1 using spatially linked et and yield also resulted in a narrower range of water footprint estimates ranging from 493 to 663 m3 t 1 compared to a range of 389 to 668 m3 t 1 when average et and 5th 95th percentile yield data were used fig 8 3 4 upscaling of water footprint information for having confidence in upscaling a single water footprint value to represent blue and green water consumption at larger scales a number of assumptions need to be made including a the water footprint is representative of any other irrigation systems and or agro ecological conditions soils micro climate management represented in the region and b the correct estimates of yield for the field as a whole and that correct field size is known fig 6 shows that using the different established et estimation techniques tested in this study can potentially result in errors of 6 15 when upscaling the water footprint assuming there is a single correct answer for et and only a single yield value is used for the calculations spot measurements of yield can potentially result in 42 error introduction if one considers the range of yields measured by the precision harvester fig 9 the following exercise is used to demonstrate the impact of different estimates of water use at larger scales based on the maize water footprints obtained in this study approximately 13 500 ha was under maize in the douglas region during the 2012 13 season if we assume an average yield of 15 3 t ha 1 which is a representative yield for the season according to gwk data and a blue water footprint of 422 m3 t 1 this equates to 87 million m3 of water consumption by maize for this season or 6 216 l s 1 if considered over the period 1 december 2012 31 may 2013 in comparison average flow of the orange river at irene station d7h012 29 18285 23 57511 located just downstream of douglas was 1529 million m3 or 109 239 l s 1 for this period maize production therefore uses approximately 5 4 of river water over the growing season however if we use the maximum blue water footprint obtained in this study 615 blue only m3 t 1 this equates to 8 3 of river flow 9076 l s 1 while if we use the minimum blue water footprint 338 blue only m3 t 1 this equates to 4 4 of river flow 5001 l s 1 implying that upscaling of water footprint information must be done with caution 4 discussion estimating et is a challenging exercise with the tools available differing in complexity ease of use and cost the most commonly used method crop modelling is dependent on past field growth analyses and soil water use calculations for parameterisation and calibration uncertainty is introduced from trial measurement error and increased when applying these models for conditions differing from those experienced in the parameterisation calibration trial for this trial simple crop factor models applying average weather data gave values comparable to more costly and time consuming methods using actual seasonal weather conditions sebal eddy covariance with cumulative et estimates only differing by a maximum of 14 it must be cautioned however that this cropping system may represent a best case scenario as the trial was conducted on a well managed input intensive commercial farm water or nutrient limiting conditions such as those often experienced in rain fed and small scale agriculture will potentially lead to less accurate et estimates and larger differences between et estimation methods especially for crop factor type models which do not account for the impact of any limiting factors on crop growth and canopy development remote sensing with sebal led to the highest estimates of seasonal et as using this method involves actual measurements of conditions as they are unfolding in real time including right from the beginning of the season pre emergence until harvest we propose that this is the most robust method to use for et estimates when available as observed in this trial yield variability which could be in response to factors such as heterogeneous soil characteristics has the potential to be large even in a single well managed field yield estimates made by researchers by measuring at several points in the field and then extrapolating to the entire field are therefore prone to this error although it can be addressed through making numerous measurements or dividing the field into zones with different yield potentials for this study the 5th and 95th percentile yields differed by 42 therefore representing an even greater potential source of error for water footprint accounting than using seasonal et estimated with different techniques precision harvesters can accurately estimate yields but these data are not available in most cases researchers have the responsibility of getting yield estimates as accurate as possible so as to limit the introduction of error into water footprint estimates from the denominator in the equation using spatially linked precision harvester yields and et estimations led to a narrower range of water footprints than using 5 95th percentile yield values together with an average et estimation spatially estimated water footprints were also generally higher than water footprints using average et together with 5 25 50 75 and 95th percentile yields one drawback of using remote sensing with pivots is that the field boundary pixels will not always be completely covered by the specific crop in this study data needed to be filtered water footprints 800 m3 t 1 were removed and then only 5 95th percentile data retained to remove unrealistic water footprints but the data filtration approach requires subjective decisions by the researcher advanced gis data processing will in future be required to overcome this issue another source of uncertainty can be irrigation volumes actually applied and uniformity of the irrigation system irrigators often are not able to accurately quantify the amount of water they irrigate more especially in developing countries the application efficiency of pivot irrigation systems as used in this study often assumed to be around 90 by default is possibly closer to a value of 80 for south african conditions according to reinders 2010 this value may therefore represent a source of error similar in magnitude to the estimated seasonal et difference between the methods assessed in this trial while this issue was not covered in this study its influence should be considered in future research including the influence of continuous over or under applications on specific areas of the field on crop yield and the soil water balance influences of irrigation non uniformity on pollution from the field also need to be considered poor crop growth and associated lower et in a region of the field that receives equal irrigation applications to regions with better crop growth will potentially result in more deep drainage beyond the root zone this together with lower fertiliser uptake can lead to higher nutrient pollution and a larger grey water footprint volume of freshwater required to dilute pollutants to ambient levels this was beyond the scope of this paper but should be explored in future research precision irrigation systems which can divide the field into zones and varying irrigation rates for each could play a major role in matching applications with crop uptake reducing the water footprint and associated pollution in the process water footprint estimation inaccuracies at the field scale will potentially be transferred during up scaling exercises unless averages accurately represent the system as a whole due to compensating errors it was observed that using site specific scientifically and physically possible estimates of yield 5 95th percentile and et sebal cropwat for a single field could result in water footprints differing by 100 for the larger study site considered this could lead to estimations that maize uses from 4 4 to 8 3 of flow of the orange river which is a substantial difference the orange river is south africa s largest river so this represents a significant volume of water and a potentially very large discrepancy if these data were to be used for allocation or policy formulation purposes 5 conclusions as water footprinting methodologies become more refined and applications become more specific it is important to understand the influence of et yield and irrigation estimates on water footprint metrics any errors introduced during the estimation of water footprints at field scale will potentially be transferred during the upscaling process biophysical scientists have the responsibility of providing as accurate water footprint estimates as possible whereafter their application should be used with responsibility and caution being fully mindful of the consequences of any limitations in their estimation this study showed that using site specific and physically possible values could still lead to water footprint estimations differing by 100 et estimation according to different methods could in this example potentially introduce 15 error and yield variability 42 error technological advances with monitoring devices such as flowmeters to measure irrigation volumes applied and remote sensing and gis tools to more accurately measure field sizes et and yields will improve the availability of data on agricultural water consumption while water footprinting has played an important role in increasing public awareness of the high amounts of water required in crop production the upscaling and extrapolation of this information must clearly be done with care in the management of water resources especially at larger scales a sound hydrological understanding and water balance method will always be favoured

11198,saline water has been increasingly used for crop production in areas characterized by freshwater shortage however continuous irrigation with saline water often results in adverse effects on the soil crop system in this study we investigated the effects of different saline water irrigation strategies on soil properties tomato plant growth fruit yield and fruit quality the irrigation treatments included i continuous irrigation with freshwater fi ii continuous irrigation with saline water si iii irrigation with the saline water blended with freshwater bi iv irrigation alternately with saline water and freshwater ai and v irrigation with freshwater at early sensitive stages combined with saline water at later tolerant stages ci overall saline water irrigation adversely affected

alleviated by the bi ai and ci treatments compared to the si treatment despite this there was no distinct difference in soil properties among the bi ai and ci treatments the ai treatment generally showed higher fruit yield as compared to the bi and ci treatments and even no significant difference as compared to the fi treatment in two out of three cropping seasons in addition the ai treatment significantly increased vitamin c soluble sugar and solids glucose fructose and sucrose in tomato fruits as compared to the fi treatment our results suggested that the alternate irrigation ai was more efficient than the blending bi and cycling ci irrigation in alleviating the adverse effects of saline water on the soil crop system keywords freshwater shortage alternative water resource irrigation management soil crop system tomato quality 1 introduction irrigation water is one of the major factors determining crop yields and agricultural production hanjra and qureshi 2010 ierna and mauromicale 2018 it has been estimated that agricultural water use accounts for approximately 70 of global freshwater withdrawals and consumption haddeland et al 2014 however most regions of the world in particular in arid and semiarid areas are characterized by freshwater shortage azarnivand and chitsaz 2015 koutroulis et al 2018 generally to meet human needs freshwater is preferably allocated to urban water supply thereby restricting the amount of freshwater available for agricultural irrigation wu et al 2016 flörke et al 2018 since irrigation water is indispensable for crop growth and yield it is necessary to seek alternatives to freshwater that are available for irrigation saline water is a poor quality source of water jalali et al 2017 and has been used as an alternative to freshwater for hundreds of years stewart and hirst 1916 the most fundamental agricultural use for saline water is to provide water for plant absorption beltrán 1999 romero aranda et al 2001 reina sánchez et al 2005 some additional uses of saline water include improving fruit quality by reducing water content de pascale et al 2001 and increasing nutritional components in the fruit ben ahmed et al 2009 increasing the number of flowers per stem by inducing flower initiation and controlling stem height shillo et al 2002 and boosting crop yields through conjunctively using saline water and freshwater murad et al 2018 or applying irrigation under subsurface drainage systems feng et al 2017 generally in areas characterized by freshwater shortage saline water irrigation has the potential to partly meet plant demands for water and to maintain a certain level of crop yields however continuous irrigation with saline water often leads to reduced crop growth and agricultural productivity when compared to freshwater irrigation baath et al 2017 alharby et al 2018 for instance irrigation with saline water may induce salt accumulation in the rootzone li et al 2015 thereby restricting water and nutrient uptake by roots and limiting plant growth hussain et al 2015 therefore the choose of proper saline water management is the major challenge to enhance crop growth and yields conjunctive use cu of saline water and freshwater has been demonstrated to be efficient in alleviating the adverse effects of saline water on crop growth bharati et al 2008 murad et al 2018 to date several relatively efficient cu strategies such as blending and alternate irrigation have been successfully explored and applied in areas rich in saline water the blending strategy involves irrigating crops with the saline water mixed with high quality water e g freshwater malash et al 2008 since this strategy can result in a relatively low level of salinity in irrigation water it has been applied to several sensitive and or moderately sensitive crops such as potato chauhan et al 2007 tomato malash et al 2012 sweet sorghum ramos et al 2012 and oleic sunflower machekposhti et al 2017 the alternate strategy involves irrigating crops alternately with saline water and freshwater malash et al 2005 a great advantage of this strategy is probably the salt leaching effect of freshwater irrigation murtaza et al 2006 despite the benefits mentioned above there are limitations on the effectiveness of blending and alternate strategies since the proportion of saline water in blended water can significantly influence plant growth machekposhti et al 2017 the blending strategy is not always feasible kan and rapaport rom 2012 especially when water salinity exceeds crop salinity threshold grattan and oster 2003 with respect to the alternate strategy an obvious disadvantage is that if there is no sufficient freshwater to leach salts the salt accumulated in the soil profile due to saline water irrigation may still show suppression effects on plant growth malash et al 2005 moreover both the blending and alternate strategies are not generally developed based on plant growth stages which are crucial for roots to sense salts in the environment del amor et al 2001 in addition to blending and alternate irrigation cycling irrigation is another cu strategy that is efficient in reducing the adverse influence of saline water the cycling strategy involves using saline water solely for certain crops e g the relatively salt tolerant crops in crop rotation systems dudley et al 2008 or only during relatively salt tolerant growth stages when salt sensitive crops are grown grattan and oster 2003 this strategy has been successfully used to increase crop yields in some regions for instance murad et al 2018 demonstrated that irrigation with freshwater at early sensitive stages combined with saline water at later tolerant stages can minimize yield loss of maize in saline coastal region of bangladesh in regions characterized by freshwater shortage the optimal management strategies for saline irrigation should possess several features it should be suitable for local crops have high efficiency simple application and low costs and risks and require minimal freshwater inputs this means that the effectiveness of a saline water irrigation strategy should be evaluated based on a comprehensive analysis although the blending alternate and cycling strategies have been widely used in most regions of the world murtaza et al 2006 bharati et al 2008 ramos et al 2012 machekposhti et al 2017 murad et al 2018 there have been very few previous attempts to comprehensively compare the advantages and disadvantages of each of these three strategies since most areas in northwestern china are facing serious freshwater shortages and since saline water resources are relatively abundant in these regions an experimental trial under greenhouse conditions was carried out over two years with three tomato cropping seasons adopting exclusive and conjunctive blending alternate and cycling strategies use of fresh and saline water for irrigation therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to compare the efficiency of different saline water irrigation strategies in alleviating salt stress in plants and to 2 explore the major factors reducing the adverse effects of saline water

5 m and it was realized in the same replicate plot for the different growing periods at the end of each growing period post harvest irrigation with freshwater had not been applied however before transplanting the tomato seedlings an irrigation with freshwater 350 m3 ha 1 had been applied to leach the salt accumulated in the soil profile from the previous crop and to reduce soil salt content

average increased there were also significant interactive effects of it cs on both soil ph and ec values both p 0 001 table 2 for instance when compared to the fi treatment soil ph was significantly increased by the bi treatment in the first and second css but was decreased in the third cs fig 1 moreover when compared to the ai treatment soil ec was significantly increased by the ci treatment in

it cs all p 0 001 table 2 soil om content was differently influenced by it in various css for example when compared to the si treatment soil om content was significantly decreased by the ci treatment in the first cs but was increased in the second cs moreover soil om content was also significantly affected by cs p 0 001 table 2 specifically in the second cs soil om content considerably increased in all treatments the values are approximately double compared with the first cs whereas in the third cs soil om content decreased table s2 this might result from the fact that the average temperature was higher in the first 23 7 and third 21 5 css than the second cs 15 6 resulting in lower soil om contents higher temperatures often lead to higher soil om mineralization rates but lower om contents similar to soil om other nutrients were also significantly affected by the it cs interaction all p 0 001 table 2 for instance soil total n was significantly decreased by the ai and ci treatments in the first cs but was increased by the si and ci treatments in the second cs when compared to the fi treatment soil total p was significantly decreased by the bi ai and ci treatments in the first cs but was increased by the si ai and ci treatments in the second cs when compared to the fi treatment with respect to available nutrients available p in the first and second css and mn in all three css were significantly decreased while available n in the second cs and fe in the first and second css were increased by the si treatment compared to the fi treatment when compared to the si treatment available p was increased by the bi and ci treatments in the second cs and by the bi treatment in the third cs while available mn was increased by the bi and ai treatments in all three css in addition

mg2 and hco3 increased compared with the first cs whereas the so4 2 cl and no3 on average decreased there were also significant interactive effects of it cs on all soil ions all p 0 01 table 2 for instance when compared to the ai treatment soil na was significantly increased by the ci treatment in the second css but was decreased in the third cs fig 2 moreover when compared to the ai treatment the ci treatment significantly increased soil ec in the first and second css but decreased it in the third cs irrigation treatments significantly affected soil ion ratios and sar table s3 specifically the k na k mg2 ca2 mg2 and cl so4 2 ratios were generally decreased while the cl no3 ratio and sar were increased by the si treatment compared to the fi treatment during the three seasons the k na k

with fi treatment compared to the si treatment the bi treatment significantly increased the k na k mg2 and ca2 mg2 ratios in the second and third css and the cl so4 2 ratio in all three css while the ai treatment significantly increased the k na and cl so4 2 ratios in the second and third css and the k mg2 and ca2 mg2 ratios in the third cs with respect to the ci treatment it significantly increased the k na and k mg2 ratios in the second and third css and the ca2 mg2 and cl so4 2 ratios in the third cs during the three seasons the k na k mg2 ca2 mg2 and cl so4 2 ratios increased on average of 51 4 52 5 16 4 and 38 8 respectively in cu related treatments bi ai and ci compared with si treatment additionally in all three css sar values were lower in ai treatment than si treatment with reductions ranging from 11 2 to 42 9 3 3 plant cations cation ratios and nutrients with respect to exchangeable cations in the plant na and k in all tissues were significantly affected by it cs and the it cs interaction all p 0 001 table 3 in general the na concentrations in all tissues were increased while the k concentrations except for root k in the third cs were decreased by the si treatment compared to the fi treatment resulting in significant reductions in the k na ratio under the si treatment fig 3 during the three seasons the k na ratio in roots stems and leaves decreased on average of 36 4 52 8 and 46 6 respectively in si treatment compared with fi treatment however compared to the si treatment the k na ratio was generally increased by the bi ai and ci treatments except for the k na ratios of roots and leaves in ai treatment in the first cs and those of roots and stems in bi treatment in the third cs during the three seasons the k na ratio in roots stems and leaves increased on average of 21 6 41 1 and 28 5 respectively in cu related treatments bi ai and ci compared with si treatment in addition at the end of the third cs the k na ratio in plants increased compared with the first cs there were also significant interactive effects of it cs on the k na ratio in plant tissues all p 0 001 table 3 for instance when compared to the bi treatment the k na ratios in leaves were significantly lower by the ai and ci treatments in the first cs but were increased in the third cs fig 3 similar to na and k all tested nutrients in plant tissues were strongly affected by it cs and the it cs interaction all p 0 001 table 3 overall within macronutrients total n and p contents were higher while total k content was lower under saline water related treatments than under the fi treatment table s4 although total ca content was generally decreased by the si treatment compared to the fi treatment it was increased by the bi treatment in roots and stems in the

si treatment table s5 total mg contents in stems and leaves were generally higher in the second and third css under the saline water related treatments than under the fi treatment table s5 with respect to micronutrients i e fe zn and mn and cu there was no obvious trend between the si and fi treatments tables s5 and s6 it was noted that total mn content was generally increased by the bi

increased pn in the first cs gs in the second and third css and e in all three css with respect to the ci treatment it decreased pn and increased ci in the second and third css as compared to the si treatment in addition the influence of it on chlorophyll was not significant p 0 05 table 3 3 5 plant growth rate plant biomass fruit yield and fruit quality the relative growth rates rgrs of plant height stem and leaf area stem biomass and fruit yield were significantly influenced by it cs and the it cs interaction all p 0 05 tables 3 and 4 in addition the leaf biomass was significantly influenced by it and cs both p 0 001 specifically the rgr of plant height in the first and second css the rgr of leaf area in the third cs and stem biomass and fruit yield in all three css were significantly lower in si treatment than fi treatment fig 5 however the rgr of plant height and leaf area were significantly higher for the ai treatment in the third cs and for the ci treatment in the first cs as compared to the si treatment moreover in all three seasons the leaf biomass was significantly higher in ai treatment than si treatment with an average increase of 34 3 it was noteworthy that fruit yields in the second and third css were significantly higher in ai treatment than si treatment with average increases of 54 9 and 74 9 the effects of it on fruit quality related parameters were generally significant table 4 overall compared to the fi treatment the saline water related treatments showed higher contents of vitamin c and soluble solids in the second and third css and soluble sugar glucose fructose and starch in the third cs fig 6 however in the second and third css fruit titratable acidity was lowest in ai treatment with average decreases of 10 3 and 28 4 compared with fi treatment 3 6 response of plant productivity to soil properties and plant parameters the pca analysis of soil properties fig 7 showed that the bi ai and ci treatments were clearly separated from the si and fi treatments while the pca analysis of plant parameters fig 7 showed clear separations among all treatments overall the pc1 was significantly correlated with most soil properties table s7 or plant parameters table s8 moreover strong relationships between the pc1 and plant productivity tpb and fy were found for both soil properties and plant parameters all p 0 001 fig 7 4 discussion for crop production saline water is generally a double edged sword which has the potential to meet crop demands for water but may also result in crop yield reduction after continuous irrigation hussain et al 2015 baath et al 2017 alharby et al 2018 although conjunctive use cu of saline water and freshwater has been increasingly used as an alternative to exclusive use of saline water ramos et al 2012 machekposhti et al 2017 murad et al 2018 it is still needed to comprehensively compare and evaluate the differences in efficiency among different cu strategies e g blending alternate and cycling irrigation when used for crop production obviously continuous irrigation with saline water could easily lead to adverse effects on tomato yield in fact in the third cs the biomass and fruit yields were lowest in the si and bi treatments respectively with average decreases of 40 2 and 57 7 compared with fi fig 5 adverse effects of salinity may be due to ion toxicity osmotic stress or both zhu 2016 chinnusamy et al 2005 considered that when ec was less than 3 0 ms cm 1 ion toxicity rather than osmotic stress was the predominant cause of crop susceptibility to salinity ion toxicity was mainly induced by three salt ions including na cl and so4 2 chinnusamy et al 2005 because our saline water had obviously higher na cl and so4 2 concentrations than freshwater table 1 continuous irrigation with saline water led to significantly increased salt ions in soils compare si versus fi figs 2 and 7 despite this at the end of the third cs soil na cl and so4 2 concentrations were significantly lower under blending alternate or cycling irrigation fig 2 compared to continuous irrigation with saline water inferring that ion toxicity could be alleviated by cu strategies these results agree with malash et al 2008 who reported that the blending 40 freshwater mixed with 60 saline water and alternate 40 of irrigations with freshwater and 60 with saline water irrigations decreased soil salinity under both drip and furrow irrigations in tomato production as compared to irrigation with 100 saline water in addition to reduced salt accumulation other soil properties improved by cu strategies such as reduced sar and increased k na compare bi ai and ci versus si fig 7 might also have beneficial effects on plant growth this could be partly supported by the results reported by chauhan et al 2007 who found that the conjunctive use of alkali and good quality canal waters could maintain the sar at relatively low levels in soils and strongly increase the yields of potato sunflower and sesbania as compared to alkali water irrigation the soil with less sar generally has lower exchangeable sodium percentage and higher soil infiltration rate muyen et al 2011 since na induced k deficiencies are closely associated with crop growth reduction under salt stress increasing the k na ratio in soils has the potential to enhance plant na tolerance through enhancing k absorption by roots sunarpi et al 2005 hauser and horie 2010 generally different cu strategies reduce soil salinity through different mechanisms blending irrigation reduces salt input into soils malash et al 2008 ramos et al 2012 machekposhti et al 2017 while alternate irrigation leach salts from soils by freshwater irrigation malash et al 2005 murtaza et al 2006 with respect to cycling irrigation it prevents crops from suffering salt stress during salt sensitive growth stages grattan and oster 2003 murad et al 2018 it seems that the blending alternate and cycling strategies should have different effects on soil properties interestingly however these three strategies i e bi ai and ci could not be clearly separated from each other based on the pca analysis of soil properties fig 7 this is in contrast with results reported by chauhan et al 2007 who observed that soil properties e g ph ec and sar under the blending strategy were obviously different from those under the alternate strategy when alkali water was conjunctively used with good quality canal water to date however most studies related to cu strategies have focused mainly on plant parameters and or only a few soil properties malash et al 2005 chauhan et al 2007 malash et al 2008 machekposhti et al 2017 murad et al 2018 the high degree of similarity in soil properties among the blending alternate and cycling strategies in our study could be explained by the fact that i the influence of irrigation strategies on soil properties might be weakened by the effects of plant growth on soils e g water uptake nutrient absorption and secondary metabolite release which was induced by irrigation strategies malash et al 2012 hussain et al 2015 jalali et al 2017 ii the complex interaction between soil properties such as the close relationship between the nutrient availability and soil ph lucas and davis 1961 reduced the overall difference in soil properties among cu strategies and iii the same total salt inputs between bi ai and ci treatments resulted in similar soil properties among cu strategies because soils had similar responses to similar salt inputs tedeschi and dell aquila 2005 zhang et al 2018 despite the marked similarity in soil properties different cu strategies were clearly separated from each other based on the pca analysis of plant parameters fig 7 plant salt stress alleviation could be partly attributed to the fact that cu strategies might enhance plant tolerance to na stress by reducing na but increasing k and k na ratio in plant tissues figs 3 and 7 hauser and horie 2010 edelstein et al 2011 huang et al 2013 indeed plant parameters pc1 which explained 55 2 of the total variation and was significantly correlated with both plant biomass and fruit yield fig 7 was strongly correlated with na k and k na in all plant tissues table s8 since the ai and ci treatments were clearly separated from the bi treatment along the plant parameters pc1 fig 7 there were distinct differences in plant na k and k na among cu strategies to date however little attention has been paid to plant na k and k na in most studies related to cu strategies malash et al 2005 chauhan et al 2007 malash et al 2008 machekposhti et al 2017 murad et al 2018 the significant difference in na k and k na among the cu strategies could infer that different cu strategies induced different levels of salt tolerance in plants in addition to k other nutrient elements e g n p ca mg fe mn zn and cu closely associated with plant growth gruber et al 2013 were also differently affected by different cu strategies fig 7 table s8 this could be caused by the fact that different cu strategies led to various salt compositions and concentrations in the rootzone figs 1 and 2 and finally resulted in different nutrient uptakes by plants tables s4 s6 although effects of it on plant nutrient elements were statistically significant table 3 it was hard to find a regular change tables s4 s6 this comes as no surprise since the influence of cu strategies on plant nutrient uptake was also affected by cropping season table 3 that is the absorption of some elements might be enhanced by a cu strategy in one cropping season but not in another cropping season plant parameters showed a strong association with fruit yield fig 7 within cu strategies the alternate irrigation generally showed relatively higher fruit yields and even had no significant yield reduction as compared to freshwater irrigation in the first and third cropping seasons fig 5 this is in contrast with results reported by malash et al 2008 who observed that irrigation with freshwater blended with saline water showed higher tomato yields than the alternate irrigation in an open field in egypt this difference could be attributed partly to the fact that water salinity 4 5 ms cm 1 used in malash et al 2008 was significantly higher than that used in this study 3 0 ms cm 1 table 1 and was so high that the efficiency of freshwater in leaching salt ions from soils was reduced under the alternate strategy indeed an obvious disadvantage for the alternate strategy is that if there is no sufficient freshwater to leach salts salt accumulation during irrigation with saline water may still show suppression effects on plant growth malash et al 2005 our results also disagree with murad et al 2018 who reported that the cycling strategy irrigation with freshwater at early sensitive stages combined with saline water at later tolerant stages could minimize yield loss of maize in saline coastal region of bangladesh instead of reducing the number of irrigation events perhaps not surprisingly since the irrigation frequency used in this study 17 23 irrigations per cropping season was much higher than that used in murad et al 2018 only 2 3 irrigations per cropping season high irrigation frequency of saline water at later tolerant stages in this study might still result in high soil salinity and ion toxicity stress in plants under the cycling strategy in contrast under the alternate strategy the salt accumulated in the soil profile during irrigation with saline water could be leached frequently from the soil when crops were irrigated with freshwater murtaza et al 2006 although the fruit yield was significantly lower for the alternate irrigation as compared to freshwater irrigation in the second cropping season it did not mean that the alternate irrigation was unsuitable for tomato production actually for most crops there was a trade off between crop yield and fruit quality bustan et al 2005 xiao et al 2015 waltz 2015 if farmers concentrate their attention upon fruit yield therefore other agricultural practices efficient in alleviating plant salt stress such as organic matter application cao et al 2016 may still need to be applied to attenuate the disadvantages of the alternate irrigation in order to maximize crop yields under saline water irrigation if the fruit quality is concerned however the benefit of alternate irrigation may exceed that of continuous freshwater irrigation since it can maintain not only a relatively high yield but also obviously improved fruit quality such as increased vitamin c soluble sugar and solids glucose fructose and sucrose fig 6 vitamin c is an essential nutrient for humans sugars such as glucose fructose and sucrose affect the flavor of tomato and are important determinants of taste in tomato fruits velterop and vos 2001 generally consumers are more attracted to tomato fruits with higher sugars in addition soluble sugar plays an important role in the osmotic adjustment munns and tester 2008 to date few studies have been performed to simultaneously compare the blending alternate and cycling irrigations in crop soil systems moreover most studies related to cu strategies mainly focused on only a few plant parameters and or soil properties malash et al 2005 chauhan et al 2007 malash et al 2008 machekposhti et al 2017 murad et al 2018 the results of the current study based on comprehensive comparison of different saline water irrigation strategies suggested that under conditions with similar irrigation amounts of saline water and relatively high irrigation frequency e g 17 23 irrigations per copping season in this study the alternate irrigation rather than the blending and cycling irrigations was the best strategy to minimize yield loss of tomato due to saline water irrigation and to obtain general fruit quality improvement the biggest advantage of the alternate irrigation was the high frequency of salt leaching furthermore to improve the saline water use in agriculture and to maximize tomato yield other agricultural practices such as organic matter application are recommended to enhance the efficiency of the alternate irrigation 5 conclusions continuous irrigation with local saline water resulted in obvious salt accumulation in soils and crop growth reduction the adverse effects of saline water on both soil quality and crop growth and yield could be alleviated by conjunctive use of saline water and freshwater generally the alternate irrigation had more increasing potential in fruit yield than the blending and cycling irrigation it was noteworthy that in two out of three cropping seasons no significant difference in fruit yield was found between the alternate irrigation and continuous irrigation with freshwater moreover the alternate irrigation could maintain not only a relatively high fruit yield but also a general improvement in fruit quality although the blending alternate and cycling strategies could generally improve soil properties compared to continuous irrigation with saline water e g reduced soil ph ec na cl and so4 2 at the end of the third cs there was no distinct

11198,saline water has been increasingly used for crop production in areas characterized by freshwater shortage however continuous irrigation with saline water often results in adverse effects on the

tissues the relative growth rates of plant height and leaf area plant biomass and fruit yield compare si versus fi however these adverse effects of saline water on the soil crop system were generally alleviated by the bi ai and ci treatments compared to the si treatment despite this there was no distinct difference in soil properties among the bi ai and ci treatments the ai treatment generally showed higher fruit yield as compared to the bi and ci treatments and even no significant difference as compared to the fi treatment in two out of three cropping seasons in addition the ai treatment significantly increased vitamin c soluble sugar and solids glucose fructose and sucrose in tomato fruits as compared to the fi treatment our results suggested that the alternate irrigation ai was more

management soil crop system tomato quality 1 introduction irrigation water is one of the major factors determining crop yields and agricultural production hanjra and qureshi 2010 ierna and mauromicale 2018 it has been estimated that agricultural water use accounts for approximately 70 of global freshwater withdrawals and consumption haddeland et al 2014 however most regions of the world in particular in arid and semiarid areas are characterized by freshwater shortage azarnivand and chitsaz 2015 koutroulis et al 2018 generally to meet human needs freshwater is preferably allocated to urban water supply thereby restricting the amount of freshwater available for agricultural irrigation wu et al 2016 flörke et al 2018 since irrigation water is indispensable for crop growth and yield it is necessary to seek alternatives to freshwater that are available for irrigation saline water is a poor quality source of water jalali et al 2017 and has been used as an alternative to freshwater for hundreds of years stewart and hirst 1916 the most fundamental agricultural use for saline water is to provide water for plant absorption beltrán 1999 romero aranda et al 2001 reina sánchez et al 2005 some additional uses of saline water include improving fruit quality by reducing water content de pascale et al 2001 and increasing nutritional components in the fruit ben ahmed et al 2009 increasing the number of flowers per stem by inducing flower initiation and controlling stem height shillo et al 2002 and boosting crop yields through conjunctively using saline water and freshwater murad et al 2018 or applying irrigation under subsurface drainage systems feng et al 2017 generally in areas characterized by freshwater shortage saline water irrigation has the potential to partly meet plant demands for water and to maintain a certain level of crop yields however continuous irrigation with saline water often leads to reduced crop growth and agricultural productivity when compared to freshwater irrigation baath et al 2017 alharby et al 2018 for instance irrigation with saline water may induce salt accumulation in the rootzone li et al 2015 thereby restricting water and nutrient uptake by roots and limiting plant growth hussain et al 2015 therefore the choose of proper saline water management is the major challenge to enhance crop growth and yields conjunctive use cu of saline water and freshwater has been demonstrated to be efficient in alleviating the adverse effects of saline water on crop growth bharati et al 2008 murad et al 2018 to date several relatively efficient cu strategies such as blending and alternate irrigation have been successfully explored and applied in areas rich in saline water the blending strategy involves irrigating crops with the saline water mixed with high quality water e g freshwater malash et al 2008 since this strategy can result in a relatively low level of salinity in irrigation water it has been applied to several sensitive and or moderately sensitive crops such as potato chauhan et al 2007 tomato malash et al 2012 sweet sorghum ramos et al 2012 and oleic sunflower machekposhti et al 2017 the alternate strategy involves irrigating crops alternately with saline water and freshwater malash et al 2005 a great advantage of this strategy is probably the salt leaching effect of freshwater irrigation murtaza et al 2006 despite the benefits mentioned above there are limitations on the effectiveness of blending and alternate strategies since the proportion of saline water in blended water can significantly influence plant growth machekposhti et al 2017 the blending strategy is not always feasible kan and rapaport rom 2012 especially when water salinity exceeds crop salinity threshold grattan and oster 2003 with respect to the alternate strategy an obvious disadvantage is that if there is no sufficient freshwater to leach salts the salt accumulated in the soil profile due to saline water irrigation may still show suppression effects on plant growth malash et al 2005 moreover both the blending and alternate strategies are not generally developed based on plant growth stages which are crucial for roots to sense salts in the environment del amor et al 2001 in addition to blending and alternate irrigation cycling irrigation is another cu strategy that is efficient in reducing the adverse influence of saline water the cycling strategy involves using saline water solely for certain crops e g the relatively salt tolerant crops in crop rotation systems dudley et al 2008 or only during relatively salt tolerant growth stages when salt sensitive crops are grown grattan and oster 2003 this strategy has been successfully used to increase crop yields in some regions for instance murad et al 2018 demonstrated that irrigation with freshwater at early sensitive stages combined with saline water at later tolerant stages can minimize yield loss of maize in saline coastal region of bangladesh in regions characterized by freshwater shortage the optimal management strategies for saline irrigation should possess several features it should be suitable for local crops have high efficiency simple application and low costs and risks and require minimal freshwater inputs this means that the effectiveness of a saline water irrigation strategy should be evaluated based on a comprehensive analysis although the blending alternate and cycling strategies have been widely used in most regions of the world murtaza et al 2006 bharati et al 2008 ramos et al 2012 machekposhti et al 2017 murad et al 2018 there have been very few previous attempts to comprehensively compare the advantages and disadvantages of each of these three strategies since most areas in northwestern china are facing serious freshwater shortages and since saline water resources are relatively abundant in these regions an experimental trial under greenhouse conditions was carried out over two years with three tomato cropping seasons adopting exclusive and conjunctive blending alternate and cycling strategies use of fresh and saline water for irrigation therefore the main objectives of this study were 1 to compare the efficiency of different saline water irrigation strategies in alleviating salt stress in plants and to 2 explore the major factors reducing the adverse effects of saline water

directly using a ph meter fe28 mettler toledo shanghai china and an ec meter fe30 mettler toledo shanghai china respectively water cations k na ca2 and mg2 and anions so4 2 cl hco3 and co3 2 were determined using the methods described by rowell 1994 in addition sar was calculated using the equation described in murtaza et al 2006 tomato solanum lycopersicum l jingfan no 301 seedlings with four leaves were transplanted by hand with double rows of 150 cm row spacing and 45 cm plant spacing on the seedbed at the beginning of february winter spring cropping season and the end of july autumn winter cropping season the experimental layout was a completely randomized block design with three replicates and the size of each replicate plot was 3 0 m 6 5 m the distance between the replicate plots was 100 cm each replicate plot was separated from the adjacent replicate plots by plastic films buried at 0 100 cm soil depth each replicate of each treatment had its own replicate plot 3 0 m 6 5 m and it was realized in the same replicate plot for the different growing periods at the end of each growing period post harvest irrigation with freshwater had not been applied however before transplanting the tomato seedlings an irrigation with freshwater 350 m3 ha 1 had been applied to leach the salt accumulated in the soil profile from the previous crop and to reduce soil salt content in order to benefit seedling survival and the growth of the next crop each plot received same basal fertilizers on february 1 and july 25 in both 2016 and 2017 including 80 t ha 1 of organic

sampled in mid april may june and july and for the autumn winter cropping season soils were sampled in mid september october november and december respectively in both 2016 and 2017 soil ph was

following equation rgr lnq 2 lnq 1 t 2 t 1 where q 2 and q 1 present the ph or la at t 2 and t 1 respectively once the final harvest was completed plants were sampled randomly from 15 plants in the

results 3 1 soil ph salinity and nutrients soil ph and ec a measure of salt concentration in a sample were significantly affected by irrigation treatment it cropping season cs and the it cs interaction all p 0 01 table 2 in general the si treatment significantly increased both soil ph and ec in all three css when compared to the fi treatment fig 1 at the end of the third cs soil ph and ec values increased of 4 9 and 60 2 respectively in si treatment compared with fi treatment however when compared to the si treatment the bi treatment significantly decreased soil ph in the second and third css and soil ec in all three css while the ai and ci treatments reduced both soil ph and ec in all three css fig 1 at the end of the third cs soil ph and ec values decreased on average of 3 29 and 15 34 respectively in cu related treatments bi ai and ci compared with si treatment in addition at the end of the third cs the soil ph values decreased compared with the first cs whereas the ec on average increased there were also significant interactive effects of it cs on both soil ph and ec values both p 0 001 table 2 for instance when compared to the fi treatment soil ph was significantly increased by the bi treatment in the first and second css but was decreased in the third cs fig 1 moreover when compared to the ai treatment soil ec was significantly increased by the ci treatment in the first and second css but was decreased in the third cs all tested soil nutrients organic matter total n and p and available n p k cu zn fe and mn were significantly affected by it all p 0 01 table 2 specifically the si treatment significantly decreased soil organic matter om content in the second cs when compared to the fi treatment table s2 however due to the significant interactive effects of it cs all p 0 001 table 2 soil om content was differently influenced by it in various css for example when compared to the si treatment soil om content was significantly decreased by the ci treatment in the first cs but was increased in the second cs moreover soil om content was also significantly affected by cs p 0 001 table 2 specifically in the second cs soil om content considerably increased in all treatments the values are approximately double compared with the first cs whereas in the third cs soil om content decreased table s2 this might result from the fact that the average temperature was higher in the first 23 7 and third 21 5 css than the second cs 15 6 resulting in lower soil om contents higher temperatures often lead to higher soil om mineralization rates but lower om contents similar to soil om other nutrients were also significantly affected by the it cs interaction all p 0 001 table 2 for instance soil total n was significantly decreased by the ai and ci treatments in the first cs but was increased by the si and ci treatments in the second cs when compared to the fi treatment soil total p was significantly decreased by the bi ai and ci treatments in the first cs but was increased by the si ai and ci treatments in the second cs when compared to the fi treatment with respect to available nutrients available p in the first and second css and mn in all three css were significantly decreased while available n in the second cs and fe in the first and second css were increased by the si treatment compared to the fi treatment when compared to the si treatment available p was increased by the bi and ci treatments in the second cs and by the bi treatment in the third cs while available mn was increased by the bi and ai treatments in all three css in addition when compared to the fi treatment all saline water related treatments i e si bi ai and ci showed significantly lower available cu in the second and third css 3 2 soil ions ion ratios and sodium adsorption ratio soil ions ion ratios and sodium adsorption ratio sar were significantly influenced by it cs and the it cs interaction all p 0 01 table 2 generally the si treatment had significantly higher soil cation i e k na ca2 and mg2 and anion i e so4 2 cl hco3 and no3 concentrations except for k and ca2 in the first cs hco3 in the second cs and no3 in the first and third css fig 2 when compared to the fi treatment at the end of the third cs soil cations and anions increased on average of 75 2 and 77 3 respectively in si treatment compared with fi treatment however when compared to the si treatment the bi treatment significantly decreased the concentrations of k ca2 mg2 so4 2 and hco3 in the first cs mg2 and so4 2 in the second cs and most ions except for k and no3 in the third cs while the ai treatment reduced the concentrations of all tested ions in the first cs na mg2 so4 2 and no3 in the second cs and most ions except for k and no3 in the third cs moreover the ci treatment significantly decreased the concentrations of most ions except for no3 in the first and third css and all cations in the second cs when compared to the si treatment at the end of the third cs soil na cl and so4 2 decreased on average of 30 8 28 4 and 45 2 respectively in cu related treatments bi ai and ci compared with si treatment in addition at the end of the third cs the soil k ca2 mg2 and hco3 increased compared with the first cs whereas the so4 2 cl and no3 on average decreased there were also significant interactive effects of it cs on all soil ions all p 0 01 table 2 for instance when compared to the ai treatment soil na was significantly increased by the ci treatment in the second css but was decreased in the third cs fig 2 moreover when compared to the ai treatment the ci treatment significantly increased soil ec in the first and second css but decreased it in the third cs irrigation treatments significantly affected soil ion ratios and sar table s3 specifically the k na k mg2 ca2 mg2 and cl so4 2 ratios were generally decreased while the cl no3 ratio and sar were increased by the si treatment compared to the fi treatment during the three seasons the k na k mg2 ca2 mg2 and cl so4 2 ratios decreased on average of 56 1 49 9 38 9 and 23 4 respectively while the cl no3 and sar ratios increased on average of 49 0 and 43 1 respectively in si treatment compared with fi treatment compared to the si treatment the bi treatment significantly increased the k na k mg2 and ca2 mg2 ratios in the second and third css and the cl so4 2 ratio in all three css while the ai treatment significantly increased the k na and cl so4 2 ratios in the second and third css and the k mg2 and ca2 mg2 ratios in the third cs with respect to the ci treatment it significantly increased the k na and k mg2 ratios in the second and third css and the ca2 mg2 and cl so4 2 ratios in the third cs during the three seasons the k na k mg2 ca2 mg2 and cl so4 2 ratios increased on average of 51 4 52 5 16 4 and 38 8 respectively in cu related treatments bi ai and ci compared with si treatment additionally in all three css sar values were lower in ai treatment than si treatment with reductions ranging from 11 2 to 42 9 3 3 plant cations cation ratios and nutrients with respect to exchangeable cations in the plant na and k in all tissues were significantly affected by it cs and the it cs interaction all p 0 001 table 3 in general the na concentrations in all tissues were increased while the k concentrations except for root k in the third cs were decreased by the si treatment compared to the fi treatment resulting in significant reductions in the k na ratio under the si treatment fig 3 during the three seasons the k na ratio in roots stems and leaves decreased on average of 36 4 52 8 and 46 6 respectively in si treatment compared with fi treatment however compared to the si treatment the k na ratio was generally increased by the bi ai and ci treatments except for the k na ratios of roots and leaves in ai treatment in the first cs and those of roots and stems in bi treatment in the third cs during the three seasons the k na ratio in roots stems and leaves increased on average of 21 6 41 1 and 28 5 respectively in cu related treatments bi ai and ci compared with si treatment in addition at the end of the third cs the k na ratio in plants increased compared with the first cs there were also significant interactive effects of it cs on the k na ratio in plant tissues all p 0 001 table 3 for instance when compared to the bi treatment the k na ratios in leaves were significantly lower by the ai and ci treatments in the first cs but were increased in the third cs fig 3 similar to na and k all tested nutrients in plant tissues were strongly affected by it cs and the it cs interaction all p 0 001 table 3 overall within macronutrients total n and p contents were higher while total k content was lower under saline water related treatments than under the fi treatment table s4 although total ca content was generally decreased by the si treatment compared to the fi treatment it was increased by the bi treatment in roots and stems in the first cs by the ai treatment in all tissues in the first cs and in stems in the second cs and by the ci treatment in all tissues in the first cs and in roots and stems in the second cs compared to the si treatment table s5 total mg contents in stems and leaves were generally higher in the second and third css under the saline water related treatments than under the fi treatment table s5 with respect to micronutrients i e fe zn and mn and cu there was no obvious trend between the si and fi treatments tables s5 and s6 it was noted that total mn content was generally increased by the bi treatment compared to the fi treatment except for total mn in roots in the third cs 3 4 leaf photosynthetic indexes and chlorophyll all leaf photosynthetic indexes were significantly influenced by it and cs p 0 001 table 3 moreover the pn ci and e were also significantly influenced by the it cs interaction all p 0 05 the si treatment showed lower ci in the second and third css gs in the third cs and e in all three css fig 4 as compared to the fi treatment when compared to the si treatment the bi treatment decreased pn and increased ci and e in the second and third css while the ai treatment increased pn in the first cs gs in the second and third css and e in all three css with respect to the ci treatment it decreased pn and increased ci in the second and third css as compared to the si treatment in addition the influence of it on chlorophyll was not significant p 0 05 table 3 3 5 plant growth rate plant biomass fruit yield and fruit quality the relative growth rates rgrs of plant height stem and leaf area stem biomass and fruit yield were significantly influenced by it cs and the it cs interaction all p 0 05 tables 3 and 4 in addition the leaf biomass was significantly influenced by it and cs both p 0 001 specifically the rgr of plant height in the first and second css the rgr of leaf area in the third cs and stem biomass and fruit yield in all three css were significantly lower in si treatment than fi treatment fig 5 however the rgr of plant height and leaf area were significantly higher for the ai treatment in the third cs and for the ci treatment in the first cs as compared to the si treatment moreover in all three seasons the leaf biomass was significantly higher in ai treatment than si treatment with an average increase of 34 3 it was noteworthy that fruit yields in the second and third css were significantly higher in ai treatment than si treatment with average increases of 54 9 and 74 9 the effects of it on fruit quality related parameters were generally significant table 4 overall compared to the fi treatment the saline water related treatments showed higher contents of vitamin c and soluble solids in the second and third css and soluble sugar glucose fructose and starch in the third cs fig 6 however in the second and third css fruit titratable acidity was lowest in ai treatment with average decreases of 10 3 and 28 4 compared with fi treatment 3 6 response of plant productivity to soil properties and plant parameters the pca analysis of soil properties fig 7 showed that the bi ai and ci treatments were clearly separated from the si and fi treatments while the pca analysis of plant parameters fig 7 showed clear separations among all treatments overall the pc1 was significantly correlated with most soil properties table s7 or plant parameters table s8 moreover strong relationships between the pc1 and plant productivity tpb and fy were found for both soil properties and plant parameters all p 0 001 fig 7 4 discussion for crop production saline water is generally a double edged sword which has the potential to meet crop demands for water but may also result in crop yield reduction after continuous irrigation hussain et al 2015 baath et al 2017 alharby et al 2018 although conjunctive use cu of saline water and freshwater has been increasingly used as an alternative to exclusive use of saline water ramos et al 2012 machekposhti et al 2017 murad et al 2018 it is still needed to comprehensively compare and evaluate the differences in efficiency among different cu strategies e g blending alternate and cycling irrigation when used for crop production obviously continuous irrigation with saline water could easily lead to adverse effects on tomato yield in fact in the third cs the biomass and fruit yields were lowest in the si and bi treatments respectively with average decreases of 40 2 and 57 7 compared with fi fig 5 adverse effects of salinity may be due to ion toxicity osmotic stress or both zhu 2016 chinnusamy et al 2005 considered that when ec was less than 3 0 ms cm 1 ion toxicity rather than osmotic stress was the predominant cause of crop susceptibility to salinity ion toxicity was mainly induced by three salt ions including na cl and so4 2 chinnusamy et al 2005 because our saline water had obviously higher na cl and so4 2 concentrations than freshwater table 1 continuous irrigation with saline water led to significantly increased salt ions in soils compare si versus fi figs 2 and 7 despite this at the end of the third cs soil na cl and so4 2 concentrations were significantly lower under blending alternate or cycling irrigation fig 2 compared to continuous irrigation with saline water inferring that ion toxicity could be alleviated by cu strategies these results agree with malash et al 2008 who reported that the blending 40 freshwater mixed with 60 saline water and alternate 40 of irrigations with freshwater and 60 with saline water irrigations decreased soil salinity under both drip and furrow irrigations in tomato production as compared to irrigation with 100 saline water in addition to reduced salt accumulation other soil properties improved by cu strategies such as reduced sar and increased k na compare bi ai and ci versus si fig 7 might also have beneficial effects on plant growth this could be partly supported by the results reported by chauhan et al 2007 who found that the conjunctive use of alkali and good quality canal waters could maintain the sar at relatively low levels in soils and strongly increase the yields of potato sunflower and sesbania as compared to alkali water irrigation the soil with less sar generally has lower exchangeable sodium percentage and higher soil infiltration rate muyen et al 2011 since na induced k deficiencies are closely associated with crop growth reduction under salt stress increasing the k na ratio in soils has the potential to enhance plant na tolerance through enhancing k absorption by roots sunarpi et al 2005 hauser and horie 2010 generally different cu strategies reduce soil salinity through different mechanisms blending irrigation reduces salt input into soils malash et al 2008 ramos et al 2012 machekposhti et al 2017 while alternate irrigation leach salts from soils by freshwater irrigation malash et al 2005 murtaza et al 2006 with respect to cycling irrigation it prevents crops from suffering salt stress during salt sensitive growth stages grattan and oster 2003 murad et al 2018 it seems that the blending alternate and cycling strategies should have different effects on soil properties interestingly however these three strategies i e bi ai and ci could not be clearly separated from each other based on the pca analysis of soil properties fig 7 this is in contrast with results reported by chauhan et al 2007 who observed that soil properties e g ph ec and sar under the blending strategy were obviously different from those under the alternate strategy when alkali water was conjunctively used with good quality canal water to date however most studies related to cu strategies have focused mainly on plant parameters and or only a few soil properties malash et al 2005 chauhan et al 2007 malash et al 2008 machekposhti et al 2017 murad et al 2018 the high degree of similarity in soil properties among the blending alternate and cycling strategies in our study could be explained by the fact that i the influence of irrigation strategies on soil properties might be weakened by the effects of plant growth on soils e g water uptake nutrient absorption and secondary metabolite release which was induced by irrigation strategies malash et al 2012 hussain et al 2015 jalali et al 2017 ii the complex interaction between soil properties such as the close relationship between the nutrient availability and soil ph lucas and davis 1961 reduced the overall difference in soil properties among cu strategies and iii the same total salt inputs between bi ai and ci treatments resulted in similar soil properties among cu strategies because soils had similar responses to similar salt inputs tedeschi and dell aquila 2005 zhang et al 2018 despite the marked similarity in soil properties different cu strategies were clearly separated from each other based on the pca analysis of plant parameters fig 7 plant salt stress alleviation could be partly attributed to the fact that cu strategies might enhance plant tolerance to na stress by reducing na but increasing k and k na ratio in plant tissues figs 3 and 7 hauser and horie 2010 edelstein et al 2011 huang et al 2013 indeed plant parameters pc1 which explained 55 2 of the total variation and was significantly correlated with both plant biomass and fruit yield fig 7 was strongly correlated with na k and k na in all plant tissues table s8 since the ai and ci treatments were clearly separated from the bi treatment along the plant parameters pc1 fig 7 there were distinct differences in plant na k and k na among cu strategies to date however little attention has been paid to plant na k and k na in most studies related to cu strategies malash et al 2005 chauhan et al 2007 malash et al 2008 machekposhti et al 2017 murad et al 2018 the significant difference in na k and k na among the cu strategies could infer that different cu strategies induced different levels of salt tolerance in plants in addition to k other nutrient elements e g n p ca mg fe mn zn and cu closely associated with plant growth gruber et al 2013 were also differently affected by different cu strategies fig 7 table s8 this could be caused by the fact that different cu strategies led to various salt compositions and concentrations in the rootzone figs 1 and 2 and finally resulted in different nutrient uptakes by plants tables s4 s6 although effects of it on plant nutrient elements were statistically significant table 3 it was hard to find a regular change tables s4 s6 this comes as no surprise since the influence of cu strategies on plant nutrient uptake was also affected by cropping season table 3 that is the absorption of some elements might be enhanced by a cu strategy in one cropping season but not in another cropping season plant parameters showed a strong association with fruit yield fig 7 within cu strategies the alternate irrigation generally showed relatively higher fruit yields and even had no significant yield reduction as compared to freshwater irrigation in the first and third cropping seasons fig 5 this is in contrast with results reported by malash et al 2008 who observed that irrigation with freshwater blended with saline water showed higher tomato yields than the alternate irrigation in an open field in egypt this difference could be attributed partly to the fact that water salinity 4 5 ms cm 1 used in malash et al 2008 was significantly higher than that used in this study 3 0 ms cm 1 table 1 and was so high that the efficiency of freshwater in leaching salt ions from soils was reduced under the alternate strategy indeed an obvious disadvantage for the alternate strategy is that if there is no sufficient freshwater to leach salts salt accumulation during irrigation with saline water may still show suppression effects on plant growth malash et al 2005 our results also disagree with murad et al 2018 who reported that the cycling strategy irrigation with freshwater at early sensitive stages combined with saline water at later tolerant stages could minimize yield loss of maize in saline coastal region of bangladesh instead of reducing the number of irrigation events perhaps not surprisingly since the irrigation frequency used in this study 17 23 irrigations per cropping season was much higher than that used in murad et al 2018 only 2 3 irrigations per cropping season high irrigation frequency of saline water at later tolerant stages in this study might still result in high soil salinity and ion toxicity stress in plants under the cycling strategy in contrast under the alternate strategy the salt accumulated in the soil profile during irrigation with saline water could be leached frequently from the soil when crops were irrigated with freshwater murtaza et al 2006 although the fruit yield was significantly lower for the alternate irrigation as compared to freshwater irrigation in the second cropping season it did not mean that the alternate irrigation was unsuitable for tomato production actually for most crops there was a trade off between crop yield and fruit quality bustan et al 2005 xiao et al 2015 waltz 2015 if farmers concentrate their attention upon fruit yield therefore other agricultural practices efficient in alleviating plant salt stress such as organic matter application cao et al 2016 may still need to be applied to attenuate the disadvantages of the alternate irrigation in order to maximize crop yields under saline water irrigation if the fruit quality is concerned however the benefit of alternate irrigation may exceed that of continuous freshwater irrigation since it can maintain not only a relatively high yield but also obviously improved fruit quality such as increased vitamin c soluble sugar and solids glucose fructose and sucrose fig 6 vitamin c is an essential nutrient for humans sugars such as glucose fructose and sucrose affect the flavor of tomato and are important determinants of taste in tomato fruits velterop and vos 2001 generally consumers are more attracted to tomato fruits with higher sugars in addition soluble sugar plays an important role in the osmotic adjustment munns and tester 2008 to date few studies have been performed to simultaneously compare the blending alternate and cycling irrigations in crop soil systems moreover most studies related to cu strategies mainly focused on only a few plant parameters and or soil properties malash et al 2005 chauhan et al 2007 malash et al 2008 machekposhti et al 2017 murad et al 2018 the results of the current study based on comprehensive comparison of different saline water irrigation strategies suggested that under conditions with similar irrigation amounts of saline water and relatively high irrigation frequency e g 17 23 irrigations per copping season in this study the alternate irrigation rather than the blending and cycling irrigations was the best strategy to minimize yield loss of tomato due to saline water irrigation and to obtain general fruit quality improvement the biggest advantage of the alternate irrigation was the high frequency of salt leaching furthermore to improve the saline water use in agriculture and to maximize tomato yield other agricultural practices such as organic matter application are recommended to enhance the efficiency of the alternate irrigation 5 conclusions continuous irrigation with local saline water resulted in obvious salt accumulation in soils and crop growth reduction the adverse effects of saline water on both soil quality and crop growth and yield could be alleviated by conjunctive use of saline water and freshwater generally the alternate irrigation had more increasing potential in fruit yield than the blending and cycling irrigation it was noteworthy that in two out of three cropping seasons no significant difference in fruit yield was found between the alternate irrigation and continuous irrigation with freshwater moreover the alternate irrigation could maintain not only a relatively high fruit yield but also a general improvement in fruit quality although the blending alternate and cycling strategies could generally improve soil properties compared to continuous irrigation with saline water e g reduced soil ph ec na cl and so4 2 at the end of the third cs there was no distinct

11199,plough pan can affect crop growth nutrient uptake and the fates of substances in the environment to determine the effects of plough pan thickness on crop and environment a field survey and a field experiment were conducted on a typical calcareous fluvo aquic soil in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system in northern china plain from 2014 to 2016 specifically the thickness of plough pans was surveyed in 108 field plots in 2014 and then based on the survey results a field experiment was established to study the effects of different plough pan thicknesses pp15 15 cm of plough pan pp10 10 cm of plough pan pp5 5 cm of plough pan pp0 0 cm of plough pan on crop growth nitrogen n utilization and the environment the survey showed that the thickness of topsoil averaged at 14 7 cm and the plough pan was approximately 15 cm deep the plough pan was found at 76 of the survey locations and it was distributed commonly from 15 to 30 cm beneath the soil surface breaking the original plough pan partially or completely could promote the net photosynthesis rate leaf water use efficiency crop yield and n use efficiency decrease n2o emission but increase co2 emission among all treatments breaking plough pans completely pp0 and by 2 3 pp5 resulted in best crop performance whose photosynthetic parameters especially net photosynthetic rate and leaf water use efficiency were significantly higher than pp10 and pp15 for both wheat and maize pp5 resulted in greater yield 7 130 kg ha 1 for wheat and 8 240 kg ha 1 for maize than other treatments although it did not differ with pp0 significantly pp5 had significantly higher n uptake 410 kg ha 1 and n use efficiency 40 1 than pp10 and pp15 the magnitude of n2o emission peak decreased with an increasing degree of plough pan breakage the cumulative n2o emission and intensity in pp5 was obviously lower than that in pp10 and pp15 annual cumulative co2 emission did not differ significantly among pp5 pp10 and pp15 net ecosystem productivity nep of the rotation system increased as the thickness of plough pan decreased so pp5 had relative higher nep 9 740 kg c ha 1 than pp10 and pp15 thus considering better crop growth higher yield optimized n utilization lower n2o and co2 emissions as well as higher nep and less mechanical costs breaking the original plough pan partially is a good choice to ameliorating the plough pan restrictions in the northern china plain keywords plough pan crop yield n utilization net primary productivity n2o emission co2emission 1 introduction the northern china plain ncp is one of the most important areas for china s food security wang et al 2014 which produces nearly 20 of the national grains in this region winter wheat summer maize double cropping rotation is the most typical cropping system which has been practiced for over 50 years and is characterized by high inputs of fertilizer irrigation water and other chemicals in order to achieve food safety duan et al 2014 maize mainly relies on rainfall while wheat depends on irrigation due to the annual precipitation distribution patterns in ncp annually irrigation water amounts approximately 240 mm being applied in three to five events zhang et al 2015a 2018 however irrigation regime of wheat maize is extensive and crop water use efficiency is low which leads to severe depletion of groundwater resources regional water shortage is very serious in this area and the irrational tillage structure which can t conserve water and fertilizer has exacerbated this situation sang et al 2016 before the reform and opening policy was started in late 1970s tillage measure in ncp was mainly digging and turning over the soil using home made simple plough like moldboard plow or disc plough du et al 2013 with the development of agricultural machinery deep tillage machine and rotary cultivator improved the formation of deep loosening and rotary tillage zhai et al 2017 although reduced and no tillage were also used in ncp it must be plowed after one or several years in order to improve soil air and moisture permeability gathala et al 2015 huang et al 2015 now small agricultural machinery dominates agricultural production in the ncp as a result of decentralized management of farmlands field traffic and long term rotary tillage with a depth of less than 20 cm using the small machinery with rotary tillers lead to soil compaction hard plough pan and shallow cultivated layer which seriously limits crop growth wiermann et al 2000 soil compaction often appears in the subsoil layer after long term planting especially under reduced tillage shallow rotary tillage and forms so called plough pan beneath the plough layer liu et al 2010 sang et al 2016 sip et al 2013 in ncp the plough pan is not only widespread but also very thick about 15 cm under the traditional rotary based tillage and it has become a major problem constraining crop production liu et al 2015 sang et al 2016 zhai et al 2017 the subsoils under cultivated top soils can store large amounts of water and nutrient and meet the needs of deep rooted crops even in drought situation schneider et al 2017 however plough pan barriers connectivity of water fertilizer gas heat between the topsoil and the subsoils thus reducing crop production dong et al 2017 zhai et al 2017 currently in order to solve the problem of thick plough pan in the ncp agronomists have proposed different methods of managing the cultivated layer ma et al 2015 phiri et al 2003 subsoiling plays an important role in efficiently breaking up the plough pan in field management cai et al 2014 tillage especially subsoiling could improve the availability of the subsoil resources for plant utilization which can be regarded as one of the most important agricultural management practices for increasing crop yield brennan et al 2014 guan et al 2014 subsoiling tillage promotes soil water content grain yield and significantly reduces lodging rate compared to no tillage bian et al 2016 lin et al 2016 deep tillage to 50 cm can obviously facilitate root morphology and resistance to environmental stress cai et al 2014 changing no tillage to subsoiling tillage was found to increase root growth and nutrient uptake leading to higher crop production guan et al 2014 many studies have demonstrated that greenhouse gas emissions from soils are the result of several complex biotic processes which depend on soil organic matter content and mineralization rate the number and activity of soil microbial groups soil animal respiration and so on behnke et al 2018 wang et al 2018 because different management practices have varying effects on soil carbon c and nitrogen n it might be possible to reduce n2o and co2 emissions by managing an appropriate thickness of plough pan through proper tillage yeboah et al 2016 however the effects of breaking the plough pan impertinently on crop production or greenhouse gas emissions would be negative some studies have showed that conventional intensive tillage declined crop yield and increased global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity compared with no tillage he et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 besides several long term field experiments have revealed that conservation tillage in dryland farming areas could improve soil quality and productivity li et al 2007 wang et al 2008 the reason for the differences found in different experiments may be associated with improper tillage practices building reasonable cultivated layer structure or plough pan is one of the key steps to achieve good soil condition higher production and better environmental benefits a proper arable layer has to reduce soil compaction increase water use efficiency facilitate root growth and improve yield lampurlanes et al 2001 further reasonable tillage practices must reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as n2o co2 and ch4 by increasing soil organic matter decreasing the rate of mineralization and changing soil microbial community structure the irrational thickness of plough pan constitutes an obstacle for root growth and utilization of soil nutrients recent research has proved that deep tillage practices can create a more favorable soil environment for root growth and crop production than shallow tillage zhai et al 2017 that is moderately breaking the plough pan could improve the soil structure and then increase crop growth however the effect of plough pan thickness on crop growth parameters and agricultural environment in ncp is not clear therefore the aims of our study were to firstly illuminate current situation of plough pan in ncp and then assess the effects of plough pan thickness on a crop growth including photosynthetic characteristics yield and net primary productivity npp b n utilization and c environment such as n2o and co2 emissions as well as net ecosystem productivity nep 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the northern china plain 32 40 n 114

evaporation and frost free period are approximately 14 15 c 500 900 mm 800 1 200 mm and 200 days respectively annual precipitation is not evenly distributed with 80 of the rainfall occurring between june and october so irrigation is needed when the water demand is high during the winter wheat growing season the most common irrigation method is flood irrigation and the irrigation water is pumped from a tributary of the yellow river which is the second longest river in china the traditional tillage method is rotary tillage to a depth of less than 15 cm using a small four wheel tractor after the annual harvest of summer maize the soils of this region are mostly covered by alluvial loess from several rivers such as the yellow river huaihe river haihe river and their tributaries according

regions with a wheat maize rotation in ncp fig 1 a geographical positioning system gps was used to locate and record the longitude and latitude of the survey sites soil profiles were excavated to determine the thickness of topsoil and plough pan according to their soil bulk density and soil penetration resistance generally plough pan has greater soil bulk density and penetration resistance significantly higher than other layers blanco canqui and ruis 2018 2 2 2 field experiment a winter wheat summer maize rotation field e116 19 46 33 n37 20 44 53 altitude 11 m above the average sea

that had been under conventional wheat maize rotation until the time of our experiment winter wheat cultivar jimai 22 was sown on october 23 2014 with row spacing of 20 cm and harvested on june 7 2015 summer maize cultivar zhengdan 958 was sown at a planting density of 67 500 plants ha 1 on june 22 2014 and harvested on october 10 nitrogen fertilizer 450 kg n ha 1 in total 210 for wheat and 240 kg n ha 1 for maize was applied based on local recommendations the n fertilizer was applied twice during each growing season basally at sowing wheat 42 9 maize 33 3 and top dressed at jointing stage of winter wheat 57 1 and when the maize had 11 12 leaves 66 7 all the phosphorous and potassium fertilizers wheat 150 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 75 kg k2o ha 1 maize 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 120 kg k2o ha 1 were basally applied across treatments two irrigation events for wheat totaling 120 mm water and one for maize 60 mm water were adopted additional field management practices such as tillage sowing and harvesting as well as residue incorporation followed the local conventional practices immediately before wheat sowing the harvested maize straw was shredded into small pieces and ploughed into soil 0 15 cm at wheat harvest the harvested wheat straw was applied back to the field by covering the ground 2 3 sampling 2 3 1 soil sampling during the field survey in 2014 soils of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm were sampled randomly in field plots by using a soil auger before the start of the field experiment soils of 0 15 cm 15 30 cm and 30 45 cm were also collected using the same method to determine basic physical and chemical properties 2 3 2 crop sampling at the mature stage of winter wheat a 1 0m 1 0 m subplot was selected per plot and the aboveground part and roots within a depth of 35 cm were sampled the plant samples were oven dried 105 c for 30 min and then 75 c for 24 h to a constant weight at the harvesting stage of summer maize three plants including roots in the soil 30 cm long 30 cm wide 35 cm deep were selected per plot and dried to a constant weight 2 3 3 greenhouse gas sampling static chambers were used to collect air samples for measuring the fluxes of n2o and co2 according to previous reports cui et al 2012 wang et al 2018 yan et al 2013 each chamber was made of a cube with stainless steel walls and frames bottom area of 40 50 cm and a height of 75 cm for each replicated field plot a stainless steel base frame 40 50 20 cm was permanently installed 20 cm into the soil although it was briefly removed one week before the events of tillage sowing basal fertilization and harvest there were nine holes of 2 cm diameter on the lower half of each base frame wall to allow for free water flow the stainless steel base was placed on the sowing line of wheat and maize and the crop seeds within the stainless steel bases were removed after sowing to eliminate interference from root respiration the co2 collected from the static chambers was mainly originated from microbial respiration 2 4 analyses 2 4 1 soil soil bulk density of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm for the 108 field survey sites was measured by using a sampling ring i e a steel cylinder

extraction method with ammonium acetate liu et al 2011 soil texture was determined by sieving method 2 4 2 crop dry plant samples were ground to determine total n concentrations by the automatic kjeldahl method after wet digestion of the samples with h2so4 and h2o2 lithourgidis et al 2011 the crop biomass and n uptake were calculated according to crop area planting density and n content using the dry weight of the above and below ground biomass 2 4 3 gases gas fluxes were measured daily immediately after fertilizer application and after other events which may have triggered microbial respiration such as rainfall irrigation or tillage for 3 14 days and about once every week during the remaining periods gas sampling for flux measurements was performed between 08 00 11 00 am local time air sampling each time lasted approximately 40 min the gas samples were analyzed within 4 h after sampling using an agilent 7890 a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector for n2o n2 was used as a carrier gas immediately after enclosure of static chambers we took the first air sample using a 12 ml vacuum glass bottle labco ltd ceredigion uk which had been pumped into vacuum state by a vacuum pump with a three way valve the single observation of each flux was directly regarded as a measure of the daily flux gap filling to obtain a daily time series was based on the arithmetic means of neighboring measurements cumulative emissions were obtained by summing the measured and gap filled daily fluxes cui et al 2012 2 5 determination of photosynthetic characteristics

for both ling county and wuqiao county soil bulk density of 20 30 cm soil layer was significantly higher than other layers meanwhile soil penetration resistance in these two counties showed the similar changing trend fig 3 generally from 0 to 18 cm soil penetration resistance increased with the increase of soil depth but it decreased from 18 cm to 25 cm and then increased again for ling county average penetration resistance in cultivated layer 0 15 cm plough pan 15 30 cm and subsoil 30 45 cm was 597 kpa 2 420 kpa and 1 960 kpa respectively and that for wuqiao county was 658 kpa 2 691 kpa and 2 010 kpa respectively based on the analysis of soil bulk density and penetration resistance results of survey showed that the average thickness of the topsoil in the experimental field was 14 74 cm and plough pan covering from 15 to 30 cm in soil profile was found in about 76 of all sites surveyed zhai et al 2016 fig 4 in the survey 74 of all 58 survey sites in ling county had a plough pan with an average depth of 14 50 cm 7 5 21 5 cm under topsoil and its thickness was 13 3 cm with a range of 7 5 21 5 cm as to wuqiao county 78 of all 50 survey sites had a plough pan under 14 98 cm from topsoil in a range of 11 5 22 5 cm and its thickness was 13 45 cm with a range of 7 5 20 cm 3 2 effects of different plough pan thicknesses on crop growth 3 2 1 photosynthetic and leaf water use efficiency the pn of winter wheat increased significantly as the breakage depth of plough pan increased fig 5 a as described in 3 1 the thickness of plough pan is 15 cm under topsoil which is also 15 cm breaking plough pan completely pp0 and breaking plough pan by 2 3 pp5 increased pn by 16 00 and 19 49 respectively as compared to pp15 p 0 05 however there was no significant difference between breaking plough pan by 1 3 pp10 and undisturbed plough pan pp15 during the maize growing season a similar trend was observed for the pn which varied in the order pp0 pp5 pp10 pp15 the gs of both crops increased significantly with the increase of breakage depth of plough pan in the order of pp0 pp5 pp10 pp15 fig 5b the tr was regulated by the stomatal size and varied consistently with gs in winter wheat season the tr under pp5 was significantly lower p 0 05 than that under pp0 but significantly exceeded that under pp15 fig 5c during maize growing season the tr under pp5 had no significant difference with that under pp0 both of which were significantly higher p 0 05 than that under pp10 and pp15 fig 5c for both wheat or maize growing seasons breaking plough pan especially under pp0 and pp5 could increase photosynthesis and transpiration ratio as well as leaf water use efficiency lwue fig 5d 3 2 2 crop yield and net primary breaking plough pan significantly affected crop growth especially both wheat and maize yield table 3 for wheat yield of pp5 7 130 kg ha 1 was higher than other treatments 6 200 6 770 kg ha 1 while its below ground biomass had no significant difference with pp15 and pp10 but much lower than pp0 the above ground biomass of pp5 did not significantly differ with pp0 but was much higher than that of pp15 and pp10 in maize growing season yield below ground and above ground biomass of pp5 all had no significant difference with that of pp0 but the values were much higher than those of pp15 and pp10 p 0 05 the npp varied from 13 04 pp15 to 15 87 t c ha 1 pp5 indicating that the breaking of plough pan increased the npp table 3 and the npp was highest under pp5 pp5 and pp0 significantly p 0 05 increased npp by 11 37 21 70 compared with pp10 and pp15 table 3 3 3 effects of different plough pan thicknesses on n utilization breaking plough pan significantly increased crop n uptake and n use efficiency nue for both wheat and maize table 4 pp5 improved n uptake by both wheat and maize the respective uptake of 185 5 kg ha 1 and 224 4 kg ha 1 were similar to those of pp0 but were significantly higher than the uptake in pp0 and pp15 p 0 05 variation of nue showed the same trend pp5 had the best n utilization rate for wheat 45 01 and maize 35 27 respectively which did not significantly differ with pp0 but was significantly higher than pp0 p 0 05 3 4 effects on greenhouse gas emissions 3 4 1 n2o emission the magnitude of n2o emission peaks decreased with increasing degree of plough pan breakage fig 6 as a result pp15 had the largest magnitude of n2o emission peak which was higher than pp10 pp5 and pp0 by 19 0 87 0 and 103 1 respectively the magnitude of n2o emission peak was mainly affected by irrigation fertilization and precipitation annual variation of n2o flux was 7 9 814 4 μg n m 2 h 1 3 1 1101 3 μg n m 2 h 1 5 1 509 0 μg n m 2 h 1 and 6 1 370 4 μg n m 2 h 1 for pp15 pp10 pp5 and pp0 respectively in one year there were four or five pulse like peaks annual magnitude of n2o emission peak was 348 9 μg n m 2 h 1 293 1 μg n m 2 h 1 186 6 μg n m 2 h 1 and 171 8 μg n m 2 h 1 for pp15 pp10 pp55 and pp0 respectively at the same time breaking the plough pan is beneficial to reducing the n2o emission peak magnitude with increasing degree of plough pan breakage the duration and magnitude of a single emission peak was shortened the duration of emission peak was the shortest in pp0 i e four to five days and reached more than 7 days in pp10 from the annual scale the average annual n2o fluxes were 130 8 μg n m 2 h 1 114 2 μg n m 2 h 1 78 1 μg n m 2 h 1 and 71 2 μg n m 2 h 1 respectively breaking the plough bottom layer was beneficial to reducing the average annual flux of n2o table 5 no matter in wheat maize or the entire rotation cumulative n2o emission of pp5 had no significant difference with that of pp0 but was much lower than that of pp15 p 0 05 and pp10 p 0 05 breaking the plough pan was conducive to achieving the goal of increasing production and reducing emissions emission intensity refers to the amount of n2o emissions per unit of economic output under the traditional plough structure pp15 the n2o emission intensity was the highest 0 00033 kg n kg 1 and the pp5 and pp0 emission intensity was the lowest 0 0002 kg n ha 1 3 4 2 co2 emission the daily co2 flux varied similarly among the plough pan treatments during the whole rotation period fig 7 the flux ranged from 7 2 mg m 2 h 1 to 326 8 mg m 2 h 1 under pp15 7 4 mg m 2 h 1 to 289 2 mg m 2 h 1 under pp10 9 8 mg m 2 h 1 to 305 3 mg m 2 h 1 under pp5 and 11 5 mg m 2 h 1 to 295 7 mg m 2 h 1 under pp0 during the winter wheat season the co2 flux decreased initially and then increased however in the summer maize season the flux increased initially and then decreased gradually the highest co2 flux occurred in the summer maize season during which the average fluxes were 146 7 mg m 2 h 1 141 6 mg m 2 h 1 127 1 mg m 2 h 1 and 131 5 mg m 2 h 1 for pp0 pp5 pp10 and pp15 respectively and mean co2 fluxes during the winter wheat season were 59 9 mg m 2 h 1 53 1 mg m 2 h 1 47 6 mg m 2 h 1 and 42 3 mg m 2 h 1 respectively the average co2 fluxes under pp0 during the two growing seasons were significantly higher than any other treatments while that under pp15 was the lowest few co2 peak fluxes were recorded across treatments 9 days after tillage during which the average co2 fluxes were 82 3 mg m 2 h 1 for pp0 69 8 mg m 2 h 1 for pp5 50 9 mg m 2 h 1 for pp10 and 43 9 mg m 2 h 1 for pp15 the highest fluxes were observed 7 days after sowing maize being induced by soil disturbance and high soil temperature the average co2 fluxes under pp0 and pp5 during 7 days after summer maize sowing were 247 0 mg m 2 h 1and 245 5 mg m 2 h 1 respectively both of which were much higher than those under pp10 and pp15 during the whole rotation annual cumulative co2 emission increased with the increase in the degree of plough pan breakage but no significant difference was found among pp5 pp10 and pp15 fig 8 annual cumulative co2 emission was 6771 kg c ha 2 under pp0 being significantly larger than pp5 pp10 and pp15 by 10 38 15 90 and 20 43 respectively the relationship between annual cumulative co2 emission and thickness of plough pan could be expressed by y 44 30x 4929 r 0 985 fig 8 in addition the cumulative emissions during the maize season under pp0 pp5 pp10 and pp15 accounted for 50 4 53 9 51 0 and 54 7 of the annual cumulative emissions 4 discussion the plough layer structure consists of cultivated soil and its cover and it is the general name of internal structures surface forms as well as coverings formed after human cultivation unger and jones 1998 good plough structure determines the exchange ability of water fertilizer gas and heat of the entire soil and external which can also maximize the storage and coordination of moisture in the plough layer sang et al 2016 in this study based on soil bulk density and penetration resistance analysis the average thickness of topsoil in ncp was 14 74 cm and the plough pan distributed from 15 to 30 cm was found at 76 of all sites surveyed the bulk density of plough pan was about 1 54 g cm 3 which was the largest in soil profile and the penetration resistance of plough pan varied from 1 371 00 kpa to 4 256 00 kpa which was in line with the previous finding for an arable field zheng 2012 thick and solid plough pan not only hinders the interpenetration of crop roots but also hinders the connectivity of water fertilizer gas and heat between the tillage layer and the deeper soil layer which leads to reduced crop growth and yield zhu et al 2017 thus it is necessary to determine the effects of different tillage depths which could form different thicknesses of plough pan on crop growth and green gas emissions zhou et al 2009 tillage has a strong influence on water and fertilizer use efficiency as well as crop photosynthesis because it could change soil structure water fertility gas and other factors breaking the plough pan is beneficial to increasing the photosynthetic efficiency of winter wheat and summer maize the stomatal conductance and transpiration of crops sang et al 2016 the conclusion of this study was consistent with the previous findings reported in literature li et al 2013 good plough pan can provide suitable environment for crop growth improve soil water supply increase leaf stomatal conductance and facilitate gas exchange jerabek et al 2017 olesen and munkholm 2007 at the same time good plough pan could help to maintain the chlorophyll content of the crop leaves for a longer time and extend the function of the leaves which is conducive to the enhancement of crop photosynthetic ability cao et al 2017 wasaya et al 2017 the results of the present study suggest that the plough pan as a physical soil sealing layer highly affects photosynthesis crop yield and n use efficiency the reason for low yield associated with plough pan can be attributed to the high penetration resistance of the plough pan abdollahi and munkholm 2014 across the entire winter wheat growing season the penetration resistance under pp15 treatment was always larger than 2 000 kpa which restrained root growth the root of winter wheat under pp15 was primarily distributed in a shallow soil layer which might lead to water stress on winter wheat production and the difficulty of nutrient uptake from deep soils in water deficient areas in contrast after breaking the plough pan partially or completely the average penetration resistance under pp10 pp5 and pp0 decreased significantly during the winter wheat season compared with pp15 therefore breaking plough pan is conducive to root growth making full use of water in the deep soils and relieving water stress cai et al 2014 a relatively small change in soil respiration caused by field management practices can result in a dramatic change in atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions which may exacerbate or mitigate global warming greenhouse gas production from soils were the result of several complex biotic processes which depend on soil organic matter content and mineralization rate the number and activity of soil microbial groups soil animal respiration and so on lee et al 2003 reasonable tillage practices can reduce gas emissions by increasing soil organic matter decreasing mineralization rate and changing soil microbial community structure the depth and frequency of tillage have a significant positive correlation with greenhouse gas emissions yeboah et al 2016 properly breaking the plough bottom layer was conducive to reduce the average annual flux of n2o and to achieve the goal of increasing production so conventional tillage management especially rotary tillage which lead to plough bottom layer must change latifmanesh et al 2016 yeboah et al 2016 ipcc defined n2o emission factor as the percentage of n2o emission rate caused by the application of fertilizer n and suggested that the n2o emission factor from fertilizer was 1 0 the n2o emission factor of each treatment in this study ranged from 0 43 to 0 73 far below the ipcc default value meanwhile breaking the plough pan was beneficial to reducing the n2o emission coefficient but there was no significant difference between completely breaking plough pan and breaking plough pan partly especially pp5 the atmospheric concentration of co2 which is an important greenhouse gas ghg increased to 1803 ppb in 2011 exceeding pre industrial levels by about 150 estimated by ipcc co2 emission from field can be affected mainly by tillage sowing irrigation and rainfall abdalla et al 2013 tian et al 2013 formerly the extent of breaking the plough pan to minimize co2 emission is poorly understood and the ecological benefit of the tillage technology whether the agriculture system is a sink or source for c is not clear given that there are few earlier field studies on c balance under different thicknesses of plough pan in ncp annual co2 emission increased with increasing degree of plough pan breakage in this study but no significant difference was found among pp5 pp10 and pp15 indicating that breakage degree of plough pan had no significant effect on co2 emission soils can act as an important source or sink for co2 and approximately 20 of global co2 emissions originate from soils rastogi et al 2002 carbon is released from agro ecosystems into the atmospheric c pool mainly through soil respiration hu et al 2012 in our study breaking the plough pan dramatically increased soil heterotrophic respiration which was supported by the previous finding that the depth and frequency of tillage significantly positively correlated with greenhouse gas emissions reicosky 2005 the effects of plough pan on co2 balance cannot be simply characterized by soil respiration because of the dual effects of soil crop ecosystem on co2 emissions and uptake carbon balance means the balance between c inputs i e straw organic fertilizer and plant litter and outputs mainly referring to the soil heterotrophic respiration of an ecosystem which can be represented by the nep net ecosystem productivity directly reflecting the net exchange of co2 between the ecosystem and the atmosphere ren et al 2011 the result showed that wheat maize rotation with straw incorporation across treatments was still an intensive c sink fig 9 the nep of which varied from 7 420 kg c ha 1to 9 740 kg c ha 1 notably pp5 had the largest nep which significantly exceeded pp0 by 11 83 pp10 by 20 84 and pp15 by 27 respectively therefore breaking the plough pan completely may not necessarily improve the yield and nep of wheat maize rotation while partly breaking the plough pan especially pp5 could be the good choice in arable land implemented with reduced or no tillage over a long term the formation of plough pan is unavoidable as a result of mechanical compaction and friction between plough and soil angel et al 2018 catania et al 2018 plough pan impedes the connection between topsoil and deep soil so water stored in deep soil can not be used for crop adequately tearing down plough pan could create a relatively loose soil layer for plant root different soil types need different tillage methods for example deep loosening with no rotary is suitable for saline alkali soil and rotary tillage can be used in fecund farmland angel et al 2018 jerabek et al 2017 in ncp current tillage techniques could sufficiently realize deep loosening and rotary tillage simultaneously in actual practice however the deeper the ploughing the greater the energy consumption hamzei and seyyedi 2016 thus tillage depth must be appropriate jerabek et al 2017 breaking plough pan could produce a loose plough layer which is beneficial to crop root growth and nutrient absorption jerabek et al 2017 nonetheless it should be noted that the field experiment in this study was conducted for only a year thus the long term effects of plough plan thickness on crop growth and gas emissions in ncp is not evaluated future research is needed with this regard and should be combined with research on other field practices such as reducing fertilization slow controlled release fertilizer water saving irrigation to achieve agricultural sustainability in ncp kiziloglu et al 2009 venterea et al 2011 yang et al 2015 5 conclusions based on the field survey conducted in ncp the effects of breaking plough pan partially or completely on crop growth n utilization and environment of the winter wheat summer maize rotation was analyzed results showed that the average thickness of the topsoil in the experimental field was 14 74 cm and plough pan covering from 15 to 30 cm in soil profile was found in about 76 of all sites surveyed breaking the plough pan partially or completely could promote the net photosynthesis rate leaf water use efficiency yield and n use efficiency decreases n2o emission but increases co2 emission although the impacts were similar to pp0 breaking plough pan by 2 3 pp5 had significantly better performance in promoting photosynthetic parameters especially net photosynthetic rate and leaf water use efficiency than pp10 and pp15 for both wheat and maize pp5 achieved greater yields 7 130 kg ha 1 for wheat and 8 240 kg ha 1 for maize than other treatments and pp5 had greater net primary productivity i e 15 870 kg c ha 1 nitrogen uptake 409 9 kg ha 1 and n use efficiency 40 14 of pp5 did not differ with those pp0 but were significantly higher than pp10 and pp15 the magnitude of n2o emission peak decreased with the increasing degree of plough pan breakage so that cumulative n2o emission and emission intensity of pp5 was obviously lower than that of pp10 and pp15 except completely breaking plough pan annual cumulative co2 emission among pp5 pp10 and pp15 had no significant difference net ecosystem productivity of the rotation system increased as the thickness of plough pan decreased so pp5 had relative higher nep 9 740 kg c ha 1 than pp10 and pp15 in conclusion breaking plough pan partially i e pp5 could achieve similar agronomic and environmental benefits as a complete break pp0 but the machinery operation would cost much less in actual practices therefore breaking plough pan partially i e pp5 is potentially a good choice for practical use to ameliorate restriction of compaction on crop growth promote n utilization and reduce greenhouse gas emissions acknowledgements this study was

11199,plough pan can affect crop growth nutrient uptake and the fates of substances in the environment to determine the effects of plough pan thickness on crop and environment a field survey and a field experiment were conducted on a typical calcareous fluvo aquic soil in a winter wheat summer maize rotation system in northern china plain from 2014 to 2016 specifically the thickness of plough pans was surveyed in 108 field plots in 2014 and then based on the survey results a field experiment was established to study the effects of different plough pan thicknesses pp15 15 cm of plough pan pp10 10 cm of plough pan pp5 5 cm of plough pan pp0 0 cm of plough pan on crop growth nitrogen n utilization and the environment the survey showed that the thickness of topsoil averaged at 14 7 cm and the plough pan was approximately 15 cm deep the plough pan was found at 76 of the survey locations and it was distributed commonly from 15 to 30 cm beneath the soil surface breaking the original plough pan partially or completely could promote the net photosynthesis rate leaf water use efficiency crop yield and n use efficiency decrease n2o emission but increase co2 emission among all treatments breaking plough pans completely pp0 and by 2 3 pp5 resulted in best crop performance whose photosynthetic parameters especially net photosynthetic rate and leaf water use efficiency were significantly higher than pp10 and pp15 for both wheat and maize pp5 resulted in greater yield 7 130 kg ha 1 for wheat and 8 240 kg ha 1 for maize than other treatments although it did not differ with pp0 significantly pp5 had significantly higher n uptake 410 kg ha 1 and n use efficiency 40 1 than pp10 and pp15 the magnitude of n2o emission peak decreased with an increasing degree of plough pan breakage the cumulative n2o emission and intensity in pp5 was obviously lower than that in pp10 and pp15 annual cumulative co2 emission did not differ significantly among pp5 pp10 and pp15 net ecosystem productivity nep of the rotation system increased as the thickness of plough pan decreased so pp5 had relative higher nep 9 740 kg c ha 1 than pp10 and pp15 thus considering better crop growth higher yield optimized n utilization lower n2o and co2 emissions as well as higher nep and less mechanical costs breaking the original plough pan partially is a good choice to ameliorating the plough pan restrictions in the northern china plain keywords plough pan crop yield n utilization net primary productivity n2o emission co2emission 1 introduction the northern china plain ncp is one of the most important areas for china s food security wang et al 2014 which produces nearly 20 of the national grains in this region winter wheat summer maize double cropping rotation is the most typical cropping system which has been practiced for over 50 years and is characterized by high inputs of fertilizer irrigation water and other chemicals in order to achieve food safety duan et al 2014 maize mainly relies on rainfall while wheat depends on irrigation due to the annual precipitation distribution patterns in ncp annually irrigation water amounts approximately 240 mm being applied in three to five events zhang et al 2015a 2018 however irrigation regime of wheat maize is extensive and crop water use efficiency is low which leads to severe depletion of groundwater resources regional water shortage is very serious in this area and the irrational tillage structure which can t conserve water and fertilizer has exacerbated this situation sang et al 2016 before the reform and opening policy was started in late 1970s tillage measure in ncp was mainly digging and turning over the soil using home made simple plough like moldboard plow or disc plough du et al 2013 with the development of agricultural machinery deep tillage machine and rotary cultivator improved the formation of deep loosening and rotary tillage zhai et al 2017 although reduced and no tillage were also used in ncp it must be plowed after one or several years in order to improve soil air and moisture permeability gathala et al 2015 huang et al 2015 now small agricultural machinery dominates agricultural production in the ncp as a result of decentralized management of farmlands field traffic and long term rotary tillage with a depth of less than 20 cm using the small machinery with rotary tillers lead to soil compaction hard plough pan and shallow cultivated layer which seriously limits crop growth wiermann et al 2000 soil compaction often appears in the subsoil layer after long term planting especially under reduced tillage shallow rotary tillage and forms so called plough pan beneath the plough layer liu et al 2010 sang et al 2016 sip et al 2013 in ncp the plough pan is not only widespread but also very thick about 15 cm under the traditional rotary based tillage and it has become a major problem constraining crop production liu et al 2015 sang et al 2016 zhai et al 2017 the subsoils under cultivated top soils can store large amounts of water and nutrient and meet the needs of deep rooted crops even in drought situation schneider et al 2017 however plough pan barriers connectivity of water fertilizer gas heat between the topsoil and the subsoils thus reducing crop production dong et al 2017 zhai et al 2017 currently in order to solve the problem of thick plough pan in the ncp agronomists have proposed different methods of managing the cultivated layer ma et al 2015 phiri et al 2003 subsoiling plays an important role in efficiently breaking up the plough pan in field management cai et al 2014 tillage especially subsoiling could improve the availability of the subsoil resources for plant utilization which can be regarded as one of the most important agricultural management practices for increasing crop yield brennan et al 2014 guan et al 2014 subsoiling tillage promotes soil water content grain yield and significantly reduces lodging rate compared to no tillage bian et al 2016 lin et al 2016 deep tillage to 50 cm can obviously facilitate root morphology and resistance to environmental stress cai et al 2014 changing no tillage to subsoiling tillage was found to increase root growth and nutrient uptake leading to higher crop production guan et al 2014 many studies have demonstrated that greenhouse gas emissions from soils are the result of several complex biotic processes which depend on soil organic matter content and mineralization rate the number and activity of soil microbial groups soil animal respiration and so on behnke et al 2018 wang et al 2018 because different management practices have varying effects on soil carbon c and nitrogen n it might be possible to reduce n2o and co2 emissions by managing an appropriate thickness of plough pan through proper tillage yeboah et al 2016 however the effects of breaking the plough pan impertinently on crop production or greenhouse gas emissions would be negative some studies have showed that conventional intensive tillage declined crop yield and increased global warming potential and greenhouse gas intensity compared with no tillage he et al 2011 zhang et al 2016 besides several long term field experiments have revealed that conservation tillage in dryland farming areas could improve soil quality and productivity li et al 2007 wang et al 2008 the reason for the differences found in different experiments may be associated with improper tillage practices building reasonable cultivated layer structure or plough pan is one of the key steps to achieve good soil condition higher production and better environmental benefits a proper arable layer has to reduce soil compaction increase water use efficiency facilitate root growth and improve yield lampurlanes et al 2001 further reasonable tillage practices must reduce greenhouse gas emissions such as n2o co2 and ch4 by increasing soil organic matter decreasing the rate of mineralization and changing soil microbial community structure the irrational thickness of plough pan constitutes an obstacle for root growth and utilization of soil nutrients recent research has proved that deep tillage practices can create a more favorable soil environment for root growth and crop production than shallow tillage zhai et al 2017 that is moderately breaking the plough pan could improve the soil structure and then increase crop growth however the effect of plough pan thickness on crop growth parameters and agricultural environment in ncp is not clear therefore the aims of our study were to firstly illuminate current situation of plough pan in ncp and then assess the effects of plough pan thickness on a crop growth including photosynthetic characteristics yield and net primary productivity npp b n utilization and c environment such as n2o and co2 emissions as well as net ecosystem productivity nep 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the northern china plain 32 40 n 114 121 e includes the whole plain region of tianjin beijing hebei and part of shandong anhui jiangsu and henan covering a total area of 300 000 ha it is a typical intensively managed agricultural region with the average elevation of less than 50 m pei et al 2015 this area has a continental monsoon climate with dry cold winter and wet hot summer annual average temperature precipitation surface evaporation and frost free period are approximately 14 15 c 500 900 mm 800 1 200 mm and 200 days respectively annual precipitation is not evenly distributed with 80 of the rainfall occurring between june and october so irrigation is needed when the water demand is high during the winter wheat growing season the most common irrigation method is flood irrigation and the irrigation water is pumped from a tributary of the yellow river which is the second longest river in china the traditional tillage method is rotary tillage to a depth of less than 15 cm using a small four wheel tractor after the annual harvest of summer maize the soils of this region are mostly covered by alluvial loess from several rivers such as the yellow river huaihe river haihe river and their tributaries according to the fao classification soil type in this area is calcaric fluvisol or cambisol with silt loam texture zhang et al 2015b rotating winter wheat and summer maize a very intensive double cropping

current thickness situation of plough pan in ncp field experiment was designed to analyze the effects of different thicknesses on crop yield n utilization and the environment 2 2 1 field survey the survey was conducted in 108 field plots to obtain the information of plough pan thickness in typical wheat maize rotation fields in ncp the survey was conducted at jointing stage of wheat from april 1 to april 13 of 2014 when there was no precipitation the survey sites were located in ling county 58 sites in shandong province and wuqiao county 50 sites of hebei province two typical agricultural regions with a wheat maize rotation in ncp fig 1 a geographical positioning system gps was used to locate and record the longitude and latitude of the survey sites soil profiles were excavated to determine the thickness of topsoil and plough pan according to their soil bulk density and soil penetration resistance generally plough pan has greater soil bulk density and penetration resistance significantly higher than other layers blanco canqui and ruis 2018 2 2 2 field experiment a winter wheat summer maize rotation field e116 19 46 33 n37 20 44 53 altitude 11 m above the average sea

management practices and it is located approximately 20 km from downtown dezhou city a key grain production area northwest of shandong province the area has a calcareous fluvo aquic soil with a silt loam texture soil properties 0 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 45 cm are listed in table 1 the average air temperature and the annual total precipitation during the field experiment were 14 9 c and 504 9 mm respectively fig 2 the field experiment was conducted based on the survey result of tillage structure and structural characteristics of the plough layer and it lasted from october 2014 to september 2015 four treatments comprising different plough pan thicknesses were studied a the undisturbed plough pan pp15 which was served as control b plough pan broken by 1 3 pp10 c plough pan broken by 2 3 pp5 and d plough pan broken completely pp0 details of the four treatments are shown in table 2 treatments were randomly assigned and replicated three times 399 6 m2 per replicate within a uniform area that had been under conventional wheat maize rotation until the time of our experiment winter wheat cultivar jimai 22 was sown on october 23 2014 with row spacing of 20 cm and harvested on june 7 2015 summer maize cultivar zhengdan 958 was sown at a planting density of 67 500 plants ha 1 on june 22 2014 and harvested on october 10 nitrogen fertilizer 450 kg n ha 1 in total 210 for wheat and 240 kg n ha 1 for maize was applied based on local recommendations the n fertilizer was applied twice during each growing season basally at sowing wheat 42 9 maize 33 3 and top dressed at jointing stage of winter wheat 57 1 and when the maize had 11 12 leaves 66 7 all the phosphorous and potassium fertilizers wheat 150 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 75 kg k2o ha 1 maize 75 kg p2o5 ha 1 and 120 kg k2o ha 1 were basally applied across treatments two irrigation events for wheat totaling 120 mm water and one for maize 60 mm water were adopted additional field management practices such as tillage sowing and harvesting as well as residue incorporation followed the local conventional practices immediately before wheat sowing the harvested maize straw was shredded into small pieces and ploughed into soil 0 15 cm at wheat harvest the harvested wheat straw was applied back to the field by covering the ground 2 3 sampling 2 3 1 soil sampling during the field survey in 2014 soils of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm were sampled randomly in field plots by using a soil auger before the start of the field experiment soils of 0 15 cm 15 30 cm and 30 45 cm were also collected using the same method to determine basic physical and chemical properties 2 3 2 crop sampling at the mature stage of winter wheat a 1 0m 1 0 m subplot was selected per plot and the aboveground part and roots within a depth of 35 cm were sampled the plant samples were oven dried 105 c for 30 min and then 75 c for 24 h to a constant weight at the harvesting stage of summer maize three plants including roots in the soil 30 cm long 30 cm wide 35 cm deep were selected per plot and dried to a constant weight 2 3 3 greenhouse gas sampling static chambers were used to collect air samples for measuring the fluxes of n2o and co2 according to previous reports cui et al 2012 wang et al 2018 yan et al 2013 each chamber was made of a cube with stainless steel walls and frames bottom area of 40 50 cm and a height of 75 cm for each replicated field plot a stainless steel base frame 40 50 20 cm was permanently installed 20 cm into the soil although it was briefly removed one week before the events of tillage sowing basal fertilization and harvest there were nine holes of 2 cm diameter on the lower half of each base frame wall to allow for free water flow the stainless steel base was placed on the sowing line of wheat and maize and the crop seeds within the stainless steel bases were removed after sowing to eliminate interference from root respiration the co2 collected from the static chambers was mainly originated from microbial respiration 2 4 analyses 2 4 1 soil soil bulk density of 0 10 cm 10 20 cm 20 30 cm and 30 40 cm for the 108 field survey sites was measured by using a sampling ring i e a steel cylinder 10 cm diameter 10 cm height the bulk density was calculated by dividing the weight of the dried soil by the volume of the soil soil penetration resistance of 0 45 cm was measured by soil compactness tester sc900 with the spatial resolution of 2 5 cm and the accuracy of 35 kpa soil organic carbon was measured by the potassium dichromate method soil total nitrogen was determined by the automated kjeldahl method after wet digestion perez et al 2001 soil available phosphorus was measured by truog method extracted by 0 002 n h2so4 solution cheng et al 2017 and available potassium was tested by extraction method with ammonium acetate liu et al 2011 soil texture was determined by sieving method 2 4 2 crop dry plant samples were ground to determine total n concentrations by the automatic kjeldahl method after wet digestion of the samples with h2so4 and h2o2 lithourgidis et al 2011 the crop biomass and n uptake were calculated according to crop area planting density and n content using the dry weight of the above and below ground biomass 2 4 3 gases gas fluxes were measured daily immediately after fertilizer application and after other events which may have triggered microbial respiration such as rainfall irrigation or tillage for 3 14 days and about once every week during the remaining periods gas sampling for flux measurements was performed between 08 00 11 00 am local time air sampling each time lasted approximately 40 min the gas samples were analyzed within 4 h after sampling using an agilent 7890 a gas chromatograph equipped with an electron capture detector for n2o n2 was used as a carrier gas immediately after enclosure of static chambers we took the first air sample using a 12 ml vacuum glass bottle labco ltd ceredigion uk which had been pumped into vacuum state by a vacuum pump with a three way valve the single observation of each flux was directly regarded as a measure of the daily flux gap filling to obtain a daily time series was based on the arithmetic means of neighboring measurements cumulative emissions were obtained by summing the measured and gap filled daily fluxes cui et al 2012 2 5 determination of photosynthetic characteristics

for both ling county and wuqiao county soil bulk density of 20 30 cm soil layer was significantly higher than other layers meanwhile soil penetration resistance in these two counties showed the similar changing trend fig 3 generally from 0 to 18 cm soil penetration resistance increased with the increase of soil depth but it decreased from 18 cm to 25 cm and then increased again for ling county average penetration resistance in cultivated layer 0 15 cm plough pan 15 30 cm and subsoil 30 45 cm was 597 kpa 2 420 kpa and 1 960 kpa respectively and that for wuqiao county was 658 kpa 2 691 kpa and 2 010 kpa respectively based on the analysis of soil bulk density and penetration resistance results of survey showed that the average thickness of the topsoil in the experimental field was 14 74 cm and plough pan covering from 15 to 30 cm in soil profile was found in about 76 of all sites surveyed zhai et al 2016 fig 4 in the survey 74 of all 58 survey sites in ling county had a plough pan with an average depth of 14 50 cm 7 5 21 5 cm under topsoil and its thickness was 13 3 cm with a range of 7 5 21 5 cm as to wuqiao county 78 of all 50 survey sites had a plough pan under 14 98 cm from topsoil in a range of 11 5 22 5 cm and its thickness was 13 45 cm with a range of 7 5 20 cm 3 2 effects of different plough pan thicknesses on crop growth 3 2 1 photosynthetic and leaf water use efficiency the pn of winter wheat increased significantly as the breakage depth of plough pan increased fig 5 a as described in 3 1 the thickness of plough pan is 15 cm under topsoil which is also 15 cm breaking plough pan completely pp0 and breaking plough pan by 2 3 pp5 increased pn by 16 00 and 19 49 respectively as compared to pp15 p 0 05 however there was no significant difference between breaking plough pan by 1 3 pp10 and undisturbed plough pan pp15 during the maize growing season a similar trend was observed for the pn which varied in the order pp0 pp5 pp10 pp15 the gs of both crops increased significantly with the increase of breakage depth of plough pan in the order of pp0 pp5 pp10 pp15 fig 5b the tr was regulated by the stomatal size and varied consistently with gs in winter wheat season the tr under pp5 was significantly lower p 0 05 than that under pp0 but significantly exceeded that under pp15 fig 5c during maize growing season the tr under pp5 had no significant difference with that under pp0 both of which were significantly higher p 0 05 than that under pp10 and pp15 fig 5c for both wheat or maize growing seasons breaking plough pan especially under pp0 and pp5 could increase photosynthesis and transpiration ratio as well as leaf water use efficiency lwue fig 5d 3 2 2 crop yield and net primary breaking plough pan significantly affected crop growth especially both wheat and maize yield table 3 for wheat yield of pp5 7 130 kg ha 1 was higher than other treatments 6 200 6 770 kg ha 1 while its below ground biomass had no significant difference with pp15 and pp10 but much lower than pp0 the above ground biomass of pp5 did not significantly differ with pp0 but was much higher than that of pp15 and pp10 in maize growing season yield below ground and above ground biomass of pp5 all had no significant difference with that of pp0 but the values were much higher than those of pp15 and pp10 p 0 05 the npp varied from 13 04 pp15 to 15 87 t c ha 1 pp5 indicating that the breaking of plough pan increased the npp table 3 and the npp was highest under pp5 pp5 and pp0 significantly p 0 05 increased npp by 11 37 21 70 compared with pp10 and pp15 table 3 3 3 effects of different plough pan thicknesses on n utilization breaking plough pan significantly increased crop n uptake and n use efficiency nue for both wheat and maize table 4 pp5 improved n uptake by both wheat and maize the respective uptake of 185 5 kg ha 1 and 224 4 kg ha 1 were similar to those of pp0 but were significantly higher than the uptake in pp0 and pp15 p 0 05 variation of nue showed the same trend pp5 had the best n utilization rate for wheat 45 01 and maize 35 27 respectively which did not significantly differ with pp0 but was significantly higher than pp0 p 0 05 3 4 effects on greenhouse gas emissions 3 4 1 n2o emission the magnitude of n2o emission peaks decreased with increasing degree of plough pan breakage fig 6 as a result pp15 had the largest magnitude of n2o emission peak which was higher than pp10 pp5 and pp0 by 19 0 87 0 and 103 1 respectively the magnitude of n2o emission peak was mainly affected by irrigation fertilization and precipitation annual variation of n2o flux was 7 9 814 4 μg n m 2 h 1 3 1 1101 3 μg n m 2 h 1 5 1 509 0 μg n m 2 h 1 and 6 1 370 4 μg n m 2 h 1 for pp15 pp10 pp5 and pp0 respectively in one year there were four or five pulse like peaks annual magnitude of n2o emission peak was 348 9 μg n m 2 h 1 293 1 μg n m 2 h 1 186 6 μg n m 2 h 1 and 171 8 μg n m 2 h 1 for pp15 pp10 pp55 and pp0 respectively at the same time breaking the plough pan is beneficial to reducing the n2o emission peak magnitude with increasing degree of plough pan breakage the duration and magnitude of a single emission peak was shortened the duration of emission peak was the shortest in pp0 i e four to five days and reached more than 7 days in pp10 from the annual scale the average annual n2o fluxes were 130 8 μg n m 2 h 1 114 2 μg n m 2 h 1 78 1 μg n m 2 h 1 and 71 2 μg n m 2 h 1 respectively breaking the plough bottom layer was beneficial to reducing the average annual flux of n2o table 5 no matter in wheat maize or the entire rotation cumulative n2o emission of pp5 had no significant difference with that of pp0 but was much lower than that of pp15 p 0 05 and pp10 p 0 05 breaking the plough pan was conducive to achieving the goal of increasing production and reducing emissions emission intensity refers to the amount of n2o emissions per unit of economic output under the traditional plough structure pp15 the n2o emission intensity was the highest 0 00033 kg n kg 1 and the pp5 and pp0 emission intensity was the lowest 0 0002 kg n ha 1 3 4 2 co2 emission the daily co2 flux varied similarly among the plough pan treatments during the whole rotation period fig 7 the flux ranged from 7 2 mg m 2 h 1 to 326 8 mg m 2 h 1 under pp15 7 4 mg m 2 h 1 to 289 2 mg m 2 h 1 under pp10 9 8 mg m 2 h 1 to 305 3 mg m 2 h 1 under pp5 and 11 5 mg m 2 h 1 to 295 7 mg m 2 h 1 under pp0 during the winter wheat season the co2 flux decreased initially and then increased however in the summer maize season the flux increased initially and then decreased gradually the highest co2 flux occurred in the summer maize season during which the average fluxes were 146 7 mg m 2 h 1 141 6 mg m 2 h 1 127 1 mg m 2 h 1 and 131 5 mg m 2 h 1 for pp0 pp5 pp10 and pp15 respectively and mean co2 fluxes during the winter wheat season were 59 9 mg m 2 h 1 53 1 mg m 2 h 1 47 6 mg m 2 h 1 and 42 3 mg m 2 h 1 respectively the average co2 fluxes under pp0 during the two growing seasons were significantly higher than any other treatments while that under pp15 was the lowest few co2 peak fluxes were recorded across treatments 9 days after tillage during which the average co2 fluxes were 82 3 mg m 2 h 1 for pp0 69 8 mg m 2 h 1 for pp5 50 9 mg m 2 h 1 for pp10 and 43 9 mg m 2 h 1 for pp15 the highest fluxes were observed 7 days after sowing maize being induced by soil disturbance and high soil temperature the average co2 fluxes under pp0 and pp5 during 7 days after summer maize sowing were 247 0 mg m 2 h 1and 245 5 mg m 2 h 1 respectively both of which were much higher than those under pp10 and pp15 during the whole rotation annual cumulative co2 emission increased with the increase in the degree of plough pan breakage but no significant difference was found among pp5 pp10 and pp15 fig 8 annual cumulative co2 emission was 6771 kg c ha 2 under pp0 being significantly larger than pp5 pp10 and pp15 by 10 38 15 90 and 20 43 respectively the relationship between annual cumulative co2 emission and thickness of plough pan could be expressed by y 44 30x 4929 r 0 985 fig 8 in addition the cumulative emissions during the maize season under pp0 pp5 pp10 and pp15 accounted for 50 4 53 9 51 0 and 54 7 of the annual cumulative emissions 4 discussion the plough layer structure consists of cultivated soil and its cover and it is the general name of internal structures surface forms as well as coverings formed after human cultivation unger and jones 1998 good plough structure determines the exchange ability of water fertilizer gas and heat of the entire soil and external which can also maximize the storage and coordination of moisture in the plough layer sang et al 2016 in this study based on soil bulk density and penetration resistance analysis the average thickness of topsoil in ncp was 14 74 cm and the plough pan distributed from 15 to 30 cm was found at 76 of all sites surveyed the bulk density of plough pan was about 1 54 g cm 3 which was the largest in soil profile and the penetration resistance of plough pan varied from 1 371 00 kpa to 4 256 00 kpa which was in line with the previous finding for an arable field zheng 2012 thick and solid plough pan not only hinders the interpenetration of crop roots but also hinders the connectivity of water fertilizer gas and heat between the tillage layer and the deeper soil layer which leads to reduced crop growth and yield zhu et al 2017 thus it is necessary to determine the effects of different tillage depths which could form different thicknesses of plough pan on crop growth and green gas emissions zhou et al 2009 tillage has a strong influence on water and fertilizer use efficiency as well as crop photosynthesis because it could change soil structure water fertility gas and other factors breaking the plough pan is beneficial to increasing the photosynthetic efficiency of winter wheat and summer maize the stomatal conductance and transpiration of crops sang et al 2016 the conclusion of this study was consistent with the previous findings reported in literature li et al 2013 good plough pan can provide suitable environment for crop growth improve soil water supply increase leaf stomatal conductance and facilitate gas exchange jerabek et al 2017 olesen and munkholm 2007 at the same time good plough pan could help to maintain the chlorophyll content of the crop leaves for a longer time and extend the function of the leaves which is conducive to the enhancement of crop photosynthetic ability cao et al 2017 wasaya et al 2017 the results of the present study suggest that the plough pan as a physical soil sealing layer highly affects photosynthesis crop yield and n use efficiency the reason for low yield associated with plough pan can be attributed to the high penetration resistance of the plough pan abdollahi and munkholm 2014 across the entire winter wheat growing season the penetration resistance under pp15 treatment was always larger than 2 000 kpa which restrained root growth the root of winter wheat under pp15 was primarily distributed in a shallow soil layer which might lead to water stress on winter wheat production and the difficulty of nutrient uptake from deep soils in water deficient areas in contrast after breaking the plough pan partially or completely the average penetration resistance under pp10 pp5 and pp0 decreased significantly during the winter wheat season compared with pp15 therefore breaking plough pan is conducive to root growth making full use of water in the deep soils and relieving water stress cai et al 2014 a relatively small change in soil respiration caused by field management practices can result in a dramatic change in atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions which may exacerbate or mitigate global warming greenhouse gas production from soils were the result of several complex biotic processes which depend on soil organic matter content and mineralization rate the number and activity of soil microbial groups soil animal respiration and so on lee et al 2003 reasonable tillage practices can reduce gas emissions by increasing soil organic matter decreasing mineralization rate and changing soil microbial community structure the depth and frequency of tillage have a significant positive correlation with greenhouse gas emissions yeboah et al 2016 properly breaking the plough bottom layer was conducive to reduce the average annual flux of n2o and to achieve the goal of increasing production so conventional tillage management especially rotary tillage which lead to plough bottom layer must change latifmanesh et al 2016 yeboah et al 2016 ipcc defined n2o emission factor as the percentage of n2o emission rate caused by the application of fertilizer n and suggested that the n2o emission factor from fertilizer was 1 0 the n2o emission factor of each treatment in this study ranged from 0 43 to 0 73 far below the ipcc default value meanwhile breaking the plough pan was beneficial to reducing the n2o emission coefficient but there was no significant difference between completely breaking plough pan and breaking plough pan partly especially pp5 the atmospheric concentration of co2 which is an important greenhouse gas ghg increased to 1803 ppb in 2011 exceeding pre industrial levels by about 150 estimated by ipcc co2 emission from field can be affected mainly by tillage sowing irrigation and rainfall abdalla et al 2013 tian et al 2013 formerly the extent of breaking the plough pan to minimize co2 emission is poorly understood and the ecological benefit of the tillage technology whether the agriculture system is a sink or source for c is not clear given that there are few earlier field studies on c balance under different thicknesses of plough pan in ncp annual co2 emission increased with increasing degree of plough pan breakage in this study but no significant difference was found among pp5 pp10 and pp15 indicating that breakage degree of plough pan had no significant effect on co2 emission soils can act as an important source or sink for co2 and approximately 20 of global co2 emissions originate from soils rastogi et al 2002 carbon is released from agro ecosystems into the atmospheric c pool mainly through soil respiration hu et al 2012 in our study breaking the plough pan dramatically increased soil heterotrophic respiration which was supported by the previous finding that the depth and frequency of tillage significantly positively correlated with greenhouse gas emissions reicosky 2005 the effects of plough pan on co2 balance cannot be simply characterized by soil respiration because of the dual effects of soil crop ecosystem on co2 emissions and uptake carbon balance means the balance between c inputs i e straw organic fertilizer and plant litter and outputs mainly referring to the soil heterotrophic respiration of an ecosystem which can be represented by the nep net ecosystem productivity directly reflecting the net exchange of co2 between the ecosystem and the atmosphere ren et al 2011 the result showed that wheat maize rotation with straw incorporation across treatments was still an intensive c sink fig 9 the nep of which varied from 7 420 kg c ha 1to 9 740 kg c ha 1 notably pp5 had the largest nep which significantly exceeded pp0 by 11 83 pp10 by 20 84 and pp15 by 27 respectively therefore breaking the plough pan completely may not necessarily improve the yield and nep of wheat maize rotation while partly breaking the plough pan especially pp5 could be the good choice in arable land implemented with reduced or no tillage over a long term the formation of plough pan is unavoidable as a result of mechanical compaction and friction between plough and soil angel et al 2018 catania et al 2018 plough pan impedes the connection between topsoil and deep soil so water stored in deep soil can not be used for crop adequately tearing down plough pan could create a relatively loose soil layer for plant root different soil types need different tillage methods for example deep loosening with no rotary is suitable for saline alkali soil and rotary tillage can be used in fecund farmland angel et al 2018 jerabek et al 2017 in ncp current tillage techniques could sufficiently realize deep loosening and rotary tillage simultaneously in actual practice however the deeper the ploughing the greater the energy consumption hamzei and seyyedi 2016 thus tillage depth must be appropriate jerabek et al 2017 breaking plough pan could produce a loose plough layer which is beneficial to crop root growth and nutrient absorption jerabek et al 2017 nonetheless it should be noted that the field experiment in this study was conducted for only a year thus the long term effects of plough plan thickness on crop growth and gas emissions in ncp is not evaluated future research is needed with this regard and should be combined with research on other field practices such as reducing fertilization slow controlled release fertilizer water saving irrigation to achieve agricultural sustainability in ncp kiziloglu et al 2009 venterea et al 2011 yang et al 2015 5 conclusions based on the field survey conducted in ncp the effects of breaking plough pan partially or completely on crop growth n utilization and environment of the winter wheat summer maize rotation was analyzed results showed that the average thickness of the topsoil in the experimental field was 14 74 cm and plough pan covering from 15 to 30 cm in soil profile was found in about 76 of all sites surveyed breaking the plough pan partially or completely could promote the net photosynthesis rate leaf water use efficiency yield and n use efficiency decreases n2o emission but increases co2 emission although the impacts were similar to pp0 breaking plough pan by 2 3 pp5 had significantly better performance in promoting photosynthetic parameters especially net photosynthetic rate and leaf water use efficiency than pp10 and pp15 for both wheat and maize pp5 achieved greater yields 7 130 kg ha 1 for wheat and 8 240 kg ha 1 for maize than other treatments and pp5 had greater net primary productivity i e 15 870 kg c ha 1 nitrogen uptake 409 9 kg ha 1 and n use efficiency 40 14 of pp5 did not differ with those pp0 but were significantly higher than pp10 and pp15 the magnitude of n2o emission peak decreased with the increasing degree of plough pan breakage so that cumulative n2o emission and emission intensity of pp5 was obviously lower than that of pp10 and pp15 except completely breaking plough pan annual cumulative co2 emission among pp5 pp10 and pp15 had no significant difference net ecosystem productivity of the rotation system increased as the thickness of plough pan decreased so pp5 had relative higher nep 9 740 kg c ha 1 than pp10 and pp15 in conclusion breaking plough pan partially i e pp5 could achieve similar agronomic and environmental benefits as a complete break pp0 but the machinery operation would cost much less in actual practices therefore breaking plough pan partially i e pp5 is potentially a good choice for practical use to ameliorate restriction of compaction on crop growth promote n utilization and reduce greenhouse gas emissions acknowledgements this study was
