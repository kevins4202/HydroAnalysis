7100,unsaturated hydraulic conductivity k of surface soil changes substantially with space and time and it is of great importance for many ecological agricultural and hydrological applications in general k is measured in the laboratory or more commonly predicted using soil water retention curve and saturated hydraulic conductivity in the field k can be determined through infiltration experiments however none of these approaches are capable of continuously monitoring k in situ at fine depth scales in this study we propose and investigate an approach to continuously estimate fine depth scale k dynamics under field conditions evaporation rate and change in water storage in a near surface soil layer are measured with the heat pulse method then water flux density at the lower boundary of the soil layer is estimated from evaporation rate change in water storage and rainfall or irrigation rate using a simple water balance approach finally k values at different soil depths are derived using the buckingham darcy equation from water flux densities and measured water potential gradients a field experiment is performed to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach k values at 2 4 7 5 and 12 5 cm depths are estimated with the new approach the results show that in situ k estimates vary with time following changes in soil water content and the k water content relationship changes with depth due to the difference in bulk density in situ estimated k matric potential curves agree well with those measured in the laboratory in situ k estimates also show good agreement with the mualem van genuchten model predictions with an average root mean square error in log10 k mm h 1 of 0 54 and an average bias of 0 17 the new approach provides reasonable in situ k estimates and has potential to reveal the influences of natural soil conditions on hydraulic properties as they change with depth and time keywords in situ unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity heat pulse water potential gradient 1 introduction unsaturated soil hydraulic conductivity k plays a significant role in processes important for ecological agricultural and hydrological applications in general k is measured in the laboratory wind 1966 developed a method to quantify k from evaporation experiments on vertical soil columns multiple matric potential ψ measurements at different depths were required in wind s method schindler 1980 simplified wind s method for determination of k by using ψ measurements at only two depths while total column weight was recorded at several times schindler s method is particularly attractive due to its simplicity and commercial devices based on this method have been developed and widely used schindler et al 2010 schwen et al 2014 peters et al 2015 brunetti et al 2017 the one step kool et al 1985 and multistep outflow methods hopmans et al 2002 have also been used to determine k by numerical inversion of the richards equation from controlled transient flow measurements the numerical inversion method is relatively complicated because it requires an outflow experiment and a numerical computation in the field approaches have been developed to estimate k through infiltration experiments ankeny et al 1991 kosugi and nakayama 1997 angulo jaramillo et al 2000 the tension disc infiltrometer and pressure ring infiltrometer are two of the primary devices that can be used for determining k in the field angulo jaramillo et al 2000 more commonly k is estimated using measured soil water characteristic curves and saturated hydraulic conductivity k s based on relative hydraulic conductivity models burdine 1953 mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 assouline 2001 however none of the mentioned approaches are capable of continuously tracking in situ k dynamics under natural conditions monitoring in situ dynamics of soil physical properties at fine depth and temporal scales is challenging due to the lack of reliable measurement techniques recent advances have begun to make these measurements more feasible heat pulse sensor and time domain reflectometry tdr arrays have been used to determine near surface soil water content θ at a depth resolution of about 1 cm sheng et al 2017 zhang et al 2017 the thermo tdr method can be used to monitor temporal variation of soil bulk density at the centimeter scale lu et al 2017 tian et al 2018 the thermo tdr method also has the capability to determine ice content at fine depth scale tian et al 2016 2017 the sensible heat balance method is capable of determining subsurface soil water evaporation e dynamics at a sub cm scale zhang et al 2012 and it also has been used to estimate soil freezing and thawing rates of near surface layers kojima et al 2014 near surface soil also undergoes significant changes in k due to transient environmental conditions chen et al 2014 ghysels et al 2018 unfortunately it remains difficult to determine real time in situ k variations at a fine depth the objective of this study is to present a novel method to estimate in situ k dynamics at fine depth scale using heat pulse and matric potential sensors the method derives k values at a fine depth by inverting the buckingham darcy equation using ψ measurements and water flux densities estimated with a simple heat and water balance method we conduct a field experiment to test the performance of this approach for monitoring in situ k dynamics laboratory k measurements made on samples collected from the same site and mualem van genuchten 1980 model predictions are used to evaluate the accuracy of the field values 2 materials and methods 2 1 conceptual background latent heat flux density induced by evaporation of water within a soil layer can be estimated using the difference between sensible heat flux densities measured at upper and lower boundaries of the soil layer and the change in sensible heat storage within the soil layer fig 1 1 le h u h l δ s h where l j m 3 is the latent heat of vaporization e is evaporation rate m s 1 h u and h l are soil sensible heat flux densities w m 2 at upper and lower boundaries of the soil layer respectively and δs h w m 2 is the change in soil sensible heat storage within the soil layer based on eq 1 heitman et al 2008a 2008b developed a method to estimate e within the soil profile using heat pulse sensors h u h l and δs h can be estimated with heat pulse sensor measured soil temperature gradient volumetric heat capacity c and thermal conductivity λ this method is referred to as the sensible heat balance method for more details of the sensible heat balance method please refer to heitman et al 2017 for bare soil conditions without root extraction the e in fig 1 can also be treated as the difference between liquid water flux densities m s 1 at upper and lower boundaries of the soil layer q u and q l respectively and the change in water storage within the soil layer δsw m s 1 2 e q u q l δ s w the value for δs w can be estimated from the change of soil water content θ many approaches have been used to measure θ among these the heat pulse sensor can determine θ dynamics at a fine depth scale and near the soil surface using c measurements heitman et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 thus δsw is derived from heat pulse sensor measured c values as 3 δ s w c i c i 1 δ z δ t c w where ci denotes the soil volumetric heat capacity mj m 3 k 1 measured at time ti δt ti ti 1 is the time step s c w is the volumetric heat capacity of water 4 182 mj m 3 k 1 and δz is the thickness of the soil layer m for a soil profile q u at the soil surface is equal to 0 for the condition of no water input while for the condition of a water input it can be approximated as the rainfall or irrigation rate m s 1 when this rate is lower than the potential infiltration rate thus q l at a depth z defined as positive downward m in the soil profile can be derived from q u and heat pulse sensor estimated e and δs w between depths 0 and z eq 2 if ψ values for unsaturated soils are negative in the soil profile is also measured k at depth z can be estimated using the buckingham darcy equation 4 k q l ψ 2 ψ 1 z 2 z 1 1 where ψ1 and ψ2 are ψ values here using water pressure head in m to unify the units at depths z 1 and z 2 respectively depth z is the center of depths z1 and z 2 i e z z 1 z 2 2 note when the z axis is defined to be positive upward the gravitational term i e 1 in eq 4 changes to 1 2 2 field measurements a field experiment was performed to assess the feasibility of the new approach to determine in situ k values the experimental site was located at the central crops research station clayton nc usa the surface soil layer 0 20 cm at the site has a texture of loamy sand 85 sand 9 silt and 6 clay about 100 m2 area of land was leveled using a harrow and it was maintained bare via weed control with an herbicide throughout the study instrumentation was done in april 2017 the sensors were installed via a 15 cm deep trench by pushing the sensor needles or heads into the undisturbed soil for e measurements heat pulse sensors identical to those described by tian et al 2015 which consisted of three parallel stainless steel needles 4 5 cm length 2 mm diameter and 8 mm needle to needle spacing were used in our study heat pulse sensors were installed at five depths with the central needles positioned at 0 8 2 4 4 7 5 and 12 5 cm respectively fig 2 the plane formed by the needles of each heat pulse sensor was oriented perpendicular to the soil surface ambient soil temperature values were recorded each 15 min with thermocouples positioned in each heat pulse sensor needle heat pulse measurements were performed each 3 h to obtain c and λ dynamics all of the measurements were controlled and recorded with a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific logan ut that was placed in a waterproof enclosure on the soil surface under field conditions heat pulse temperature signals measured in the near surface soil layer can be affected by ambient temperature fluctuations to account for the effect of ambient temperature variations a temperature drift correction following zhang et al 2014 was performed after the correction heat pulse data were then processed using the lu et al 2013 method to derive thermal properties c and λ temperature c and λ measurements were used together to estimate hourly le dynamics fig 3 gives the details on le computations at various depths during the period immediately following a rainfall event stage i evaporation occurs at the surface and is therefore not detectable with heat pulse sensors below the surface sakai et al 2011 xiao et al 2014 developed a modified sensible heat balance method to capture stage i evaporation using combined net radiation and heat pulse measurements in the present study the xiao et al 2014 method was used under such conditions in addition to determining e the heat pulse sensors were also used to estimate hourly δs w mm h 1 dynamics at different depths in the soil profile with eq 3 fig 3 presents the detailed calculation procedure for δs w ren et al 2003 reported that relatively large errors can occur in heat pulse sensor measured θ due to errors in determining specific heat of the soil solids needle deflection is another source of error for heat pulse sensor estimated water content wen et al 2015 and liu et al 2016 present methods for correcting measurements for needle deflections in order to verify the accuracy of heat pulse sensor measured δs w θ was also determined with tdr sensors in the present study five 7 5 cm long tdr sensors model cs645 l campbell scientific inc logan ut usa were inserted horizontally into the undisturbed soil at the same depths as the heat pulse sensors fig 2 for tdr measurements bulk soil dielectric permittivity was recorded hourly with a time domain reflectometer tdr100 campbell scientific logan ut usa and θ was estimated from the dielectric permittivity using the empirical topp et al 1980 equation by comparing with θ measurements from gravimetric sampling tian et al 2018 reported that use of the topp et al 1980 equation provided accurate θ values for the loamy sand used in this study depth averaged θ values from tdr were used to calculate hourly δs w dynamics see fig 3 the average of measurements from adjacent sensors was used as the value at the mid depth between the sensor installation depths both heat pulse based and tdr based δs w estimates along with sensible heat balance method estimated e values using heat pulse sensors were used to calculate q l values referred to as the heat pulse based q l and the combined heat pulse and tdr based q l several approaches have been developed for in situ measurement of soil ψ we conducted a preliminary experiment using micro tensiometers for determination of soil ψ however the micro tensiometers had limited measurement range and failed to work properly in this loamy sand under relatively dry conditions thus in this study soil ψ values were measured with the mps 6 water potential sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa which were more robust than the micro tensiometers and extended the measurement range to air dry conditions for sensor installation we moistened some native soil packed it firmly around the sensor disc and inserted the packed sensor horizontally into a channel at the desired depth via a trench mps 6 sensors were installed at 1 3 5 10 and 15 cm depths fig 2 accordingly ψ gradients at depths of 2 4 7 5 and 12 5 cm were estimated from mps 6 measurements we then calculated the corresponding accumulated e and δs w values for the 0 2 0 4 0 7 5 and 0 12 5 cm soil layers using the heat pulse based method and the combined heat pulse and tdr based method at the same site a weather station measured daily rainfall net radiation air temperature and humidity atmospheric pressure and wind speed the q l values at depths of 2 4 7 5 and 12 5 cm were derived from e δsw and rainfall rate subsequently k values at the same depths were estimated with eq 4 fig 3 gives the detailed spatial arrangements of all the measurements and computational procedures for parameters needed for estimating k at various depths or for specific soil layers 2 3 validation of in situ k estimates in order to verify the accuracy of the in situ k estimates soil k ψ curves were also determined in the laboratory intact soil cores 8 cm diameter by 5 cm long from depths of 0 5 cm 5 10 cm and 10 15 cm were collected from the same site in the laboratory soil k values were determined using a hyprop device ums gmbh munich germany during the measurement the soil column hyprop device assembly was placed on a balance ψ values at two depths 1 25 and 3 75 cm within the soil cores and weight loss were recorded continuously and automatically and then k values were calculated from the measurements using the hyprop fit software following the schindler 1980 evaporation method there were two replicates for each depth laboratory measured k ψ curves were compared with in situ estimates at depths of 2 4 7 5 and 12 5 cm it is difficult to quantify the accuracy of in situ k estimates directly using laboratory measured k ψ curves because they were determined at various ψ values and ranges in this study we fitted the mualem van genuchten relative hydraulic conductivity model van genuchten 1980 to the laboratory measured k ψ curves and then applied the model predictions for verifying the accuracy of the in situ estimates the mualem van genuchten model is given as follows 5 s e 1 1 α ψ n 1 1 n 6 k k s s e l 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n 2 where s e is the effective degree of saturation α and n are empirical shape parameters for the water retention curve and l is an empirical pore connectivity parameter commonly an l of 0 5 is used mualem 1976 but several studies have indicated that l varied over a wide range and could be negative yates et al 1992 schaap leij 2000 in this study we measured k s of soil samples at 0 to 15 cm depth with a constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 and obtained α n and l parameters by fitting the model to the laboratory measured k ψ curves of soil samples from 0 to 5 5 to 10 and 10 to 15 cm depths the goodness of fit was quantified with the root mean square error rmse between fitted and measured k values the calculation of rmse is given as follows 7 r m s e log 10 k m e a s u r e d log 10 k f i t t e d 2 n where n is the number of data points logarithmic values of k were used in eq 7 because k varied over several orders of magnitude finally we calculated the rmse between the in situ k estimates and model predictions using best fit parameters to evaluate the performance of the new field measurement based approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 components of heat and water balance and matric potential gradient fig 4 presents an example of heat and water balance components and ψ measurements required for estimating k at the 2 cm depth during a 10 day period within these days a rainfall of 10 5 mm occurred on april 12 and two smaller rainfalls both were 0 3 mm occurred on april 13 and 17 respectively fig 4c for all three rain events the intensity was much smaller than the k s 53 mm h 1 and thus was lower than the potential infiltration rate fig 4a gives the sensible heat balance method estimated hourly e rate in the 0 to 2 cm soil layer for this near surface soil layer e and net radiation showed consistent trends in their diurnal variations the e estimates in the other layers were much lower than those in the 0 to 2 cm soil layer data not shown previous studies made at the same field site showed that the estimated accumulated e by using the sensible heat balance method agreed well with measurements from micro lysimeter and micro bowen ratio methods holland et al 2013 deol et al 2014 we note that the sensible heat balance method ignores the heat convection from the liquid water flux at the drying front because it is negligibly small compared to the sensible heat flux by conduction sakai et al 2011 however rainfall induced infiltration may have a larger effect because the associated water fluxes are relatively large thus e should be assumed to be 0 mm h 1 during rainfall when computing the water balance in our study the rainfall events mainly occurred during the night time when evaporation rates were very small fig 4 fig 4b and c present the hourly δs w dynamics in the 0 to 2 cm soil layer and cumulative δs w values i e net change in water storage over time from the heat pulse based and tdr based methods during the study period compared to the heat pulse based method the tdr based method estimated δs w showed greater temporal fluctuations fig 4b this might be because hourly θ values measured with tdr were used to calculate δs w but δs w values estimated with heat pulse sensors were obtained using c values measured each three hours the cumulative δs w estimates from both heat pulse based and tdr based methods were in good agreement with a mean bias heat pulse minus tdr of 0 07 mm within the 10 day period fig 4c heitman et al 2003 reported that the heat pulse method was more appropriate for determining change in θ than for determining its absolute value which was consistent with the approach used for the calculation of δs w herein i e change in water storage rather than absolute water storage thus by comparison to tdr and from observations reported previously the heat pulse method was shown to be capable of providing accurate δs w estimates the cumulative δs w values estimated with the heat pulse based method did however show a diurnal variation that was more evident than those estimated with the tdr based method the diurnal pattern in cumulative δs w is consistent with the diurnal cycling in near surface θ reported by others jackson 1978 mcinnes et al 1986 cahill and parlange 1998 heitman et al 2008a diurnal variations in ψ at the 1 cm depth were also observed in our study fig 4e the difference between heat pulse and tdr data might also result from the differences in measurement volumes the three rod tdr sensor has a larger sensing volume about 50 cm3 compared to the heat pulse sensor which has a sensing volume of about 20 cm3 schwartz et al 2013 knight et al 2007 thus the tdr is not as likely to capture diurnal variation in θ at shallow depths the hourly δs w estimates from both heat pulse based and tdr based methods were used to calculate q l at the 2 cm depth fig 4d q l estimates using δs w from the two methods matched closely with each other linear regression analysis indicated that a strong correlation existed between q l estimates from the two methods r 2 0 85 and rmse 0 26 mm h 1 on most days negative q l values upward flow of liquid water were observed at the 2 cm depth and the magnitude of q l generally increased from mid morning through mid afternoon and then decreased from late afternoon through mid night the diurnal pattern in q l was driven by evaporation most of the evaporation in the 0 to 2 cm soil layer occurred in the daytime which resulted in water moving upwards from below large positive values of q l downward flow of liquid water observed on april 12 were caused by infiltrating rainwater that moved past the 2 cm soil depth on that day in general the pattern and magnitude of the subsurface q l dynamics appeared reasonable and was consistent between the two methods used to estimate δs w fig 4e shows the ψ dynamics at depths of 1 and 3 cm within the 10 day period the ψ at the 1 cm depth showed a significant diurnal variation caused by the evaporation of water and condensation of water vapor for the 3 cm depth however the diurnal variation only occurred on days with relatively dry conditions the ψ measurements at 1 and 3 cm depths were used to estimate ψ gradients at the 2 cm depth k values at the 2 cm depth were derived from the ψ gradients and q l estimates using eq 4 3 2 k estimates at different depths fig 5 presents the estimated in situ k dynamics at depths of 2 4 7 5 and 12 5 cm the heat pulse based and the combined heat pulse and tdr based k values agreed well with each other most of the time the θ dynamics from the tdr method are also included in fig 5 in which θ values at the 2 cm depth were estimated from measurements made at depths of 0 8 and 2 4 cm using linear interpolation generally θ increased with increasing soil depth and k varied with depth and time following changes in θ at the 2 cm depth k varied over a range of 10 4 10 mm h 1 due to significant changes in θ at the 4 and 7 5 cm depths k varied over a smaller range 10 3 1 mm h 1 than it did at the 2 cm depth at the 12 5 cm depth k remained relatively constant compared to the upper depths during the study period both heat pulse based and combined heat pulse and tdr based k values showed diurnal variations at all four depths fig 5 the diurnal pattern in k seemed to conflict with ψ and θ values which did not show substantial diurnal variations at depth this might be because of the time and depth approximations we used in the buckingham darcy equation which created an artifact that propagated downward from the diurnally varying surface flux the diurnal variations were more significant in the heat pulse based k estimates than in those from the combined heat pulse and tdr method and this phenomenon was related to the difference in q l estimates fig 4d as indicated above the tdr sensor has a relatively large sensing volume for measuring θ compared to the heat pulse method thus it may not have the capability to capture fine scale variations in θ at shallow depths on the other hand the tdr method might give more accurate δs w estimates in the 5 to 15 cm soil layers than the heat pulse method because for each method only two sensors were installed at these depths and the heat pulse sensor has a relatively small sensing volume about half the sensing volume of tdr sensor in general the trends observed in k dynamics over depth and time from both methods appeared to be reasonable fig 6 a illustrates the relationship between k from the heat pulse based method and θ at various depths the k θ relationship seemed to be influenced by soil depth for the same k θ at 2 and 4 cm depths were lower than those at 7 5 and 12 5 cm which was likely due to differences in soil bulk density fig 6b previous studies have reported that soil bulk density has a considerable impact on the soil water retention curve assouline 2006 zhang et al 2018 from fig 6c we can see that the field measured water retention curve varied with soil depth as did the soil bulk density for near surface soil with a smaller bulk density 0 to 5 cm depth smaller θ values were observed at the same ψ values compared to the soil at deeper depths which had larger bulk density 5 to 15 cm depth this happened because the near surface soil with smaller bulk density had larger pores and thus shallow soil held less water at relatively large ψ values than did the deeper soil since k values were directly estimated from ψ gradient it had a similar dependence on depth bulk density as did the soil water retention curve 3 3 evaluation of in situ k estimates fig 7 shows a comparison of estimated k ψ in situ values and laboratory measured k ψ curves k ψ curves measured with the hyprop device for soil samples collected from 0 to 5 5 to 10 and 10 to 15 cm soil layers were not exactly the same they varied within a range in log10 k mm h 1 of 0 5 of the average at the same ψ values this happened because soil bulk density and pore system varied with soil depth the in situ estimated k ψ values had larger variation mostly in log10 k mm h 1 of 1 of the average than the laboratory measurements at the same ψ values wetting and drying cycles have a substantial effect on soil hydraulic properties and hysteresis phenomena are most apparent in situ zhang et al 2018 in the present study several wetting and drying cycles occurred in the field experiment which might contribute to the relatively large variation in k ψ estimates as compared to laboratory measurements which were subjected to only one drying cycle due to the measurement range limitation the hyprop device only gave k measurements at potentials greater than 100 kpa the mps 6 sensor measurement range can include very dry conditions 100 000 kpa which has the potential to extend the measurement range of k to these same relatively dry conditions both heat pulse based and combined heat pulse and tdr based in situ k ψ curves see fig 7a and b respectively showed trends similar to the laboratory measurements at ψ values 20 kpa in situ estimated k values mainly from 2 and 4 cm depths from both methods agreed very well with the laboratory measurements the in situ estimated k values scattered randomly along the laboratory measured k ψ curves within a 0 5 value of log10 k mm h 1 range at ψ values 20 kpa however some of the in situ estimated k values were much larger than the laboratory measurements at large ψ values close to 0 the absolute accuracy of ψ measurements have a greater impact on k estimates compared to smaller ψ ranges when using both our method and the hyprop device the hyprop device determined ψ using micro tensiometers while the in situ approach measured ψ with mps 6 sensors the two sensors are based on different physical principles the micro tensiometers measure ψ with an accuracy of about 0 5 kpa while the mps 6 sensors have errors about 2 kpa in the wet range decagon devices 2017 thus the deviations between in situ estimated and laboratory measured k values at ψ values 20 kpa stem in part from the less accurate ψ measurements by mps 6 sensors we fitted the mualem van genuchten model to laboratory measured k ψ curves to obtain best fit model parameters fig 8 then used model predictions to quantify the accuracy of the in situ k estimates fig 9 compares the heat pulse based and the combined heat pulse and tdr based in situ k estimates to k values predicted by the mualem van genuchten model the k values estimated with the heat pulse based method were in good agreement with model predictions with an average rmse in log10 k mm h 1 of 0 57 and an average bias of 0 17 the combined heat pulse and tdr based method provided k estimates that were slightly greater than the model predictions with an average rmse in log10 k mm h 1 of 0 54 and an average bias of 0 40 on the whole both methods gave reasonable in situ k estimates compared to model predictions the combined heat pulse and tdr based method is more costly than the heat pulse based method however because in addition to tdr measurements it also still requires heat pulse measurements for estimating e overall our results indicate that combining the heat pulse technique with or without supplemental tdr measurements with mps 6 sensors provides a promising approach for in situ estimation of k at a fine depth scale 4 conclusion soil k is a function of soil θ or ψ under field conditions k θ and k ψ relationships vary in time and space due to changes in soil bulk density pore size distribution and many other transient environmental conditions few measurement approaches are currently available for determining in situ k variations combining heat pulse and ψ gradient measurements provides a means to determine in situ k dynamics at a fine depth scale we performed a field experiment to test the feasibility of this new approach for estimating k in situ the results showed that the new approach provided reasonable in situ k estimates at fine depth scale which were in good agreement with those measured in the laboratory using a hyprop device and those predicted using the van genuchten mualem model the field experiment showed that the estimated k θ relationship varied with depth due to variations in bulk density thus the proposed approach is a promising method to estimate k in situ at a fine depth scale and it is capable of determining transient k dynamics that are influenced by variable environmental conditions in this study the new approach was only tested in a loamy sand soil during a short period with simple weather condition further studies on soils with various textures and under changing atmospheric conditions are needed in the future acknowledgements this work is

δs h can be estimated with heat pulse sensor measured soil temperature gradient volumetric heat capacity c and thermal conductivity λ this method is referred to as the sensible heat balance method for more details of the sensible heat balance method please refer to heitman et al 2017 for bare soil conditions without root extraction the e in fig 1 can also be treated as the difference between liquid water flux densities m s 1 at upper and lower boundaries of the soil layer q u and q l respectively and the change in water storage within the soil layer δsw m s 1 2 e q u q l δ s w the value for δs w can be estimated from the change of soil water content θ many approaches have been used to measure θ among these the heat pulse sensor can determine θ dynamics at a fine depth scale and near the soil surface using c measurements heitman et al 2003 zhang et al 2017 thus δsw is derived from heat pulse sensor measured c values as 3 δ s w c i c i 1 δ z δ t c w where ci denotes the soil volumetric heat capacity mj m 3 k 1 measured at time ti δt ti ti 1 is the time step s c w is the volumetric heat capacity of water 4 182 mj m 3 k 1 and δz is the thickness of the soil layer m for a soil profile q u at the soil surface is equal to 0 for the condition of no water input while for the condition of a water input it can be approximated as the rainfall or irrigation rate m s 1 when this rate is lower than the potential infiltration rate thus q l at a depth z defined as positive downward m in the soil profile can be derived from q u and heat pulse sensor estimated e and δs w between depths 0 and z eq 2 if ψ values for unsaturated soils are negative in the soil profile is also measured k at depth z can be estimated using the buckingham darcy equation 4 k q l ψ 2 ψ 1 z 2 z 1 1 where ψ1 and ψ2 are ψ values here using water pressure head in m to unify the units at depths z 1 and z 2 respectively depth z is the center of depths z1 and z 2 i e z z 1 z 2 2 note when the z axis is defined to be positive upward the gravitational term i e 1 in eq 4 changes to 1 2 2 field measurements a field experiment was performed to assess the feasibility of the new approach to determine in situ k values the experimental site was located at the central crops research station clayton nc usa the surface soil layer 0 20 cm at the site has a texture of loamy sand 85 sand 9 silt and 6 clay about 100 m2 area of land was leveled using a harrow and it was maintained bare via weed control with an herbicide throughout the study instrumentation was done in april 2017 the sensors were installed via a 15 cm deep trench by pushing the sensor needles or heads into the undisturbed soil for e measurements heat pulse sensors identical to those described by tian et al 2015 which consisted of three parallel stainless steel needles 4 5 cm length 2 mm diameter and 8 mm needle to needle spacing were used in our study heat pulse sensors were installed at five depths with the central needles positioned at 0 8 2 4 4 7 5 and 12 5 cm respectively fig 2 the plane formed by the needles of each heat pulse sensor was oriented perpendicular to the soil surface ambient soil temperature values were recorded each 15 min with thermocouples positioned in each heat pulse sensor needle heat pulse measurements were performed each 3 h to obtain c and λ dynamics all of the measurements were controlled and recorded with a data logger cr3000 campbell scientific logan ut that was placed in a waterproof enclosure on the soil surface under field conditions heat pulse temperature signals measured in the near surface soil layer can be affected by ambient temperature fluctuations to account for the effect of ambient temperature variations a temperature drift correction following zhang et al 2014 was performed after the correction heat pulse data were then processed using the lu et al 2013 method to derive thermal properties c and λ temperature c and λ measurements were used together to estimate hourly le dynamics fig 3 gives the details on le computations at various depths during the period immediately following a rainfall event stage i evaporation occurs at the surface and is therefore not detectable with heat pulse sensors below the surface sakai et al 2011 xiao et al 2014 developed a modified sensible heat balance method to capture stage i evaporation using combined net radiation and heat pulse measurements in the present study the xiao et al 2014 method was used under such conditions in addition to determining e the heat pulse sensors were also used to estimate hourly δs w mm h 1 dynamics at different depths in the soil profile with eq 3 fig 3 presents the detailed calculation procedure for δs w ren et al 2003 reported that relatively large errors can occur in heat pulse sensor measured θ due to errors in determining specific heat of the soil solids needle deflection is another source of error for heat pulse sensor estimated water content wen et al 2015 and liu et al 2016 present methods for correcting measurements for needle deflections in order to verify the accuracy of heat pulse sensor measured δs w θ was also determined with tdr sensors in the present study five 7 5 cm long tdr sensors model cs645 l campbell scientific inc logan ut usa were inserted horizontally into the undisturbed soil at the same depths as the heat pulse sensors fig 2 for tdr measurements bulk soil dielectric permittivity was recorded hourly with a time domain reflectometer tdr100 campbell scientific logan ut usa and θ was estimated from the dielectric permittivity using the empirical topp et al 1980 equation by comparing with θ measurements from gravimetric sampling tian et al 2018 reported that use of the topp et al 1980 equation provided accurate θ values for the loamy sand used in this study depth averaged θ values from tdr were used to calculate hourly δs w dynamics see fig 3 the average of measurements from adjacent sensors was used as the value at the mid depth between the sensor installation depths both heat pulse based and tdr based δs w estimates along with sensible heat balance method estimated e values using heat pulse sensors were used to calculate q l values referred to as the heat pulse based q l and the combined heat pulse and tdr based q l several approaches have been developed for in situ measurement of soil ψ we conducted a preliminary experiment using micro tensiometers for determination of soil ψ however the micro tensiometers had limited measurement range and failed to work properly in this loamy sand under relatively dry conditions thus in this study soil ψ values were measured with the mps 6 water potential sensors decagon devices inc pullman wa usa which were more robust than the micro tensiometers and extended the measurement range to air dry conditions for sensor installation we moistened some native soil packed it firmly around the sensor disc and inserted the packed sensor horizontally into a channel at the desired depth via a trench mps 6 sensors were installed at 1 3 5 10 and 15 cm depths fig 2 accordingly ψ gradients at depths of 2 4 7 5 and 12 5 cm were estimated from mps 6 measurements we then calculated the corresponding accumulated e and δs w values for the 0 2 0 4 0 7 5 and 0 12 5 cm soil layers using the heat pulse based method and the combined heat pulse and tdr based method at the same site a weather station measured daily rainfall net radiation air temperature and humidity atmospheric pressure and wind speed the q l values at depths of 2 4 7 5 and 12 5 cm were derived from e δsw and rainfall rate subsequently k values at the same depths were estimated with eq 4 fig 3 gives the detailed spatial arrangements of all the measurements and computational procedures for parameters needed for estimating k at various depths or for specific soil layers 2 3 validation of in situ k estimates in order to verify the accuracy of the in situ k estimates soil k ψ curves were also determined in the laboratory intact soil cores 8 cm diameter by 5 cm long from depths of 0 5 cm 5 10 cm and 10 15 cm were collected from the same site in the laboratory soil k values were determined using a hyprop device ums gmbh munich germany during the measurement the soil column hyprop device assembly was placed on a balance ψ values at two depths 1 25 and 3 75 cm within the soil cores and weight loss were recorded continuously and automatically and then k values were calculated from the measurements using the hyprop fit software following the schindler 1980 evaporation method there were two replicates for each depth laboratory measured k ψ curves were compared with in situ estimates at depths of 2 4 7 5 and 12 5 cm it is difficult to quantify the accuracy of in situ k estimates directly using laboratory measured k ψ curves because they were determined at various ψ values and ranges in this study we fitted the mualem van genuchten relative hydraulic conductivity model van genuchten 1980 to the laboratory measured k ψ curves and then applied the model predictions for verifying the accuracy of the in situ estimates the mualem van genuchten model is given as follows 5 s e 1 1 α ψ n 1 1 n 6 k k s s e l 1 1 s e n n 1 1 1 n 2 where s e is the effective degree of saturation α and n are empirical shape parameters for the water retention curve and l is an empirical pore connectivity parameter commonly an l of 0 5 is used mualem 1976 but several studies have indicated that l varied over a wide range and could be negative yates et al 1992 schaap leij 2000 in this study we measured k s of soil samples at 0 to 15 cm depth with a constant head method klute and dirksen 1986 and obtained α n and l parameters by fitting the model to the laboratory measured k ψ curves of soil samples from 0 to 5 5 to 10 and 10 to 15 cm depths the goodness of fit was quantified with the root mean square error rmse between fitted and measured k values the calculation of rmse is given as follows 7 r m s e log 10 k m e a s u r e d log 10 k f i t t e d 2 n where n is the number of data points logarithmic values of k were used in eq 7 because k varied over several orders of magnitude finally we calculated the rmse between the in situ k estimates and model predictions using best fit parameters to evaluate the performance of the new field measurement based approach 3 results and discussion 3 1 components of heat and water balance and matric potential gradient fig 4 presents an example of heat and water balance components and ψ measurements required for estimating k at the 2 cm depth during a 10 day period within these days a rainfall of 10 5 mm occurred on april 12 and two smaller rainfalls both were 0 3 mm occurred on april 13 and 17 respectively fig 4c for all three rain events the intensity was much smaller than the k s 53 mm h 1 and thus was lower than the potential infiltration rate fig 4a gives the sensible heat balance method estimated hourly e rate in the 0 to 2 cm soil layer for this near surface soil layer e and net radiation showed consistent trends in their diurnal variations the e estimates in the other layers were much lower than those in the 0 to 2 cm soil layer data not shown previous studies made at the same field site showed that the estimated accumulated e by using the sensible heat balance method agreed well with measurements from micro lysimeter and micro bowen ratio methods holland et al 2013 deol et al 2014 we note that the sensible heat balance method ignores the heat convection from the liquid water flux at the drying front because it is negligibly small compared to the sensible heat flux by conduction sakai et al 2011 however rainfall induced infiltration may have a larger effect because the associated water fluxes are relatively large thus e should be assumed to be 0 mm h 1 during rainfall when computing the water balance in our study the rainfall events mainly occurred during the night time when evaporation rates were very small fig 4 fig 4b and c present the hourly δs w dynamics in the 0 to 2 cm soil layer and cumulative δs w values i e net change in water storage over time from the heat pulse based and tdr based methods during the study period compared to the heat pulse based method the tdr based method estimated δs w showed greater temporal fluctuations fig 4b this might be because hourly θ values measured with tdr were used to calculate δs w but δs w values estimated with heat pulse sensors were obtained using c values measured each three hours the cumulative δs w estimates from both heat pulse based and tdr based methods were in good agreement with a mean bias heat pulse minus tdr of 0 07 mm within the 10 day period fig 4c heitman et al 2003 reported that the heat pulse method was more appropriate for determining change in θ than for determining its absolute value which was consistent with the approach used for the calculation of δs w herein i e change in water storage rather than absolute water storage thus by comparison to tdr and from observations reported previously the heat pulse method was shown to be capable of providing accurate δs w estimates the cumulative δs w values estimated with the heat pulse based method did however show a diurnal variation that was more evident than those estimated with the tdr based method the diurnal pattern in cumulative δs w is consistent with the diurnal cycling in near surface θ reported by others jackson 1978 mcinnes et al 1986 cahill and parlange 1998 heitman et al 2008a diurnal variations in ψ at the 1 cm depth were also observed in our study fig 4e the difference between heat pulse and tdr data might also result from the differences in measurement volumes the three rod tdr sensor has a larger sensing volume about 50 cm3 compared to the heat pulse sensor which has a sensing volume of about 20 cm3 schwartz et al 2013 knight et al 2007 thus the tdr is not as likely to capture diurnal variation in θ at shallow depths the hourly δs w estimates from both heat pulse based and tdr based methods were used to calculate q l at the 2 cm depth fig 4d q l estimates using δs w from the two methods matched closely with each other linear regression analysis indicated that a strong correlation existed between q l estimates from the two methods r 2 0 85 and rmse 0 26 mm h 1 on most days negative q l values upward flow of liquid water were observed at the 2 cm depth and the magnitude of q l generally increased from mid morning through mid afternoon and then decreased from late afternoon through mid night the diurnal pattern in q l was driven by evaporation most of the evaporation in the 0 to 2 cm soil layer occurred in the daytime which resulted in water moving upwards from below large positive values of q l downward flow of liquid water observed on april 12 were caused by infiltrating rainwater that moved past the 2 cm soil depth on that day in general the pattern and magnitude of the subsurface q l dynamics appeared reasonable and was consistent between the two methods used to estimate δs w fig 4e shows the ψ dynamics at depths of 1 and 3 cm within the 10 day period the ψ at the 1 cm depth showed a significant diurnal variation caused by the evaporation of water and condensation of water vapor for the 3 cm depth however the diurnal variation only occurred on days with relatively dry conditions the ψ measurements at 1 and 3 cm depths were used to estimate ψ gradients at the 2 cm depth k values at the 2 cm depth were derived from the ψ gradients and q l estimates using eq 4 3 2 k estimates at different depths fig 5 presents the estimated in situ k dynamics at depths of 2 4 7 5 and 12 5 cm the heat pulse based and the combined heat pulse and tdr based k values agreed well with each other most of the time the θ dynamics from the tdr method are also included in fig 5 in which θ values at the 2 cm depth were estimated from measurements made at depths of 0 8 and 2 4 cm using linear interpolation generally θ increased with increasing soil depth and k varied with depth and time following changes in θ at the 2 cm depth k varied over a range of 10 4 10 mm h 1 due to significant changes in θ at the 4 and 7 5 cm depths k varied over a smaller range 10 3 1 mm h 1 than it did at the 2 cm depth at the 12 5 cm depth k remained relatively constant compared to the upper depths during the study period both heat pulse based and combined heat pulse and tdr based k values showed diurnal variations at all four depths fig 5 the diurnal pattern in k seemed to conflict with ψ and θ values which did not show substantial diurnal variations at depth this might be because of the time and depth approximations we used in the buckingham darcy equation which created an artifact that propagated downward from the diurnally varying surface flux the diurnal variations were more significant in the heat pulse based k estimates than in those from the combined heat pulse and tdr method and this phenomenon was related to the difference in q l estimates fig 4d as indicated above the tdr sensor has a relatively large sensing volume for measuring θ compared to the heat pulse method thus it may not have the capability to capture fine scale variations in θ at shallow depths on the other hand the tdr method might give more accurate δs w estimates in the 5 to 15 cm soil layers than the heat pulse method because for each method only two sensors were installed at these depths and the heat pulse sensor has a relatively small sensing volume about half the sensing volume of tdr sensor in general the trends observed in k dynamics over depth and time from both methods appeared to be reasonable fig 6 a illustrates the relationship between k from the heat pulse based method and θ at various depths the k θ relationship seemed to be influenced by soil depth for the same k θ at 2 and 4 cm depths were lower than those at 7 5 and 12 5 cm which was likely due to differences in soil bulk density fig 6b previous studies have reported that soil bulk density has a considerable impact on the soil water retention curve assouline 2006 zhang et al 2018 from fig 6c we can see that the field measured water retention curve varied with soil depth as did the soil bulk density for near surface soil with a smaller bulk density 0 to 5 cm depth smaller θ values were observed at the same ψ values compared to the soil at deeper depths which had larger bulk density 5 to 15 cm depth this happened because the near surface soil with smaller bulk density had larger pores and thus shallow soil held less water at relatively large ψ values than did the deeper soil since k values were directly estimated from ψ gradient it had a similar dependence on depth bulk density as did the soil water retention curve 3 3 evaluation of in situ k estimates fig 7 shows a comparison of estimated k ψ in situ values and laboratory measured k ψ curves k ψ curves measured with the hyprop device for soil samples collected from 0 to 5 5 to 10 and 10 to 15 cm soil layers were not exactly the same they varied within a range in log10 k mm h 1 of 0 5 of the average at the same ψ values this happened because soil bulk density and pore system varied with soil depth the in situ estimated k ψ values had larger variation mostly in log10 k mm h 1 of 1 of the average than the laboratory measurements at the same ψ values wetting and drying cycles have a substantial effect on soil hydraulic properties and hysteresis phenomena are most apparent in situ zhang et al 2018 in the present study several wetting and drying cycles occurred in the field experiment which might contribute to the relatively large variation in k ψ estimates as compared to laboratory measurements which were subjected to only one drying cycle due to the measurement range limitation the hyprop device only gave k measurements at potentials greater than 100 kpa the mps 6 sensor measurement range can include very dry conditions 100 000 kpa which has the potential to extend the measurement range of k to these same relatively dry conditions both heat pulse based and combined heat pulse and tdr based in situ k ψ curves see fig 7a and b respectively showed trends similar to the laboratory measurements at ψ values 20 kpa in situ estimated k values mainly from 2 and 4 cm depths from both methods agreed very well with the laboratory measurements the in situ estimated k values scattered randomly along the laboratory measured k ψ curves within a 0 5 value of log10 k mm h 1 range at ψ values 20 kpa however some of the in situ estimated k values were much larger than the laboratory measurements at large ψ values close to 0 the absolute accuracy of ψ measurements have a greater impact on k estimates compared to smaller ψ ranges when using both our method and the hyprop device the hyprop device determined ψ using micro tensiometers while the in situ approach measured ψ with mps 6 sensors the two sensors are based on different physical principles the micro tensiometers measure ψ with an accuracy of about 0 5 kpa while the mps 6 sensors have errors about 2 kpa in the wet range decagon devices 2017 thus the deviations between in situ estimated and laboratory measured k values at ψ values 20 kpa stem in part from the less accurate ψ measurements by mps 6 sensors we fitted the mualem van genuchten model to laboratory measured k ψ curves to obtain best fit model parameters fig 8 then used model predictions to quantify the accuracy of the in situ k estimates fig 9 compares the heat pulse based and the combined heat pulse and tdr based in situ k estimates to k values predicted by the mualem van genuchten model the k values estimated with the heat pulse based method were in good agreement with model predictions with an average rmse in log10 k mm h 1 of 0 57 and an average bias of 0 17 the combined heat pulse and tdr based method provided k estimates that were slightly greater than the model predictions with an average rmse in log10 k mm h 1 of 0 54 and an average bias of 0 40 on the whole both methods gave reasonable in situ k estimates compared to model predictions the combined heat pulse and tdr based method is more costly than the heat pulse based method however because in addition to tdr measurements it also still requires heat pulse measurements for estimating e overall our results indicate that combining the heat pulse technique with or without supplemental tdr measurements with mps 6 sensors provides a promising approach for in situ estimation of k at a fine depth scale 4 conclusion soil k is a function of soil θ or ψ under field conditions k θ and k ψ relationships vary in time and space due to changes in soil bulk density pore size distribution and many other transient environmental conditions few measurement approaches are currently available for determining in situ k variations combining heat pulse and ψ gradient measurements provides a means to determine in situ k dynamics at a fine depth scale we performed a field experiment to test the feasibility of this new approach for estimating k in situ the results showed that the new approach provided reasonable in situ k estimates at fine depth scale which were in good agreement with those measured in the laboratory using a hyprop device and those predicted using the van genuchten mualem model the field experiment showed that the estimated k θ relationship varied with depth due to variations in bulk density thus the proposed approach is a promising method to estimate k in situ at a fine depth scale and it is capable of determining transient k dynamics that are influenced by variable environmental conditions in this study the new approach was only tested in a loamy sand soil

7101,in this study we aim to characterise natural variability of water temperature in surface waters of the tatra mts and determine the dominant factors controlling its spatial diversity and seasonal patterns for this purpose a total of 33 time series of water temperature representing lakes vaucluse springs and streams were analysed using the continuous wavelet transform cwt the periodicity analysis were conducted with the morlet wavelet on hourly sampled data covering aperiod of 5 years the principal components analysis pca has been applied to describe the relationships among variables and extract potential sources of water temperature variability the results showed an extremely high heterogeneity in temporal patterns of water temperature fluctuations among streams when compared to lakes and vaucluse springs wavelet analysis of water temperature time series revealed the presence of seven different configurations of periodical patterns the lowest variability was observed among vaucluse springs that are supplied by groundwaters temporal fluctuations of water temperature in lakes contained four different types of oscillations streams were among the most diversified in terms of water temperature patterns exhibiting low medium and high frequency behaviour the pca analysis confirmed the dependence of water temperature on weather conditions catchment characteristics and flow rate explaining 88 97 of the total variability in the data the results obtained from this study emphasize the importance of continuous data collection for capturing the long term dynamics and consistent temporal patterns in time series the study also demonstrates that wavelet analysis is helpful to identify cyclical patterns in time series of water temperature and therefore may be useful in the classification of thermal regimes in surface waters keywords water temperature the tatra mts vaucluse springs groundwaters the continuous wavelet transform the principal components analysis 1 introduction water temperature is one of the most essential physical properties of water influencing the functioning of aquatic ecosystems it affects stream metabolism the distribution of species and rate of biochemical reactions demars et al 2011 the temperature regime of surface waters defined asthe regular pattern of water temperature fluctuations is shaped by a variety of interrelated factors such as climatological conditions recharge sources meltwater groundwater precipitation basin characteristics and human activity brown et al 2006 brown and hannah 2007 2008 caissie 2006 vanzo et al 2015 therefore studies on the thermal regime require not only sufficiently long time series webb et al 2008 but also relevant methods for capturing its main components turschwell et al 2016 temporal fluctuations of water temperature have usually been analysed in time domain taking into account different statistical measures of the thermal regime such as mean minimal and maximal temperatures these measures have been further extended by some additional descriptors such as magnitude variability duration frequency timing and the rate of change arismendi et al 2013 maheu et al 2016 however apart from general informative content none of these metrics consider water temperature variability at multiple temporal scales simultaneously steel and lange 2007 the transformation of time series into frequency domain may provide far more detailed characteristics of the thermal regime like dominant frequencies periodicities in time series their duration and occurrence in time drewnik et al 2018 kirchner et al 2004 rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2015 2016 zolezzi et al 2009 2011 those characteristics of water temperature regime are equally important because they strongly influence aquatic ecosystems from this point of view spectral methods such as the wavelet transform constitute an adequate alternative for standard statistical analysis nowadays studies on the thermal regime of rivers and streams became of particular importance in terms of climate changes especially in mountainous regions that remain unaffected by human activity in here water temperature can be considered as a good indicator of climate changes as well as a tracer of physical processes in catchments ficklin et al 2013 the use of temperature as atracer has a long history constantz 2008 stonestrom and constantz 2003 measurements of water temperature help to elucidate the mechanisms that control different hydrologic processes identify possible groundwater sources and recharge zones as well as depths and lengths of groundwater circulation so far the natural variability of water temperature in surface waters in the tatra mts has not yet received a comprehensive study apart from the basic interest in the average values of groundwaters and surface water temperature seasonal variability and potential spatial diversity the detailed long term variability has never been reported most early studies were either unsystematic often limited to manual single spot measurements or covered relatively short periods of time therefore data obtained from those studies tend to be heterogeneous and poses relatively high percentage of missing values in the present work we investigated natural inter and intra annual variability of water temperature in streams karst springs and lakes located in the tatra mts using high resolution data we attempted to find an answer on how does the natural variability of water temperature at those different locations accounts for the type and number of periodicities occurring in time series the main goals of this study were to 1 detect dominant modes of water temperature variability 2 describe patterns of temporal variability of water temperature and their different configurations and 3 identify the key drivers that influence thermal variability of streams springs and lakes 2 site description the tatra mts are the highest mountain range in the carpathian mountains forming a natural border between poland and slovakia they occupy a total area of about 750 km2 1 5 of which is located on polish territory fig 1 both polish and slovak parts of the tatra mts are protected within the tatra national park approved as an international biosphere reserve unesco and area of nature 2000 the tatras have preserved their natural character with high mountain relief pristine landscape and a variety of natural features such as canyons waterfalls a dwarf pine belt alpine meadows lakes and rocky peaks the geological structure of the tatra mts is complex the tatra mts consist of crystalline basement core and sedimentary cover the crystalline core comprises igneous mainly granitic and metamorphic rocks whose main outcrops are located in western and eastern parts of the polish tatras respectively crystalline rocks of the tatra mts which formed during the variscan orogeny have undergone multiple phases of tectonic activity the sedimentary cover is composed of mesozoic rocks such as sandstones limestones marls dolomites and slates which were thrusted over the core in northern direction during eo alpine orogenic phase anczkiewicz et al 2015 and references therein the main geological units are locally covered by quaternary sediments associated with the pleistocene glaciation and holocene processes of erosion and accumulation uchman 2004 the outcrops of crystalline rocks are situated in the southern part of the polish tatra mts along the main ridges sedimentary rock outcrops preserved mainly to the north and build lower parts of the mountains bac moszaszwili et al 1979 piotrowska et al 2015 one of the characteristic features of the tatra mts is a vertical zonation of climatic conditions vegetation cover and morphogenetic processes hess 1996 kotarba and starkel 1972 piękoś mirkowa and mirek 1996 skiba et al 2015 the average sums of precipitation in the tatras vary from 1120 mm at the foothills up to 1800 mm at the mountain peaks żmudzka 2010 whereas the average air temperature ranges between 6 0 c and 2 0 c respectively niedźwiedź 1992 in terms of hydrology the area stands out from the rest part of the carpathian mts exhibiting a great diversity of ice phenomena because it tends to be affected by local hydrogeological conditions żelazny et al 2015 the tatra mts constitute a source area for many streams most of them fed by groundwaters flowing waters of the tatra mts are represented by small streams with a steep gradient turbulent current and rocky bottom both high velocity streams and those fed by karst springs may lack of ice cover even when temperatures drop below freezing the distribution of springs varies significantly depending on geological structure the highest number of springs is associated with areas built of quaternary deposits e g moraine formations whereas the highest flowrates are characteristic for vaucluse springs occurring in karstified carbonate rocks this type of springs has an extensive alimentation area i e recharge zone that is located beyond the topographic boundary of the catchment and are recharged by karst flows from other parts of the massif arrows in fig 1 show documented karst flows crystalline part of the tatra mts is relatively poor in terms of abundance and flowrate of springs małecka 1997 lakes occurring in the tatra mts are of glacial origin such as tarns and bedrock moraine dammed lakes among them the most spectacular type known as the paternoster lake is represented by lakes in the five polish lakes valley pociask karteczka et al 2014 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sets data used in the present study were obtained from 33 monitoring sites located in the tatra national park including streams 24 pts karst springs 6 pts and lakes 3 pts fig 1 please note the term karst spring is used interchangeably with vaucluse spring the latter has been adopted from earlier studies carried out in the tatra mts barczyk 2002 2008 małecka 1997 measurement points were chosen to represent various types of catchments and recharge zones in terms of morphology and geological units characteristics of selected sites including mean flowrate elevation afforestation degree channel slope and geology are summarised in table 1 channel slopes were calculated based on a 10x10 m digital elevation model dem with respect to all pixels located along the streamline afforestation degree was calculated with reference to the elementary basins cut by the streamline measurement points were arranged by valleys from west to east and by elevation above sea level from the highest point to the lowest point in the given valley for the sake of simplicity streams flowing through different geological units are referred to as transit table 1 water temperature data comprised of 33 sets of time

logger supplied with lithium batteries of min 5 years longevity operating within the temperature range from 25 c to 70 c the instrument features a ceramic pressure cell that provides the stability in long term measurements as well as mechanical resistance to pressure overload and corrosive waters some of the loggers are paired with ott itc for remote data transfer loggers were installed either in springheads or on the bed of streams and lakes automatic measurements were verified several times a year by manual measurements at site using wtw handheld conductivity meters the retrieved data from data loggers cover a period of approximately 5 to 6 years between 01 11 2009 and 31 10 2015 fig 1 table 1 prior to analysis time series were inspected for exceptionally high values negative values of water temperature were considered erroneous and were replaced by 0 c 3 2 time series analysis water temperature fluctuations in 33 time series were analysed in frequency domain using the continuous wavelet transform cwt to adequately capture variability in one framework during the transformation original time series are decomposed into components called wavelets that represent shifted and scaled

wavelet x t is the time series whereas the asterisks indicates a complex conjugate the mother wavelet is characterised by limited duration and average that is equal to 0 in this study the morlet wavelet has been applied as the mother wavelet which is defined as 2 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e η 2 2 where η denotes dimensionless time and ω 0 ω 0 6 is a dimensionless frequency the morlet wavelet relatively well resembles the shape of environmental time series and has a fairly good localisation in time and frequency cazelles et al 2008 grinsted et al 2004 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 labat 2008 the mother wavelet is subjected to scaling a and translation b resulting in a matrix of continuous wavelet coefficients that measure the similarity between analysed fragment of time series and the mother wavelet the wavelet power was normalised by variance to have unit energy at all timescales ψ 2 t d t 1 grinsted et al 2004 in this way narrow wavelets small scales can detect fast changing features while stretched wavelets large scales allow for the separation of low frequency characteristics kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 the main result of the continuous wavelet transform is a three dimensional colour map of the wavelet power spectrum w a b 2 which shows the distribution of power at certain scale a period and time position b the finite length of the time series results in edge effect which is visible at both sides of the wavelet power spectrum torrence and compo 1998 this is due to the fact that the wavelet is moved along the signal and the convolution is calculated for each time step and for each scale consequently calculations at edges of the signal require non existing values this region is termed as the cone of influence coi the statistical significance of results obtained from wavelet analysis was assessed against the null hypotheses that the signal is generated by a stationary process with a theoretical red noise power spectrum grinsted et al 2004 all calculations were performed in matlab software basing on a script developed by grinsted et al 2004 the principal components analysis pca was applied to identify independent variables shaping water temperature variability in relation to abiotic components of the physical environment component loadings in the pca analysis were calculated based on 17 variables including hydrological 8 meterological 5 and physical 4 parameters such as minimum maximum median average amplitude and coefficients of variability of water temperature tw min tw max tw me tw av tw amp and tw cv respectively minimum maximum average and amplitude of air temperature ta min ta max ta av and ta amp respectively precipitation totals p average stream discharge and coefficient of variability of the stream discharge q av and q cv respectively elevation e catchment area a channel slope s and afforestation degree f air temperature data and precipitation totals were aggregated as the annual values while tw min tw max tw me tw av were calculated for the whole analysed period of time tw amp was calculated as the difference between maximum and minimum values of water temperature recorded in the whole analysed period of time ta amp was calculated for the annual values the number of the most important factors was determined based on the kaiser criterion factor loadings 0 45 were used to indicate significant correlations the choice of particular parameters and restricting the pca analysis to streams was intentional the minimum and maximum water temperatures actually differentiate investigated streams to those which are recharged by vaucluse springs and those which are not this is because streams recharged by vaucluse springs exhibit higher minimum water temperature water temperature never drops to 0 c and lower maximum water temperature in turn the parameters such as average maximum and minimum annual air temperatures and precipitation totals describe climatic conditions in the studied area therefore the greater the differences between meteorological characteristics and parameters defining the thermal conditions of streams water temperature in streams the more likely is the impact of other factors e g topographic or hydrogeological on stream water temperature 4 results 4 1 water temperature fluctuations in surface waters the analysis of time series showed that data obtained from lakes are characterised by wider interquartile range and contain more extreme maximum values when compared to data from streams and springs fig 2 wide temperature fluctuations have also been observed in some of the streams such as s20 s22 and s6 it is also visible that the distribution of points shows aright skewness because the majority of points are located above the median value in contrast to lakes vaucluse springs displayed a relatively constant water temperature over the year and asmaller spread of values with water temperatures rarely exceeding 7 c the lodowe spring v2 is of particular interest because the amplitude of water temperature fluctuations during the year never exceeded 1 c it can also be noted that water temperature data from vaucluse springs are pretty symmetrically distributed roughly the same applies to streams because the median value is located in the middle of the box fig 2 water temperature maxima varied among sites more than minima that are limited by the freezing point of water during the investigated period of time maxima of water temperature in lakes and in a vast majority of streams predominantly occurred in august owning to reduced water levels and increased atmospheric heating in the case of vaucluse springs the maxima of water temperature were frequently recorded in september among streams the highest water temperatures greater than 15 c occurred at sites s20 s21 and s22 fig 2 the average water temperature among streams was very similar 4 9 1 1 c the minima of water temperature in streams were frequently observed during winter from december to march in lakes the minima of water temperature usually occurred in an extended period of time from november till may karst springs v1 v6 and streams fed by karst springs e g s15 s17 exhibited the warmest minimum water temperature fig 2 4 2 factors controlling water temperature variability in streams according to the pca analysis water temperature variability in streams is shaped by four independent factors that together explained 88 97 of the total variability table 2 fig 3 the first factor f1 explained the maximum variance and subsequent factors explained progressively smaller portions of the total variance first factor f1 explained 48 54 of the variability in the data set it is tightly bound with the altitudinal zonation table 2 it describes the negative relation between air and water temperature and physical characteristics of the stream this dependence can be expressed by the relation the higher air fl ta av ta max 0 96 ta amp 0 90 ta min 0 89 and water temperature fl tw me 0 90 tw av 0 83 the lower elevation of the measuring point fl e 0 94 the lower precipitation amounts fl p 0 90 and slightly lower slope of the stream fl s 0 63 this relation reflects the vertical zonation of climatic conditions and vegetation cover in high mountain regions second factor f2 explained 22 54 of the variability and is associated with the thermal and hydrological regime of the stream table 2 it expresses a negative relation the lower water temperature variability fl tw cv 0 95 amplitudes fl tw amp 0 93 and maxima fl tw max 0 91 the higher the minima of water temperature fl tw min 0 85 and slightly higher average discharge of the stream fl q av 0 45 third factor f3 explained 12 of the variability table 2 it describes the negative relation the higher average discharge of the stream fl q av 0 82 the greater the area of the catchment fl a 0 75 and lower the slope of the stream fl s 0 61 this factor was identified as hydrologic fourth factor f4 explained barely 5 89 of the total variability table 2 and it does not describe any relation because it only controls the variability of stream discharge fl q cv 0 96 4 3 periodical patterns of water temperature in majority of cases water temperatures in streams followed an expected temporal pattern reflecting seasonal changes in air temperature wavelet analysis of all 33 wavelet power spectra enabled to detect several periodical patterns in time series including daily weekly 8 30 days half year and annual which occur in 7 different types of configurations fig 4 table 3 the results showed that one characteristic configuration of patterns can be assigned to lakes and two configurations of patterns to vaucluse springs among streams four distinct configurations of temporal patterns were found all temporal patterns in the wavelet power spectrum were distinguished based on the statistical significance of periods greater than 95 confidence level occurring in the wavelet power spectrum their length and occurrence in time fig 4 table 3 some of periodicities were marked as dampen indicating either a less strong or narrower periodic band for the sake of simplicity similar wavelet power spectra of time series were arranged into the same type of configuration due to the limited space only one exemplary wavelet power spectrum for each type of configuration was presented as identified from the wavelet power spectra the first type of configuration contains astrong diurnal cycle occurring in a warm period of the year and annual cycle fig 4 table 3 the wavelet power spectra of the second configuration contains additional intermittent fine scale oscillations concentrated at the weekly period band occurring in late summer that indicates localised features of temporal variations the third type of configuration displays an additional periodicity located in elongated period band between 8 and 32 days that appear intermittently fig 4 table 3 it is characteristic for lower reaches of independent streams s12 s13 s14 and s24 fig 1 notably medium frequency oscillations that are displaying in the wavelet power spectrum take the form of single isolated patches of varying amplitudes rather than apersistent band this phenomena is probably related to fast water circulation which causes rapid changes in water temperature as opposed to the first configuration the fourth configuration shows a weak diurnal cycle and strong annual cycle fig 4 table 3 it seems that streams arranged into this type s4 s15 s16 s17 s19 and s23 are less sensitive to daily fluctuations of air temperature in fact some of them are located below the inflow of karstic groundwaters fig 1 that generally display low frequency oscillations therefore the diurnal cycle in those time series is far less pronounced it especially pertains to the olczyski stream s17 which is fed by groundwaters from the olczyskie vaucluse spring v5 and the bystra stream s15 which is recharged partially by groundwaters coming from the bystre vaucluse spring v4 and the goryczkowe vaucluse spring v3 the wavelet power spectrum of the fifth configuration is representative for lakes located at high altitudes in the eastern part of the tatra mts l1 l2 and l3 and contains four distinct periodicities weak and short diurnal periodicity intermittent periodicity between 8 and 32 days band semiannual half year and annual fig 4 table 3 the occurrence of semi annual cycle in lakes is associated with temporal freezing of the upper layer of the water column which usually lasts up to 6 months from december do the end of april water temperature power spectrum of the sixth configuration contains solely asingle periodicity at the annual timescale and is devoid of the diurnal cycle it is characteristic for vaucluse springs v1 v3 v4 v5 and v6 which exhibit relatively low and stable water temperature fig 4 table 3 over the wintertime water temperature in vaucluse springs remains constant as opposed to lakes that exhibit deeper minima due to the temporal presence of ice cover in contrast to the other vaucluse springs the lodowe spring v2 alone represents the seventh type of configuration containing an additional periodicity corresponding to the semiannual cycle half year fig 4 table 3 this example demonstrates that water temperature fluctuations in the lodowe spring v2 reflect asecondary contribution which might be caused either by combined local forcing or site specific characteristics e g greater alimentation area it is also visible that vaucluse springs can significantly modify thermal patterns even in different stretches of the same stream depending on the distance from the vaucluse spring different configurations of temporal patterns can be observed such as between s4 and s5 supplied by v1 between s17 and s18 recharged by v5 and between s15 and s16 supplied by v3 and v4 figs 1 and 4 table 3 5 discussion the present study has revealed that surface waters in the tatra mts display relatively high temporal and spatial heterogeneity of thermal conditions it has been demonstrated that temporal fluctuations of water temperature depend not only on the type of analysed system i e lake stream or spring but also on site specific characteristics streams that were expected to behave in a similar manner showed the greatest diversity in configurations of periodical patterns i e 4 different types aside from the daily and annual cycles the intermittent 8 32 days and weekly periodicities were also noted fig 4 table 3 as opposed to vaucluse springs lakes reflected the configuration with the highest number of periodical patterns relatively more cycles were detected in the warm period of year april october than in the cold period november march the observed increase in periodicity and variability of water temperature in the warm period of year are in close agreement with earlier findings of arismendi et al 2013 and rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2016 in the pca analysis the projection of cases streams on the factor plane defined by the first two factors fig 6 showed a clear contrast in water temperature between small streams located close to the mountain ridges e g s1 s7 and s8 and those located at lower elevations in mountain valleys e g s5 and s20 this relation is associated with the altitudinal zonation in the tatra mts which is localy strengthened by hydrogeological conditions associated with the presence of high discharge karst springs in the middle sections of valleys the analysis of the chemical composition of waters in the chochołowska valley indicated that waters from the chochołowskie vaucluse spring v1 strictly determine the water chemical composition of the chochołowski stream żelazny et al 2011 our results showed however that water temperature of the chochołowski stream is controlled by the vaucluse sping in a quite different way the results of wavelet analysis showed that vaucluse springs tend to suppress the daily cycle of water temperature in streams located below the groundwater inflow fig 4 configurations 1 and 4 then after reaching a certain distance downstream the daily cycle of water temperature begins again but in a different temperature range second identified relation in the pca analysis fig 6 showed a clear distinction between independent streams e g s6 and s14 and those which entirely originate from vaucluse springs e g s15 and s17 the results showed that the important role of vaucluse springs is manifested in the increase of discharge and minimum water temperature in the lower sections of gaining streams and dampening of the daily cycle in the section of the stream located directly below the inflow of karstic groundwaters table 2 the relation between different configurations of temporal patterns fig 4 and statistical measures describing water temperature variability fig 2 could not be fully expalained our results suggest that relatively weak correlations between water temperature and environmental variables may result from the presence of other factors that were not taken into account in the pca analysis 5 1 the dependence of water temperature patterns on weather conditions discharge and stream characteristics one of the most common features of all analysed time series is the presence of annual cycle fig 4 table 3 that has the strongest intensity and reflects seasonal changes in the temperate climate zone stream water temperature is regulated by the air temperature through the heat exchange at the air water interface e g webb et al 2003 mohseni et al 1998 this is especially visible for greater timescales and is valid for the entire temperature range above 0 c according to bogan et al 2003 the full effect of weather on stream water temperature is clearly visible at the weekly timescale providing that heat inputs are solely from the atmosphere and streams are located far from groundwater or meltwater sources our results have shown a strong linkage between water temperature and air temperature which is conditioned by the elevation above sea level table 2 the mean annual water temperature of streams tends to coincide with the average annual air temperature for a given climatic belt indicating an important role of climatic vertical zonation in mountain areas niedźwiedź 1992 it however may vary significantly depending on catchment size and groundwater inputs erickson and stefan 2000 a major role in heat exchange is played by insolation which increases daily amplitudes of water temperature in a warmer period of the year during winter december february diurnal fluctuations of water temperature either vanish or almost disappear brown et al 2010 łaszewski 2013 rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2016 the impact of solar radiation on water temperature is strongly pronounced in unforested catchments and upper parts of the tatra mts located above the tree line the shading caused by riparian vegetation prevents from large changes in water temperature whereas the removal of riparian tree cover may dramatically increase the incoming shortwave radiation an immediate effect of shading on water temperature has been documented elsewhere brown et al 2010 johnson 2004 johnson and jones 2000 kalny et al 2017 most often water temperature fluctuations in streams are related to the amount and depth of water in the stream shallow streams tend to be influenced by conductive heat flux between streambed and water column which becomes insignificant for timescales longer than one day stefan and sinokrot 1993 by contrast streams that carry larger volumes of water have a greater capacity for heat storage thus are less responsive to alternations in the energy budget brown 1969 this particularly refers to the lower reaches of streams i e gaining streams that are either recharged by vaucluse springs or collect water from larger areas fig 1 the results showed that stream discharge increases with increasing area of the catchment and decreasing channel slope table 2 the pca analysis showed that stream discharge affects mainly the extremes of water temperature such as minima and maxima amplitudes as well as the coefficients of variability cv worth noting is also the relation between those metrics the lower the coefficients of variability tw cv amplitudes tw amp and maxima tw max of water temperature the higher the minima of water temperature tw min table 2 this relation reflects lower reaches of streams i e gaining streams which exhibit higher mean water temperature due to the lower elevation and higher minima of water temperature owning to the recharge from vaucluse springs table 2 fig 6 by contrast the mean and median values of water temperature are primarily shaped by the altitudinal zonation table 2 surprisingly the variability of discharge in streams q cv appears to be unrelated to water temperature variability tw cv or to other variables as evidenced by small factor loadings table 2 although somewhat inconclusive the results suggest that potential errors in the estimation of stream discharge might be more significant at high and low flows this can additionally be enhanced by higher variability of flow in intermittent streams in which the flow can disappear in bed material e g s19 5 2 groundwater impact on stream water temperature the results showed that the wavelet power spectrum of the third configuration displayed a greater number of periodicities in time series notably streams arranged into this type s12 s14 and s24 are located in carbonate catchments and are recharged by waters of both deep and shallow circulation such as shallow groundwaters percolating in rock debris and those circulating within the underground system of vacuums and karstic corridors respectively conversely smaller streams flowing in the crystalline part of the tatra mts have relatively fast and shallow circulation with a dominance of surface runoff their flowrate depends on the amount of precipitation whereas their temperature is conditioned by the mean air temperature owning to the shallowness of circulation and small water depths łajczak 1996 apparently the presence of moraine covers on the crystalline basement may act as a transient storage significantly elongating the circulation of water undoubtedly water temperature in mountain streams is largely controlled by the inputs of cool water from snowmelt as well as hyporheic flows and groundwaters groundwaters tend to moderate water temperature fluctuations in temperate climate zone ward 1985 gaining streams recharged by groundwaters have relatively stable water temperature regimes constantz 1998 crisp et al 1982 compared to running waters located far downstream of the recharge zones which tend to reflect higher temporal variability tague et al 2007 webb and zhang 1999 therefore close to springs the thermal behaviour of streams is not necessarily in equilibrium with energy fluxes affecting lower parts of the water course stefan and sinokrot 1993 sinokrot et al 1995 our results have shown that streams assigned to the fourth configuration s4 s15 s17 s19 and s23 reflected little variability because their temperature is conditioned by the recharge from karst springs for instance the hydrological regime of the olczyski stream s17 for the most part of the year is shaped by the outflow from the olczyskie vaucluse spring v5 especially in winter streamflow is derived entirely from the spring małecka 1997 małecka and humnicki 1989 those types of streams are less sensitive to weather conditions brown and hannah 2008 due to the strong influence of advective inputs of cold water tague et al 2007 cold water inflows that originate from large groundwater aquifers can strongly modify reach to segment scale stream water temperature and may alter stream temperature patterns over large downstream distances tague et al 2007 according to webb and zhang 1999 groundwaters can alter the heat budget of streams in two different ways having a cooling effect in summer and warming in winter it is because karst springs exhibit the warmest minimum water temperature brown and hannah 2008 this situation is clearly visible when comparing time series of water temperature and corresponding boxplots of temporal variability obtained from upstream and downstream sections of the chochołowski stream and the chochołowskie vaucluse spring itself fig 5 given the above the contribution of groundwaters on the one hand tends to lower and stabilise water temperature in streams by reducing the amplitudes of daily fluctuations on the other prevents from ice sheet forming during the wintertime żelazny et al 2015 5 3 thermal inertia of spring waters in general groundwater temperature is roughly equal to the temperature of geological formation from which the groundwater originates sinokrot et al 1995 genthon et al 2005 spring waters from fractured aquifers tend to exhibit relatively small amplitudes of water temperature manga 1999 low temporal variability of water temperature indicates that the majority of spring water is confined to the deeper part of the aquifer which is located beneath the zone of seasonal temperature changes szczucińska and wasilewski 2013 it is presumably associated with a transit time of recharge waters flowing through a well developed karst network in such cases the elongation of flow paths does not give a noticeable increase in heat exchange linan baena et al 2009 this feature is evident for all karst springs according to pitty et al 1979 the variability of water temperature in karst springs may have different origins in shallow and fast flowing groundwaters the seasonal rhythm can be associated with air and soil temperature prevailing during rainfall events spring waters can also be influenced by air temperature as they move through a fissure network or a soil cover overlying the opening of the spring finally water temperature in springs may be altered by the air circulation in caves caverns and voids especially in places of the direct contact with air temperature vaucluse springs that were arranged to the sixth configuration v1 v3 v4 v5 and v6 did not show any consistent cyclical pattern besides the annual cycle in this context a distinct behaviour of the lodowe spring v2 fig 4 table 3 may potentially be associated with an additional water supply from different parts of the recharge area which was suggested in earlier studies of wolanin and żelazny 2010 who documented semiannual changes in the chemical composition of the lodowe spring the lodowe spring is a typical ascending spring where the water flows out of limestone at the area of few tens of m2 according to małecka 1997 water hardness of the lodowe vaucluse spring increases after rainfalls which can be explained by the activation of water stagnating in hollows that do not take part in the circulation at low water stages eventually both rainfalls and snowmelt episodes may also initiate anadditional outflow from gullies situated above the spring which drains the excess of water from the karst aquifer 5 4 water temperature fluctuation patterns in the tatra lakes as opposed to streams and springs lakes undergo seasonal thermal stratification resulting in the vertical differences in water density this stratification however tends to be deformed during the year by meltwater inflows and strong winds the latter generate waving that enhances vertical circulation of water masses leading ultimately to mixing phenomenon this is commonly known as the winter stagnation and spring and autumn turnover homothermy summer stratification anothermy in the tatra lakes most frequently establishes during the warm period of the year during the cold period surface cooling promotes areverse thermal stratification catothermy and lowering of the water level most recent studies revealed that short periods of homothermy in morskie oko lake up to 1 week most frequently occur in may and november choiński et al 2015 the diurnal cycle occurring in time series is originating from changes in air temperature as evidenced by a strong positive correlation between air and water temperatures in the tatra lakes ptak et al 2017 according to the earlier studies in morskie oko lake clearly defined diurnal cycles from may to november reach approximately 10 m depth choiński 2010 choiński and łyczkowska 2008 our results showed however that daily cycles observed during summer months are limited to a relatively short period of time indicating equally short period of summer stratification fig 4 the periodicities of about 8 32 days that occur in the warm period of the year may be related to these short periods of summer stratification that are preceded by equally short periods of homothermy fig 4 other small scale variability in water temperature can be attributed to varied sources such as tributary inflows or groundwaters that infiltrate into lakes from thick covers of quaternary sediments moraines notably the annual cycle observed in time series is related to climatic conditions semi annual cycle is in turn associated with the presence of ice cover the timing of seasonal processes of thawing warming and cooling may however vary depending on the altitude łajczak 1982 showed that the duration of ice cover in the tatra lakes differs markedly depending on whether it is northern and southern exposure šporka et al 2006 clarifies that although the timing of ice off among the lakes is linearly dependent on elevation above sea level cooling seems to be independent of elevation as well as lake area and water depth novikmec et al 2013 the largest temperature differences in surface water temperature between individual lakes most frequently occur in mid july as a result of altitudinally dependent differences in the timing of ice off among the lakes šporka et al 2006 at the beginning of 20th century the tatra lakes were permanently covered with ice of about 10 5 months szaflarski 1932 more recent studies in morskie oko lake suggests that freeze up of lake is delayed in time of about 4 1 days per decade while the ablation tends to take place earlier at a rate of 4 5 days per decade pociask karteczka and choiński 2012 these findings confirm a general trend of decreasing ice duration on lakes throughout the northern hemisphere and serve as an evidence of climate warming in this part of europe 6 conclusions the results obtained from this study have shown that water temperature fluctuations in waters of the tatra mts depend not only on the type of analysed system stream spring or lake but also on the altitudinal zonation and hydrogeological conditions the results demonstrated that groundwaters exert astrong influence on the stability of water temperature and thereby indicate the dominant role of hydrogeology in shaping the thermal and hydrological regime of surface waters the combination of two methods namely the wavelet analysis and pca analysis allowed for a better explanation of the observed variability in water temperature time series wavelet analysis enabled the identification of natural periodicities in time series that could not be captured using standard statistical measures such as mean or interquartile range whereas the pca analys helped to determine factors such as atitudinal zonation and hydrological conditions responsible for the observed variability the results showed that most vaucluse springs except the lodowe spring reflected the simple type of configuration with a single annual periodicity streams and lakes exhibited the complex types of configurations containing a growing number of periodical patterns in fact the complex type of configuration seems to be the most expected due to the location of the studied area in the temperate climate zone with distinct altitudinal zonation in mountainous areas it has been demonstrated that the wavelet power spectra of water temperature fluctuations in lakes are markedly different from those obtained from streams and springs in lakes located at high altitudes the additional half year periodicity and weak diurnal periodicity are apparent streams in the tatra mts represent the most diversified types of configurations most of them contain two main frequency components reflecting diurnal and annual cycle the hydrogeology of the area appeared as the main factor that strongly determines the number of periodicities in time series acknowledgement this

7101,in this study we aim to characterise natural variability of water temperature in surface waters of the tatra mts and determine the dominant factors controlling its spatial diversity and seasonal patterns for this purpose a total of 33 time series of water temperature representing lakes vaucluse springs and streams were analysed using the continuous wavelet transform cwt the periodicity analysis were conducted with the morlet wavelet on hourly sampled data covering aperiod of 5 years the principal components analysis pca has been applied to describe the relationships among variables and extract potential sources of water temperature variability the results showed an extremely high heterogeneity in temporal patterns of water temperature fluctuations among streams when compared to lakes and vaucluse springs wavelet analysis of water temperature time series revealed the presence of seven different configurations of periodical patterns the lowest variability was observed among vaucluse springs that are supplied by groundwaters temporal fluctuations of water temperature in lakes contained four different types of oscillations streams were among the most diversified in terms of water temperature patterns exhibiting low medium and high frequency behaviour the pca analysis confirmed the dependence of water temperature on weather conditions catchment characteristics and flow rate explaining 88 97 of the total variability in the data the results obtained from this study emphasize the importance of continuous data collection for capturing the long term dynamics and consistent temporal patterns in time series the study also demonstrates that wavelet analysis is helpful to identify cyclical patterns in time series of water temperature and therefore may be useful in the classification of thermal regimes in surface waters keywords water temperature the tatra mts vaucluse springs groundwaters the continuous wavelet transform the principal components analysis 1 introduction water temperature is one of the most essential physical properties of water influencing the functioning of aquatic ecosystems it affects stream metabolism the distribution of species and rate of biochemical reactions demars et al 2011 the temperature regime of surface waters defined asthe regular pattern of water temperature fluctuations is shaped by a variety of interrelated factors such as climatological conditions recharge sources meltwater groundwater precipitation basin characteristics and human activity brown et al 2006 brown and hannah 2007 2008 caissie 2006 vanzo et al 2015 therefore studies on the thermal regime require not only sufficiently long time series webb et al 2008 but also relevant methods for capturing its main components turschwell et al 2016 temporal fluctuations of water temperature have usually been analysed in time domain taking into account different statistical measures of the thermal regime such as mean minimal and maximal temperatures these measures have been further extended by some additional descriptors such as magnitude variability duration frequency timing and the rate of change arismendi et al 2013 maheu et al 2016 however apart from general informative content none of these metrics consider water temperature variability at multiple temporal scales simultaneously steel and lange 2007 the transformation of time series into frequency domain may provide far more detailed characteristics of the thermal regime like dominant frequencies periodicities in time series their duration and occurrence in time drewnik et al 2018 kirchner et al 2004 rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2015 2016 zolezzi et al 2009 2011 those characteristics of water temperature regime are equally important because they strongly influence aquatic ecosystems from this point of view spectral methods such as the wavelet transform constitute an adequate alternative for standard statistical analysis nowadays studies on the thermal regime of rivers and streams became of particular importance in terms of climate changes especially in mountainous regions that remain unaffected by human activity in here water temperature can be considered as a good indicator of climate changes as well as a tracer of physical processes in catchments ficklin et al 2013 the use of temperature as atracer has a long history constantz 2008 stonestrom and constantz 2003 measurements of water temperature help to elucidate the mechanisms that control different hydrologic processes identify possible groundwater sources and recharge zones as well as depths and lengths of groundwater circulation so far the natural variability of water temperature in surface waters in the tatra mts has not yet received a comprehensive study apart from the basic interest in the average values of groundwaters and surface water temperature seasonal variability and potential spatial diversity the detailed long term variability has never been reported most early studies were either unsystematic often limited to manual single spot measurements or covered relatively short periods of time therefore data obtained from those studies tend to be heterogeneous and poses relatively high percentage of missing values in the present work we investigated natural inter and intra annual variability of water temperature in streams karst springs and lakes located in the tatra mts using high resolution data we attempted to find an answer on how does the natural variability of water temperature at those different locations accounts for the type and number of periodicities occurring in time series the main goals of this study were to 1 detect dominant modes of water temperature variability 2 describe patterns of temporal variability of water temperature and their different configurations and 3 identify the key drivers that influence thermal variability of streams springs and lakes 2 site description the tatra mts are the highest mountain range in the carpathian mountains forming a natural border between poland and slovakia they occupy a total area of about 750 km2 1 5 of which is located on polish territory fig 1 both polish and slovak parts of the tatra mts are protected within the tatra national park approved as an international biosphere reserve unesco and area of nature 2000 the tatras have preserved their natural character with high mountain relief pristine landscape and a variety of natural features such as canyons waterfalls a dwarf pine belt alpine meadows lakes and rocky peaks the geological structure of the tatra mts is complex the tatra mts consist of crystalline basement core and sedimentary cover the crystalline core comprises igneous mainly granitic and metamorphic rocks whose main outcrops are located in western and eastern parts of the polish tatras respectively crystalline rocks of the tatra mts which formed during the variscan orogeny have undergone multiple phases of tectonic activity the sedimentary cover is composed of mesozoic rocks such as sandstones limestones marls dolomites and slates which were thrusted over the core in northern direction during eo alpine orogenic phase anczkiewicz et al 2015 and references therein the main geological units are locally covered by quaternary sediments associated with the pleistocene glaciation and holocene processes of erosion and accumulation uchman 2004 the outcrops of crystalline rocks are situated in the southern part of the polish tatra mts along the main ridges sedimentary rock outcrops preserved mainly to the north and build lower parts of the mountains bac moszaszwili et al 1979 piotrowska et al 2015 one of the characteristic features of the tatra mts is a vertical zonation of climatic conditions vegetation cover and morphogenetic processes hess 1996 kotarba and starkel 1972 piękoś mirkowa and mirek 1996 skiba et al 2015 the average sums of precipitation in the tatras vary from 1120 mm at the foothills up to 1800 mm at the mountain peaks żmudzka 2010 whereas the average air temperature ranges between 6 0 c and 2 0 c respectively niedźwiedź 1992 in terms of hydrology the area stands out from the rest part of the carpathian mts exhibiting a great diversity of ice phenomena because it tends to be affected by local hydrogeological conditions żelazny et al 2015 the tatra mts constitute a source area for many streams most of them fed by groundwaters flowing waters of the tatra mts are represented by small streams with a steep gradient turbulent current and rocky bottom both high velocity streams and those fed by karst springs may lack of ice cover even when temperatures drop below freezing the distribution of springs varies significantly depending on geological structure the highest number of springs is associated with areas built of quaternary deposits e g moraine formations whereas the highest flowrates are characteristic for vaucluse springs occurring in karstified carbonate rocks this type of springs has an extensive alimentation area i

lakes among them the most spectacular type known as the paternoster lake is represented by lakes in the five polish lakes valley pociask karteczka et al 2014 3 materials and methods 3 1 data sets data used in the present study were obtained from 33 monitoring sites located in the tatra national park including streams 24 pts karst springs 6 pts and lakes 3 pts fig 1 please note the term karst spring is used interchangeably with vaucluse spring the latter has been adopted from earlier studies carried out in the tatra mts barczyk 2002 2008 małecka 1997 measurement points were chosen to represent various types of catchments and recharge zones in terms of morphology and geological units characteristics of selected sites including mean flowrate elevation afforestation degree channel slope and geology are summarised in table 1 channel slopes were calculated based on a 10x10 m digital elevation model dem with respect to all pixels located along the streamline afforestation degree was calculated with reference to the elementary basins cut by the streamline measurement points were arranged by valleys from west to east and by elevation above sea level from the highest point to the lowest point in the given valley for the sake of simplicity streams flowing through different geological units are referred to as transit table 1 water temperature data comprised of 33 sets of time series collected at 1 hour time interval using orpheus mini water level loggers manufactured by ott hydromet with 0 1 c accuracy the ott orpheus mini logger is an integrated pressure sensor and data logger supplied with lithium batteries of min 5 years longevity operating within the temperature range from 25 c to 70 c the instrument features a ceramic pressure cell that provides the stability in long term measurements as well as mechanical resistance to pressure overload and corrosive waters some of the loggers are paired with ott itc for remote data transfer loggers were installed either in springheads or on the bed of streams and lakes automatic measurements were verified several times a year by manual measurements at site using wtw handheld conductivity meters the retrieved data from data loggers cover a period of approximately 5 to 6 years between 01 11 2009 and 31 10 2015 fig 1 table 1 prior to analysis time series were inspected for exceptionally high values negative values of water temperature were considered erroneous and were replaced by 0 c 3 2 time series analysis water temperature fluctuations in 33 time series were analysed in frequency domain using the continuous wavelet transform cwt to adequately capture variability in one framework during the transformation original time series are decomposed into components called wavelets that represent shifted and scaled versions of amother wavelet the wavelet transform of aparticular time series is given by the following equation 1 cw t x ψ a b w a b 1 a x t ψ t b a d t a r b r where w a b represents a matrix of wavelet coefficients that are a function of scale a and translation b a 0 5 is a normalisation factor ensuring the same energy of the wavelet for different a values of the scale ψ denotes the mother wavelet x t is the time series whereas the asterisks indicates a complex conjugate the mother wavelet is characterised by limited duration and average that is equal to 0 in this study the morlet wavelet has been applied as the mother wavelet which is defined as 2 ψ 0 η π 1 4 e i ω 0 η e η 2 2 where η denotes dimensionless time and ω 0 ω 0 6 is a dimensionless frequency the morlet wavelet relatively well resembles the shape of environmental time series and has a fairly good localisation in time and frequency cazelles et al 2008 grinsted et al 2004 kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 labat 2008 the mother wavelet is subjected to scaling a and translation b resulting in a matrix of continuous wavelet coefficients that measure the similarity between analysed fragment of time series and the mother wavelet the wavelet power was normalised by variance to have unit energy at all timescales ψ 2 t d t 1 grinsted et al 2004 in this way narrow wavelets small scales can detect fast changing features while stretched wavelets large scales allow for the separation of low frequency characteristics kumar and foufoula georgiou 1997 the main result of the continuous wavelet transform is a three dimensional colour map of the wavelet power spectrum w a b 2 which shows the distribution of power at certain scale a period and time position b the finite length of the time series results in edge effect which is visible at both sides of the wavelet power spectrum torrence and compo 1998 this is due to the fact that the wavelet is moved along the signal and the convolution is calculated for each time step and for each scale consequently calculations at edges of the signal require non existing values this region is termed as the cone of influence coi the statistical significance of results obtained from wavelet analysis was assessed against the null hypotheses that the signal is generated by a stationary process with a theoretical red noise power spectrum grinsted et al 2004 all calculations were performed in matlab software basing on a script developed by grinsted et al 2004 the principal components analysis pca was applied to identify independent variables shaping water temperature variability in relation to abiotic components of the physical environment component loadings in the pca analysis were calculated based on 17 variables including hydrological 8 meterological 5 and physical 4 parameters such as minimum maximum median average amplitude and coefficients of variability of water temperature tw min tw max tw me tw av tw amp and tw cv respectively minimum maximum average and amplitude of air temperature ta min ta max ta av and ta amp respectively precipitation totals p average stream discharge and coefficient of variability of the stream discharge q av and q cv respectively elevation e catchment area a channel slope s and afforestation degree f air temperature data and precipitation totals were aggregated as the annual values while tw min tw max tw me tw av were calculated for the whole analysed period of time tw amp was calculated as the difference between maximum and minimum values of water temperature recorded in the whole analysed period of time ta amp was calculated for the annual values the number of the most important factors was determined based on the kaiser criterion factor loadings 0 45 were used to indicate significant correlations the choice of particular parameters and restricting the pca analysis to streams was intentional the minimum and maximum water temperatures actually differentiate investigated streams to those which are recharged by vaucluse springs and those which are not this is because streams recharged by vaucluse springs exhibit higher minimum water temperature water temperature never drops to 0 c and lower maximum water temperature in turn the parameters such as average maximum and minimum annual air temperatures and precipitation totals describe climatic conditions in the studied area therefore the greater the differences between meteorological characteristics and parameters defining the thermal conditions of streams water temperature in streams the more likely is the impact of other factors e g topographic or hydrogeological on stream water temperature 4 results 4 1 water temperature fluctuations in surface waters the analysis of time series showed that data obtained from lakes are characterised by wider interquartile range and contain more extreme maximum values when compared to data from streams and springs fig 2 wide temperature fluctuations have also been observed in some of the streams such as s20 s22 and s6 it is also visible that the distribution of points shows aright skewness because the majority of points are located above the median value in contrast to lakes vaucluse springs displayed a relatively constant water temperature over the year and asmaller spread of values with water temperatures rarely exceeding 7 c the lodowe spring v2 is of particular interest because the amplitude of water temperature fluctuations during the year never exceeded 1 c it can also be noted that water temperature data from vaucluse springs are pretty symmetrically distributed roughly the same applies to streams because the median value is located in the middle of the box fig 2 water temperature maxima varied among sites more than minima that are limited by the freezing point of water during the investigated period of time maxima of water temperature in lakes and in a vast majority of streams predominantly occurred in august owning to reduced water levels and increased atmospheric heating in the case of vaucluse springs the maxima of water temperature were frequently recorded in september among streams the highest water temperatures greater than 15 c occurred at sites s20 s21 and s22 fig 2 the average water temperature among streams was very similar 4 9 1 1 c the minima of water temperature in streams were frequently observed during winter from december to march in lakes the minima of water temperature usually occurred in an extended period of time from november till may karst springs v1 v6 and streams fed by karst springs e g s15 s17 exhibited the warmest minimum water temperature fig 2 4 2 factors controlling water temperature variability in streams according to the pca analysis water temperature variability in streams is shaped by four independent factors that together explained 88 97 of the total variability table 2 fig 3 the first factor f1 explained the maximum variance and subsequent factors explained progressively smaller portions of the total variance first factor f1 explained 48 54 of the variability in the data set it is tightly bound with the altitudinal zonation table 2 it describes the negative relation between air and water temperature and physical characteristics of the stream this dependence can be expressed by the relation the higher air fl ta av ta max 0 96 ta amp 0 90 ta min 0 89 and water temperature fl tw me 0 90 tw av 0 83 the lower elevation of the measuring point fl e 0 94 the lower precipitation amounts fl p 0 90 and slightly lower slope of the stream fl s 0 63 this relation reflects the vertical zonation of climatic conditions and vegetation cover in high mountain regions second factor f2 explained 22 54 of the variability and is associated with the thermal and hydrological regime of the stream table 2 it expresses a negative relation the lower water temperature variability fl tw cv 0 95 amplitudes fl tw amp 0 93 and maxima fl tw max 0 91 the higher the minima of water temperature fl tw min 0 85 and slightly higher average discharge of the stream fl q av 0 45 third factor f3 explained 12 of the variability table 2 it describes the negative relation the higher average discharge of the stream fl q av 0 82 the greater the area of the catchment fl a 0 75 and lower the slope of the stream fl s 0 61 this factor was identified as hydrologic fourth factor f4 explained barely 5 89 of the total variability table 2 and it does not describe any relation because it only controls the variability of stream discharge fl q cv 0 96 4 3 periodical patterns of water temperature in majority of cases water temperatures in streams followed an expected temporal pattern reflecting seasonal changes in air temperature wavelet analysis of all 33 wavelet power spectra enabled to detect several periodical patterns in time series including daily weekly 8 30 days half year and annual which occur in 7 different types of configurations fig 4 table 3 the results showed that one characteristic configuration of patterns can be assigned to lakes and two configurations of patterns to vaucluse springs among streams four distinct configurations of temporal patterns were found all temporal patterns in the wavelet power spectrum were distinguished based on the statistical significance of periods greater than 95 confidence level occurring in the wavelet power spectrum their length and occurrence in time fig 4 table 3 some of periodicities were marked as dampen indicating either a less strong or narrower periodic band for the sake of simplicity similar wavelet power spectra of time series were arranged into the same type of configuration due to the limited space only one exemplary wavelet power spectrum for each type of configuration was presented as identified from the wavelet power spectra the first type of configuration contains astrong diurnal cycle occurring in a warm period of the year and annual cycle fig 4 table 3 the wavelet power spectra of the second configuration contains additional intermittent fine scale oscillations concentrated at the weekly period band occurring in late summer that indicates localised features of temporal variations the third type of configuration displays an additional periodicity located in elongated period band between 8 and 32 days that appear intermittently fig 4 table 3 it is characteristic for lower reaches of independent streams s12 s13 s14 and s24 fig 1 notably medium frequency oscillations that are displaying in the wavelet power spectrum take the form of single isolated patches of varying amplitudes rather than apersistent band this phenomena is probably related to fast water circulation which causes rapid changes in water temperature as opposed to the first configuration the fourth configuration shows a weak diurnal cycle and strong annual cycle fig 4 table 3 it seems that streams arranged into this type s4 s15 s16 s17 s19 and s23 are less sensitive to daily fluctuations of air temperature in fact some of them are located below the inflow of karstic groundwaters fig 1 that generally display low frequency oscillations therefore the diurnal cycle in those time series is far less pronounced it especially pertains to the olczyski stream s17 which is fed by groundwaters from the olczyskie vaucluse spring v5 and the bystra stream s15 which is recharged partially by groundwaters coming from the bystre vaucluse spring v4 and the goryczkowe vaucluse spring v3 the wavelet power spectrum of the fifth configuration is representative for lakes located at high altitudes in the eastern part of the tatra mts l1 l2 and l3 and contains four distinct periodicities weak and short diurnal periodicity intermittent periodicity between 8 and 32 days band semiannual half year and annual fig 4 table 3 the occurrence of semi annual cycle in lakes is associated with temporal freezing of the upper layer of the water column which usually lasts up to 6 months from december do the end of april water temperature power spectrum of the sixth configuration contains solely asingle periodicity at the annual timescale and is devoid of the diurnal cycle it is characteristic for vaucluse springs v1 v3 v4 v5 and v6 which exhibit relatively low and stable water temperature fig 4 table 3 over the wintertime water temperature in vaucluse springs remains constant as opposed to lakes that exhibit deeper minima due to the temporal presence of ice cover in contrast to the other vaucluse springs the lodowe spring v2 alone represents the seventh type of configuration containing an additional periodicity corresponding to the semiannual cycle half year fig 4 table 3 this example demonstrates that water temperature fluctuations in the lodowe spring v2 reflect asecondary contribution which might be caused either by combined local forcing or site specific characteristics e g greater alimentation area it is also visible that vaucluse springs can significantly modify thermal patterns even in different stretches of the same stream depending on the distance from the vaucluse spring different configurations of temporal patterns can be observed such as between s4 and s5 supplied by v1 between s17 and s18 recharged by v5 and between s15 and s16 supplied by v3 and v4 figs 1 and 4 table 3 5 discussion the present study has revealed that surface waters in the tatra mts display relatively high temporal and spatial heterogeneity of thermal conditions it has been demonstrated that temporal fluctuations of water temperature depend not only on the type of analysed system i e lake stream or spring but also on site specific characteristics streams that were expected to behave in a similar manner showed the greatest diversity in configurations of periodical patterns i e 4 different types aside from the daily and annual cycles the intermittent 8 32 days and weekly periodicities were also noted fig 4 table 3 as opposed to vaucluse springs lakes reflected the configuration with the highest number of periodical patterns relatively more cycles were detected in the warm period of year april october than in the cold period november march the observed increase in periodicity and variability of water temperature in the warm period of year are in close agreement with earlier findings of arismendi et al 2013 and rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2016 in the pca analysis the projection of cases streams on the factor plane defined by the first two factors fig 6 showed a clear contrast in water temperature between small streams located close to the mountain ridges e g s1 s7 and s8 and those located at lower elevations in mountain valleys e g s5 and s20 this relation is associated with the altitudinal zonation in the tatra mts which is localy strengthened by hydrogeological conditions associated with the presence of high discharge karst springs in the middle sections of valleys the analysis of the chemical composition of waters in the chochołowska valley indicated that waters from the chochołowskie vaucluse spring v1 strictly determine the water chemical composition of the chochołowski stream żelazny et al 2011 our results showed however that water temperature of the chochołowski stream is controlled by the vaucluse sping in a quite different way the results of wavelet analysis showed that vaucluse springs tend to suppress the daily cycle of water temperature in streams located below the groundwater inflow fig 4 configurations 1 and 4 then after reaching a certain distance downstream the daily cycle of water temperature begins again but in a different temperature range second identified relation in the pca analysis fig 6 showed a clear distinction between independent streams e g s6 and s14 and those which entirely originate from vaucluse springs e g s15 and s17 the results showed that the important role of vaucluse springs is manifested in the increase of discharge and minimum water temperature in the lower sections of gaining streams and dampening of the daily cycle in the section of the stream located directly below the inflow of karstic groundwaters table 2 the relation between different configurations of temporal patterns fig 4 and statistical measures describing water temperature variability fig 2 could not be fully expalained our results suggest that relatively weak correlations between water temperature and environmental variables may result from the presence of other factors that were not taken into account in the pca analysis 5 1 the dependence of water temperature patterns on weather conditions discharge and stream characteristics one of the most common features of all analysed time series is the presence of annual cycle fig 4 table 3 that has the strongest intensity and reflects seasonal changes in the temperate climate zone stream water temperature is regulated by the air temperature through the heat exchange at the air water interface e g webb et al 2003 mohseni et al 1998 this is especially visible for greater timescales and is valid for the entire temperature range above 0 c according to bogan et al 2003 the full effect of weather on stream water temperature is clearly visible at the weekly timescale providing that heat inputs are solely from the atmosphere and streams are located far from groundwater or meltwater sources our results have shown a strong linkage between water temperature and air temperature which is conditioned by the elevation above sea level table 2 the mean annual water temperature of streams tends to coincide with the average annual air temperature for a given climatic belt indicating an important role of climatic vertical zonation in mountain areas niedźwiedź 1992 it however may vary significantly depending on catchment size and groundwater inputs erickson and stefan 2000 a major role in heat exchange is played by insolation which increases daily amplitudes of water temperature in a warmer period of the year during winter december february diurnal fluctuations of water temperature either vanish or almost disappear brown et al 2010 łaszewski 2013 rajwa kuligiewicz et al 2016 the impact of solar radiation on water temperature is strongly pronounced in unforested catchments and upper parts of the tatra mts located above the tree line the shading caused by riparian vegetation prevents from large changes in water temperature whereas the removal of riparian tree cover may dramatically increase the incoming shortwave radiation an immediate effect of shading on water temperature has been documented elsewhere brown et al 2010 johnson 2004 johnson and jones 2000 kalny et al 2017 most often water temperature fluctuations in streams are related to the amount and depth of water in the stream shallow streams tend to be influenced by conductive heat flux between streambed and water column which becomes insignificant for timescales longer than one day stefan and sinokrot 1993 by contrast streams that carry larger volumes of water have a greater capacity for heat storage thus are less responsive to alternations in the energy budget brown 1969 this particularly refers to the lower reaches of streams i e gaining streams that are either recharged by vaucluse springs or collect water from larger areas fig 1 the results showed that stream discharge increases with increasing area of the catchment and decreasing channel slope table 2 the pca analysis showed that stream discharge affects mainly the extremes of water temperature such as minima and maxima amplitudes as well as the coefficients of variability cv worth noting is also the relation between those metrics the lower the coefficients of variability tw cv amplitudes tw amp and maxima tw max of water temperature the higher the minima of water temperature tw min table 2 this relation reflects lower reaches of streams i e gaining streams which exhibit higher mean water temperature due to the lower elevation and higher minima of water temperature owning to the recharge from vaucluse springs table 2 fig 6 by contrast the mean and median values of water temperature are primarily shaped by the altitudinal zonation table 2 surprisingly the variability of discharge in streams q cv appears to be unrelated to water temperature variability tw cv or to other variables as evidenced by small factor loadings table 2 although somewhat inconclusive the results suggest that potential errors in the estimation of stream discharge might be more significant at high and low flows this can additionally be enhanced by higher variability of flow in intermittent streams in which the flow can disappear in bed material e g s19 5 2 groundwater impact on stream water temperature the results showed that the wavelet power spectrum of the third configuration displayed a greater number of periodicities in time series notably streams arranged into this type s12 s14 and s24 are located in carbonate catchments and are recharged by waters of both deep and shallow circulation such as shallow groundwaters percolating in rock debris and those circulating within the underground system of vacuums and karstic corridors respectively conversely smaller streams flowing in the crystalline part of the tatra mts have relatively fast and shallow circulation with a dominance of surface runoff their flowrate depends on the amount of precipitation whereas their temperature is conditioned by the mean air temperature owning to the shallowness of circulation and small water depths łajczak 1996 apparently the presence of moraine covers on the crystalline basement may act as a transient storage significantly elongating the circulation of water undoubtedly water temperature in mountain streams is largely controlled by the inputs of cool water from snowmelt as well as hyporheic flows and groundwaters groundwaters tend to moderate water temperature fluctuations in temperate climate zone ward 1985 gaining streams recharged by groundwaters have relatively stable water temperature regimes constantz 1998 crisp et al 1982 compared to running waters located far downstream of the recharge zones which tend to reflect higher temporal variability tague et al 2007 webb and zhang 1999 therefore close to springs the thermal behaviour of streams is not necessarily in equilibrium with energy fluxes affecting lower parts of the water course stefan and sinokrot 1993 sinokrot et al 1995 our results have shown that streams assigned to the fourth configuration s4 s15 s17 s19 and s23 reflected little variability because their temperature is conditioned by the recharge from karst springs for instance the hydrological regime of the olczyski stream s17 for the most part of the year is shaped by the outflow from the olczyskie vaucluse spring v5 especially in winter streamflow is derived entirely from the spring małecka 1997 małecka and humnicki 1989 those types of streams are less sensitive to weather conditions brown and hannah 2008 due to the strong influence of advective inputs of cold water tague et al 2007 cold water inflows that originate from large groundwater aquifers can strongly modify reach to segment scale stream water temperature and may alter stream temperature patterns over large downstream distances tague et al 2007 according to webb and zhang 1999 groundwaters can alter the heat budget of streams in two different ways having a cooling effect in summer and warming in winter it is because karst springs exhibit the warmest minimum water temperature brown and hannah 2008 this situation is clearly visible when comparing time series of water temperature and corresponding boxplots of temporal variability obtained from upstream and downstream sections of the chochołowski stream and the chochołowskie vaucluse spring itself fig 5 given the above the contribution of groundwaters on the one hand tends to lower and stabilise water temperature in streams by reducing the amplitudes of daily fluctuations on the other prevents from ice sheet forming during the wintertime żelazny et al 2015 5 3 thermal inertia of spring waters in general groundwater temperature is roughly equal to the temperature of geological formation from which the groundwater originates sinokrot et al 1995 genthon et al 2005 spring waters from fractured aquifers tend to exhibit relatively small amplitudes of water temperature manga 1999 low temporal variability of water temperature indicates that the majority of spring water is confined to the deeper part of the aquifer which is located beneath the zone of seasonal temperature changes szczucińska and wasilewski 2013 it is presumably associated with a transit time of recharge waters flowing through a well developed karst network in such cases the elongation of flow paths does not give a noticeable increase in heat exchange linan baena et al 2009 this feature is evident for all karst springs according to pitty et al 1979 the variability of water temperature in karst springs may have different origins in shallow and fast flowing groundwaters the seasonal rhythm can be associated with air and soil temperature prevailing during rainfall events spring waters can also be influenced by air temperature as they move through a fissure network or a soil cover overlying the opening of the spring finally water temperature in springs may be altered by the air circulation in caves caverns and voids especially in places of the direct contact with air temperature vaucluse springs that were arranged to the sixth configuration v1 v3 v4 v5 and v6 did not show any consistent cyclical pattern besides the annual cycle in this context a distinct behaviour of the lodowe spring v2 fig 4 table 3 may potentially be associated with an additional water supply from different parts of the recharge area which was suggested in earlier studies of wolanin and żelazny 2010 who documented semiannual changes in the chemical composition of the lodowe spring the lodowe spring is a typical ascending spring where the water flows out of limestone at the area of few tens of m2 according to małecka 1997 water hardness of the lodowe vaucluse spring increases after rainfalls which can be explained by the activation of water stagnating in hollows that do not take part in the circulation at low water stages eventually both rainfalls and snowmelt episodes may also initiate anadditional outflow from gullies situated above the spring which drains the excess of water from the karst aquifer 5 4 water temperature fluctuation patterns in the tatra lakes as opposed to streams and springs lakes undergo seasonal thermal stratification resulting in the vertical differences in water density this stratification however tends to be deformed during the year by meltwater inflows and strong winds the latter generate waving that enhances vertical circulation of water masses leading ultimately to mixing phenomenon this is commonly known as the winter stagnation and spring and autumn turnover homothermy summer stratification anothermy in the tatra lakes most frequently establishes during the warm period of the year during the cold period surface cooling promotes areverse thermal stratification catothermy and lowering of the water level most recent studies revealed that short periods of homothermy in morskie oko lake up to 1 week most frequently occur in may and november choiński et al 2015 the diurnal cycle occurring in time series is originating from changes in air temperature as evidenced by a strong positive correlation between air and water temperatures in the tatra lakes ptak et al 2017 according to the earlier studies in morskie oko lake clearly defined diurnal cycles from may to november reach approximately 10 m depth choiński 2010 choiński and łyczkowska 2008 our results showed however that daily cycles observed during summer months are limited to a relatively short period of time indicating equally short period of summer stratification fig 4 the periodicities of about 8 32 days that occur in the warm period of the year may be related to these short periods of summer stratification that are preceded by equally short periods of homothermy fig 4 other small scale variability in water temperature can be attributed to varied sources such as tributary inflows or groundwaters that infiltrate into lakes from thick covers of quaternary sediments moraines notably the annual cycle observed in time series is related to climatic conditions semi annual cycle is in turn associated with the presence of ice cover the timing of seasonal processes of thawing warming and cooling may however vary depending on the altitude łajczak 1982 showed that the duration of ice cover in the tatra lakes differs markedly depending on whether it is northern and southern exposure šporka et al 2006 clarifies that although the timing of ice off among the lakes is linearly dependent on elevation above sea level cooling seems to be independent of elevation as well as lake area and water depth novikmec et al 2013 the largest temperature differences in surface water temperature between individual lakes most frequently occur in mid july as a result of altitudinally dependent differences in the timing of ice off among the lakes šporka et al 2006 at the beginning of 20th century the tatra lakes were permanently covered with ice of about 10 5 months szaflarski 1932 more recent studies in morskie oko lake suggests that freeze up of lake is delayed in time of about 4 1 days per decade while the ablation tends to take place earlier at a rate of 4 5 days per decade pociask karteczka and choiński 2012 these findings confirm a general trend of decreasing ice duration on lakes throughout the northern hemisphere and serve as an evidence of climate warming in this part of europe 6 conclusions the results obtained from this study have shown that water temperature fluctuations in waters of the tatra mts depend not only on the type of analysed system stream spring or lake but also on the altitudinal zonation and hydrogeological conditions the results demonstrated that groundwaters exert astrong influence on the stability of water temperature and thereby indicate the dominant role of hydrogeology in shaping the thermal and hydrological regime of surface waters the combination of two methods namely the wavelet analysis and pca analysis allowed for a better explanation of the observed variability in water temperature time series wavelet analysis enabled the identification of natural periodicities in time series that could not be captured using standard statistical measures such as mean or interquartile range whereas the pca analys helped to determine factors such as atitudinal zonation and hydrological conditions responsible for the observed variability the results showed that most vaucluse springs except the lodowe spring reflected the simple type of configuration with a single annual periodicity streams and lakes exhibited the complex types of configurations containing a growing number of periodical patterns in fact the complex type of configuration seems to be the most expected due to the location of the studied area in the temperate climate zone with distinct altitudinal zonation in mountainous areas it has been demonstrated that the wavelet power spectra of water temperature fluctuations in lakes are markedly different from those obtained from streams and springs in lakes located at high altitudes the additional half year periodicity and weak diurnal periodicity are apparent streams in the tatra mts represent the most diversified types of configurations most of them contain two main frequency components reflecting diurnal and annual cycle the hydrogeology of the area appeared as the main factor that strongly determines the number of periodicities in time series acknowledgement this

7102,the groundwater contribution to streamflow along a lowland alluvial stream in denmark was estimated using a variety of methods and at different spatial scales at the point scale less than a few metres groundwater discharge to the stream was measured using seepage meters at the reach scale 0 5 1 5 km groundwater discharge to the stream was estimated using differential streamflow gauging and at the catchment scale 1 5 km groundwater discharge to the stream was estimated using hydrograph separation the estimates of groundwater discharge obtained using point scale measurements range from 12 to 41 cm d which is lower than fluxes estimated at the reach scale which range from 18 to 333 cm d this discrepancy was attributed to the partitioning of groundwater discharge into streambed seepage and bank seepage on the other hand the groundwater discharge estimates obtained using hydrograph separation were generally the highest and ranged from 194 to 289 cm d for this study this discrepancy from the reach scale estimates was attributed to the assumption that baseflow obtained using hydrograph separation represents groundwater discharge to the stream when part of the baseflow actually comes from artificial drainage systems anyhow seepage meter measurements differential streamflow gauging and hydrograph separation showed similar trends the increase in streamflow is mainly due to either groundwater discharge through the streambed and the banks in the lower part or tile drainage discharge in the upper part of the catchment furthermore estimation of uncertainty for the various groundwater discharge estimates showed that some of the flux estimates were insignificant compared with their propagated uncertainties to this end a novel method was developed to estimate the uncertainty of groundwater discharge estimates obtained by hydrograph separation overall this paper shows that more than one method should be used to obtain a reliable estimate of groundwater discharge to a lowland alluvial stream from other discharge contributions such as tile drainage keywords seepage meters differential streamflow gauging hydrograph separation measurement uncertainty groundwater discharge 1 introduction most streams in denmark flow year round and are located in humid lowland alluvial areas with a thin unsaturated zone thus the groundwater and surface water systems are strongly interconnected and groundwater is an important component of total streamflow in many of these streams e g van roosmalen et al 2007 in such interconnected systems groundwater withdrawals can deplete streamflow e g nyholm et al 2002 with detrimental consequences for stream ecosystems e g johansen et al 2011 in addition to water budget concerns it is also of importance to assess the water fluxes between groundwater and surface water because of the risk of excess nutrients leaching to aquifers and streams especially in agricultural catchments kronvang et al 2005 which constitute approximately two thirds of all land in denmark it is well known that the potential for reducing nitrate via denitrification and thus improvement of water quality depends on where and how groundwater discharges to alluvial streams therefore reliable methods for estimating groundwater discharge to streams are needed for successful water resource management common methods used to estimate groundwater discharge are reviewed by for example kalbus et al 2006 and include seepage meter measurements e g lee 1977 rosenberry 2008 natural tracer methods e g xie et al 2016 heat tracer methods e g anderson 2005 constantz 2008 hatch et al 2006 lowry et al 2007 mass balance approaches including differential streamflow gauging e g cey et al 1998 harte and kiah 2009 langhoff et al 2006 schmadel et al 2010 and hydrograph separation e g gonzales et al 2009 hannula et al 2003 generally these methods may be divided into three groups those that estimate the groundwater flux directly through the sediment water interface at point scale less than a few metres those that estimate the volumetric change in flow along the stream at reach scale 100 m to several kilometres and those that estimate the integrated response of the surface groundwater interaction at catchment scale greater than a few kilometres although it is well known that the processes governing the groundwater discharge estimate are different depending on the method cranswick and cook 2015 kalbus et al 2006 it is relevant and important to compare these results because the interpretation of the importance of groundwater discharge to the stream water budget would be greatly dependent on the method used for quantifying the input e g becker et al 2004 at the point scale direct measurements of water flux across the sediment water interface by seepage meters are widely applied in streams the seepage meter relies on a simple concept and is inexpensive to construct however since the meter covers a relatively small bed area its application can be influenced by streambed heterogeneity and measurements at many locations are therefore required with large associated labour costs numerous studies have addressed this by combining seepage meters with fibre optic distributed temperature sensing e g rosenberry et al 2016 furthermore seepage meters measure the water exchange across the streambed while other components of the total groundwater discharge are neglected including seepage through the banks this component however can be measured with alternative seepage meters langhoff et al 2006 on the other hand water flux across the sediment water interface measured with seepage meters may include a contribution from hyperheic flow in addition to the groundwater contribution e g rosenberry and pitlick 2009 at the reach scale closely spaced measurements of streamflow referred to as differential streamflow gauging can estimate the net groundwater flux to streams through the bed and the banks if all other fluxes in and out of the reach are accounted for cey et al 1998 harte and kiah 2009 langhoff et al 2006 opsahl et al 2007 schmadel et al 2010 results of for example cey et al 1998 suggest that differential streamflow gauging gives more reasonable estimates of the groundwater discharge contribution to streamflow than point scale estimates at the catchment scale the quintessential method to estimate the groundwater contribution to streams is hydrograph separation which has a long history in hydrology gonzales et al 2009 hall 1968 tallaksen 1995 basically a stream hydrograph is separated into a short term fluctuating component typically named direct runoff and a long term fluctuating component typically named baseflow it is then assumed that baseflow represents groundwater discharge to the stream hydrograph separation methods can be divided into tracer based and non tracer based results of gonzales et al 2009 suggest that tracer based hydrograph separation methods provide the hydrological most reasonable estimates of the groundwater contribution to streamflow in a lowland catchment however tracer based hydrograph separation methods are more costly and labour intensive than non tracer based methods and long term tracer data are not available from most gauging stations therefore it is important to evaluate the ability of non tracer based hydrograph separation methods to give reasonable estimates of groundwater discharge despite the limitations of such techniques gonzales et al 2009 suggest that the rating curve envelope method kliner and knezek 1974 sellinger 1996 and the recursive filter methods eckhardt 2005 are the best to estimate the groundwater contribution to streamflow however these methods require groundwater level measurements and calibration to tracer based results respectively a limitation of non tracer based hydrograph separation methods is that the identification of the groundwater component of continuous discharge data is uncertain because other inputs such as tributaries overland flow and tile drainage systems may exceed the groundwater discharge and cause a similar recession e g halford and mayer 2000 therefore the groundwater discharge is easily overestimated by hydrograph separation methods one may overcome this by estimating the water balance between two gauging stations on the same stream system taking into account major inputs and losses mccallum et al 2014 opsahl et al 2007 sutton et al 2014 the first objective of this study is to characterise the groundwater discharge to a 4 8 km long lowland alluvial stream in the western part of denmark based on an application of methods at point reach and catchment scale the methods of groundwater discharge estimation are 1 seepage meter measurements at the point scale 2 differential streamflow gauging at the reach scale and 3 hydrograph separation at the catchment scale the second objective is to compare and discuss the groundwater discharge estimates obtained by these various methods working on different spatial scales to support this comparison and discussion we estimate the standard deviations and confidence intervals associated with the various flux estimates to this end we develop a novel method to estimate the uncertainty of groundwater discharge estimates obtained by hydrograph separation for clarity in hydrological systems such as the one studied here water can flow to a stream 1 directly through the streambed and the banks referred to as groundwater discharge 2 diffusively to the riparian zone from where it discharges to the stream at locations where ponded water spills over the bank into the stream channel overland flow and 3 through drain pipes or ditches bypassing the riparian area aquifer and discharging to the stream tile drainage discharge dahl et al 2007 langhoff et al 2006 the various methods used in this paper measure or estimate one or more of these streamflow components 2 site description the knivsbaek catchment is located in the western part of denmark fig 1 inside the hydrological observatory skjern catchment hobe jensen and illangasekare 2011 to the west knivsbaek catchment is bounded by an ice pushed moraine called fjaldene topographic divide to the south it is bounded by valley terraces separating the stream from the town videbaek to the north and east it is bounded by abildaa stream the area of the topographical catchment is 12 4 km2 the groundwater divide in fig 1 was based on hydraulic head data from 48 wells in the area in most of the wells hydraulic head was measured once shortly after the well construction or twice at the year of the well construction as well as during a field campaign on 6 10 april 2015 only 17 boreholes available for measurement the groundwater catchment is smaller than the topographical catchment toward the west and northwest on the other hand it coincides with the topographical divide in the lower parts of the study area to the east while in some places to the south it is beyond the topographical divide the highest part of the catchment at the fjaldene moraine reaches near 85 masl it is characterized by sandy permeable soils on top of tills at the bottom of the moraine to the east the catchment becomes flat with altitudes between 30 and 35 m above sea level here the lithology consists of either glacial outwash sand and gravel of quaternary age on top of alternating layers of miocene mica clay referred to as cover layer in fig 1 or miocene sand rasmussen et al 2010 overlain by peat in the lowest areas to the east frederiksen et al 2017 the thickness of the quaternary deposits varies from 1 m to up to approximately 10 m frederiksen et al 2017 the reader is referred to frederiksen et al 2017 for a detailed description of the shallow geology the drainage system is dense in parts of the study area as is typical for danish lowland alluvial areas fig 1 it consists of open ditches and tile drain pipes that were implemented to maximize crop growth by lowering the shallow groundwater table the drainage system has been made where either low permeable deposits are shallow or the groundwater table is shallow because of the topography being both flat and low confluence points between drainage tile outlets and knivsbaek stream are indicated in fig 1 knivsbaek stream which flows year round originates in a wetland in the west of the catchment and flows 4800 m to the east with a mean gradient of approximately 0 004 through agricultural fields before reaching the outlet station at s12 approximately 2500 m downstream from the source of knivsbaek the wetland and riparian meadows around the stream widens from a few meters to 50 100 m along the stream drainage water enters the stream at eight locations six tile drain outlets from the fields in the upper part of the catchment and two tile drain outlets between 2500 m and 2300 m downstream from the fields in the southern part of the catchment t1 and t2 in fig 1 during baseflow conditions the width of knivsbaek stream ranges from 0 5 to 3 m and the depth from 10 to 50 cm but during high flow events depths up to 1 5 m occur the streambed consists of coarse sand and gravel but thin silt deposits and organic material are present where water moves slowly the knivsbaek catchment is divided into two sub catchments by the two automated gauging stations s11 and s12 and the stream is further sub divided into four reaches as follows reach 1 from d1 to s11 reach 2 from s11 to d2 reach 3 from d2 to d3 and reach 4 from d3 to s12 fig 1 3 material and methods 3 1 continuous stream discharge data stream stage was recorded every 15 min from 1 november 2014 to 31 october 2016 at upstream s11 in fig 1 and downstream s12 in fig 1 locations using pressure transducers type schlumberger mini diver water level and temperature sensor installed in stilling wells furthermore at each gauging location stream discharge was measured sub monthly during both high and low flows following the recommendations of herschy et al 1999 and using hydrometric propellers type ott c31 universal current meter discharge was calculated using the velocity area technique the standard deviation for such a discharge estimate in this type of stream is approximately 5 ovesen 2011 the stage discharge data were used to develop rating curves for both stations herschy et al 1999 the rating curves were generated using hymer www orbicon com hymer is a hydrometric software package that manages hydrometric hydrological and climate data and allows continuous correction of variations in channel roughness due to weed growth during spring and summer the rating curves provided a theoretical baseline for estimating 15 minute incremented time series of stream discharge as well as a series of daily average discharge values the standard deviation for such data in this type of environment is assumed to be 20 which is similar to the standard deviation for stage based stream discharge data in two other hobe sub catchments holtum and ahlergaarde based on expert elicitation sebok et al 2016 the daily discharge data were used for differential streamflow gauging over time and hydrograph separation respectively as described below the specific stream discharge ls 1 km 2 was calculated by dividing discharge with the topographic area of the catchment 3 2 groundwater discharge estimates 3 2 1 seepage meter measurements groundwater discharge through the streambed was measured using 660 cm2 circular seepage meters lee 1977 at four locations along the stream on 15 april and 6 august 2015 the seepage cylinder was connected via a 1 m flexible plastic tube to a partly pre filled 4 l plastic collection bag sheltered to minimize the effect of velocity head effects associated with moving water rosenberry 2008 after a pre set time interval the bag was removed and the volume of water collected was measured in order to calculate a seepage rate two separate measurements were made at each seepage meter installation with a temporal gap of eight hours to ensure that plenty of time was given for the system to return to normal before the second measurement three seepage meters were installed and measured simultaneously at each location to minimize concerns about local scale heterogeneity and the local groundwater flux was estimated as the average of the six seepage meter measurements water flux measured using a seepage meter is commonly multiplied by a correction factor to account for the total flow resistance in the meter including barrel outlet tube valves and collection bag rosenberry 2005 the correction factor may vary from 1 05 rosenberry 2005 to 1 74 erickson 1981 in the present study precautions were taken in applying the meter and a factor of 1 10 was used 3 2 2 detailed differential streamflow gauging detailed differential streamflow gauging was taken on 15 april and 6 august 2015 here streamflow was measured using an ott c31 propeller at five locations d1 s11 d2 d3 and s12 in fig 1 at the same time discharge from all tile drain outlets and all overland flows were measured between d1 and s12 fig 1 they were measured using an ott c2 mini propeller where possible otherwise by a plastic bag and a stopwatch using a water balance and accounting for all fluxes in and out of the reach the groundwater discharge for each of the four reaches was estimated as 1 q gw q down q up q in where q down and q up are streamflow at the downstream and upstream end of the reach respectively and q in is the sum of flow into the reach from tile drain outlets and overland flow using 1 it is implicitly assumed that change in channel storage and losses due to for example evapotranspiration are negligible streamflow gain tile drainage discharge and overland flow are measured values while groundwater discharge is a residual value estimated as streamflow gain subtracted tile drainage discharge and overland flow that is groundwater discharge is defined here as flow from the groundwater system to the stream directly through the streambed or through the banks groundwater discharge was divided by the streambed area to give estimates of groundwater discharge flux cm d 3 2 3 differential streamflow gauging over time significant tile drainage discharge and overland flow contributions to stream flow between gauging station s11 and s12 can be limited to the two largest tile drain outlets t1 and t2 fig 1 again neglecting change in channel storage and loss from evapotranspiration the mean daily groundwater discharge between s11 and s12 was estimated as 2 q diff t q 12 t q 11 t q t t where q 12 t and q 11 t are mean daily streamflow at s12 and s11 respectively and q t t is the sum of inflow from t1 and t2 fig 1 unfortunately we were unable to continuously monitor inflows from t1 and t2 instead we established a correlation between streamflow at s11 and the sum of inflow from t1 and t2 by conducting a number of flow measurements at these locations between august 2015 and february 2016 the measurements are shown in fig 2 the correlation between streamflow at s11 and the sum of inflow from t1 and t2 is 1 1 or 1 1 8 when streamflow at s11 is below or above respectively 80 l s using these correlations q diff t can be estimated from mean daily streamflow at s12 and s11 respectively as 3 q diff t q 12 t α q 11 t where the constant α is 4 α 2 for q 11 t 80 l s 2 8 for q 11 t 80 l s 3 2 4 hydrograph separation the continuous discharge data for gauging stations s11 and s12 were separated into baseflow and direct runoff using the united kingdom institute of hydrology method ukih method which is widely used since it is easy to apply and it is a standardized and systematic filtering method gustard et al 1992 a python script was used to carry out the procedure the script divides the daily stream discharge data into 5 day non overlapping blocks of data for each block of data the script calculates the discharge minima of five day non overlapping consecutive periods and subsequently searches for turning points in this sequence of minima turning points are defined as minima that are smaller than their neighbouring minima when multiplied by 0 9 the turning points are then connected to obtain the baseflow hydrograph which is constrained to equal the observed hydrograph ordinate on any day when the separated hydrograph exceeds the observed the direct runoff ratio was calculated as direct runoff divided by total discharge assuming that baseflow represents groundwater discharge to the stream the mean daily groundwater discharge between s11 and s12 was estimated as 5 qb diff t qb 12 t qb 11 t where q b 12 t and q b 11 t are mean daily baseflow at s12 and s11 respectively calculated using the ukih method 3 3 uncertainty estimation the following subsections explain how the standard deviation sd was determined for various flow estimates q in the results section and discussion section each q is presented with its 95 confidence interval the confidence interval was calculated simply as q 2 s d 3 3 1 seepage meter measurements simple statistics mean and standard deviation were calculated for groundwater discharge estimates obtained using seepage meters the values were based on data from six seepage measurements at each location orange dots in fig 1 3 3 2 detailed differential streamflow gauging assuming that measurement uncertainties of q down q up and q in in 1 are independent the standard deviation for groundwater discharge estimates obtained using detailed differential streamflow gauging was calculated using uncertainty propagation as 6 sd qgw sd qdown 2 sd qup 2 sd in 2 where s d qdown and s d qup are standard deviations for streamflow at the downstream and upstream end of the reach respectively while s d qin is the standard deviation for the sum of flow into the reach from tile drain outlets and overland flow in the present case using 6 it is assumed that the standard deviation for the sum of flows into the reach from tile drain outlets and overland flow is 10 of their total flow rate for each of the stream flows the standard deviation is 5 of the flow rate ovesen 2011 3 3 3 differential streamflow gauging over time assuming that measurement uncertainties of q 12 and q 11 in 3 are independent the standard deviation for q diff t was calculated using uncertainty propagation as goodman 1960 7 sd qdiff sd q 12 2 q q 11 2 sd α 2 α 2 sd q 11 2 where s d q 12 and s d q 11 are standard deviations for daily stream discharge at s12 and s11 respectively and s d α is standard deviation of the constant α calculating s d α as the standard deviation of the estimated slope of the two regression lines with known intercept in fig 2 is problematic because of the low number of measurements estimating s d α this way gave an unreasonable low deviation 2 and 0 6 for α 2 and α 2 8 respectively however a somewhat higher value for s d α is expected if more measurements had been available therefore using 7 it is instead assumed that s d α amounts to 10 grey shaded area in fig 2 3 3 4 hydrograph separation assuming that measurement uncertainties of q b 12 and q b 11 in 5 are independent the standard deviation for q b diff t was calculated using uncertainty propagation as 8 sd qbdiff sd qb 12 2 sd qb 11 2 where s d q b 12 and s d q b 11 are standard deviation for baseflow at s12 and s11 respectively each of s d q b 12 and s d q b 11 were calculated for 5 day non overlapping blocks of data containing 15 april 2015 and 6 august 2015 respectively to this end a novel method was developed for example to calculate s d q b 11 for the 5 day non overlapping block containing 6 august 2015 referred to as s d q b 11 a u g the following procedure was used 1 divide the daily stream discharge data for gauging station s11 into 5 day non overlapping blocks of data for each block compute the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding set of data let the mean and standard deviation for block i be called x i and s i respectively a scatter point in fig 3 represents the mean and standard deviation for a specific block of data 2 let the mean for the 5 day block containing the data for 6 august 2015 be called x 0 indicated by dotted line in fig 3 3 calculate the mean of s i for all the blocks of data all the points in fig 3 which satisfy that x i x 0 0 1 x 0 grey shaded area in fig 3 and let this mean value be called s 0 this measures the typical scatter of data having a block mean value of x 0 which is the average stream discharge in the five day period of 6 august 2015 4 set s d q b 11 a u g equal to s 0 4 results 4 1 seepage meters seepage meter measurements of groundwater discharge were taken at four locations 25 m upstream s11 d2 d3 and s12 respectively see fig 1 along the stream on 15 april 2015 and at two locations d2 and d3 on 6 august 2015 the results are presented in table 1 the measured groundwater fluxes were upwards at all locations and tend to increase from upstream to downstream the values range from 12 15 to 41 16 cm d with an insignificant difference between 15 april and 6 august it was observed that the six seepage measurements taken at each location resulted in large 95 confidence intervals table 1 even though the streambed sediments at all four locations appear to consist of homogeneous coarse sand and gravel 4 2 detailed differential streamflow gauging on 15 april and 6 august 2015 streamflow was measured at five locations d1 s11 d2 d3 and s12 in fig 1 along the stream together with discharge from tile drainage outlets and overland flow tile drainage outlets are shown on fig 1 no precipitation occurred for 4 days prior to the august measurements and the streamflow hydrograph indicates low and constant stream discharge fig 5 on the other hand the april measurements were taken after a wet period on this basis it is assumed that the august measurements represent a dry groundwater system with relatively low groundwater levels low soil water content and empty shallow runoff reservoirs while the april measurements represent a wet system the results are presented in table 2 on 15 april and 6 august the groundwater discharge along the entire stream length is estimated to be 77 l s 52 of the streamflow gain and 44 l s 50 respectively however the relative importance of tile drainage discharge overland flow and groundwater discharge varies along the stream on 15 april tile drainage discharge accounted for 79 of the increase in streamflow along reach 1 94 along reach 2 9 along reach 3 and 0 along reach 4 while overland flow accounted for 0 0 3 and 42 respectively hence groundwater discharge along each of the reaches accounted for 21 6 88 and 58 respectively this pattern was evident on 6 august as well on this basis reaches 1 2 can be classified as tile drainage dominated while reaches 3 4 are groundwater dominated it is noticed that the confidence interval is very wide for the estimates of groundwater discharge and especially for reaches 1 2 and 4 table 2 the wide intervals are mainly caused by uncertainty of the streamflow gain from which the groundwater discharge is estimated can be deducted from the numbers given in table 2 moreover an inspection of stream physical characteristics for reach 1 through 4 reveals that the average stream width increases from 0 65 m to 0 93 m 1 20 m and 1 45 m respectively while the average wet riparian width increases from 0 m to 48 m 52 m and 83 m respectively furthermore the wet riparian area constitutes 0 1 0 4 7 and 8 3 of the four sub catchments that is the two groundwater dominated reaches have wider stream channels and wider wet riparian areas than the two tile drainage discharge dominated reaches these characteristics are therefore consistent with the results of the detailed differential streamflow gauging 4 3 differential streamflow gauging over time between gauging stations s11 and s12 mean daily groundwater discharge was estimated using continuous discharge data for s11 and s12 black line in fig 4 for april through september mean monthly groundwater discharge varied from 100 60 cm d to 160 120 cm d with june and july having the lowest values on 15 april and 6 august 2015 the fluxes were estimated to be 161 96 and 108 54 cm d respectively red vertical lines in fig 4 overall the groundwater discharge is relatively constant during the period shown in fig 4 however the stream reach between s11 and s12 is located in a low lying area where high stream stage at high stream discharge potentially may reverse the hydraulic gradient over the sediment water interface for shorter periods for example the two large negative peaks that occurred start june and end july are likely examples of flux reversals pressure transducers or temperature loggers placed in the water column and streambed in different depths could test this hypothesis 4 4 hydrograph separation for gauging stations s11 and s12 the daily precipitation and stream discharge data show an immediate response of runoff to precipitation events and short recession curves indicate that fast runoff reservoirs are present fig 5 a for s11 and s12 the annual mean specific stream discharge is approximately 13 ls 1 km 2 and 17 ls 1 km 2 respectively fig 5b typical values for streams in western denmark are 13 ls 1 km 2 ovesen et al 2000 for s11 and s12 the annual variation of monthly mean specific stream discharge ranges from 7 to 26 ls 1 km 2 and 10 to 30 ls 1 km 2 respectively with values above the annual mean from november to march and below from april to october for both s11 and s12 the flow duration curves show a portion of small daily discharges dry summer days and a portion of large daily discharges wet winter days and large summer precipitation events fig 5c s11 has a higher portion of small values than s12 and some very large values 60 ls 1 km 2 not observed at s12 for gauging stations s11 and s12 the continuous discharge data were separated into baseflow and direct runoff using the ukih method fig 6 a and b respectively for s11 and s12 the annual mean direct runoff ratio is 0 26 and 0 21 respectively fig 6c for both stations the monthly mean direct runoff ratio varies over the year having values above annual mean in september and from november through january while having values less than 0 10 in may august and october for s11 and s12 values during the year range from 0 05 to 0 43 and 0 04 to 0 34 respectively s11 has higher monthly mean direct runoff ratios than s12 for months with above annual mean ratio while the ratio for the two stations is more similar for all other months furthermore between gauging stations s11 and s12 mean daily groundwater discharge was estimated using daily baseflow values for s11 and s12 on 15 april and 6 august 2015 the groundwater discharge fluxes over this stream reach were 289 102 and 194 31 cm d respectively 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater discharge along knivsbaek stream streamflow observations at two gauging stations within the knivsbaek catchment revealed a fast response to precipitation events in the studied lowland alluvial area the corresponding flow duration curves fig 5c show that the upstream gauging station s11 in fig 1 has a larger portion of small specific stream discharge values and more very large values than the outlet gauging station s12 in fig 1 furthermore the relative contribution of the mean annual direct runoff component to the streamflow hydrograph is approximately 25 larger for s11 than for s12 these findings indicate that groundwater discharge is less important for streamflow at s11 than for streamflow at s12 the specific stream discharge is approximately 30 larger for s12 than for s11 throughout the observation period fig 5b this indicates that groundwater may be recharged in the upland parts of knivsbaek catchment flow to lower lying areas to the east and discharge directly to knivsbaek stream or its surrounding riparian areas as explained in the site description the groundwater catchment is likely to be smaller than the topographical catchment toward the west and northwest and therefore knivsbaek catchment may be losing a likely small amount of groundwater to neighbouring catchments to the west of the topographical highs of fjaldene this is confirmed by the groundwater level contours in fig 1 the general groundwater flow pattern combined with the spatial differences between groundwater divide and topographical divide is likely to explain why specific stream discharge values for s12 are larger than those for s11 even though the s11 sub catchment is part of the catchment to s12 groundwater discharge measured using seepage meters showed that flux through the streambed to the upper reaches reaches 1 2 is 50 of the flux to the lower reaches reaches 3 4 groundwater discharge estimated using detailed differential streamflow gauging showed that flux through the streambed and the banks to the lower reaches is 4 to 10 times larger than the flux to the upper reaches the general groundwater flow pattern is likely to explain this spatial difference in groundwater discharge the hydrogeological controls on increase in streamflow vary along the stream the increase in streamflow along reaches 1 2 d1 to s11 and s11 to d2 respectively in fig 1 is mainly due to tile drainage discharge 79 94 in table 2 the agricultural fields around reach 1 are artificially drained because the groundwater table is shallow where the topography transitions from high hills to a flat stream valley fig 1 tile drainage discharge via t1 and t2 fig 1 accounts for approximately 94 of the increase in streamflow along reach 2 table 2 t1 and t2 drain the low lying areas to the south where superficial low permeable deposits are present on the other hand the increase in streamflow along reaches 3 4 d2 to d3 and d3 to s12 respectively in fig 1 is mainly due to groundwater discharge 58 100 in table 2 which may be controlled by the catchment scale groundwater flow direction combined with flat low lying areas and high permeable sediments in this part of knivsbaek catchment fig 1 in order to facilitate the larger groundwater discharge in the lower part of the catchment the riparian areas next to the stream are wider and the stream channel is wider the wide riparian area also makes some groundwater discharge to the most downstream reaches as overland flow table 2 5 2 comparison of groundwater discharge estimates the results of groundwater discharge estimates obtained from seepage meter measurements detailed differential streamflow gauging differential streamflow gauging over time and hydrograph separation are summarized in table 3 it is seen that estimates from point scale measurements range from 12 15 to 41 16 cm d and are lower than inflows estimated using the other methods estimates obtained using catchment scale methods hydrograph separation yield the highest inflow estimates ranging from 194 31 to 289 102 cm d for the shorter reaches 1 to 4 the estimates from detailed differential streamflow gauging range from 18 46 to 333 110 cm d these results suggest that groundwater discharge estimates depend on the spatial scale of the investigation method on 15 april 2015 for reaches 1 to 4 the groundwater contribution to streamflow estimated using seepage meter measurements accounted for 53 44 10 and 31 respectively of the net groundwater discharges estimated using the detailed differential streamflow gauging this suggests that point scale measurements are likely to underestimate volumetric change in flow along the stream because they typically are taken on the sediment water interface and therefore neglect groundwater discharge through the banks or that there is too few measurements over the variable streambed sediments the partitioning of groundwater discharge into streambed seepage and bank seepage is likely to be particularly important in lowland alluvial catchments langhoff et al 2006 for example estimated the groundwater contribution to streamflow using differential streamflow gauging and compared it to explicit measurements of streambed seepage bank seepage and overland flow at one site they found that streambed seepage accounted for 38 bank seepage for 25 and overland flow for 10 at another site the numbers were 8 0 and 109 respectively langhoff et al 2006 measured streambed seepage at additional seven sites where it accounted for from a few percent to about 100 of the increase in streamflow in the present paper it could have been useful to also measure the groundwater discharge through the banks using an alternative seepage meter as done by langhoff et al 2006 however this was not done because it is difficult and laborious to install such a seepage meter moreover on 6 august 2015 for reaches 2 and 3 the groundwater discharge estimates obtained using seepage meter measurements were 94 and 22 respectively of the estimates obtained using differential streamflow gauging thus the discrepancy between seepage meter measurements and differential streamflow gauging is significantly larger in april than in august table 3 this is likely because bank seepage is more important when the groundwater system is wet with high water levels high soil water content and partially filled shallow runoff reservoirs as in april instead of dry as in august furthermore the discrepancy between the groundwater discharge estimates obtained using seepage meter measurements and differential streamflow gauging is significant for the two groundwater dominated reaches while it is insignificant for the two tile drainage dominated reaches this is as expected because the groundwater dominated reaches of knivsbaek stream are tightly connected with the aquifer through a wide riparian zone on 15 april 2015 and 6 august 2015 for the stream reach between s11 and s12 the groundwater contribution to streamflow estimated using hydrograph separation was approximately twice the net discharges estimated using the detailed differential streamflow gauging table 3 results of gonzales et al 2009 suggest that simple filtering methods for hydrograph separation including the ukih method used in this paper give lower groundwater discharge estimates than other non tracer based methods and tracer based methods thus had we used other hydrograph separation methods than the ukih method this would likely have increased the overestimation of groundwater discharge from baseflow separation we attribute the discrepancy between groundwater discharge estimates obtained using detailed differential streamflow gauging and hydrograph separation to the in this case erroneous assumption that the entire baseflow component of the streamflow hydrograph represents groundwater discharge to the stream e g halford and mayer 2000 thus other runoff components than groundwater discharge is likely to contribute to the long term fluctuating component of the streamflow hydrograph our findings from knivsbaek catchment suggest that the most important other component is tile drainage discharge to this end we used a method differential streamflow gauging over time to exclude the tile drainage component from the streamflow hydrograph and thereby extract a more reliable estimate of groundwater discharge to the stream thus we found that the discrepancy between groundwater discharge estimates obtained using detailed differential streamflow gauging and differential streamflow gauging over time was insignificant 1 and 20 for april 2015 and august 2015 respectively overall for the studied stream differential streamflow gauging provides a more reliable groundwater discharge estimate than that provided by seepage meter measurements this is because differential streamflow gauging estimates the combined flux through the streambed and the banks while a seepage meter only measures the flux through the streambed in addition differential streamflow gauging also provides a more reliable groundwater discharge estimate than hydrograph separation this is the result of the importance of tile drainage discharge for baseflow which cannot be recognised by pure non tracer based hydrograph separation thus our recommendation for future groundwater discharge estimation in lowland alluvial streams such as knivsbaek is to use differential streamflow gauging however for hydrological systems in which hyporheic exchange is important differential streamflow gauging does not capture this process which will limit the utility of the method in addition the more detailed i e the shorter the reach the larger the propagated uncertainty is relative to the estimated flux this constrains the spatial resolution that can be obtained using this method overall the use of more than one investigation method at point reach or catchment scale will help to obtain a reliable estimate of the groundwater discharge component 6 conclusions as part of research conducted at one of the hobe project sites field work was undertaken in the period nov 2014 to oct 2016 to demonstrate how combined use of methods at point reach and catchment scale can be used to characterise groundwater discharge along a lowland alluvial stream to this end we compared and discussed groundwater discharge estimates obtained from these various methods the specific stream discharge was higher for the catchment outlet than for the gauging station at the upper third of the catchment and it varied seasonally from less than 5 ls 1 km 2 during summer months and up to 60 ls 1 km 2 during winter events the increase in streamflow was mainly due to tile drainage discharge in the upper reaches 80 while groundwater discharge was most important in the lower reaches 60 this spatial variation was controlled by topography geology regional groundwater flow pattern and anthropogenic tile drainage groundwater discharge estimates obtained using seepage meters at the lower reaches were about the double of those at the upper reaches while the difference between measurements taken in april and those taken in august was insignificant however these estimates had large 95 confidence intervals even though the streambed deposits appear to be homogeneous the groundwater discharge estimates obtained using detailed differential streamflow gauging were an order of magnitude larger than the estimates obtained using seepage meters this is attributed to the partitioning of groundwater discharge into streambed seepage and bank seepage or that too few seepage meter measurements were taken to fully account for the spatial variability of streambed seepage furthermore the estimates obtained using detailed differential streamflow gauging were half of those obtained using hydrograph separation which was attributed to errors associated with the assumption that baseflow represents groundwater discharge to the stream to this end we used a method which is referred to as differential streamflow gauging over time to extract the tile drainage discharge from the streamflow hydrograph a more reliable groundwater discharge estimate was thereby obtained moreover we developed a novel method to calculate the uncertainty on groundwater discharge estimates obtained using hydrograph separation the overall conclusion is that the relative importance of different flow paths for discharging groundwater to a lowland alluvial stream varied between short reaches 0 5 1 5 km and between april and august these findings support the idea that groundwater and surface water interaction even in lowland alluvial catchments is spatially and temporally variable furthermore the groundwater discharge estimates were dependent on the spatial scale of the investigation method thus the use of more than one method at a site will help to obtain a reliable estimate of groundwater discharge from the other discharge components to the stream such as tile drainage discharge acknowledgements the manuscript was improved by review from donald rosenberry and three

7102,the groundwater contribution to streamflow along a lowland alluvial stream in denmark was estimated using a variety of methods and at different spatial scales at the point scale less than a few metres groundwater discharge to the stream was measured using seepage meters at the reach scale 0 5 1 5 km groundwater discharge to the stream was estimated using differential streamflow gauging and at the catchment scale 1 5 km groundwater discharge to the stream was estimated using hydrograph separation the estimates of groundwater discharge obtained using point scale measurements range from 12 to 41 cm d which is lower than fluxes estimated at the reach scale which range from 18 to 333 cm d this discrepancy was attributed to the partitioning of groundwater discharge into streambed seepage and bank seepage on the other hand the groundwater discharge estimates obtained using hydrograph separation were generally the highest and ranged from 194 to 289 cm d for this study this discrepancy from the reach scale estimates was attributed to the assumption that baseflow obtained using hydrograph separation represents groundwater discharge to the stream when part of the baseflow actually comes from artificial drainage systems anyhow seepage meter measurements differential streamflow gauging and hydrograph separation showed similar trends the increase in streamflow is mainly due to either groundwater discharge through the streambed and the banks in the lower part or tile drainage discharge in the upper part of the catchment furthermore estimation of uncertainty for the various groundwater discharge estimates showed that some of the flux estimates were insignificant compared with their propagated uncertainties to this end a novel method was developed to estimate the uncertainty of groundwater discharge estimates obtained by hydrograph separation overall this paper shows that more than one method should be used to obtain a reliable estimate of groundwater discharge to a lowland alluvial stream from other discharge contributions such as tile drainage keywords seepage meters differential streamflow gauging hydrograph separation measurement uncertainty groundwater discharge 1 introduction most streams in denmark flow year round and are located in humid lowland alluvial areas with a thin unsaturated zone thus the groundwater and surface water systems are strongly interconnected and groundwater is an important component of total streamflow in many of these streams e g van roosmalen et al 2007 in such interconnected systems groundwater withdrawals can deplete streamflow e g nyholm et al 2002 with detrimental consequences for stream ecosystems e g johansen et al 2011 in addition to water budget concerns it is also of importance to assess the water fluxes between groundwater and surface water because of the risk of excess nutrients leaching to aquifers and streams especially in agricultural catchments kronvang et al 2005 which constitute approximately two thirds of all land in denmark it is well known that the potential for reducing nitrate via denitrification and thus improvement of water quality depends on where and how groundwater discharges to alluvial streams therefore reliable methods for estimating groundwater discharge to streams are needed for successful water resource management common methods used to estimate groundwater discharge are reviewed by for example kalbus et al 2006 and include seepage meter measurements e g lee 1977 rosenberry 2008 natural tracer methods e g xie et al 2016 heat tracer methods e g anderson 2005 constantz 2008 hatch et al 2006 lowry et al 2007 mass balance approaches including differential streamflow gauging e g cey et al 1998 harte and kiah 2009 langhoff et al 2006 schmadel et al 2010 and hydrograph separation e g gonzales et al 2009 hannula et al 2003 generally these methods may be divided into three groups those that estimate the groundwater flux directly through the sediment water interface at point scale less than a few metres those that estimate the volumetric change in flow along the stream at reach scale 100 m to several kilometres and those that estimate the integrated response of the surface groundwater interaction at catchment scale greater than a few kilometres although it is well known that the processes governing the groundwater discharge estimate are different depending on the method cranswick and cook 2015 kalbus et al 2006 it is relevant and important to compare these results because the interpretation of the importance of groundwater discharge to the stream water budget would be greatly dependent on the method used for quantifying the input e g becker et al 2004 at the point scale direct measurements of water flux across the sediment water interface by seepage meters are widely applied in streams the seepage meter relies on a simple concept and is inexpensive to construct however since the meter covers a relatively small bed area its application can be influenced by streambed heterogeneity and measurements at many locations are therefore required with large associated labour costs numerous studies have addressed this by combining seepage meters with fibre optic distributed temperature sensing e g rosenberry et al 2016 furthermore seepage meters measure the water exchange across the streambed while other components of the total groundwater discharge are neglected including seepage through the banks this component however can be measured with alternative seepage meters langhoff et al 2006 on the other hand water flux across the sediment water interface measured with seepage meters may include a contribution from hyperheic flow in addition to the groundwater contribution e g rosenberry and pitlick 2009 at the reach scale closely spaced measurements of streamflow referred to as differential streamflow gauging can estimate the net groundwater flux to streams through the bed and the banks if all other fluxes in and out of the reach are accounted for cey et al 1998 harte and kiah 2009 langhoff et al 2006 opsahl et al 2007 schmadel et al 2010 results of for example cey et al 1998 suggest that differential streamflow gauging gives more reasonable estimates of the groundwater discharge contribution to streamflow than point scale estimates at the catchment scale the quintessential method to estimate the groundwater contribution to streams is hydrograph separation which has a long history in hydrology gonzales et al 2009 hall 1968 tallaksen 1995 basically a stream hydrograph is separated into a short term fluctuating component typically named direct runoff and a long term fluctuating component typically named baseflow it is then assumed that baseflow represents groundwater discharge to the stream hydrograph separation methods can be divided into tracer based and non tracer based results of gonzales et al 2009 suggest that tracer based hydrograph separation methods provide the hydrological most reasonable estimates of the groundwater contribution to streamflow in a lowland catchment however tracer based hydrograph separation methods are more costly and labour intensive than non tracer based methods and long term tracer data are not available from most gauging stations therefore it is important to evaluate the ability of non tracer based hydrograph separation methods to give reasonable estimates of groundwater discharge despite the limitations of such techniques gonzales et al 2009 suggest that the rating curve envelope method kliner and knezek 1974 sellinger 1996 and the recursive filter methods eckhardt 2005 are the best to estimate the groundwater contribution to streamflow however these methods require groundwater level measurements and calibration to tracer based results respectively a limitation of non tracer based hydrograph separation methods is that the identification of the groundwater component of continuous discharge data is uncertain because other inputs such as tributaries overland flow and tile drainage systems may exceed the groundwater discharge and cause a similar recession e g halford and mayer 2000 therefore the groundwater discharge is easily overestimated by hydrograph separation methods one may overcome this by estimating the water balance between two gauging stations on the same stream system taking into account major inputs and losses mccallum et al 2014 opsahl et al 2007 sutton et al 2014 the first objective of this study is to characterise the groundwater discharge to a 4 8 km long lowland alluvial stream in the western part of denmark based on an application of methods at point reach and catchment scale the methods of groundwater discharge estimation are 1 seepage meter measurements at the point scale 2 differential streamflow gauging at the reach scale and 3 hydrograph separation at the catchment scale the second objective is to compare and discuss the groundwater discharge estimates obtained by these various methods working on different spatial scales to support this comparison and discussion we estimate the standard deviations and confidence intervals associated with the various flux estimates to this end we develop a novel method to estimate the uncertainty of groundwater discharge estimates obtained by hydrograph separation for clarity in hydrological systems such as the one studied here water can flow to a stream 1 directly through the streambed and the banks referred to as groundwater discharge 2 diffusively to the riparian zone from where it discharges to the stream at locations where ponded water spills over the bank into the stream channel overland flow and 3 through drain pipes or ditches bypassing the riparian area aquifer and discharging to the stream tile drainage discharge dahl et al 2007 langhoff et al 2006 the various methods used in this paper measure or estimate one or more of these streamflow components 2 site description the knivsbaek catchment is located in the western part of denmark fig 1 inside the hydrological observatory skjern catchment hobe jensen and illangasekare 2011 to the west knivsbaek catchment is bounded by an ice pushed moraine called fjaldene topographic divide to the south it is bounded by valley terraces separating the stream from the town videbaek to the north and east it is bounded by abildaa stream the area of the topographical catchment is 12 4 km2 the groundwater divide in fig 1 was based on hydraulic head data from 48 wells in the area in most of the wells hydraulic head was measured once shortly after the well construction or twice at the year of the well construction as well as during a field campaign on 6 10 april 2015 only 17 boreholes available for measurement the groundwater catchment is smaller than the topographical catchment toward the west and northwest on the other hand it coincides with the topographical divide in the lower parts of the study area to the east while in some places to the south it is beyond the topographical divide the highest part of the catchment at the fjaldene moraine reaches near 85 masl it is characterized by sandy permeable soils on top of tills at the bottom of the moraine to the east the catchment becomes flat with altitudes between 30 and 35 m above sea level here the lithology consists of either glacial outwash sand and gravel of quaternary age on top of alternating layers of miocene mica clay referred to as cover layer in fig 1 or miocene sand rasmussen et al 2010 overlain by peat in the lowest areas to the east frederiksen et al 2017 the thickness of the quaternary deposits varies from 1 m to up to approximately 10 m frederiksen et al 2017 the reader is referred to frederiksen et al 2017 for a detailed description of the shallow geology the drainage system is dense in parts of the study area as is typical for danish lowland alluvial areas fig 1 it consists of open ditches and tile drain pipes that were implemented to maximize crop growth by lowering the shallow groundwater table the drainage system has been made where either low permeable deposits are shallow or the groundwater table is shallow because of the topography being both flat and low confluence points between drainage tile outlets and knivsbaek stream are indicated in fig 1 knivsbaek stream which flows year round originates in a wetland in the west of the catchment and flows 4800 m to the east with a mean gradient of approximately 0 004 through agricultural fields before reaching the outlet station at s12 approximately 2500 m downstream from the source of knivsbaek the wetland and riparian meadows around the stream widens from a few meters to 50 100 m along the stream drainage water enters the stream at eight locations six tile drain outlets from the fields in the upper part of the catchment and two tile drain outlets between 2500 m and 2300 m downstream from the fields in the southern part of the catchment t1 and t2 in fig 1 during baseflow conditions the width of knivsbaek stream ranges from 0 5 to 3 m and the depth from 10 to 50 cm but during high flow events depths up to 1 5 m occur the streambed consists of coarse sand and gravel but thin silt deposits and organic material are present where water moves slowly the knivsbaek catchment is divided into two sub catchments by the two automated gauging stations s11 and s12 and the stream is further sub divided into four reaches as follows reach 1 from d1 to s11 reach 2 from s11 to d2 reach 3 from d2 to d3 and reach 4 from d3 to s12 fig 1 3 material and methods 3 1 continuous stream discharge data stream stage was recorded every 15 min from 1 november 2014 to 31 october 2016 at upstream s11 in fig 1 and downstream s12 in fig 1 locations using pressure transducers type schlumberger mini diver water level and temperature sensor installed in stilling wells furthermore at each gauging location stream discharge was measured sub monthly during both high and low flows following the recommendations of herschy et al 1999 and using hydrometric propellers type ott c31 universal current meter discharge was calculated using the velocity area technique the standard deviation for such a discharge estimate in this type of stream is approximately 5 ovesen 2011 the stage discharge data were used to develop rating curves for both stations herschy et al 1999 the rating curves were generated using hymer www orbicon com hymer is a hydrometric software package that manages hydrometric hydrological and climate data and allows continuous correction of variations in channel roughness due to weed growth during spring and summer the rating curves provided a theoretical baseline for estimating 15 minute incremented time series of stream discharge as well as a series of daily average discharge values the standard deviation for such data in this type of environment is assumed to be 20 which is similar to the standard deviation for stage based stream discharge data in two other hobe sub catchments holtum and ahlergaarde based on expert elicitation sebok et al 2016 the daily discharge data were used for differential streamflow gauging over time and hydrograph separation respectively as described below the specific stream discharge ls 1 km 2 was calculated by dividing discharge with the topographic area of the catchment 3 2 groundwater discharge estimates 3 2 1 seepage meter measurements groundwater discharge through the streambed was measured using 660 cm2 circular seepage meters lee 1977 at four locations along the stream on 15 april and 6 august 2015 the seepage cylinder was connected via a 1 m flexible plastic tube to a partly pre filled 4 l plastic collection bag sheltered to minimize the effect of velocity head effects associated with moving water rosenberry 2008 after a pre set time interval the bag was removed and the volume of water collected was measured in order to calculate a seepage rate two separate measurements were made at each seepage meter installation with a temporal gap of eight hours to ensure that plenty of time was given for the system to return to normal before the second measurement three seepage meters were installed and measured simultaneously at each location to minimize concerns about local scale heterogeneity and the local groundwater flux was estimated as the average of the six seepage meter measurements water flux measured using a seepage meter is commonly multiplied by a correction factor to account for the total flow resistance in the meter including barrel outlet tube valves and collection bag rosenberry 2005 the correction factor may vary from 1 05 rosenberry 2005 to 1 74 erickson 1981 in the present study precautions were taken in applying the meter and a factor of 1 10 was used 3 2 2 detailed differential streamflow gauging detailed differential streamflow gauging was taken on 15 april and 6 august 2015 here streamflow was measured using an ott c31 propeller at five locations d1 s11 d2 d3 and s12 in fig 1 at the same time discharge from all tile drain outlets and all overland flows were measured between d1 and s12 fig 1 they were measured using an ott c2 mini propeller where possible otherwise by a plastic bag and a stopwatch using a water balance and accounting for all fluxes in and out of the reach the groundwater discharge for each of the four reaches was estimated as 1 q gw q down q up q in where q down and q up are streamflow at the downstream and upstream end of the reach respectively and q in is the sum of flow into the reach from tile drain outlets and overland flow using 1 it is implicitly assumed that change in channel storage and losses due to for example evapotranspiration are negligible streamflow gain tile drainage discharge and overland flow are measured values while groundwater discharge is a residual value estimated as streamflow gain subtracted tile drainage discharge and overland flow that is groundwater discharge is defined here as flow from the groundwater system to the stream directly through the streambed or through the banks groundwater discharge was divided by the streambed area to give estimates of groundwater discharge flux cm d 3 2 3 differential streamflow gauging over time significant tile drainage discharge and overland flow contributions to stream flow between gauging station s11 and s12 can be limited to the two largest tile drain outlets t1 and t2 fig 1 again neglecting change in channel storage and loss from evapotranspiration the mean daily groundwater discharge between s11 and s12 was estimated as 2 q diff t q 12 t q 11 t q t t where q 12 t and q 11 t are mean daily streamflow at s12 and s11 respectively and q t t is the sum of inflow from t1 and t2 fig 1 unfortunately we were unable to continuously monitor inflows from t1 and t2 instead we established a correlation between streamflow at s11 and the sum of inflow from t1 and t2 by conducting a number of flow measurements at these locations between august 2015 and february 2016 the measurements are shown in fig 2 the correlation between streamflow at s11 and the sum of inflow from t1 and t2 is 1 1 or 1 1 8 when streamflow at s11 is below or above respectively 80 l s using these correlations q diff t can be estimated from mean daily streamflow at s12 and s11 respectively as 3 q diff t q 12 t α q 11 t where the constant α is 4 α 2 for q 11 t 80 l s 2 8 for q 11 t 80 l s 3 2 4 hydrograph separation the continuous discharge data for gauging stations s11 and s12 were separated into baseflow and direct runoff using the united kingdom institute of hydrology method ukih method which is widely used since it is easy to apply and it is a standardized and systematic filtering method gustard et al 1992 a python script was used to carry out the procedure the script divides the daily stream discharge data into 5 day non overlapping blocks of data for each block of data the script calculates the discharge minima of five day non overlapping consecutive periods and subsequently searches for turning points in this sequence of minima turning points are defined as minima that are smaller than their neighbouring minima when multiplied by 0 9 the turning points are then connected to obtain the baseflow hydrograph which is constrained to equal the observed hydrograph ordinate on any day when the separated hydrograph exceeds the observed the direct runoff ratio was calculated as direct runoff divided by total discharge assuming that baseflow represents groundwater discharge to the stream the mean daily groundwater discharge between s11 and s12 was estimated as 5 qb diff t qb 12 t qb 11 t where q b 12 t and q b 11 t are mean daily baseflow at s12 and s11 respectively calculated using the ukih method 3 3 uncertainty estimation the following subsections explain how the standard deviation sd was determined for various flow estimates q in the results section and discussion section each q is presented with its 95 confidence interval the confidence interval was calculated simply as q 2 s d 3 3 1 seepage meter measurements simple statistics mean and standard deviation were calculated for groundwater discharge estimates obtained using seepage meters the values were based on data from six seepage measurements at each location orange dots in fig 1 3 3 2 detailed differential streamflow gauging assuming that measurement uncertainties of q down q up and q in in 1 are independent the standard deviation for groundwater discharge estimates obtained using detailed differential streamflow gauging was calculated using uncertainty propagation as 6 sd qgw sd qdown 2 sd qup 2 sd in 2 where s d qdown and s d qup are standard deviations for streamflow at the downstream and upstream end of the reach respectively while s d qin is the standard deviation for the sum of flow into the reach from tile drain outlets and overland flow in the present case using 6 it is assumed that the standard deviation for the sum of flows into the reach from tile drain outlets and overland flow is 10 of their total flow rate for each of the stream flows the standard deviation is 5 of the flow rate ovesen 2011 3 3 3 differential streamflow gauging over time assuming that measurement uncertainties of q 12 and q 11 in 3 are independent the standard deviation for q diff t was calculated using uncertainty propagation as goodman 1960 7 sd qdiff sd q 12 2 q q 11 2 sd α 2 α 2 sd q 11 2 where s d q 12 and s d q 11 are standard deviations for daily stream discharge at s12 and s11 respectively and s d α is standard deviation of the constant α calculating s d α as the standard deviation of the estimated slope of the two regression lines with known intercept in fig 2 is problematic because of the low number of measurements estimating s d α this way gave an unreasonable low deviation 2 and 0 6 for α 2 and α 2 8 respectively however a somewhat higher value for s d α is expected if more measurements had been available therefore using 7 it is instead assumed that s d α amounts to 10 grey shaded area in fig 2 3 3 4 hydrograph separation assuming that measurement uncertainties of q b 12 and q b 11 in 5 are independent the standard deviation for q b diff t was calculated using uncertainty propagation as 8 sd qbdiff sd qb 12 2 sd qb 11 2 where s d q b 12 and s d q b 11 are standard deviation for baseflow at s12 and s11 respectively each of s d q b 12 and s d q b 11 were calculated for 5 day non overlapping blocks of data containing 15 april 2015 and 6 august 2015 respectively to this end a novel method was developed for example to calculate s d q b 11 for the 5 day non overlapping block containing 6 august 2015 referred to as s d q b 11 a u g the following procedure was used 1 divide the daily stream discharge data for gauging station s11 into 5 day non overlapping blocks of data for each block compute the mean and standard deviation of the corresponding set of data let the mean and standard deviation for block i be called x i and s i respectively a scatter point in fig 3 represents the mean and standard deviation for a specific block of data 2 let the mean for the 5 day block containing the data for 6 august 2015 be called x 0 indicated by dotted line in fig 3 3 calculate the mean of s i for all the blocks of data all the points in fig 3 which satisfy that x i x 0 0 1 x 0 grey shaded area in fig 3 and let this mean value be called s 0 this measures the typical scatter of data having a block mean value of x 0 which is the average stream discharge in the five day period of 6 august 2015 4 set s d q b 11 a u g equal to s 0 4 results 4 1 seepage meters seepage meter measurements of groundwater discharge were taken at four locations 25 m upstream s11 d2 d3 and s12 respectively see fig 1 along the stream on 15 april 2015 and at two locations d2 and d3 on 6 august 2015 the results are presented in table 1 the measured groundwater fluxes were upwards at all locations and tend to increase from upstream to downstream the values range from 12 15 to 41 16 cm d with an insignificant difference between 15 april and 6 august it was observed that the six seepage measurements taken at each location resulted in large 95 confidence intervals table 1 even though the streambed sediments at all four locations appear to consist of homogeneous coarse sand and gravel 4 2 detailed differential streamflow gauging on 15 april and 6 august 2015 streamflow was measured at five locations d1 s11 d2 d3 and s12 in fig 1 along the stream together with discharge from tile drainage outlets and overland flow tile drainage outlets are shown on fig 1 no precipitation occurred for 4 days prior to the august measurements and the streamflow hydrograph indicates low and constant stream discharge fig 5 on the other hand the april measurements were taken after a wet period on this basis it is assumed that the august measurements represent a dry groundwater system with relatively low groundwater levels low soil water content and empty shallow runoff reservoirs while the april measurements represent a wet system the results are presented in table 2 on 15 april and 6 august the groundwater discharge along the entire stream length is estimated to be 77 l s 52 of the streamflow gain and 44 l s 50 respectively however the relative importance of tile drainage discharge overland flow and groundwater discharge varies along the stream on 15 april tile drainage discharge accounted for 79 of the increase in streamflow along reach 1 94 along reach 2 9 along reach 3 and 0 along reach 4 while overland flow accounted for 0 0 3 and 42 respectively hence groundwater discharge along each of the reaches accounted for 21 6 88 and 58 respectively this pattern was evident on 6 august as well on this basis reaches 1 2 can be classified as tile drainage dominated while reaches 3 4 are groundwater dominated it is noticed that the confidence interval is very wide for the estimates of groundwater discharge and especially for reaches 1 2 and 4 table 2 the wide intervals are mainly caused by uncertainty of the streamflow gain from which the groundwater discharge is estimated can be deducted from the numbers given in table 2 moreover an inspection of stream physical characteristics for reach 1 through 4 reveals that the average stream width increases from 0 65 m to 0 93 m 1 20 m and 1 45 m respectively while the average wet riparian width increases from 0 m to 48 m 52 m and 83 m respectively furthermore the wet riparian area constitutes 0 1 0 4 7 and 8 3 of the four sub catchments that is the two groundwater dominated reaches have wider stream channels and wider wet riparian areas than the two tile drainage discharge dominated reaches these characteristics are therefore consistent with the results of the detailed differential streamflow gauging 4 3 differential streamflow gauging over time between gauging stations s11 and s12 mean daily groundwater discharge was estimated using continuous discharge data for s11 and s12 black line in fig 4 for april through september mean monthly groundwater discharge varied from 100 60 cm d to 160 120 cm d with june and july having the lowest values on 15 april and 6 august 2015 the fluxes were estimated to be 161 96 and 108 54 cm d respectively red vertical lines in fig 4 overall the groundwater discharge is relatively constant during the period shown in fig 4 however the stream reach between s11 and s12 is located in a low lying area where high stream stage at high stream discharge potentially may reverse the hydraulic gradient over the sediment water interface for shorter periods for example the two large negative peaks that occurred start june and end july are likely examples of flux reversals pressure transducers or temperature loggers placed in the water column and streambed in different depths could test this hypothesis 4 4 hydrograph separation for gauging stations s11 and s12 the daily precipitation and stream discharge data show an immediate response of runoff to precipitation events and short recession curves indicate that fast runoff reservoirs are present fig 5 a for s11 and s12 the annual mean specific stream discharge is approximately 13 ls 1 km 2 and 17 ls 1 km 2 respectively fig 5b typical values for streams in western denmark are 13 ls 1 km 2 ovesen et al 2000 for s11 and s12 the annual variation of monthly mean specific stream discharge ranges from 7 to 26 ls 1 km 2 and 10 to 30 ls 1 km 2 respectively with values above the annual mean from november to march and below from april to october for both s11 and s12 the flow duration curves show a portion of small daily discharges dry summer days and a portion of large daily discharges wet winter days and large summer precipitation events fig 5c s11 has a higher portion of small values than s12 and some very large values 60 ls 1 km 2 not observed at s12 for gauging stations s11 and s12 the continuous discharge data were separated into baseflow and direct runoff using the ukih method fig 6 a and b respectively for s11 and s12 the annual mean direct runoff ratio is 0 26 and 0 21 respectively fig 6c for both stations the monthly mean direct runoff ratio varies over the year having values above annual mean in september and from november through january while having values less than 0 10 in may august and october for s11 and s12 values during the year range from 0 05 to 0 43 and 0 04 to 0 34 respectively s11 has higher monthly mean direct runoff ratios than s12 for months with above annual mean ratio while the ratio for the two stations is more similar for all other months furthermore between gauging stations s11 and s12 mean daily groundwater discharge was estimated using daily baseflow values for s11 and s12 on 15 april and 6 august 2015 the groundwater discharge fluxes over this stream reach were 289 102 and 194 31 cm d respectively 5 discussion 5 1 groundwater discharge along knivsbaek stream streamflow observations at two gauging stations within the knivsbaek catchment revealed a fast response to precipitation events in the studied lowland alluvial area the corresponding flow duration curves fig 5c show that the upstream gauging station s11 in fig 1 has a larger portion of small specific stream discharge values and more very large values than the outlet gauging station s12 in fig 1 furthermore the relative contribution of the mean annual direct runoff component to the streamflow hydrograph is approximately 25 larger for s11 than for s12 these findings indicate that groundwater discharge is less important for streamflow at s11 than for streamflow at s12 the specific stream discharge is approximately 30 larger for s12 than for s11 throughout the observation period fig 5b this indicates that groundwater may be recharged in the upland parts of knivsbaek catchment flow to lower lying areas to the east and discharge directly to knivsbaek stream or its surrounding riparian areas as explained in the site description the groundwater catchment is likely to be smaller than the topographical catchment toward the west and northwest and therefore knivsbaek catchment may be losing a likely small amount of groundwater to neighbouring catchments to the west of the topographical highs of fjaldene this is confirmed by the groundwater level contours in fig 1 the general groundwater flow pattern combined with the spatial differences between groundwater divide and topographical divide is likely to explain why specific stream discharge values for s12 are larger than those for s11 even though the s11 sub catchment is part of the catchment to s12 groundwater discharge measured using seepage meters showed that flux through the streambed to the upper reaches reaches 1 2 is 50 of the flux to the lower reaches reaches 3 4 groundwater discharge estimated using detailed differential streamflow gauging showed that flux through the streambed and the banks to the lower reaches is 4 to 10 times larger than the flux to the upper reaches the general groundwater flow pattern is likely to explain this spatial difference in groundwater discharge the hydrogeological controls on increase in streamflow vary along the stream the increase in streamflow along reaches 1 2 d1 to s11 and s11 to d2 respectively in fig 1 is mainly due to tile drainage discharge 79 94 in table 2 the agricultural fields around reach 1 are artificially drained because the groundwater table is shallow where the topography transitions from high hills to a flat stream valley fig 1 tile drainage discharge via t1 and t2 fig 1 accounts for approximately 94 of the increase in streamflow along reach 2 table 2 t1 and t2 drain the low lying areas to the south where superficial low permeable deposits are present on the other hand the increase in streamflow along reaches 3 4 d2 to d3 and d3 to s12 respectively in fig 1 is mainly due to groundwater discharge 58 100 in table 2 which may be controlled by the catchment scale groundwater flow direction combined with flat low lying areas and high permeable sediments in this part of knivsbaek catchment fig 1 in order to facilitate the larger groundwater discharge in the lower part of the catchment the riparian areas next to the stream are wider and the stream channel is wider the wide riparian area also makes some groundwater discharge to the most downstream reaches as overland flow table 2 5 2 comparison of groundwater discharge estimates

summarized in table 3 it is seen that estimates from point scale measurements range from 12 15 to 41 16 cm d and are lower than inflows estimated using the other methods estimates obtained using catchment scale methods hydrograph separation yield the highest inflow estimates ranging from 194 31 to 289 102 cm d for the shorter reaches 1 to 4 the estimates from detailed differential streamflow gauging range from 18 46 to 333 110 cm d these results suggest that groundwater discharge estimates depend on the spatial scale of the investigation method on 15 april 2015 for reaches 1 to 4 the groundwater contribution to streamflow estimated using seepage meter measurements accounted for 53 44 10 and 31 respectively of the net groundwater discharges estimated using the detailed differential streamflow gauging this suggests that point scale measurements are likely to underestimate volumetric change in flow along the stream because they typically are taken on the sediment water interface and therefore neglect groundwater discharge through the banks or that there is too few measurements over the variable streambed sediments the partitioning of groundwater discharge into streambed seepage and bank seepage is likely to be particularly important in lowland alluvial catchments langhoff et al 2006 for example estimated the groundwater contribution to streamflow using differential streamflow gauging and compared it to explicit measurements of streambed seepage bank seepage and overland flow at one site they found that streambed seepage accounted for 38 bank seepage for 25 and overland flow for 10 at another site the numbers were 8 0 and 109 respectively langhoff et al 2006 measured streambed seepage at additional seven sites where it accounted for from a few percent to about 100 of the increase in streamflow in the present paper it could have been useful to also measure the groundwater discharge through the banks using an alternative seepage meter as done by langhoff et al 2006 however this was not done because it is difficult and laborious to install such a seepage meter moreover on 6 august 2015 for reaches 2 and 3 the groundwater discharge estimates obtained using seepage meter measurements were 94 and 22 respectively of the estimates obtained using differential streamflow gauging thus the discrepancy between seepage meter measurements and differential streamflow gauging is significantly larger in april than in august table 3 this is likely because bank seepage is more important when the groundwater system is wet with high water levels high soil water content and partially filled shallow runoff reservoirs as in april instead of dry as in august furthermore the discrepancy between the groundwater discharge estimates obtained using seepage meter measurements and differential streamflow gauging is significant for the two groundwater dominated reaches while it is insignificant for the two tile drainage dominated reaches this is as expected because the groundwater dominated reaches of knivsbaek stream are tightly connected with the aquifer through a wide riparian zone on 15 april 2015 and 6 august 2015 for the stream reach between s11 and s12 the groundwater contribution to streamflow estimated using hydrograph separation was approximately twice the net discharges estimated using the detailed differential streamflow gauging table 3 results of gonzales et al 2009 suggest that simple filtering methods for hydrograph separation including the ukih method used in this paper give lower groundwater discharge estimates than other non tracer based methods and tracer based methods thus had we used other hydrograph separation methods than the ukih method this would likely have increased the overestimation of groundwater discharge from baseflow separation we attribute the discrepancy between groundwater discharge estimates obtained using detailed differential streamflow gauging and hydrograph separation to the in this case erroneous assumption that the entire baseflow component of the streamflow hydrograph represents groundwater discharge to the stream e g halford and mayer 2000 thus other runoff components than groundwater discharge is likely to contribute to the long term fluctuating component of the streamflow hydrograph our findings from knivsbaek catchment suggest that the most important other component is tile drainage discharge to this end we used a method differential streamflow gauging over time to exclude the tile drainage component from the streamflow hydrograph and thereby extract a more reliable estimate of groundwater discharge to the stream thus we found that the discrepancy between groundwater discharge estimates obtained using detailed differential streamflow gauging and differential streamflow gauging over time was insignificant 1 and 20 for april 2015 and august 2015 respectively overall for the studied stream differential streamflow gauging provides a more reliable groundwater discharge estimate than that provided by seepage meter measurements this is because differential streamflow gauging estimates the combined flux through the streambed and the banks while a seepage meter only measures the flux through the streambed in addition differential streamflow gauging also provides a more reliable groundwater discharge estimate than hydrograph separation this is the result of the importance of tile drainage discharge for baseflow which cannot be recognised by pure non tracer based hydrograph separation thus our recommendation for future groundwater discharge estimation in lowland alluvial streams such as knivsbaek is to use differential streamflow gauging however for hydrological systems in which hyporheic exchange is important differential streamflow gauging does not capture this process which will limit the utility of the method in addition the more detailed i e the shorter the reach the larger the propagated uncertainty is relative to the estimated flux this constrains the spatial resolution that can be obtained using this method overall the use of more than one investigation method at point reach or catchment scale will help to obtain a reliable estimate of the groundwater discharge component 6 conclusions as part of research conducted at one of the hobe project sites field work was undertaken in the period nov 2014 to oct 2016 to demonstrate how combined use of methods at point reach and catchment scale can be used to characterise groundwater discharge along a lowland alluvial stream to this end we compared and discussed groundwater discharge estimates obtained from these various methods the specific stream discharge was higher for the catchment outlet than for the gauging station at the upper third of the catchment and it varied seasonally from less than 5 ls 1 km 2 during summer months and up to 60 ls 1 km 2 during winter events the increase in streamflow was mainly due to tile drainage discharge in the upper reaches 80 while groundwater discharge was most important in the lower reaches 60 this spatial variation was controlled by topography geology regional groundwater flow pattern and anthropogenic tile drainage groundwater discharge estimates obtained using seepage meters at the lower reaches were about the double of those at the upper reaches while the difference between measurements taken in april and those taken in august was insignificant however these estimates had large 95 confidence intervals even though the streambed deposits appear to be homogeneous the groundwater discharge estimates obtained using detailed differential streamflow gauging were an order of magnitude larger than the estimates obtained using seepage meters this is attributed to the partitioning of groundwater discharge into streambed seepage and bank seepage or that too few seepage meter measurements were taken to fully account for the spatial variability of streambed seepage furthermore the estimates obtained using detailed differential streamflow gauging were half of those obtained using hydrograph separation which was attributed to errors associated with the assumption that baseflow represents groundwater discharge to the stream to this end we used a method which is referred to as differential streamflow gauging over time to extract the tile drainage discharge from the streamflow hydrograph a more reliable groundwater discharge estimate was thereby obtained moreover we developed a novel method to calculate the uncertainty on groundwater discharge estimates obtained using hydrograph separation the overall conclusion is that the relative importance of different flow paths for discharging groundwater to a lowland alluvial stream varied between short reaches 0 5 1 5 km and between april and august these findings support the idea that groundwater and surface water interaction even in lowland alluvial catchments is spatially and temporally variable furthermore the groundwater discharge estimates were dependent on the spatial scale of the investigation method thus the use of more than one method at a site will help to obtain a reliable estimate of groundwater discharge from the other discharge components to the stream such as tile drainage discharge acknowledgements the manuscript was improved by review from donald rosenberry and three

7103,to improve the behavioural realism of a water resource model this study coupled hydrologic modelling with stated preference research thereby incorporating an empirical estimate of behavioural parameters to represent residents landscape decisions in an urban environment the stated preference data came from a discrete choice experiment in which residents were asked to choose among several possible lawn plots varying in size turf variety and aesthetic qualities the discrete choice experiment also included subsidies for lawn replacement and information about estimated water use and watering costs for each lawn choice we prepared a behavioural model utilizing coefficients from a mixed logit model estimated from the stated preference data and then coupled it with a water resources model of the okanagan basin using the water evaluation and planning system we then conducted a scenario analysis using the coupled socio hydrological model to simulate the extent to which residents would adopt alternative lawns under varying incentives and subsequently computed corresponding changes in water demand the results indicate that proposing alternative lawn configurations to residents and providing site specific information about the potential for reduced watering costs along with a small subsidy could lead to considerable reduction of outdoor water use through voluntary adoption under a scenario in which the attributes of the suggested lawn configuration matched those most preferred by residents in the choice experiment the suggested configuration was widely adopted in the okanagan but a scenario with a more extreme water conserving lawn configuration reduced overall outdoor water use by a greater amount even though the configuration was adopted by a smaller percentage of residents this study illustrates the relationship between lawn preferences and water use and supports calls to integrate hydrological and social modelling in order to capture the complex interactions between human behaviour and water use keywords coupled socio hydrological model socio ecological systems water resource models consumer stated preferences water supply and demand water policymaking 1 introduction water resource planning increasingly recognizes that human and ecological systems are complex adaptive systems characterized by cross scale interactions and high uncertainty folke et al 2005 levin 1998 mitchell et al 2012 accordingly scholars have called for new research on the development of coupled socio ecological models which represent human interactions with water resource systems for example sivapalan et al 2012 argue for a new science of socio hydrology to explore how coupled human water systems co evolve socio hydrology can generate quantitative descriptions of system behaviour for modelling and forecasting possible future states carey et al 2014 propose a framework for hydro social modelling to capture the human variables critical to hydrological modelling troy et al 2015 explore the development of socio hydrologic modelling noting that it is still unclear whether existing examples of coupled human water models reflect an over emphasis on calibrated data or an accurate representation of known human water relationships the recognition of human water interconnections has also fostered research on hydro ecological modelling akter et al 2014 hydro economic modelling boehlert and jaeger 2010 hurd and coonrod 2012 kragt et al 2011 socio economic tools applied to water systems koundouri et al 2015 socio hydrosystems lanini et al 2004 and applications of socio hydrology di baldassarre et al 2013 elshafei et al 2014 while the constructs for socio hydrological modelling have been studied in various forms the parameterization of human behaviour in water resource models remains relatively rare this lack of attention prompts for investigation into approaches for the integration of socio economic research with hydrological models in order to simulate the interactions of human systems with hydrological systems address water needs for society and ecosystems and represent the dynamic nature of water demand carey et al 2014 in our research we developed a socially coupled water resource model for residential landscapes in the okanagan basin of british columbia canada the model demonstrates the effects that residents preferences concerning their lawns under various scenarios will have on water use the coupled socio hydrological model the okanagan coupled model is designed for use as a decision support tool to inform policies for managing water demand in the okanagan basin the model uses the water evaluation and planning system weap a water management and allocation system developed by raskin et al 1992 and the stockholm environment institute and a discrete choice model derived from a discrete choice experiment to examine the influence of residential landscape choices on regional water supplies we applied the okanagan coupled model in a subwatershed within the okanagan basin for alternative lawn scenarios to investigate changes in water demand in this paper we describe the process we developed for coupling the discrete choice model with weap and the resulting information provided to decision makers to our knowledge this paper presents the first application of a discrete choice model being fully coupled with a water resource model moving beyond the simple linking of outputs from separated models or frameworks the results illustrate how the okanagan coupled model provides water demand simulations based on hydrological and behavioural modelling including empirical evidence of the preferences of water users allowing for more informed policymaking this paper is organized as follows an overview of the study area is given in the remainder of section 1 section 2 discusses the parameterization of the weap software with water supply and demand data in the okanagan basin we include a description of the theory and calculations underlying the preference data and how the data were used to estimate the behavioural parameters in the okanagan coupled model in section 3 we demonstrate how the okanagan coupled model can be used for behaviourally realistic scenario analysis section 4 provides a discussion of the results and assesses the usefulness of the approach 1 1 study area the okanagan basin covers 8046 km2 in british columbia canada fig 1 and is unique in that it has the highest ratio of population to annual surface water yields of any basin in canada statistics canada 2010 the semi arid okanagan basin has a small water catchment receives an annual average of only 300 mm of precipitation in the lower basin analogous to other semi arid regions like the southwest united states and parts of australia and is undergoing rapid population growth in a changing climate cohen et al 2004 merritt et al 2003 taylor and barton 2004 surface water is major supply source meeting 67 of the region s water demand summit environmental 2010a historically water managers have mainly used surface water storage to meet growing water demand mcneill 2004 however future scenario modelling suggests that existing surface water storage systems will be unable to meet municipal and instream flow needs by 2050 harma et al 2012 to study these issues in 2007 the okanagan basin water board a regional water governance body whose board is comprised of local governments water suppliers and first nations initiated the development of two regional planning models for water and land use in the region the first the okanagan water demand model estimated water needs for residential agricultural and industrial and commercial uses based on land survey data gis and cadastral mapping of crop types including turfgrass irrigation system types soil properties and climatic data summit environmental 2010b the second model the okanagan water accounting model owam estimated natural streamflows and the effects of water storage and extractions on streamflows and lake levels in the okanagan basin dhi water and environment 2010 neither of these models included a coupled social component these models did however provide the hydrologic basis for our study as well as a foundation for considering water management strategies and policies in the okanagan basin in 2010 the okanagan basin water board had initiated a new phase of work to increase the availability of data refine modelling tools and improve public consultation in policy development this timing presented a window of opportunity to evaluate methods for increasing the predictive capacity of water resource models of the okanagan basin by including a representation of water user behaviour a key point of interest for water providers in the okanagan basin is the impact population growth will have on water supplies as rural landscapes transition to residential land uses the population of the okanagan basin grew by 46 during the period 1990 2010 from 235 793 to 345 831 bcstats n d accompanying this growth was the expansion of single family residential development with large lawns that require more water to maintain compared to higher density developments maurer 2010 irrigating these residential lawns accounts for 24 of all water use in the okanagan basin the second largest use of water after agricultural irrigation summit environmental 2010a reoccurring droughts have had a moderate impact on water conservation attitudes suggesting residents are open to consider options for reducing outdoor water use brandes and kriwoken 2006 conrad 2012a unfortunately in choosing options for managing water use water managers often have little empirical information about the preferences of water users concerning these options instead water managers often formulate strategies based on their own uncertain and sometimes inaccurate assumptions about the perceptions and preferences of water users therefore predicting how residential consumers will respond to water demand management strategies and policies targeting residential landscapes is critical in decision making about water management in the okanagan 2 the okanagan coupled model in addition to the previously mentioned weap there exist many possible basin wide water modelling systems including ribasim hydraulics 2004 mike basin dhi water and environment 2009 aquatool andreu et al 1996 and modsim labadie 1995 we selected weap as the modelling platform because of its broad use as a decision support tool and because the okanagan basin water board was planning to adopt weap as a water management tool also weap is a platform that provides flexibility in structuring water demand data by various measures of social and economic activities e g water use rates per household water use rates number of households with lawns yates et al 2005 the weap platform is a water management and allocation tool that has a graphical user interface to guide model parameterization weap uses a mass balance accounting framework to calculate a monthly water balance of flows changes in reservoir and groundwater storages and water supply allocations to water demands and outflows yates et al 2005 weap uses a linear programming heuristics approach to consider demand priorities and supply preferences to simulate both natural processes and human influences key assumptions may be built into the accounting to represent policies costs and other factors that affect demand supply and the overall hydrologic cycle a scenario feature allows the user to explore the effect of changes in climate and water management strategies on water systems making weap well suited for evaluating human influences on water systems and informing water policymaking yates et al 2005 as a decision support tool weap has been used to explore human water interactions in a number of case studies swiech et al 2012 for example analyzed the impacts of a reservoir for improved agricultural production in the yarabamba region peru with a weap model application in another weap modelling application for benin höllermann et al 2010 applied different scenarios of socio economic development and climate change to review benin s future water situation through 2025 bhave et al 2014 used weap to model the effect of stakeholder prioritized climate change adaptation options for the kangsabati river catchment in india hellegers et al 2013 used weap to model trade offs between water supply and demand to examine deficits against climate change scenarios in iran morocco and saudi arabia recently safavi et al 2015 used expert knowledge to prepare underlying data in a river basin model using weap for the zayandehrud river basin weap has also been previously used to examine water supply and demand in the okanagan basin harma et al 2012 utilized weap to investigate future climate scenarios in unregulated and reservoir supported streams that supply the district of peachland in the okanagan after the initiation of our research weap was selected by the okanagan basin water board as a platform for investigating the effects of the prior appropriation principle used in the british columbia water licensing system summit environmental 2013 the resulting model examines connected water use between communities and is being used as a decision support tool for regional drought response plans and new water licensing decisions this okanagan hydrologic connectivity model provided the hydrological structure e g rivers reservoirs lakes for preparing the okanagan coupled model and is described in detail in summit environmental 2013 the conceptual framework for the okanagan coupled model is shown in fig 2 the model consists of a discrete choice model and a hydrological representation of a water resource system a monthly time step was used to prepare water supply and demand data for the known system 2010 to couple stated preference data and to prepare future scenarios for the analysis period 2011 2015 2 1 stated preference data and the discrete choice model to prepare the behavioural component of the okanagan coupled model we used stated preference data from the discrete choice experiment in conrad et al 2018 to estimate the choices that would be made by residents with regard to landscaping features under various conditions stated preference data refer to observations that are derived from survey data in which respondents express what their choice would be in a hypothetical scenario whereas revealed preference data come from observations of actual behaviour for example conrad et al 2018 presented six sets of three alternative lawns fig 3 with varying attribute levels table 1 two of the lawns in each set were hypothetical and one was based on the respondent s description of his or her own lawn for each choice set the respondent was asked to choose their preferred lawn we chose to use stated preference data rather than revealed preference data for two reasons first comprehensive data on lawn configurations and resultant water use or resident response to measures aimed at reducing the size of residential lawns or reducing water use e g subsidies education lawn audits are not readily available in the okanagan region second revealed preference data may be insufficient to represent the impact of policies that have not been previously attempted or that drive water use behaviour beyond historic limits in the remainder of this section we discuss the underpinnings of the discrete choice model i e the mixed logit model utilized in preparing the okanagan coupled model a detailed discussion of the discrete choice experiment and resulting mixed logit model is provided in conrad et al 2018 and a complete description of the underlying survey with full questionnaire responses can be found in conrad 2012a the analysis of data derived from the discrete choice experiment is grounded in lancaster s attribute theory of value and consumer choice lancaster 1966 and has an econometric basis in random utility theory mcfadden 1974 following lancaster we assume that residents derive satisfaction from the features or attributes that constitute the lawn alternatives available to them choices can then be modeled considering additive separability as a function of the sum of the utility or value residents obtain from each of the attributes of the lawn alternatives given mcfadden 1974 train 2009 the overall utility u ij an individual i gains by choosing alternative j consists of an observable or deterministic v ij component and an unobservable or stochastic ε ij component of utility 1 u ij v ij ε ij in conrad et al 2018 individuals were also asked to describe their existing lawn conditions which were then included in the set of alternatives as an existing lawn or status quo alternative these status quo sq conditions can be expressed as predictors of individual choice representing case specific values that influence the probability an individual selects an alternative vermunt and magidson 2005 expressing the probability assuming the error terms are identically and independently distributed with a weibull distribution that an individual i selects lawn alternative j at replication t given attribute values z it att and predictor values z it pre for all responses y it is given

2018 j 1 j β j con 0 and j 1 j β jq pre 0 for 1 q q the above form of the conditional logit model assumes that there are no similarities among the alternatives the independence of irrelevant alternatives assumption which can be concerning as it does not account for unobserved preference heterogeneity over the sample to relax the iia assumption and examine preference heterogeneity conrad et al 2018 prepared a mixed logit also called random parameters or error components logit model which using computer estimation allows each coefficient β to vary randomly across respondents we refer to detailed specification of the mixed logit model in literature mcfadden and train 2000 revelt and train 1998 to prepare the mixed logit model conrad et al 2018 first estimated a conditional logit model following a step wise process in which they reviewed log likelihood ll bic bayesian information criterion and aic akaike information criterion criteria in selecting the most parsimonious model wald statistics aided their consideration on whether to retain individual attributes and z scores were used to determine the significance of individual attribute levels to the best fit most parsimonious design attribute model they added predictor values representing sq conditions all sq variables from responses obtained for each respondent were effects coded using identical coding as the corresponding design attribute table 1 to account for reference levels in each alternative 1 careful consideration of coding is needed when including sq levels and while conrad et al 2018 includes sq conditions identical and within the bounds of their experimental design these conditions may not always be present cooper et al 2011 and barton and bergland 2010 discuss coding approaches when sq conditions do not align with the choice design 1 conrad et al 2018 then prepared a mixed logit variant of the final conditional logit model to provide a comparative estimate of random effects and found that the mixed logit model with predictor coefficients sq variables was the best fit model as it had the lowest bic aic and ll statistics among the stable models given that calculating the probability of choice using ratios of random parameters is particularly challenging to estimate hensher et al 2015 train 2009 we fixed those random parameters wcost subsidy sq of total landscape sq variety of turf and sq appearance during peak of summer not shown to significantly deviate from the mean i e do not vary greatly in the population in the best fit mixed logit model in conrad et al 2018 and prepared revised coefficients following the model estimation methodology described in conrad et al 2018 that is we used stata 12 1 and the mixlogit command programmed for stata by hole 2007 to estimate normally distributed random parameter effects using simulation based on 1000 halton sequences for the integration haan and uhlendorff 2006 it is this revised mixed logit model that provides the framework for estimating choices and including behavioural data in the okanagan coupled model model coefficients for the choice model component of the okanagan coupled model are presented in table 2 the negative coefficient for the alternative specific constant specifies an overall preference for existing lawns in residential landscapes this preference is however refined by the preferences individuals have for the conditions describing their existing lawn represented by sq predictors 2 2 lawn watering cost calculations conrad et al 2018 included individual calculations for water use and watering cost for each lawn alternative presented and watering cost was significant in residents choice of lawn alternative accordingly we included estimates for watering cost in the coupled model as a function of water pricing and water use with the following considerations first the amount of water required mm of water per month for maintaining a healthy lawn varies during the yearly watering period april october and was derived from city of kelowna lawn irrigation guidelines as shown in table 3 traditional varieties of turfgrass require more irrigation than water conserving varieties to maintain a green appearance and artificial lawns require no irrigation second the amount of water required is a factor of the size of the property and the percentage of turfgrass that covers the landscapable areas of the property third it is expected that the appearance of the lawn during the summer is an indicator of the amount of lawn irrigation required where very green lawns suggest residents will use more water than those residents who maintain a mostly green lawn residents who allow their lawn to turn brown during the peak of summer will likely use even less water total water use w use in m3 for lawn irrigation is then the product of water needed need in each month m in mm of water during the watering period for each variety of turfgrass tg property size in m2 the of turfgrass in each yard and a scaling factor l a determined from the appearance of the lawn l a very green 1 15 mostly green 1 00 more green than brown 0 95 more brown than green 75 set at

lawn watering cost is calculated on a monthly basis according to the city of kelowna residential water rates the city of kelowna water utility assigns prices for residential water use on a four tiered pricing structure described in table 4 lawn watering cost is derived from the charges residents pay for the volume of water used w use during a monthly billing cycle above the base amount of water used for indoor domestic uses d an average of 19 m3 per month in the city of kelowna to determine the additional charges residents pay to irrigate their lawn total water used indoor and outdoor and the cost for this water is calculated and then reduced by the price residents would pay for their base indoor water use as follows total household water use wh use in a given month m allocated to the price of water wp in tier t provides an estimate of total household water cost c total accordingly 6 wh use m w use m d m 7 c total m wh use m wp t 1 i f wh use m 30 30 wp t 1 wh use m 30 wp t 2 i f

lakes and four points of interest on the okanagan river summit environmental 2013 in our study we limited the system modelling to those surface water sources that are directly involved in the supply and delivery of water to residents characterized by the stated preference data the okanagan coupled model hydrological system represents the okanagan lake okanagan river mission creek hydraulic creek and the major catchments where extractions and upland reservoirs are present e g mccollogh lake long meadow lake fig 4 all other stream catchments and residual areas were accounted for as lumped inputs to a mainstem lake or river segment in order to balance supply and demand in the region the physical properties and operational rules as well as flow data for each mainstem river in the okanagan coupled model were constructed from several data sets first data extracted from owam dhi water and environment 2010 provided natural streamflow data for each water intake at upland reservoir locations and net streamflow outlets of watersheds not explicitly modeled a minimum flow requirement was included for mission creek to satisfy instream flow requirements for fish and habitat specified by the okanagan fish water management tool and the lake operating plan hyatt et al 2009 elevation curves for the mainstem lakes reservoir operation rules and physical descriptions e g maximum storage capacity assumed initial storage maximum hydraulic outflow net evaporation monthly target elevations were based on parameters obtained from the okanagan hydrologic connectivity model summit environmental 2013 finally net evaporation from each mainstem lake and reservoir was estimated from potential evapotranspiration and precipitation data from environment canada prepared for the okanagan water supply and demand project summit environmental 2009 2 4 water demand data water demand data were prepared for each of the demand sites represented in fig 4 from three data sources first water utility data from the city of kelowna provided demand profiles for the categories single family indoor and outdoor industrial and commercial multi family and strata parks and net uncategorized water use metered data from the southeast kelowna irrigation district provided demand profiles segregated into agriculture domestic base load and sessional water use i e outdoor irrigation industrial and commercial and net uncategorized water use the remaining water demand nodes were prepared from data extracts from the okanagan water demand model summit environmental 2010b in this paper we focus on single family outdoor water demand in the city of kelowna represented in table 5 and shown as cok single family outdoor in fig 4 leaving other demand nodes representing indoor commercial and agricultural and other water uses unmodified outdoor water use currently represents 20 3 of overall water use in the city of kelowna water service area across the 13 506 single family households served outdoor water use was annualized in the model at 2 97 million m3 yr lawn irrigation accounts for almost all outdoor water use in single family households in the city of kelowna 2009 so non irrigation contributions to outdoor water use were assumed to be negligible and not included in the study estimating changes in outdoor water demand for households in the city of kelowna water utility service area in response to residents switching to proposed new lawn alternatives is a function of combining the probability for choices provided by the mixed logit model with the water use data

sq water and h waterj 2 5 model verification the objective of model verification was to verify the hydrological components of the okanagan coupled model and test its parameterization against the streamflow and lake level data extracted from owam for the base year 2010 owam data were derived from a detailed hydrologic model of the okanagan basin developed in the mike she integrated watershed modelling system dhi water and environment 2010 owam provided a sophisticated hydrological representation of the okanagan basin but owam calculated water demand from changes in streamflows and reservoir levels whereas in the okanagan coupled model we estimated water demand by water service area and category i e city of kelowna outdoor water use we compared net flows of the okanagan coupled model with the net flows calculated by owam at outlets of mission creek hydraulic creek and grouse creek we also compared observed water storage in the reservoirs mccollugh lake browne lake and okanagan lake table 6 lists the results of comparing the baseline scenario with owam results for each tributary and waterbody we calculated the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient r2 nash and sutcliffe 1970 and correlation r matching was good for mission creek r2 0 95 and grouse creek r2 0 89 and satisfactory for hydraulic creek r2 0 75 matching was also satisfactory for okanagan lake r2 0 73 but less satisfactory for browne lake r2 0 67 and mccollugh lake r2 0 22 low r2 results for mccollugh lake and browne lake were not surprising due to differences in water demand data sets between the okanagan coupled model and owam for these water bodies however these differences do not impact observed levels for the okanagan lake or streamflows in other tributaries suggesting the hydrological components of the okanagan coupled model adequately represent hydrological conditions in the basin overall we consider the validated model suitable for the region of study in the okanagan basin and that it may reasonably be used for exploring changes in water demand due to changes in residential landscapes 3 scenario analysis using the okanagan coupled model the mixed logit model presented in table 2 provides a means to evaluate the preferences of residents of the city of kelowna for attributes of residential lawns subsidies turfgrass variety the percentage of turfgrass in each yard the appearance of the lawn during the peak of summer and the cost of water required to maintain that lawn all influence whether a homeowner would likely choose to make alterations to their residential landscape determining how residential preferences for lawn attributes translate to changes in water use requires further examination due to the contributory effect each attribute has on water use turfgrass variety the percentage of turfgrass in each yard and the appearance of the lawn during the peak of summer all contribute to the amount of water required to maintain residential lawns the water savings anticipated from a policy targeted at lawn size reduction would therefore be uncertain until the contributing effects other attributes had on overall water use were simulated the okanagan coupled model framework allows for these contributory effects to be included in the analysis and consideration of landscape changes the mixed logit model in the okanagan coupled model operates as an embedded calculation so that changes in attribute levels for lawn alternatives and the subsequent effect on residential landscaping choices are processed in weap automatically we coded the coefficients for the attributes listed in table 2 as key assumptions in the coupled model allowing us to simulate changes in residential outdoor water use under various scenarios we coded all coefficients listed in table 2 to provide consistency with conrad et al 2018 and so each attribute would be included in the ratio of coefficients in eq 9 in addition we coded the relationships defining water use variation in response to lawn attributes affecting residential landscapes as user defined functions in weap in the weap scenario explorer user interface we programmed the ability to adjust the attributes for both the lawn alternative and sq conditions after programming the levels for each attribute can be changed and the okanagan coupled model responds by re calculating watering cost and the likelihood of residents choices under any of the scenarios adjusted water demand is similarly calculated and processed by weap and the corresponding changes in the hydrological system presented to the model user taken together the modelling framework was prepared to provide flexibility to the user to define scenarios that affect the water use demands of the system according to characteristics of the region and the residential landscape options being considered by decision makers the input of different lawn alternatives and current lawn conditions provides over 9216 2 calculated as new lawn size 4 levels x new lawn variety 3 levels x new law appearance 4 levels x new lawn subsidy 4 levels x current lawn size 4 levels x current lawn variety 3 levels x current lawn appearance 4 levels 2 possible configurations to be studied analyzing all these scenarios would be impractical and would not necessarily inform the policy options being considered to address water use for single family residential lawns in the city of kelowna for the preparation of this paper we focused on three scenarios to demonstrate the potential of the okanagan coupled model in each case starting with specified sq conditions designed to represent the current lawn conditions and lawn preferences of single family residents in the city of kelowna conrad 2012b indicates that 62 2 of single family households in the city of kelowna reside on averaged sized properties greater than 0 15 acres 0 061 ha and less than 0 25 acres 0 103 ha in area traditional varieties of turfgrass kentucky blue grass ryegrass comprise a substantial majority 95 5 of the residents lawns and these lawns cover approximately 50 37 3 or 75 38 1 of the landscapeable area of their property conrad 2012b further more than 85 of the residents irrigate their lawns to be either mostly green or more green than brown during the peak of summer conrad 2012b following these findings we prepared two sq variants labelled sq50 representing landscapes with 50 turf mostly green appearance traditional turf varieties and average sized properties with a summer watering cost of 130 and sq75 representing landscapes with 75 turf mostly green appearance traditional turf varieties and average sized properties with a summer watering cost of 220 to use in each of the scenarios as representing existing lawn conditions these sq variants were used throughout the scenario analysis effectively representing segments defined by the current landscape situation of the residents with the parameters of the okanagan coupled model prepared empirically we can now demonstrate the use of the model by simulating the adoption rate of lawn alternatives and corresponding changes in water use in response to hypothetical polices aimed at reducing outdoor water use we examine adoption rates for a 5 year period following the year 2010 for three scenarios the first scenario is a baseline case in which existing lawn attributes are maintained throughout the simulation period in both of the other scenarios it is assumed that water managers propose to residents that they change their lawns to a specified alternative configuration i e a renovated lawn from existing to the alternative that would conserve water use to encourage the voluntary change information is provided about the reduced watering costs available with the alternative water conserving configuration together with a small subsidy for making the change subsidy levels were defined in conrad et al 2018 to provide a realistic decision context according to funds available to city of kelowna water managers so results would more accurately represent real world behaviour and improve the validity of the experiment measures hainmueller et al 2015 the scenarios and their parameters are listed in table 7 and are described below a baseline scenario in which existing lawn attributes remain unchanged throughout the simulation period a preferred lawn scenario in which water managers propose a lawn alternative that matches the lawn attributes most preferred by residents in the choice experiment based on the estimated coefficients set out in table 2 presenting residential landscapes with lawns that cover 50 of the landscapeable area use a water conserving turfgrass variety and are mostly green in appearance during the peak of summer with a flat subsidy of 250 for switching to the proposed lawn alternative the summer watering cost for this alternative would be 90 for average sized properties an extreme water conserving scenario in which water managers propose a lawn alternative that significantly reduces the fraction of turfgrass in residential landscapes and the subsequent water needed to maintain these lawns presenting residential landscapes with lawns that cover 25 of the landscapeable area use a water conserving turfgrass variety and are more brown than green in appearance during the peak of summer with a flat subsidy of 125 for switching to the proposed lawn alternative the summer watering cost for this alternative would be 30 for average sized properties for each scenario we assumed a 5 year s shaped logistic adoption curve of alternative lawns and evaluated the status of water allocations to the cok single family outdoor water demand node site shown in fig 4 during each monthly time step a stochastic factor representing a random standard deviation of up to 5 from the mean was applied to the water demand calculation to induce variability and further create behavioural realism in each scenario 3 see bartholomew 1967 for a discussion of stochastic models of social systems 3 in describing the scenario results below we review the proportion of households adopting the proposed lawn alternative i e market share and compare outdoor water demand in each scenario to the baseline scenario deriving market shares for lawn alternatives affecting water demand calculations requires utilizing both the mean coefficient and standard deviation sd distributions for random parameters to account for the heterogeneity represented in the mixed logit model table 2 for each scenario we derived market share estimates using the simulation approach described in hu et al 2005 and hensher and greene 2003 two rounds of simulation were conducted yielding vectors representing market share distribution densities for each scenario an initial parameter simulation prepared r draws from a multivariate normal distribution characterized by the mixed logit model s mean parameters and covariance from simulated maximum likelihood for each random parameter a subsequent coefficient simulation was completed by taking s draws from the normal distribution defined by the mean coefficient and standard deviation from each of the r draws of the parameter simulation r vectors of size s are thus generated for each random parameter market shares were then calculated together with fixed coefficients for the resulting r vectors point estimates were then calculated using the mean of mean approach hu et al 2005 that is we took the mean of the s estimates of market shares from each of the r vectors 2000 simulation draws were run for the preferred lawn and extreme water conserving scenarios to identify the mean and standard deviations reported in presenting the results we return to the main aim of the paper which is to demonstrate an empirical method for incorporating human behaviour in a water resource model figs 5 7 present the results of the simulations using the okanagan coupled model and show the evolution in the rate of change in single family landscapes over time to different lawn alternatives mean and standard deviations of market shares are presented in fig 5 however for ease of interpretation only mean results are shown in figs 6 and 7 the preferred lawn scenario presents a 39 6 sd 6 9 market share of the lawn alternative for sq50 configurations and a 83 8 sd 4 0 market share for sq75 configurations while the extreme water conserving scenario results in a 29 3 sd 4 9 market share of the lawn alternative presented for sq50 configurations and 65 0 sd 4 5 market share for sq75 configurations although market shares for alternative lawns are higher for the preferred lawn scenario than for the extreme water conserving scenario for both sq50 and sq75 configurations the ultimate water use savings under each scenario depend on how much water is used under the new conditions fig 6 illustrates that despite the larger adoption rate by residents under the preferred lawn scenario simulated savings in water use are greater for the extreme water conserving scenario at the end of the simulation period 2015 the extreme water conserving scenario results in mean water use savings of 23 9 over the baseline for sq50 configurations and 44 0 for sq75 configurations the preferred lawn scenario results in mean water use savings of 8 9 over the baseline for sq50 configurations and 16 2 for sq75 configurations under either scenario the sq configuration substantially influences the amount of achievable water use savings fig 7 illustrates the relative effect of sq50 and sq75 status quo configurations on simulated single family outdoor water demand for the extreme water conserving and preferred lawn scenarios at the end of the simulation period alternative lawns represented in the preferred lawn scenario account for 34 2 mean of total water demand for sq50 configurations and 80 5 mean of total water demand for sq75 configurations and alternative lawns represented in the extreme water conserving scenario account for 10 0 mean of total water demand for sq50 configurations and 36 1 mean of total water demand for sq75 configurations so again while adoption of the proposed lawn alternative is greatest under the preferred lawn scenario the extreme water conserving scenario achieves greater outdoor water savings with alternative lawns accounting for a smaller proportion of total outdoor water demand under this scenario 4 summary and conclusion in this paper we presented a coupled socio hydrological model that contains an explicit representation of the hydrology in the okanagan basin and a model of simulated human behaviour to indicate how water users would respond to proposed lawn alternatives that affect water demanded from regional water sources this approach contributes to the call by troy et al 2015 for creative proxies of human behaviour that lead to more robust ways of parameterizing models stated preference data and discrete choice models may represent one such proxy as they supply information about relationships between the characteristics of the choices water users make and the probability of those choices being made under differing scenarios we demonstrated how the coupled socio hydrological modelling framework could be used to simulate responses by individuals to proposed lawn alternatives for residential landscapes a mixed logit model was coupled with the weap system to simulate behavioural responses by residents in the study area and to estimate changes in outdoor water use the resultant okanagan coupled model provides decision makers with increased knowledge about residents preferences and intended choices which should enable managers to make more informed decisions when designing water demand policies we agree with bhave et al 2014 that a socially informed water resources model is a viable tool for water policymaking further the ability to work through a number of scenarios in a short period of time allows for the possible use of the okanagan coupled model in decision making sessions among water managers water utilities residents and other stakeholders to simulate the complex relationship between water users and the hydrological system and demonstrate how behaviour affects water use demand in the okanagan basin the use of a mixed logit model with random parameters increases the explanatory power of the okanagan coupled model through the mixed logit model s representation of preference heterogeneity in the population but at a cost of increased modelling complexity estimating market shares with random parameters required additional simulation which could limit its application in water management modeling frameworks lacking computational capacity to accommodate parameter distributions 4 in addition to computational complexity the design and parameterization of mixed logit models require specific econometric expertise that may not be readily available among staff available to water managers 4 hensher and greene 2003 alternatively discuss using only the mean coefficient and standard deviation in choice estimates avoiding the need for simulation further it may also be desirable to utilize a fixed parameter model e g conditional logit model with its advantages in computational efficiency and ease in obtaining probability expressions in cases where mixed logit models fail to converge with small data sets hensher et al 2005 however additional investigation is required to determine whether excluding the information provided in the distribution of random parameters provides for comparable estimates to the more complex simulation modelling method described in this paper in preparing the scenarios we set sq conditions to illustrate the potential of the model to provide a comparison of possible scenario conditions that is we assumed homogeneity in the sq conditions presented in each scenario across all single family residents in the city of kelowna water service area to correspond with the single node water demand data available although these sq configurations closely approximate residential landscapes across the city of kelowna they do not fully represent the heterogeneity of these landscapes and we caution readers to bear this in mind when considering the results future application of the okanagan coupled model may include its refinement to more fully represent the heterogeneity of existing lawns to do so will require segmenting water demand nodes by combinations of lawn features e g lawn size lawn variety and lawn appearances and property sizes collecting water demand data on these groups and possible refinement of model parameters to represent these groups an important message for water managers is that under both the extreme water conserving and preferred lawn scenarios and both sq configurations the modelling results indicate that considerable savings in total water use may be attained by proposing the alternative lawn configuration to residents and providing site specific information about the potential for reduced watering costs along with a small subsidy city of kelowna domestic households are metered and residents receive water bills and in an earlier survey we noted that residents expressed limited knowledge of the water required along with the cost of water to irrigate their lawns conrad 2012b we further noted that while residents expressed a desire to reduce the size of their lawns they also wanted for more information on landscape water requirements before making decisions conrad 2012b as noted by one anonymous reviewer the application of a small subsidy compared to the cost of replacing or reducing the amount of turfgrass in a residential landscape contrasts with studies that highlight the need to provide substantial subsidies to motivate behaviour however while conservation attitudes are not as prevalent in the okanagan as those found in australia belzile 2011 we suspect that the desire of residents to reduce outdoor water use may influence residents choice to convert their landscapes in the absence of higher subsidies we note that economic studies have shown that subsidy requirements as a proportion of the adoption costs vary depending on the attitudes and preferences of individuals lienhoop and brouwer 2015 tapsuwan et al 2014 the decision to convert or change watering behaviour is highly intertwined with conservation mindsets and will also likely be weighed against other factors such as conversion costs or impacts on lawn maintenance further research is needed to determine whether residents stated preferences will translate into real behaviour in these circumstances but the possibility could be tested with a pilot program aimed at residents with larger proportions of turf in their landscapes results from this program could be used to enhance the response of the behavioural component of the model by combining revealed and stated preference data adamowicz et al 1994 the modelling results indicate that the extreme water conserving scenario would result in the greatest reductions in outdoor water use for residents with either sq50 or sq75 configurations however this scenario presents an ambitious lawn alternative that reduces residential lawn sizes to 25 of the total landscapable area and a more brown than green lawn appearance of which reducing lawn sizes contributes most to overall water savings water policy makers could use the okanagan coupled model to assess the trade offs between designing policies to encourage the maximum reduction in water demand versus aligning policies with the preferences of a larger proportion of residents by modifying the extreme water conserving scenario to include some of the more widely preferred lawn attributes and then evaluating the overall changes in water use for example they might investigate the effect of lawns appearing mostly green during the summer or incorporating other combinations of lawn sizes and turfgrass varieties they might also investigate the effect of increasing water pricing across all residents or on certain sq configurations the studied scenario alternatives and sq50 and sq75 configurations represent just a small subset of the more than 9000 possible configurations that remain available to policy makers our findings support calls to integrate hydrology and social sciences in order to fully model the complex interactions between watershed dynamics and human behaviour braden et al 2009 carey et al 2014 troy et al 2015 wiek and larson 2012 our use of a discrete choice model presents just one approach for estimating residential water demand and arbués et al 2003 provides a description of many others further research should explore the application of discrete choice models to estimate additional social parameters affecting water demand in water resource models this could include investigations into the adoption of water efficient technology smart water metering and other residential information feedbacks more sophisticated subsidy programs and programs targeting water use in

7103,to improve the behavioural realism of a water resource model this study coupled hydrologic modelling with stated preference research thereby incorporating an empirical estimate of behavioural parameters to represent residents landscape decisions in an urban environment the stated preference data came from a discrete choice experiment in which residents were asked to choose among several possible lawn plots varying in size turf variety and aesthetic qualities the discrete choice experiment also included subsidies for lawn replacement and information about estimated water use and watering costs for each lawn choice we prepared a behavioural model utilizing coefficients from a mixed logit model estimated from the stated preference data and then coupled it with a water resources model of the okanagan basin using the water evaluation and planning system we then conducted a scenario analysis using the coupled socio hydrological model to simulate the extent to which residents would adopt alternative lawns under varying incentives and subsequently computed corresponding changes in water demand the results indicate that proposing alternative lawn configurations to residents and providing site specific information about the potential for reduced watering costs along with a small subsidy could lead to considerable reduction of outdoor water use through voluntary adoption under a scenario in which the attributes of the suggested lawn configuration matched those most preferred by residents in the choice experiment the suggested configuration was widely adopted in the okanagan but a scenario with a more extreme water conserving lawn configuration reduced overall outdoor water use by a greater amount even though the configuration was adopted by a smaller percentage of residents this study illustrates the relationship between lawn preferences and water use and supports calls to integrate hydrological and social modelling in order to capture the complex interactions between human behaviour and water use keywords coupled socio hydrological model socio ecological systems water resource models consumer stated preferences water supply and demand water policymaking 1 introduction water resource planning increasingly recognizes that human and ecological systems are complex adaptive systems characterized by cross scale interactions and high uncertainty folke et al 2005 levin 1998 mitchell et al 2012 accordingly scholars have called for new research on the development of coupled socio ecological models which represent human interactions with water resource systems for example sivapalan et al 2012 argue for a new science of socio hydrology to explore how coupled human water systems co evolve socio hydrology can generate quantitative descriptions of system behaviour for modelling and forecasting possible future states carey et al 2014 propose a framework for hydro social modelling to capture the human variables critical to hydrological modelling troy et al 2015 explore the development of socio hydrologic modelling noting that it is still unclear whether existing examples of coupled human water models reflect an over emphasis on calibrated data or an accurate representation of known human water relationships the recognition of human water interconnections has also fostered research on hydro ecological modelling akter et al 2014 hydro economic modelling boehlert and jaeger 2010 hurd and coonrod 2012 kragt et al 2011 socio economic tools applied to water systems koundouri et al 2015 socio hydrosystems lanini et al 2004 and applications of socio hydrology di baldassarre et al 2013 elshafei et al 2014 while the constructs for socio hydrological modelling have been studied in various forms the parameterization of human behaviour in water resource models remains relatively rare this lack of attention prompts for investigation into approaches for the integration of socio economic research with hydrological models in order to simulate the interactions of human systems with hydrological systems address water needs for society and ecosystems and represent the dynamic nature of water demand carey et al 2014 in our research we developed a socially coupled water resource model for residential landscapes in the okanagan basin of british columbia canada the model demonstrates the effects that residents preferences concerning their lawns under various scenarios will have on water use the coupled socio hydrological model the okanagan coupled model is designed for use as a decision support tool to inform policies for managing water demand in the okanagan basin the model uses the water evaluation and planning system weap a water management and allocation system developed by raskin et al 1992 and the stockholm environment institute and a discrete choice model derived from a discrete choice experiment to examine the influence of residential landscape choices on regional water supplies we applied the okanagan coupled model in a subwatershed within the okanagan basin for alternative lawn scenarios to investigate changes in water demand in this paper we describe the process we developed for coupling the discrete choice model with weap and the resulting information provided to decision makers to our knowledge this paper presents the first application of a discrete choice model being fully coupled with a water resource model moving beyond the simple linking of outputs from separated models or frameworks the results illustrate how the okanagan coupled model provides water demand simulations based on hydrological and behavioural modelling including empirical evidence of the preferences of water users allowing for more informed policymaking this paper is organized as follows an overview of the study area is given in the remainder of section 1 section 2 discusses the parameterization of the weap software with water supply and demand data in the okanagan basin we include a description of the theory and calculations underlying the preference data and how the data were used to estimate the behavioural parameters in the okanagan coupled model in section 3 we demonstrate how the okanagan coupled model can be used for behaviourally realistic scenario analysis section 4 provides a discussion of the results and assesses the usefulness of the approach 1 1 study area the okanagan basin covers 8046 km2 in british columbia canada fig 1 and is unique in that it has the highest ratio of population to annual surface water yields of any basin in canada statistics canada 2010 the semi arid okanagan basin has a small water catchment receives an annual average of only 300 mm of precipitation in the lower basin analogous to other semi arid regions like the southwest united states and parts of australia and is undergoing rapid population growth in a changing climate cohen et al 2004 merritt et al 2003 taylor and barton 2004 surface water is major supply source meeting 67 of the region s water demand summit environmental 2010a historically water managers have mainly used surface water storage to meet growing water demand mcneill 2004 however future scenario modelling suggests that existing surface water storage systems will be unable to meet municipal and instream flow needs by 2050 harma et al 2012 to study these issues in 2007 the okanagan basin water board a regional water governance body whose board is comprised of local governments water suppliers and first nations initiated the development of two regional planning models for water and land use in the region the first the okanagan water demand model estimated water needs for residential agricultural and industrial and commercial uses based on land survey data gis and cadastral mapping of crop types including turfgrass irrigation system types soil properties and climatic data summit environmental 2010b the second model the okanagan water accounting model owam estimated natural streamflows and the effects of water storage and extractions on streamflows and lake levels in the okanagan basin dhi water and environment 2010 neither of these models included a coupled social component these models did however provide the hydrologic basis for our study as well as a foundation for considering water management strategies and policies in the okanagan basin in 2010 the okanagan basin water board had initiated a new phase of work to increase the availability of data refine modelling tools and improve public consultation in policy development this timing presented a window of opportunity to evaluate methods for increasing the predictive capacity of water resource models of the okanagan basin by including a representation of water user behaviour a key point of interest for water providers in the okanagan basin is the impact population growth will have on water supplies as rural landscapes transition to residential land uses the population of the okanagan basin grew by 46 during the period 1990 2010 from 235 793 to 345 831 bcstats n d accompanying this growth was the expansion of single family residential development with large lawns that require more water to maintain compared to higher density developments maurer 2010 irrigating these residential lawns accounts for 24 of all water use in the okanagan basin the second largest use of water after agricultural irrigation summit environmental 2010a reoccurring droughts have had a moderate impact on water conservation attitudes suggesting residents are open to consider options for reducing outdoor water use brandes and kriwoken 2006 conrad 2012a unfortunately in choosing options for managing water use water managers often have little empirical information about the preferences of water users concerning these options instead water managers often formulate strategies based on their own uncertain and sometimes inaccurate assumptions about the perceptions and preferences of water users therefore predicting how residential consumers will respond to water demand management strategies and policies targeting residential landscapes is critical in decision making about water management in the okanagan 2 the okanagan coupled model in addition to the previously mentioned weap there exist many possible basin wide water modelling systems including ribasim hydraulics 2004 mike basin dhi water and environment 2009 aquatool andreu et al 1996 and modsim labadie 1995 we selected weap as the modelling platform because of its broad use as a decision support tool and because the okanagan basin water board was planning to adopt weap as a water management tool also weap is a platform that provides flexibility in structuring water demand data by various measures of social and economic activities e g water use rates per household water use rates number of households with lawns yates et al 2005 the weap platform is a water management and allocation tool that has a graphical user interface to guide model parameterization weap uses a mass balance accounting framework to calculate a monthly water balance of flows changes in reservoir and groundwater storages and water supply allocations to water demands and outflows yates et al 2005 weap uses a linear programming heuristics approach to consider demand priorities and supply preferences to simulate both natural processes and human influences key assumptions may be built into the accounting to represent policies costs and other factors that affect demand supply and the overall hydrologic cycle a scenario feature allows the user to explore the effect of changes in climate and water management strategies on water systems making weap well suited for evaluating human influences on water systems and informing water policymaking yates et al 2005 as a decision support tool weap has been used to explore human water interactions in a number of case studies swiech et al 2012 for example analyzed the impacts of a reservoir for improved agricultural production in the yarabamba region peru with a weap model application in another weap modelling application for benin höllermann et al 2010 applied different scenarios of socio economic development and climate change to review benin s future water situation through 2025 bhave et al 2014 used weap to model the effect of stakeholder prioritized climate change adaptation options for the kangsabati river catchment in india hellegers et al 2013 used weap to model trade offs between water supply and demand to examine deficits against climate change scenarios in iran morocco and saudi arabia recently safavi et al 2015 used expert knowledge to prepare underlying data in a river basin model using weap for the zayandehrud river basin weap has also been previously used to examine water supply and demand in the okanagan basin harma et al 2012 utilized weap to investigate future climate scenarios in unregulated and reservoir supported streams that supply the district of peachland in the okanagan after the initiation of our research weap was selected by the okanagan basin water board as a platform for investigating the effects of the prior appropriation principle used in the british columbia water licensing system summit environmental 2013 the resulting model examines connected water use between communities and is being used as a decision support tool for regional drought response plans and new water licensing decisions this okanagan hydrologic connectivity model provided the hydrological structure e g rivers reservoirs lakes for preparing the okanagan coupled model and is described in detail in summit environmental 2013 the conceptual framework for the okanagan coupled model is shown in fig 2 the model consists of a discrete choice model and a hydrological representation of a water resource system a monthly time step was used to prepare water supply and demand data for the known system 2010 to couple stated preference data and to prepare future scenarios for the analysis period 2011 2015 2 1 stated preference data and the discrete choice model to prepare the behavioural component of the okanagan coupled model we used stated preference data from the discrete choice experiment in conrad et al 2018 to estimate the choices that would be made by residents with regard to landscaping features under various conditions stated preference data refer to observations that are derived from survey data in which respondents express what their choice would be in a hypothetical scenario whereas revealed preference data come from observations of actual behaviour for example conrad et al 2018 presented six sets of three alternative lawns fig 3 with varying attribute levels table 1 two of the lawns in each set were hypothetical and one was based on the respondent s description of his or her own lawn for each choice set the respondent was asked to choose their preferred lawn we chose to use stated preference data rather than revealed preference data for two reasons first comprehensive data on lawn configurations and resultant water use or resident response to measures aimed at reducing the size of residential lawns or reducing water use e g subsidies education lawn audits are not readily available in the okanagan region second revealed preference data may be insufficient to represent the impact of policies that have not been previously attempted or that drive water use behaviour beyond historic limits in the remainder of this section we discuss the underpinnings of the discrete choice model i e the mixed logit model utilized in preparing the okanagan coupled model a detailed discussion of the discrete choice experiment and resulting mixed logit model is provided in conrad et al 2018 and a complete description of the underlying survey with full questionnaire responses can be found in conrad 2012a the analysis of data derived from the discrete choice experiment is grounded in lancaster s attribute theory of value and consumer choice lancaster 1966 and has an econometric basis in random utility theory mcfadden 1974 following lancaster we assume that residents derive satisfaction from the features or attributes that constitute the lawn alternatives available to them choices can then be modeled considering additive separability as a function of the sum of the utility or value residents obtain from each of the attributes of the lawn alternatives given mcfadden 1974 train 2009 the overall utility u ij an individual i gains by choosing alternative j consists of an observable or deterministic v ij component and an unobservable or stochastic ε ij component of utility 1 u ij v ij ε ij in conrad et al 2018 individuals were also asked to describe their existing lawn conditions which were then included in the set of alternatives as an existing lawn or status quo alternative these status quo sq conditions can be expressed as predictors of individual choice representing case specific values that influence the probability an individual selects an alternative vermunt and magidson 2005 expressing the probability assuming the error terms are identically and independently

alternatives assumption which can be concerning as it does not account for unobserved preference heterogeneity over the sample to relax the iia assumption and examine preference heterogeneity conrad et al 2018 prepared a mixed logit also called random parameters or error components logit model which using computer estimation allows each coefficient β to vary randomly across respondents we refer to detailed specification of the mixed logit model in literature mcfadden and train 2000 revelt and train 1998 to prepare the mixed logit model conrad et al 2018 first estimated a conditional logit model following a step wise process in which they reviewed log likelihood ll bic bayesian information criterion and aic akaike information criterion criteria in selecting the most parsimonious model wald statistics aided their consideration on whether to retain individual attributes and z scores were used to determine the significance of individual attribute levels to the best fit most parsimonious design attribute model they added predictor values representing sq conditions all sq variables from responses obtained for each respondent were effects coded using identical coding as the corresponding design attribute table 1 to account for reference levels in each alternative 1 careful consideration of coding is needed when including sq levels and while conrad et al 2018 includes sq conditions identical and within the bounds of their experimental design these conditions may not always be present cooper et al 2011 and barton and bergland 2010 discuss coding approaches when sq conditions do not align with the choice design 1 conrad et al 2018 then prepared a mixed logit variant of the final conditional logit model to provide a comparative estimate of random effects and found that the mixed logit model with predictor coefficients sq variables was the best fit model as it had the lowest bic aic and ll statistics among the stable models given that calculating the probability of choice using ratios of random parameters is particularly challenging to estimate hensher et al 2015 train 2009 we fixed those random parameters wcost subsidy sq of total landscape sq variety of turf and sq appearance during peak of summer not shown to significantly deviate from the mean i e do not vary greatly in the population in the best fit mixed logit model in conrad et al 2018 and prepared revised coefficients following the model estimation methodology described in conrad et al 2018 that is we used stata 12 1 and the mixlogit command programmed for stata by hole 2007 to estimate normally distributed random parameter effects using simulation based on 1000 halton sequences for the integration haan and uhlendorff 2006 it is this revised mixed logit model that provides the framework for estimating choices and including behavioural data in the okanagan coupled model model coefficients for the choice model component of the okanagan coupled model are presented in table 2 the negative coefficient for the alternative specific constant specifies an overall preference for existing lawns in residential landscapes this preference is however refined by the preferences individuals have for the conditions describing their existing lawn represented by sq predictors 2 2 lawn watering cost calculations conrad et al 2018 included individual calculations for water use and watering cost for each lawn alternative presented and watering cost was significant in residents choice of lawn alternative accordingly we included estimates for watering cost in the coupled model as a function of water pricing and water use with the following considerations first the amount of water required mm of water per month for maintaining a healthy lawn varies during the yearly watering period april october and was derived from city of kelowna lawn irrigation guidelines as shown in table 3 traditional varieties of turfgrass require more irrigation than water conserving varieties to maintain a green appearance and artificial lawns require no irrigation second the amount of water required is a factor of the size of the property and the percentage of turfgrass that covers the landscapable areas of the property third it is expected that the appearance of the lawn during the summer is an indicator of the amount of lawn irrigation required where very green lawns suggest residents will use more water than those residents who maintain a mostly green lawn residents who allow their lawn to turn brown during the peak of summer will likely use even less water total water use w use in m3 for lawn irrigation is then the product of water needed need in each month m in mm of water during the watering period for each variety of turfgrass tg property size

lawn watering cost is calculated on a monthly basis according to the city of kelowna residential water rates the city of kelowna water utility assigns prices for residential water use on a four tiered pricing structure described in table 4 lawn watering cost is derived from the charges residents pay for the volume of water used w use during a monthly billing cycle above the base amount of water used for indoor domestic uses d an average of 19 m3 per month in the city of kelowna to determine the additional charges residents pay to irrigate their lawn total water used indoor and outdoor and

lakes and four points of interest on the okanagan river summit environmental 2013 in our study we limited the system modelling to those surface water sources that are directly involved in the supply and delivery of water to residents characterized by the stated preference data the okanagan coupled model hydrological system represents the okanagan lake okanagan river mission creek hydraulic creek and the major catchments where extractions and upland reservoirs are present e g mccollogh lake long meadow lake fig 4 all other stream catchments and residual areas were accounted for as lumped inputs to a mainstem lake or river segment in order to balance supply and demand in the region the physical properties and operational rules as well as flow data for each mainstem river in the okanagan coupled model were constructed from several data sets first data extracted from owam dhi water and environment 2010 provided natural streamflow data for each water intake at upland reservoir locations and net streamflow outlets of watersheds not explicitly modeled a minimum flow requirement was included for mission creek to satisfy instream flow requirements for fish and habitat specified by the okanagan fish water management tool and the lake operating plan hyatt et al 2009 elevation curves for the mainstem lakes reservoir operation rules and physical descriptions e g maximum storage capacity assumed initial storage maximum hydraulic outflow net evaporation monthly target elevations were based on parameters obtained from the okanagan hydrologic connectivity model summit environmental 2013 finally net evaporation from each mainstem lake and reservoir was estimated from potential evapotranspiration and precipitation data from environment canada prepared for the okanagan water supply and demand project summit environmental 2009 2 4 water demand data water demand data were prepared for each of the demand sites represented in fig 4 from three data sources first water utility data from the city of kelowna provided demand profiles for the categories single family indoor and outdoor industrial and commercial multi family and strata parks and net uncategorized water use metered data from the southeast kelowna irrigation district provided demand profiles segregated into agriculture domestic base load and sessional water use i e outdoor irrigation industrial and commercial and net uncategorized water use the remaining water demand nodes were prepared from data extracts from the okanagan water demand model summit environmental 2010b in this paper we focus on single family outdoor water demand in the city of kelowna represented in table 5 and shown as cok single family outdoor in fig 4 leaving other demand nodes representing indoor commercial and agricultural and other water uses unmodified outdoor water use currently represents 20 3 of overall water use in the city of kelowna water service area across the 13 506 single family households served outdoor water use was annualized in the model at 2 97 million m3 yr lawn irrigation accounts for almost all outdoor water use in single family households in the city of kelowna 2009 so non irrigation contributions to outdoor water use were assumed to be negligible and not included in the study estimating changes in outdoor water demand for households in the city of kelowna water utility service area in response to residents switching to proposed new lawn alternatives is a function of combining the probability for choices provided by the mixed logit model with the water use data provided in table 5 first the relative percentage of households h sq that would choose their existing lawn described by the attributes q when compared to the lawn alternative j with the attributes p

and sfh total is the total number of single family households in the city of kelowna water utility service area resulting outdoor water demand when presenting lawn alterative j is coded as the sum of sq water and h waterj 2 5 model verification the objective of model verification was to verify the hydrological components of the okanagan coupled model and test its parameterization against the streamflow and lake level data extracted from owam for the base year 2010 owam data were derived from a detailed hydrologic model of the okanagan basin developed in the mike she integrated watershed modelling system dhi water and environment 2010 owam provided a sophisticated hydrological representation of the okanagan basin but owam calculated water demand from changes in streamflows and reservoir levels whereas in the okanagan coupled model we estimated water demand by water service area and category i e city of kelowna outdoor water use we compared net flows of the okanagan coupled model with the net flows calculated by owam at outlets of mission creek hydraulic creek and grouse creek we also compared observed water storage in the reservoirs mccollugh lake browne lake and okanagan lake table 6 lists the results of comparing the baseline scenario with owam results for each tributary and waterbody we calculated the nash and sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient r2 nash and sutcliffe 1970 and correlation r matching was good for mission creek r2 0 95 and grouse creek r2 0 89 and satisfactory for hydraulic creek r2 0 75 matching was also satisfactory for okanagan lake r2 0 73 but less satisfactory for browne lake r2 0 67 and mccollugh lake r2 0 22 low r2 results for mccollugh lake and browne lake were not surprising due to differences in water demand data sets between the okanagan coupled model and owam for these water bodies however these differences do not impact observed levels for the okanagan lake or streamflows in other tributaries suggesting the hydrological components of the okanagan coupled model adequately represent hydrological conditions in the basin overall we consider the validated model suitable for the region of study in the okanagan basin and that it may reasonably be used for exploring changes in water demand due to changes in residential landscapes 3 scenario analysis using the okanagan coupled model the mixed logit model presented in table 2 provides a means to evaluate the preferences of residents of the city of kelowna for attributes of residential lawns subsidies turfgrass variety the percentage of turfgrass in each yard the appearance of the lawn during the peak of summer and the cost of water required to maintain that lawn all influence whether a homeowner would likely choose to make alterations to their residential landscape determining how residential preferences for lawn attributes translate to changes in water use requires further examination due to the contributory effect each attribute has on water use turfgrass variety the percentage of turfgrass in each yard and the appearance of the lawn during the peak of summer all contribute to the amount of water required to maintain residential lawns the water savings anticipated from a policy targeted at lawn size reduction would therefore be uncertain until the contributing effects other attributes had on overall water use were simulated the okanagan coupled model framework allows for these contributory effects to be included in the analysis and consideration of landscape changes the mixed logit model in the okanagan coupled model operates as an embedded calculation so that changes in attribute levels for lawn alternatives and the subsequent effect on residential landscaping choices are processed in weap automatically we coded the coefficients for the attributes listed in table 2 as key assumptions in the coupled model allowing us to simulate changes in residential outdoor water use under various scenarios we coded all coefficients listed in table 2 to provide consistency with conrad et al 2018 and so each attribute would be included in the ratio of coefficients in eq 9 in addition we coded the relationships defining water use variation in response to lawn attributes affecting residential landscapes as user defined functions in weap in the weap scenario explorer user interface we programmed the ability to adjust the attributes for both the lawn alternative and sq conditions after programming the levels for each attribute can be changed and the okanagan coupled model responds by re calculating watering cost and the likelihood of residents choices under any of the scenarios adjusted water demand is similarly calculated and processed by weap and the corresponding changes in the hydrological system presented to the model user taken together the modelling framework was prepared to provide flexibility to the user to define scenarios that affect the water use demands of the system according to characteristics of the region and the residential landscape options being considered by decision makers the input of different lawn alternatives and current lawn conditions provides over 9216 2 calculated as new lawn size 4 levels x new lawn variety 3 levels x new law appearance 4 levels x new lawn subsidy 4 levels x current lawn size 4 levels x current lawn variety 3 levels x current lawn appearance 4 levels 2 possible configurations to be studied analyzing all these scenarios would be impractical and would not necessarily inform the policy options being considered to address water use for single family residential lawns in the city of kelowna for the preparation of this paper we focused on three scenarios to demonstrate the potential of the okanagan coupled model in each case starting with specified sq conditions designed to represent the current lawn conditions and lawn preferences of single family residents in the city of kelowna conrad 2012b indicates that 62 2 of single family households in the city of kelowna reside on averaged sized properties greater than 0 15 acres 0 061 ha and less than 0 25 acres 0 103 ha in area traditional varieties of turfgrass kentucky blue grass ryegrass comprise a substantial majority 95 5 of the residents lawns and these lawns cover approximately 50 37 3 or 75 38 1 of the landscapeable area of their property conrad 2012b further more than 85 of the residents irrigate their lawns to be either mostly green or more green than brown during the peak of summer conrad 2012b following these findings we prepared two sq variants labelled sq50 representing landscapes with 50 turf mostly green appearance traditional turf varieties and average sized properties with a summer watering cost of 130 and sq75 representing landscapes with 75 turf mostly green appearance traditional turf varieties and average sized properties with a summer watering cost of 220 to use in each of the scenarios as representing existing lawn conditions these sq variants were used throughout the scenario analysis effectively representing segments defined by the current landscape situation of the residents with the parameters of the okanagan coupled model prepared empirically we can now demonstrate the use of the model by simulating the adoption rate of lawn alternatives and corresponding changes in water use in response to hypothetical polices aimed at reducing outdoor water use we examine adoption rates for a 5 year period following the year 2010 for three scenarios the first scenario is a baseline case in which existing lawn attributes are maintained throughout the simulation period in both of the other scenarios it is assumed that water managers propose to residents that they change their lawns to a specified alternative configuration i e a renovated lawn from existing to the alternative that would conserve water use to encourage the voluntary change information is provided about the reduced watering costs available with the alternative water conserving configuration together with a small subsidy for making the change subsidy levels were defined in conrad et al 2018 to provide a realistic decision context according to funds available to city of kelowna water managers so results would more accurately represent real world behaviour and improve the validity of the experiment measures hainmueller et al 2015 the scenarios and their parameters are listed in table 7 and are described below a baseline scenario in which existing lawn attributes remain unchanged throughout the simulation period a preferred lawn scenario in which water managers propose a lawn alternative that matches the lawn attributes most preferred by residents in the choice experiment based on the estimated coefficients set out in table 2 presenting residential landscapes with lawns that cover 50 of the landscapeable area use a water conserving turfgrass variety and are mostly green in appearance during the peak of summer with a flat subsidy of 250 for switching to the proposed lawn alternative the summer watering cost for this alternative would be 90 for average sized properties an extreme water conserving scenario in which water managers propose a lawn alternative that significantly reduces the fraction of turfgrass in residential landscapes and the subsequent water needed to maintain these lawns presenting residential landscapes with lawns that cover 25 of the landscapeable area use a water conserving turfgrass variety and are more brown than green in appearance during the peak of summer with a flat subsidy of 125 for switching to the proposed lawn alternative the summer watering cost for this alternative would be 30 for average sized properties for each scenario we assumed a 5 year s shaped logistic adoption curve of alternative lawns and evaluated the status of water allocations to the cok single family outdoor water demand node site shown in fig 4 during each monthly time step a stochastic factor representing a random standard deviation of up to 5 from the mean was applied to the water demand calculation to induce variability and further create behavioural realism in each scenario 3 see bartholomew 1967 for a discussion of stochastic models of social systems 3 in describing the scenario results below we review the proportion of households adopting the proposed lawn alternative i e market share and compare outdoor water demand in each scenario to the baseline scenario deriving market shares for lawn alternatives affecting water demand calculations requires utilizing both the mean coefficient and standard deviation sd distributions for random parameters to account for the heterogeneity represented in the mixed logit model table 2 for each scenario we derived market share estimates using the simulation approach described in hu et al 2005 and hensher and greene 2003 two rounds of simulation were conducted yielding vectors representing market share distribution densities for each scenario an initial parameter simulation prepared r draws from a multivariate normal distribution characterized by the mixed logit model s mean parameters and covariance from simulated maximum likelihood for each random parameter a subsequent coefficient simulation was completed by taking s draws from the normal distribution defined by the mean coefficient and standard deviation from each of the r draws of the parameter simulation r vectors of size s are thus generated for each random parameter market shares were then calculated together with fixed coefficients for the resulting r vectors point estimates were then calculated using the mean of mean approach hu et al 2005 that is we took the mean of the s estimates of market shares from each of the r vectors 2000 simulation draws were run for the preferred lawn and extreme water conserving scenarios to identify the mean and standard deviations reported in presenting the results we return to the main aim of the paper which is to demonstrate an empirical method for incorporating human behaviour in a water resource model figs 5 7 present the results of the simulations using the okanagan coupled model and show the evolution in the rate of change in single family landscapes over time to different lawn alternatives mean and standard deviations of market shares are presented in fig 5 however for ease of interpretation only mean results are shown in figs 6 and 7 the preferred lawn scenario presents a 39 6 sd 6 9 market share of the lawn alternative for sq50 configurations and a 83 8 sd 4 0 market share for sq75 configurations while the extreme water conserving scenario results in a 29 3 sd 4 9 market share of the lawn alternative presented for sq50 configurations and 65 0 sd 4 5 market share for sq75 configurations although market shares for alternative lawns are higher for the preferred lawn scenario than for the extreme water conserving scenario for both sq50 and sq75 configurations the ultimate water use savings under each scenario depend on how much water is used under the new conditions fig 6 illustrates that despite the larger adoption rate by residents under the preferred lawn scenario simulated savings in water use are greater for the extreme water conserving scenario at the end of the simulation period 2015 the extreme water conserving scenario results in mean water use savings of 23 9 over the baseline for sq50 configurations and 44 0 for sq75 configurations the preferred lawn scenario results in mean water use savings of 8 9 over the baseline for sq50 configurations and 16 2 for sq75 configurations under either scenario the sq configuration substantially influences the amount of achievable water use savings fig 7 illustrates the relative effect of sq50 and sq75 status quo configurations on simulated single family outdoor water demand for the extreme water conserving and preferred lawn scenarios at the end of the simulation period alternative lawns represented in the preferred lawn scenario account for 34 2 mean of total water demand for sq50 configurations and 80 5 mean of total water demand for sq75 configurations and alternative lawns represented in the extreme water conserving scenario account for 10 0 mean of total water demand for sq50 configurations and 36 1 mean of total water demand for sq75 configurations so again while adoption of the proposed lawn alternative is greatest under the preferred lawn scenario the extreme water conserving scenario achieves greater outdoor water savings with alternative lawns accounting for a smaller proportion of total outdoor water demand under this scenario 4 summary and conclusion in this paper we presented a coupled socio hydrological model that contains an explicit representation of the hydrology in the okanagan basin and a model of simulated human behaviour to indicate how water users would respond to proposed lawn alternatives that affect water demanded from regional water sources this approach contributes to the call by troy et al 2015 for creative proxies of human behaviour that lead to more robust ways of parameterizing models stated preference data and discrete choice models may represent one such proxy as they supply information about relationships between the characteristics of the choices water users make and the probability of those choices being made under differing scenarios we demonstrated how the coupled socio hydrological modelling framework could be used to simulate responses by individuals to proposed lawn alternatives for residential landscapes a mixed logit model was coupled with the weap system to simulate behavioural responses by residents in the study area and to estimate changes in outdoor water use the resultant okanagan coupled model provides decision makers with increased knowledge about residents preferences and intended choices which should enable managers to make more informed decisions when designing water demand policies we agree with bhave et al 2014 that a socially informed water resources model is a viable tool for water policymaking further the ability to work through a number of scenarios in a short period of time allows for the possible use of the okanagan coupled model in decision making sessions among water managers water utilities residents and other stakeholders to simulate the complex relationship between water users and the hydrological system and demonstrate how behaviour affects water use demand in the okanagan basin the use of a mixed logit model with random parameters increases the explanatory power of the okanagan coupled model through the mixed logit model s representation of preference heterogeneity in the population but at a cost of increased modelling complexity estimating market shares with random parameters required additional simulation which could limit its application in water management modeling frameworks lacking computational capacity to accommodate parameter distributions 4 in addition to computational complexity the design and parameterization of mixed logit models require specific econometric expertise that may not be readily available among staff available to water managers 4 hensher and greene 2003 alternatively discuss using only the mean coefficient and standard deviation in choice estimates avoiding the need for simulation further it may also be desirable to utilize a fixed parameter model e g conditional logit model with its advantages in computational efficiency and ease in obtaining probability expressions in cases where mixed logit models fail to converge with small data sets hensher et al 2005 however additional investigation is required to determine whether excluding the information provided in the distribution of random parameters provides for comparable estimates to the more complex simulation modelling method described in this paper in preparing the scenarios we set sq conditions to illustrate the potential of the model to provide a comparison of possible scenario conditions that is we assumed homogeneity in the sq conditions presented in each scenario across all single family residents in the city of kelowna water service area to correspond with the single node water demand data available although these sq configurations closely approximate residential landscapes across the city of kelowna they do not fully represent the heterogeneity of these landscapes and we caution readers to bear this in mind when considering the results future application of the okanagan coupled model may include its refinement to more fully represent the heterogeneity of existing lawns to do so will require segmenting water demand nodes by combinations of lawn features e g lawn size lawn variety and lawn appearances and property sizes collecting water demand data on these groups and possible refinement of model parameters to represent these groups an important message for water managers is that under both the extreme water conserving and preferred lawn scenarios and both sq configurations the modelling results indicate that considerable savings in total water use may be attained by proposing the alternative lawn configuration to residents and providing site specific information about the potential for reduced watering costs along with a small subsidy city of kelowna domestic households are metered and residents receive water bills and in an earlier survey we noted that residents expressed limited knowledge of the water required along with the cost of water to irrigate their lawns conrad 2012b we further noted that while residents expressed a desire to reduce the size of their lawns they also wanted for more information on landscape water requirements before making decisions conrad 2012b as noted by one anonymous reviewer the application of a small subsidy compared to the cost of replacing or reducing the amount of turfgrass in a residential landscape contrasts with studies that highlight the need to provide substantial subsidies to motivate behaviour however while conservation attitudes are not as prevalent in the okanagan as those found in australia belzile 2011 we suspect that the desire of residents to reduce outdoor water use may influence residents choice to convert their landscapes in the absence of higher subsidies we note that economic studies have shown that subsidy requirements as a proportion of the adoption costs vary depending on the attitudes and preferences of individuals lienhoop and brouwer 2015 tapsuwan et al 2014 the decision to convert or change watering behaviour is highly intertwined with conservation mindsets and will also likely be weighed against other factors such as conversion costs or impacts on lawn maintenance further research is needed to determine whether residents stated preferences will translate into real behaviour in these circumstances but the possibility could be tested with a pilot program aimed at residents with larger proportions of turf in their landscapes results from this program could be used to enhance the response of the behavioural component of the model by combining revealed and stated preference data adamowicz et al 1994 the modelling results indicate that the extreme water conserving scenario would result in the greatest reductions in outdoor water use for residents with either sq50 or sq75 configurations however this scenario presents an ambitious lawn alternative that reduces residential lawn sizes to 25 of the total landscapable area and a more brown than green lawn appearance of which reducing lawn sizes contributes most to overall water savings water policy makers could use the okanagan coupled model to assess the trade offs between designing policies to encourage the maximum reduction in water demand versus aligning policies with the preferences of a larger proportion of residents by modifying the extreme water conserving scenario to include some of the more widely preferred lawn attributes and then evaluating the overall changes in water use for example they might investigate the effect of lawns appearing mostly green during the summer or incorporating other combinations of lawn sizes and turfgrass varieties they might also investigate the effect of increasing water pricing across all residents or on certain sq configurations the studied scenario alternatives and sq50 and sq75 configurations represent just a small subset of the more than 9000 possible configurations that remain available to policy makers our findings support calls to integrate hydrology and social sciences in order to fully model the complex interactions between watershed dynamics and human behaviour braden et al 2009 carey et al 2014 troy et al 2015 wiek and larson 2012 our use of a discrete choice model presents just one approach for estimating residential water demand and arbués et al 2003 provides a description of many others further research should explore the application of discrete choice models to estimate additional social parameters affecting water demand in water resource models this could include investigations into the adoption of water efficient technology smart water metering and other residential information feedbacks more sophisticated subsidy programs and programs targeting water use in

7104,we used data from 109 surveyed cross sections at 34 reaches of new zealand rivers ranging in bankfull width from 8 to 234 m each with 4 13 measured flows to compare regression derived at a station hydraulic geometry ahg coefficients and exponents to the coefficients and exponents predicted by dingman s 2007 analytical ahg relations the analytical geometrical relations depend on measured values of 1 bankfull width 2 bankfull maximum depth and 3 a geometric exponent fit to the measured cross section because of data limitations and the lack of a generally applicable analytical hydraulic relation the hydraulic relation is here represented by an empirical power law relation between depth and velocity developed at each section the fits between the quasi analytical and empirical values of the ahg coefficients and exponents are highly statistically significant with intercepts near 0 and slopes near 1 validating dingman s original analytical relations this confirmation of the physical basis underlying empirically observed ahg relations along with some statistically significant relations among the quantities that determine ahg coefficients and exponents that are not predicted by theory may be useful for estimating ahg relations from remotely sensed or partial information keywords hydraulic geometry river hydraulics river geometry 1 introduction 1 1 definition of at a station hydraulic geometry ahg the concept of hydraulic geometry was introduced by leopold and maddock 1953 the at a station hydraulic geometry ahg relations are three simple power laws that relate water surface width w average depth y and average velocity u at a stream cross section to the discharge q through the section that is imposed by upstream watershed hydrologic processes 1w w a q b 1y y c q f 1u u k q m a given set of ahg relations applies to within bank flows at a specific cross section with characteristic channel characteristics cross section size shape slope and bed and bank material it is assumed that the channel characteristics do not change sensibly with discharge continuity dictates that 2 w y u q and therefore that 3 b f m 1 and 4 a c k 1 1 2 applications of ahg determinations of discharge derived from measurements of water surface width average depth and average velocity that can be used to determine empirical ahg relations have been recorded for well over a century at tens of thousands of river cross sections worldwide many quantities related to fluvial geomorphic activity hydraulics erosion and sediment transport water quality stream habitat and river navigation are functions of width depth and or velocity thus ahg relations can be used to estimate the values or ranges of discharges for which those quantities have critical values where discharge records are sufficiently long ahg relations can be combined with flow duration curves to estimate the fraction of time that critical values of those quantities occur 1 3 variability and physical basis of ahg prior to dingman 2007 attempts to characterize and explain the variability of observed ahg relations focused virtually exclusively on the exponents the coefficients were treated simply as the unit dependent values of the dependent variables when the discharge equals one unit e g 1 m3 s the most extensive previous surveys rhodes 1977 park 1977 found that the ahg exponents vary over almost the entire physically possible extent of their range from 0 to 1 for example rhodes 1977 found 0 b 0 84 0 01 f 0 84 0 03 m 0 99 there have been many attempts to explain this variability by channel type and geological setting knighton 1975 park 1977 or various metaphysical theories e g most probable state leopold and langbein 1962 minimum variance langbein 1964 williams 1978 equable change miller 1991 maximum entropy and minimum energy dissipation singh and zhang 2008 as singh s 2003 comprehensive review reported these explanations have not proved convincing this should not have been surprising as ferguson 1986 p 25 had reasoned that to explain ahg we need look no further than hydraulics and geometry the cross sectional shape of a channel determines the rate of increase of water width with depth while flow resistance laws define the rate of increase of mean velocity with depth it remained for dingman 2007 to put this reasoning into mathematical form and show that the power law ahg relations can be derived from 1 a power law hydraulic relation between average velocity and average depth and 2 a power law characterization of cross section geometry based on bankfull width bankfull maximum depth and a shape exponent 1 4 study objective dingman s 2007 analytical ahg relations have not previously been compared with empirical i e regression derived ahg relations and that is the principal objective of the present paper the variability of ahg relations and prior to dingman s 2007 analysis the failure to reliably relate them to underlying geometric and hydraulic characteristics have limited the application of ahg related relations for many useful purposes understanding the physical determinants of ahg should provide practical and theoretical insights to stream behavior perhaps including interpretation of remotely sensed observations bjerklie et al 2018 and understanding of downstream hydraulic geometry and the recently described phenomenon of at many stations hydraulic geometry amhg gleason 2015 gleason and wang 2015 2 empirical ahg relations leopold and maddock 1953 determined best fit hydraulic geometry relations simply by eye fitting of points plotted on log log paper subsequent researchers have determined the exponents and coefficients in equations 1 for a given cross section by linear regression of the logarithms of observations from repeated stream gauging measurements at that section 5 l n w l n y l n u l n a l n c l n k b f m l n q and expressing the results as in 1 several authors have pointed out the potential problem of using linear regression of logarithms to estimate the coefficients of power law relations e g helsel and hirsch 1992 p 253 261 and mccuen 1993 p 261 273 the problem is that when the ln w y u values computed via 5 are retransformed the w y u estimates are medians not means of the estimates and tend to be biased low to explore whether this issue has a significant effect on our coefficient estimates we estimated the unbiased empirical power law coefficients for ahg values by multiplying the coefficients determined by log log regression by the duan smearing estimate denoted δ see appendix a as shown in appendix a we found that the 0 75 quantile values of δ for the empirical ahg relations in this study are all 1 003 because 1 it is doubtful that the measurements we use have precision greater than three significant figures 2 we found that the product of the three bias adjusted coefficients was usually significantly greater than its theoretical value of 1 and 3 this unbiasing approach to determining ahg coefficients has not been used in previous studies we retained the traditional practice of using the non bias adjusted coefficients 3 analytical ahg relations 3 1 introduction starting with 1 a generalized hydraulic relation and 2 an idealized model of a symmetrical channel cross section dingman 2007 showed that the empirically observed coefficients and exponents in the ahg relations can be explicitly related to measurable hydraulic and geometric quantities justifying the seminal intuitive insight of leopold and maddock 1953 in calling the empirical phenomenon they discovered hydraulic geometry dingman s 2007 analysis is reviewed and slightly modified here 3 2 hydraulic relation as discussed by manning 1889 ferguson 1986 yen 2002 dingman 2007 and rickenmann and recking 2011 among many many others equations of power law form have been used for characterizing the constitutive relations for one dimensional open channel flow since chézy s original formulation in 1768 these equations are thought to apply where resistance is due predominantly to boundary roughness in his original derivation dingman 2007 used a generalized power law hydraulic relation of the form 6a u k s q y p where k is a generalized conductance coefficient s is energy slope and p and q are exponents the chézy and manning uniform flow equations are the most commonly used versions of this relation in the chézy relation k is chézy s c q 1 2 and p 1 2 in the manning relation k 1 n n is manning s roughness coefficient q 1 2 and p 2 3 neither the chézy manning nor equation 6a relations are in general dimensionally correct and thus require appropriate unit adjustment factors however several studies of large data sets of natural streams have indicated that p and q have different values than assumed in the chézy manning relations e g riggs 1976 dingman and sharma 1997 bjerklie et al 2005 lopez et al 2007 ferguson 2007 ferguson 2010 for the purposes of the present study we incorporate the slope term into the conductance coefficient and use an even more generalized hydraulic relation 6b u κ y p where κ k s q and κ and p are found by log log regression of measured u and y values at each cross section we used this form of the hydraulic relation because values of slope are not available for the individual cross sections used in this study taking this approach allows us to determine whether dingman s 2007 analytical relations for the ahg coefficients and exponents are consistent with a power law that describes the hydraulic relation at the cross section of interest as he postulated note that although the values of the duan bias adjustment factor δ was somewhat higher for κ than for the ahg coefficients see appendix a the median value was 1 004 so again no bias adjustment was made it is important to emphasize that the hydraulic relation used in this study equation 6b is determined empirically at each cross section and requires measurement of average depth and average velocity this paper does not address the question of a priori or general determination of κ and p from channel characteristics especially slope and boundary roughness which as noted is a central problem in open channel hydraulics that has resisted simple solution as described below we tried to select a sample of cross sections at which resistance is dominated by the effects of boundary particle roughness in spite of this we find that the exponent p usually differs substantially from the conventional uniform flow values p 1 2 for chezy 2 3 for manning and that κ varies over several orders of magnitude even between adjacent cross sections in a given reach we could not explore the dependence of p or κ on slope or boundary particle size because the slope and particle size data that are given in hicks and mason 1991 apply to reaches and not to individual cross sections as noted in ferguson 1986 2007 and others the exponent p varies with relative submergence y d where d is a characteristic particle diameter or the one dimensional hydraulic relation may be represented as well or better by a logarithmic or more complex formulation e g ferguson s 2007 eq 20 as by 6b thus a simple power law between velocity and depth may be an approximation of the local hydraulic relation however its use has a long history see ferguson 1986 and is justifiable for the purposes of the present study 3 3 geometric relation in dingman s 2007 derivation the channel cross section is modeled as a symmetrical form given by 7 z ψ bf 2 w bf r x r where z is height of the bed above the lowest channel elevation assumed to occur at the channel center x is horizontal distance from the center ψ bf is the bankfull maximum central depth and wbf is bankfull width fig 1 the exponent r reflects the cross section shape a triangle is represented by r 1 the lane type b stable channel henderson 1966 figs 10 21 by r 1 75 a parabola by r 2 and forms with increasingly flatter bottoms and steeper banks by increasing values of r in the limit as r the channel is rectangular fig 2 although 7 is a model of a symmetrical channel natural channels are not symmetrical and as will be shown in section 6 1 2 the method used here to determine the characteristic value of r at a given cross section is consistent with 7 but does not require that the section be symmetrical 3 4 ahg relations as functions of hydraulics and geometry 3 4 1 ahg coefficients combining relations 1 2 6b and 7 as in dingman 2007 the ahg coefficients are related to cross section hydraulics and geometry as 8a a d w bf r r p δ ψ bf r 1 p δ κ 1 δ 8c c d w bf r δ ψ bf r 1 δ κ r δ 8c k d w bf r p δ ψ bf r p δ κ 1 r δ where 9 δ 1 r r p and 10 r 1 r r and the subscript d indicates coefficient values determined from dingman s analytical expressions via 8 10 3 4 2 ahg exponents the analytical ahg exponents are related to the exponents of the hydraulic and geometric factors as 11b b d 1 δ 11f f d r δ 11 m m d p r δ so that 12r r f d b d 12p p m d f d if r is determined from the channel cross section geometry and p from the cross section hydraulic relation as described we can calculate δ from 9 and r from 10 find bd fd and md from 11 and write the ahg relations of 1 in terms of the channel hydraulics and geometry 13 w w w bf r r p δ ψ bf r 1 p δ q 1 δ 13y y w bf r δ ψ bf r 1 δ κ r δ q r δ 13u u w bf r p δ ψ bf r p δ κ 1 r δ q r p δ note that the exponents on the wbf ψ bf r and κ terms in 13 each sum to 0 and the exponents on q sum to 1 4 research plan the main objective of this paper is to explore the degree to which the ahg coefficients a c k and exponents b f m determined by log log regression of field measurements equal their counterparts ad cd kd and bd fd md calculated via the analytical relations of eqs 8 and 11 for a set of stream cross sections at which flow resistance is dominated by boundary grain roughness and the hydraulic u y relation is well characterized by the simple power law of eq 6b in addition we explore statistically significant relations among ahg determining quantities not predicted by the theory but which if widely observed may have general predictive value 5 field data 5 1 requirements table 1 summarizes the quantities needed to calculate the ahg coefficients and exponents via dingman s 2007 analytical relations eqs 8 and 11 in order to achieve our objectives we require a number of cross sections with 1 reliable determinations of bankfull width wbf and bankfull maximum depth ψ bf 2 measurements of cross section geometry that allow a best fit estimate of the geometric exponent r and 3 sufficient observations of the four ahg variables w y u and q to provide reliable regression estimates of a the hydraulic coefficient κ and exponent p and b the ahg coefficients a c and k and exponents b f and m 5 2 source the field data used in this study are from cross sections and stream discharge measurements measured by the staff of new zealand s national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa in producing its well known publication roughness characteristics of new zealand rivers hicks and mason 1991 through the courtesy of murray hicks of niwa we obtained the original cross section surveys 2 to 5 sections at each of the sites and measurements of hydraulic quantities 3 to 12 flows at each cross section for the 78 reaches included in hicks and mason 1991 as described more fully below we selected from this original data base cross sections in which 1 sediment grain boundary roughness appears to be the dominant source of flow resistance and 2 the hydraulic relation can be well characterized by the power law relation of eq 6b hicks and mason 1991 give values of slope for all flows at all reaches and grain size distributions at most reaches however we found that these data are not useful in our analysis of flows at individual cross sections within a given reach because the original data for each reach give distances between cross sections and water surface elevations at each flow this allows calculation of slopes between adjacent sections but not through each section our attempts to estimate the latter from the data provided gave values that lacked explanatory power similarly the grain size distributions given in hicks and mason 1991 are for reaches not individual cross sections and also lacked explanatory power for our purposes 5 3 data selection the overall goal of our data selection methodology was to identify cross sections at which we could 1 reliably characterize the empirical ahg 2 reliably determine the quantities needed for computing the analytical ahg identified in table 1 and 3 be reasonably confident that flow resistance was primarily due to boundary grain roughness the specific criteria we used for inclusion of cross sections from hicks and mason s 1991 78 reaches are listed in table 2 these criteria are very similar to those used by lopez et al 2007 p 116 in their development of statistical relations between discharge and cross sectional area depth and slope based on criteria 1 5 24 of hicks and mason s 1991 78 reaches were eliminated from further study application of criteria 6 11 resulted in a final data set of 109 cross sections at 34 reaches table 3 lists and gives the dimensions of the reaches included in the analysis 6 determination of geometric and hydraulic quantities from field measurements 6 1 geometric quantities 6 1 1 bankfull maximum depth ψ bf and bankfull width wbf ideally determination of bankfull locations and elevations at the measured sections should be determined in the field based on multiple indicators see for example harrelson and rawlins 1994 rosgen 1996 p 5 8 5 14 personal communication with murray hicks of niwa revealed that no formal attempts were made to identify bankfull elevations when cross sections were surveyed so these indicators were not available in the present study however measurements were generally limited to flows confined within the banks of simple single thread channels hicks and mason 1991 p 2 therefore we assumed that all measured flows were within bank and that surveyed cross sections extended to above bankfull elevation to estimate bankfull levels we first plotted each cross section survey and examined the photographs and cross section plots given in hicks and mason 1991 to eliminate reaches in which channel curvature or vegetation appeared to be significant contributors to flow resistance we assumed that bankfull levels were above the highest observed water surface elevation indicated in their diagrams and usually to be at breaks in slope in many cases the plotted survey data included identical elevations often given to three decimal places that met those criteria on either side of a channel when these were found we assumed that that elevation was bankfull ψ bf was determined as the difference between the bankfull elevation and the lowest surveyed elevation and wbf as the horizontal distance between bankfull elevations on left and right banks to avoid the temptation to fudge the data to make it better fit the theory the initial values determined in this way were not subsequently altered the average values of wbf and the actual and relative i e length divided by average bankfull width reach lengths are given in table 3 and the distributions of wbf and ψ bf are summarized in table 4 6 1 2 geometric exponent r eq 7 leads to the following relations between geometric elements of a cross section 14 y a w 1 r ψ 15 w w bf ψ ψ bf 1 r and 16 a w bf 1 r ψ bf 1 r ψ r where w is water surface width a is wetted cross sectional area and ψ is maximum depth the data provided by niwa for each flow at each cross section include the elevation of the water surface which with the cross section survey allows calculation of the maximum depth ψ the wetted cross sectional area a the hydraulic radius rh and the discharge q determined either by slope area measurements or reliable flow ratings see hicks and mason 1991 p 3 4 we assumed that rh was effectively equal to average depth y and the water surface width was calculated as w a rh using these measurements eqs 7 and 14 16 suggest the four possible methods for estimating r summarized in table 5 all four methods require identification of wbf and ψ bf section 6 1 1 although method 1 is a straightforward test of the basic cross section model of equation 7 we found that it is subject to giving distorted results to the extent that the channel is asymmetrical i e the deepest part of the section is distant from the channel center which is the case for all sections methods 2 3 and 4 do not require the cross section to be symmetrical note however that because 14 relates y and ψ and y a w observations of a as well as w and ψ are required for method 2 method 3 involves only the two channel dimensions that are in principle directly observable w and ψ method 4 requires observations of a w and ψ note also that the regression intercept in this latter relation should be close to ln 1 r ψ bf 1 r and thus depends on r we calculated r using all four methods of table 5 and there was substantial variability in these estimates at many sections based on the above reasoning and before we compared the estimates with the estimate using the regression estimates of b and f we selected method 3 which is based only on observations of the directly observable quantities w and ψ including wbf and ψ bf as the most straightforward and widely useful approach to estimating the geometric exponent r from measurements of channel cross sections in addition to not requiring that the cross section be symmetrical the variability of both w wbf and ψ ψ bf at a cross section is usually less than one order of magnitude so that determination of r 3 by log regression minimizes bias and goodness of fit issues note also that w and ψ are potentially directly observable via remote sensing thus in the remainder of this paper method 3 was used and r r 3 6 2 hydraulic quantities 6 2 1 approach as noted above in order to objectively test dingman s 2007 formulations of the physical basis of ahg we need to specify an explicit constitutive relation between average velocity u and average flow depth y we have assumed this relation can be represented by a power law equation 6b and as noted in criterion 6 of table 2 our sample included only sections where boundary grain roughness appeared to be the major source of resistance and where a power law relation between u and y was statistically significant as noted the values of κ and p were determined by log log regression at each section 6 2 2 hydraulic coefficient κ fig 3 a and table 6 show the distributions of the coefficient κ in the power law hydraulic relation values of κ range over six orders of magnitude 0 000500 to 28 338 but 90 of the values are between 0 199 and 4 57 and 50 are between 0 601 and 1 936 as noted above hydraulic theory indicates that κ should be positively related to slope and inversely related to boundary roughness but the available data did not allow us to investigate those relations at individual cross sections 6 2 3 hydraulic exponent p fig 3b and table 6 show the distributions of the exponent p in the power law hydraulic relation the value of p ranges from 0 234 to 9 785 with 90 of the values between 0 543 and 3 06 and 50 between 0 989 and 1 875 four of the 109p values were less than the chézy value of 0 5 6 were between 0 5 and the manning value of 0 667 and 90 were 0 667 the median p 1 285 and mean p 1 583 values are approximately twice as large as conventional uniform flow values and the values found in the regression models of lopez et al 2007 0 77 0 82 thus our results add to a large body of evidence indicating that velocity usually increases significantly more rapidly with depth than predicted by the manning equation see ferguson 2010 7 comparisons of empirical and analytical ahg quantities 7 1 ahg coefficients 7 1 1 ranges and intercorrelations table 7 and fig 4 show the distributions of the regression derived ahg coefficients a c and k note that there is considerable correlation among the coefficients and between coefficients and exponents in particular a is strongly correlated with wbf r 2 0 770 fig 5 this is unsurprising given that eq 8a shows that a depends on wbf r r p δ and the fraction r r p δ r r p 1 r r p is usually fairly close to 1 if widespread some of these correlations might prove useful in estimating ahg via remote sensing 7 1 2 accuracy of analytical relations fig 6 and table 8 compare the coefficients determined by log log regression with the coefficients calculated via dingman s 2007 analytical relations all the relations between observed and predicted coefficients are highly significant the 95 confidence intervals for the intercepts contain 0 for a and k and are very close to doing so for c the 95 confidence intervals for the slopes slightly exceed 1 for a and c and are 1 for k the predictive relation is closest to 1 1 for the depth coefficient c this may be because ad and kd depend on both the geometric exponent r and the hydraulic exponent p while cd does not depend on p eq 8c the correspondence between the analytical and regression derived coefficients is least good for the width coefficient a this may be due to 1 its strong dependence on the estimate of wbf the value of which may be relatively uncertain and 2 the fact that the exponent on wbf is typically near 1 as noted above eq 8a 7 2 ahg exponents 7 2 1 ranges and intercorrelations table 9 and fig 7 show the distributions of the regression derived ahg exponents b f and m and their correlations with other quantities it is informative to plot the values of b f and m on a triaxial graph fig 8 and compare the distributions we found with those of rhodes 1977 who summarized 577 values taken from the literature we find as did rhodes 1977 that the distributions of f and m are quite symmetrical and quasi normal while that of b is strongly positively skewed and is approximately log normal rhodes 1977 found a larger range for b 0 001 to 0 840 and a similarly positively skewed distribution however his values were more concentrated in the range 0 00 to 0 10 most of both rhodes s 1977 and our values are considerably smaller than the theoretical minimum variance value of b 0 23 derived by leopold and langbein 1962 depth exponents in our sample have a similar range of values to rhodes s but most are less than the theoretical value of 0 42 derived by leopold and langbein 1962 conversely the velocity exponents in our sample are generally higher than rhodes found and tend to be considerably higher than leopold and langbein s theoretical value of m 0 35 7 2 2 accuracy of analytical relations fig 9 and table 10 compare the ahg exponents determined by log log regression with those calculated via dingman s 2007 analytical relations eqs 11 all three empirical ahg exponents are strongly predicted by their estimates based on the cross section channel geometry r and hydraulic p relations for b and f the intercept is not significantly different from 0 and for f and m the slope is not significantly different from 1 7 3 hydraulic conductivity ahg relation from eqs 6b and 1 it can be shown that hydraulic conductivity is related to empirical ahg quantities as 21 κ k c m f analogously conductivity is related to the analytical ahg relations eq 8 as 22 κ k d c d p these theoretical relations are confirmed the empirical value of κ is strongly predicted by the empirical ahg quantities fig 10a and even more strongly by the analytical ahg quantities fig 10b furthermore the relationship between the analytical values kd cd p and the empirical values k c m f is very close to 1 1 if the unexplained anomalous values at butchers xs 1 are omitted fig 10c 8 other relations among variables 8 1 relations among ahg determining variables five independent variables appear in dingman s 2007 analytical ahg relations eqs 8 11 wbf ψ bf r κ p we explored quantitative relations among these variables plus δ 1 r r p that may be of use in predicting ahg from those variables and report apparently significant results here fig 11 shows graphs of each pair of those variables at each of the 109 cross sections and table 11 gives the coefficient of determination r 2 for each pair in only two cases were linear correlations significant at the 0 01 level wbf ψ bf and r δ neither relation provides much insight as a significant relation between bankfull dimensions is expected and δ is determined by both r which varies widely and p which varies across a fairly narrow range in spite of the low linear correlation there appears to be a systematic relation between p and κ for κ 2 fig 12 that can be approximated as 23a p 1 189 κ 0 276 r 2 0 355 or 23b p 0 776 ln κ 1 268 r 2 0 589 which is hydraulically interesting but for which a physical explanation does not occur to us the plot of p vs r in fig 11 suggests the possibility that p declines with increasing r when r 2 5 but is independent of r for larger values however this apparent trend may be due to two anomalously large p values and thus may not indicate an underlying general relation the only other possibly significant relations relate conductivity κ to channel dimensions ψ bf and wbf fig 13 these can be fitted with statistically significant power law relations 24a κ 2 364 ψ bf 0 877 r 2 0 191 and 24b κ 7 061 w bf 0 579 r 2 0 137 but both have considerable scatter and may not prove general or useful especially as there is no apparent physical reason why channel conductivity should decrease with channel size 8 2 significant relations among ahg variables we have already noted 1 a strong relation between the width coefficient a and bankfull width fig 5 that theory eq 8a indicates should be robust and helpful in estimating a via remote sensing and 2 a very strong relation between hydraulic conductivity κ and k c m f fig 10 that is according to our theory an identity eqs 21 and 22 fig 14 shows additional strong relations between 14a the regression derived depth coefficient c and exponent f r 2 0 534 14b c and the ratio of velocity exponent to depth exponent m f p r 2 0 749 and 14c m and f r 2 0 652 the relations of fig 14a and 14b are not predicted by our theory but if found widely may prove useful in estimating ahg relations from remotely sensed or incomplete observations at stream cross sections the relation of fig 14c reflects the fact that b values have a limited range and since b f m 1 f and m tend to be inversely related κ values are strongly α 0 001 correlated positively with k and kd but the r 2 values for these correlations are 0 5 as noted in table 6 the p values in our data are significantly α 0 001 correlated positively with m and c and negatively with f and k the r 2 values with m f and c are all 0 5 the strong correlations with m and f are expected because p m f eq 12p fig 15 shows a strong relation of p with c note from eq 8c that c depends on bankfull width and depth the geometric exponent r and the hydraulic coefficient κ thus this relation might prove helpful in estimating ahg or hydraulic relations from measurable channel characteristics we find a strong negative correlation r 2 0 540 between b and δ this is expected since theoretically b 1 δ eq 11b similarly the strong negative correlation between f and m r 2 0 651 and between f and p r 2 0 591 and strong positive correlation between m and p r 2 0 534 arise because p m f eq 12p 9 summary and conclusions soon after leopold and maddock 1953 discovered the ubiquity of the power law ahg relations a review by mackin 1963 p 148 observed that the ahg equations may be terminal engineering conclusions but from the standpoint of science they are statements of problems not conclusions as noted above subsequent attempts to solve this problem by deriving the values of the ahg exponents from various metaphysical considerations have not proved convincing and in a review of world wide data park 1997 noted that there is no significant evidence of central tendencies for the ahg exponents being related to hydrologic climate or geologic setting and stated p 144 that perhaps the greatest problem remains that of accounting for observed variations in the hydraulic geometry relations ferguson 1986 qualitatively and dingman 2007 quantitatively addressed that problem by showing that the ahg relations can be derived from one dimensional hydraulic principles and cross section geometry the present study confirms their conclusions by showing that dingman s 2007 analytical relations are strong predictors of empirical ahg coefficients and exponents in a sample of 109 cross sections at which boundary grain roughness is the dominant source of resistance the geometric part of these relations depends on bankfull width bankfull maximum depth and an exponent characterizing the relationship between those two quantities that can be estimated from paired observations of width and maximum depth the hydraulic part of the analytical relations as used herein incorporates an empirical characterization of the local hydraulic velocity depth relation as a simple power law the coefficient and exponent of which are in general highly variable from cross section to cross section and the exponent of which is generally considerably different from conventional uniform flow equations such as manning chezy theoretically the coefficient in these relations should depend largely on slope and boundary particle size and may differ for different ratios of depth to particle size but the cross section data used here did not permit exploring that question our study also revealed some fairly strong correlations between elements of ahg that are not predicted by theory that if general may prove useful in predicting ahg from remotely sensed information since all the ahg coefficients depend on bankfull width recently established global relations between wbf and drainage area andreadis et al 2013 wilkerson et al 2014 may also be helpful in predicting ahg relations from remotely sensed data thus our results strongly support the conclusion that ferguson s 1986 conceptual and dingman s 2007 analytical relations correctly identify the hydraulic and geometric relations that give rise to ahg it seems reasonable to hope that this verification of the underlying relations that give rise to ahg could provide a basis for understanding the underlying causes of downstream and at many stations hydraulic geometry gleason 2015 however the problem of determining the physically based local hydraulic relation remains acknowledgments we thank murray hicks of the new zealand national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa for providing us

grove school of engineering internal funding comments from two anonymous reviewers were very helpful in streamlining and improving the paper appendix a the duan smearing factor for bias adjustment it is well known that predictions of dependent variables using ordinary linear regression models developed using logarithms as in eq 5 tend to be low biased to correct for this helsel and hirsch 1992 p 257 recommended adjusting those predictions using the duan 1983 smearing factor δ they noted that the validity of this approach relies only on the assumption that the residuals are independent and homoscedastic the method is robust to the distribution of residuals and is the most generally applicable approach for a regression on natural logarithms the residuals ei are a1 e i ln ξ i ln ξ i where ξi is the measured value at case i and ξ i the value of the dependent variable ξ predicted by linear regression of natural logarithms the bias adjustment factor δ is the average of the retransformed

7104,we used data from 109 surveyed cross sections at 34 reaches of new zealand rivers ranging in bankfull width from 8 to 234 m each with 4 13 measured flows to compare regression derived at a station hydraulic geometry ahg coefficients and exponents to the coefficients and exponents predicted by dingman s 2007 analytical ahg relations the analytical geometrical relations depend on measured values of 1 bankfull width 2 bankfull maximum depth and 3 a geometric exponent fit to the measured cross section because of data limitations and the lack of a generally applicable analytical hydraulic relation the hydraulic relation is here represented by an empirical power law relation between depth and velocity developed at each section the fits between the quasi analytical and empirical values of the ahg coefficients and exponents are highly statistically significant with intercepts near 0 and slopes near 1 validating dingman s original analytical relations this confirmation of the physical basis underlying empirically observed ahg relations along with some statistically significant relations among the quantities that determine ahg coefficients and exponents that are not predicted by theory may be useful for estimating ahg relations from remotely sensed or partial information keywords hydraulic geometry river hydraulics river geometry 1 introduction 1 1 definition of at a station hydraulic geometry ahg the concept of hydraulic geometry was introduced by leopold and maddock 1953 the at a station hydraulic geometry ahg relations are three simple power laws that relate water surface width w average depth y and average velocity u at a stream cross section to the discharge q through the section that is imposed by upstream watershed hydrologic processes 1w w a q b 1y y c q f 1u u k q m a given set of ahg relations applies to within bank flows at a specific cross section with characteristic channel characteristics cross section size shape slope and bed and bank material it is assumed that the channel characteristics do not change sensibly with discharge continuity dictates that 2 w y u q and therefore that 3 b f m 1 and 4 a c k 1 1 2 applications of ahg determinations of discharge derived from measurements of water surface width average depth and average velocity that can be used to determine empirical ahg relations have been recorded for well over a century at tens of thousands of river cross sections worldwide many quantities related to fluvial geomorphic activity hydraulics erosion and sediment transport water quality stream habitat and river navigation are functions of width depth and or velocity thus ahg relations can be used to estimate the values or ranges of discharges for which those quantities have critical values where discharge records are sufficiently long ahg relations can be combined with flow duration curves to estimate the fraction of time that critical values of those quantities occur 1 3 variability and physical basis of ahg prior to dingman 2007 attempts to characterize and explain the variability of observed ahg relations focused virtually exclusively on the exponents the coefficients were treated simply as the unit dependent values of the dependent variables when the discharge equals one unit e g 1 m3 s the most extensive previous surveys rhodes 1977 park 1977 found that the ahg exponents vary over almost the entire physically possible extent of their range from 0 to 1 for example rhodes 1977 found 0 b 0 84 0 01 f 0 84 0 03 m 0 99 there have been many attempts to explain this variability by channel type and geological setting knighton 1975 park 1977 or various metaphysical theories e g most probable state leopold and langbein 1962 minimum variance langbein 1964 williams 1978 equable change miller 1991 maximum entropy and minimum energy dissipation singh and zhang 2008 as singh s 2003 comprehensive review reported these explanations have not proved convincing this should not have been surprising as ferguson 1986 p 25 had reasoned that to explain ahg we need look no further than hydraulics and geometry the cross sectional shape of a channel determines the rate of increase of water width with depth while flow resistance laws define the rate of increase of mean velocity with depth it remained for dingman 2007 to put this reasoning into mathematical form and show that the power law ahg relations can be derived from 1 a power law hydraulic relation between average velocity and average depth and 2 a power law characterization of cross section geometry based on bankfull width bankfull maximum depth and a shape exponent 1 4 study objective dingman s 2007 analytical ahg relations have not previously been compared with empirical i e regression derived ahg relations and that is the principal objective of the present paper the variability of ahg relations and prior to dingman s 2007 analysis the failure to reliably relate them to underlying geometric and hydraulic characteristics have limited the application of ahg related relations for many useful purposes understanding the physical determinants of ahg should provide practical and theoretical insights to stream behavior perhaps including interpretation of remotely sensed observations bjerklie et al 2018 and understanding of downstream hydraulic geometry and the recently described phenomenon of at many stations hydraulic geometry amhg gleason 2015 gleason and wang 2015 2 empirical ahg relations leopold and maddock 1953 determined best fit hydraulic geometry relations simply by eye fitting of points plotted on log log paper subsequent researchers have determined the exponents and coefficients in equations 1 for a given cross section by linear regression of the logarithms of observations from repeated stream gauging measurements at that section 5 l n w l n y l n u l n a l n c l n k b f m l n q and expressing the results as in 1 several authors have pointed out the potential problem of using linear regression of logarithms to estimate the coefficients of power law relations e g helsel and hirsch 1992 p 253 261 and mccuen 1993 p 261 273 the problem is that when the ln w y u values computed via 5 are retransformed the w y u estimates are medians not means of the estimates and tend to be biased low to explore whether this issue has a significant effect on our coefficient estimates we estimated the unbiased empirical power law coefficients for ahg values by multiplying the coefficients determined by log log regression by the duan smearing estimate denoted δ see appendix a as shown in appendix a we found that the 0 75 quantile values of δ for the empirical ahg relations in this study are all 1 003 because 1 it is doubtful that the measurements we use have precision greater than three significant figures 2 we found that the product of the three bias adjusted coefficients was usually significantly greater than its theoretical value of 1 and 3 this unbiasing approach to determining ahg coefficients has not been used in previous studies we retained the traditional practice of using the non bias adjusted coefficients 3 analytical ahg relations 3 1 introduction starting with 1 a generalized hydraulic relation and 2 an idealized model of a symmetrical channel cross section dingman 2007 showed that the empirically observed coefficients and exponents in the ahg relations can be explicitly related to measurable hydraulic and geometric quantities justifying the seminal intuitive insight of leopold and maddock 1953 in calling the empirical phenomenon they discovered hydraulic geometry dingman s 2007 analysis is reviewed and slightly modified here 3 2 hydraulic relation as discussed by manning 1889 ferguson 1986 yen 2002 dingman 2007 and rickenmann and recking 2011 among many many others equations of power law form have been used for characterizing the constitutive relations for one dimensional open channel flow since chézy s original formulation in 1768 these equations are thought to apply where resistance is due predominantly to boundary roughness in his original derivation dingman 2007 used a generalized power law hydraulic relation of the form 6a u k s q y p where k is a generalized conductance coefficient s is energy slope and p and q are exponents the chézy and manning uniform flow equations are the most commonly used versions of this relation in the chézy relation k is chézy s c q 1 2 and p 1 2 in the manning relation k 1 n n is manning s roughness coefficient q 1 2 and p 2 3 neither the chézy manning nor equation 6a relations are in general dimensionally correct and thus require appropriate unit adjustment factors however several studies of large data sets of natural streams have indicated that p and q have different values than assumed in the chézy manning relations e g riggs 1976 dingman and sharma 1997 bjerklie et al 2005 lopez et al 2007 ferguson 2007 ferguson 2010 for the purposes of the present study we incorporate the slope term into the conductance coefficient and use an even more generalized hydraulic relation 6b u κ y p where κ k s q and κ and p are found by log log regression of measured u and y values at each cross section we used this form of the hydraulic relation because values of slope are not available for the individual cross sections used in this study taking this approach allows us to determine whether dingman s 2007 analytical relations for the ahg coefficients and exponents are consistent with a power law that describes the hydraulic relation at the cross section of interest as he postulated note that although the values of the duan bias adjustment factor δ was somewhat higher for κ than for the ahg coefficients see appendix a the median value was 1 004 so again no bias adjustment was made it is important to emphasize that the hydraulic relation used in this study equation 6b is determined empirically at each cross section and requires measurement of average depth and average velocity this paper does not address the question of a priori or general determination of κ and p from channel characteristics especially slope and boundary roughness which as noted is a central problem in open channel hydraulics that has resisted simple solution as described below we tried to select a sample of cross sections at which resistance is dominated by the effects of boundary particle roughness in spite of this we find that the exponent p usually differs substantially from the conventional uniform flow values p 1 2 for chezy 2 3 for manning and that κ varies over several orders of magnitude even between adjacent cross sections in a given reach we could not explore the dependence of p or κ on slope or boundary particle size because the slope and particle size data that are given in hicks and mason 1991 apply to reaches and not to individual cross sections as noted in ferguson 1986 2007 and others the exponent p varies with relative submergence y d where d is a characteristic particle diameter or the one dimensional hydraulic relation may be represented as well or better by a logarithmic or more complex formulation e g ferguson s 2007 eq 20 as by 6b thus a simple power law between velocity and depth may be an approximation of the local hydraulic relation however its use has a long history see ferguson 1986 and is justifiable for the purposes of the present study 3 3 geometric relation in dingman s 2007 derivation the channel cross section is modeled as a symmetrical form given by 7 z ψ bf 2 w bf r x r where z is height of the bed above the lowest channel elevation assumed to occur at the channel center x is horizontal distance from the center ψ bf is the bankfull maximum central depth and wbf is bankfull width fig 1 the exponent r reflects the cross section shape a triangle is represented by r 1 the lane type b stable channel henderson 1966 figs 10 21 by r 1 75 a parabola by r 2 and forms with increasingly flatter bottoms and steeper banks by increasing values of r in the limit as r the channel is rectangular fig 2 although 7 is a model of a symmetrical channel natural channels are not symmetrical and as will be shown in section 6 1 2 the method used here to determine the characteristic value of r at a given cross section is consistent with 7 but does not require that the section be symmetrical 3 4 ahg relations as functions of hydraulics and geometry 3 4 1 ahg coefficients combining relations 1 2 6b and 7 as in dingman 2007 the ahg coefficients are related to cross section hydraulics and geometry as 8a a d w bf r r p δ ψ bf r 1 p δ κ 1 δ 8c c d w bf r δ ψ bf r 1 δ κ r δ 8c k d w bf r p δ ψ bf r p δ κ 1 r δ where 9 δ 1 r r p and 10 r 1 r r and the subscript d indicates coefficient values determined from dingman s analytical expressions via 8 10 3 4 2 ahg exponents the analytical ahg exponents are related to the exponents of the hydraulic and geometric factors as 11b b d 1 δ 11f f d r δ 11 m m d p r δ so that 12r r f d b d 12p p m d f d if r is determined from the channel cross section geometry and p from the cross section hydraulic relation as described we can calculate δ from 9 and r from 10 find bd fd and md from 11 and write the ahg relations of 1 in terms of the channel hydraulics and geometry 13 w w w bf r r p δ ψ bf r 1 p δ q 1 δ 13y y w bf r δ ψ bf r 1 δ κ r δ q r δ 13u u w bf r p δ ψ bf r p δ κ 1 r δ q r p δ note that the exponents on the wbf ψ bf r and κ terms in 13 each sum to 0 and the exponents on q sum to 1 4 research plan the main objective of this paper is to explore the degree to which the ahg coefficients a c k and exponents b f m determined by log log regression of field measurements equal their counterparts ad cd kd and bd fd md calculated via the analytical relations of eqs 8 and 11 for a set of stream cross sections at which flow resistance is dominated by boundary grain roughness and the hydraulic u y relation is well characterized by the simple power law of eq 6b in addition we explore statistically significant relations among ahg determining quantities not predicted by the theory but which if widely observed may have general predictive value 5 field data 5 1 requirements table 1 summarizes the quantities needed to calculate the ahg coefficients and exponents via dingman s 2007 analytical relations eqs 8 and 11 in order to achieve our objectives we require a number of cross sections with 1 reliable determinations of bankfull width wbf and bankfull maximum depth ψ bf 2 measurements of cross section geometry that allow a best fit estimate of the geometric exponent r and 3 sufficient observations of the four ahg variables w y u and q to provide reliable regression estimates of a the hydraulic coefficient κ and exponent p and b the ahg coefficients a c and k and exponents b f and m 5 2 source the field data used in this study are from cross sections and stream discharge measurements measured by the staff of new zealand s national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa in producing its well known publication roughness characteristics of new zealand rivers hicks and mason 1991 through the courtesy of murray hicks of niwa we obtained the original cross section surveys 2 to 5 sections at each of the sites and measurements of hydraulic quantities 3 to 12 flows at each cross section for the 78 reaches included in hicks and mason 1991 as described more fully below we selected from this original data base cross sections in which 1 sediment grain boundary roughness appears to be the dominant source of flow resistance and 2 the hydraulic relation can be well characterized by the power law relation of eq 6b hicks and mason 1991 give values of slope for all flows at all reaches and grain size distributions at most reaches however we found that these data are not useful in our analysis of flows at individual cross sections within a given reach because the original data for each reach give distances between cross sections and water surface elevations at each flow this allows calculation of slopes between adjacent sections but not through each section our attempts to estimate the latter from the data provided gave values that lacked explanatory power similarly the grain size distributions given in hicks and mason 1991 are for reaches not individual cross sections and also lacked explanatory power for our purposes 5 3 data selection the overall goal of our data selection methodology was to identify cross sections at which we could 1 reliably characterize the empirical ahg 2 reliably determine the quantities needed for computing the analytical ahg identified in table 1 and 3 be reasonably confident that flow resistance was primarily due to boundary grain roughness the specific criteria we used for inclusion of cross sections from hicks and mason s 1991 78 reaches are listed in table 2 these criteria are very similar to those used by lopez et al 2007 p 116 in their development of statistical relations between discharge and cross sectional area depth and slope based on criteria 1 5 24 of hicks and mason s 1991 78 reaches were eliminated from further study application of criteria 6 11 resulted in a final data set of 109 cross sections at 34 reaches table 3 lists and gives the dimensions of the reaches included in the analysis 6 determination of geometric and hydraulic quantities from field measurements 6 1 geometric quantities 6 1 1 bankfull maximum depth ψ bf and bankfull width wbf ideally determination of bankfull locations and elevations at the measured sections should be determined in the field based on multiple indicators see for example harrelson and rawlins 1994 rosgen 1996 p 5 8 5 14 personal communication with murray hicks of niwa revealed that no formal attempts were made to identify bankfull elevations when cross sections were surveyed so these indicators were not available in the present study however measurements were generally limited to flows confined within the banks of simple single thread channels hicks and mason 1991 p 2 therefore we assumed that all measured flows were within bank and that surveyed cross sections extended to above bankfull elevation to estimate bankfull levels we first plotted each cross section survey and examined the photographs and cross section plots given in hicks and mason 1991 to eliminate reaches in which channel curvature or vegetation appeared to be significant contributors to flow resistance we assumed that bankfull levels were above the highest observed water surface elevation indicated in their diagrams and usually to be at breaks in slope in many cases the plotted survey data included identical elevations often given to three decimal places that met those criteria on either side of a channel when these were found we assumed that that elevation was bankfull ψ bf was determined as the difference between the bankfull elevation and the lowest surveyed elevation and wbf as the horizontal distance between bankfull elevations on left and right banks to avoid the temptation to fudge the data to make it better fit the theory the initial values determined in this way were not subsequently altered the average values of wbf and the actual and relative i e length divided by average bankfull width reach lengths are given in table 3 and the distributions of wbf and ψ bf are summarized in table 4 6 1 2 geometric exponent r eq 7 leads to the following relations between geometric elements of a cross section 14 y a w 1 r ψ 15 w w bf ψ ψ bf 1 r and 16 a w bf 1 r ψ bf 1 r ψ r where w is water surface width a is wetted cross sectional area and ψ is maximum depth the data provided by niwa for each flow at each cross section include the elevation of the water surface which with the cross section survey allows calculation of the maximum depth ψ the wetted cross sectional area a the hydraulic radius rh and the discharge q determined either by slope area measurements or reliable flow ratings see hicks and mason 1991 p 3 4 we assumed that rh was effectively equal to average depth y and the water surface width was calculated as w a rh using these measurements eqs 7 and 14 16 suggest the four possible methods for estimating r summarized in table 5 all four methods require identification of wbf and ψ bf section 6 1 1 although method 1 is a straightforward test of the basic cross section model of equation 7 we found that it is subject to giving distorted results to the extent that the channel is asymmetrical i e the deepest part of the section is distant from the channel center which is the case for all sections methods 2 3 and 4 do not require the cross section to be symmetrical note however that because 14 relates y and ψ and y a w observations of a as well as w and ψ are required for method 2 method 3 involves only the two channel dimensions that are in principle directly observable w and ψ method 4 requires observations of a w and ψ note also that the regression intercept in this latter relation should be close to ln 1 r ψ bf 1 r and thus depends on r we calculated r using all four methods of table 5 and there was substantial variability in these estimates at many sections based on the above reasoning and before we compared the estimates with the estimate using the regression estimates of b and f we selected method 3 which is based only on observations of the directly observable quantities w and ψ including wbf and ψ bf as the most straightforward and widely useful approach to estimating the geometric exponent r from measurements of channel cross sections in addition to not requiring that the cross section be symmetrical the variability of both w wbf and ψ ψ bf at a cross section is usually less than one order of magnitude so that determination of r 3 by log regression minimizes bias and goodness of fit issues note also that w and ψ are potentially directly observable via remote sensing thus in the remainder of this paper method 3 was used and r r 3 6 2 hydraulic quantities 6 2 1 approach as noted above in order to objectively test dingman s 2007 formulations of the physical basis of ahg we need to specify an explicit constitutive relation between average velocity u and average flow depth y we have assumed this relation can be represented by a power law equation 6b and as noted in criterion 6 of table 2 our sample included only sections where boundary grain roughness appeared to be the major source of resistance and where a power law relation between u and y was statistically significant as noted the values of κ and p were determined by log log regression at each section 6 2 2 hydraulic coefficient κ fig 3 a and table 6 show the distributions of the coefficient κ in the power law hydraulic relation values of κ range over six orders of magnitude 0 000500 to 28 338 but 90 of the values are between 0 199 and 4 57 and 50 are between 0 601 and 1 936 as noted above hydraulic theory indicates that κ should be positively related to slope and inversely related to boundary roughness but the available data did not allow us to investigate those relations at individual cross sections 6 2 3 hydraulic exponent p fig 3b and table 6 show the distributions of the exponent p in the power law hydraulic relation the value of p ranges from 0 234 to 9 785 with 90 of the values between 0 543 and 3 06 and 50 between 0 989 and 1 875 four of the 109p values were less than the chézy value of 0 5 6 were between 0 5 and the manning value of 0 667 and 90 were 0 667 the median p 1 285 and mean p 1 583 values are approximately twice as large as conventional uniform flow values and the values found in the regression models of lopez et al 2007 0 77 0 82 thus our results add to a large body of evidence indicating that velocity usually increases significantly more rapidly with depth than predicted by the manning equation see ferguson 2010 7 comparisons of empirical and analytical ahg quantities 7 1 ahg coefficients 7 1 1 ranges and intercorrelations table 7 and fig 4 show the distributions of the regression derived ahg coefficients a c and k note that there is considerable correlation among the coefficients and between coefficients and exponents in particular a is strongly correlated with wbf r 2 0 770 fig 5 this is unsurprising given that eq 8a shows that a depends on wbf r r p δ and the fraction r r p δ r r p 1 r r p is usually fairly close to 1 if widespread some of these correlations might prove useful in estimating ahg via remote sensing 7 1 2 accuracy of analytical relations fig 6 and table 8 compare the coefficients determined by log log regression with the coefficients calculated via dingman s 2007 analytical relations all the relations between observed and predicted coefficients are highly significant the 95 confidence intervals for the intercepts contain 0 for a and k and are very close to doing so for c the 95 confidence intervals for the slopes slightly exceed 1 for a and c and are 1 for k the predictive relation is closest to 1 1 for the depth coefficient c this may be because ad and kd depend on both the geometric exponent r and the hydraulic exponent p while cd does not depend on p eq 8c the correspondence between the analytical and regression derived coefficients is least good for the width coefficient a this may be due to 1 its strong dependence on the estimate of wbf the value of which may be relatively uncertain and 2 the fact that the exponent on wbf is typically near 1 as noted above eq 8a 7 2 ahg exponents 7 2 1 ranges and intercorrelations table 9 and fig 7 show the distributions of the regression derived ahg exponents b f and m and their correlations with other quantities it is informative to plot the values of b f and m on a triaxial graph fig 8 and compare the distributions we found with those of rhodes 1977 who summarized 577 values taken from the literature we find as did rhodes 1977 that the distributions of f and m are quite symmetrical and quasi normal while that of b is strongly positively skewed and is approximately log normal rhodes 1977 found a larger range for b 0 001 to 0 840 and a similarly positively skewed distribution however his values were more concentrated in the range 0 00 to 0 10 most of both rhodes s 1977 and our values are considerably smaller than the theoretical minimum variance value of b 0 23 derived by leopold and langbein 1962 depth exponents in our sample have a similar range of values to rhodes s but most are less than the theoretical value of 0 42 derived by leopold and langbein 1962 conversely the velocity exponents in our sample are generally higher than rhodes found and tend to be considerably higher than leopold and langbein s theoretical value of m 0 35 7 2 2 accuracy of analytical relations fig 9 and table 10 compare the ahg exponents determined by log log regression with those calculated via dingman s 2007 analytical relations eqs 11 all three empirical ahg exponents are strongly predicted by their estimates based on the cross section channel geometry r and hydraulic p relations for b and f the intercept is not significantly different from 0 and for f and m the slope is not significantly different from 1 7 3 hydraulic conductivity ahg relation from eqs 6b and 1 it can be shown that hydraulic conductivity is related to empirical ahg quantities as 21 κ k c m f analogously conductivity is related to the analytical ahg relations eq 8 as 22 κ k d c d p these theoretical relations are confirmed the empirical value of κ is strongly predicted by the empirical ahg quantities fig 10a and even more strongly by the analytical ahg quantities fig 10b furthermore the relationship between the analytical values kd cd p and the empirical values k c m f is very close to 1 1 if the unexplained anomalous values at butchers xs 1 are omitted fig 10c 8 other relations among variables 8 1 relations among ahg determining variables five independent variables appear in dingman s 2007 analytical ahg relations eqs 8 11 wbf ψ bf r κ p we explored quantitative relations among these variables plus δ 1 r r p that may be of use in predicting ahg from those variables and report apparently significant results here fig 11 shows graphs of each pair of those variables at each of the 109 cross sections and table 11 gives the coefficient of determination r 2 for each pair in only two cases were linear correlations significant at the 0 01 level wbf ψ bf and r δ neither relation provides much insight as a significant relation between bankfull dimensions is expected and δ is determined by both r which varies widely and p which varies across a fairly narrow range in spite of the low linear correlation there appears to be a systematic relation between p and κ for κ 2 fig 12 that can be approximated as 23a p 1 189 κ 0 276 r 2 0 355 or 23b p 0 776 ln κ 1 268 r 2 0 589 which is hydraulically interesting but for which a physical explanation does not occur to us the plot of p vs r in fig 11 suggests the possibility that p declines with increasing r when r 2 5 but is independent of r for larger values however this apparent trend may be due to two anomalously large p values and thus may not indicate an underlying general relation the only other possibly significant relations relate conductivity κ to channel dimensions ψ bf and wbf fig 13 these can be fitted with statistically significant power law relations 24a κ 2 364 ψ bf 0 877 r 2 0 191 and 24b κ 7 061 w bf 0 579 r 2 0 137 but both have considerable scatter and may not prove general or useful especially as there is no apparent physical reason why channel conductivity should decrease with channel size 8 2 significant relations among ahg variables we have already noted 1 a strong relation between the width coefficient a and bankfull width fig 5 that theory eq 8a indicates should be robust and helpful in estimating a via remote sensing and 2 a very strong relation between hydraulic conductivity κ and k c m f fig 10 that is according to our theory an identity eqs 21 and 22 fig 14 shows additional strong relations between 14a the regression derived depth coefficient c and exponent f r 2 0 534 14b c and the ratio of velocity exponent to depth exponent m f p r 2 0 749 and 14c m and f r 2 0 652 the relations of fig 14a and 14b are not predicted by our theory but if found widely may prove useful in estimating ahg relations from remotely sensed or incomplete observations at stream cross sections the relation of fig 14c reflects the fact that b values have a limited range and since b f m 1 f and m tend to be inversely related κ values are strongly α 0 001 correlated positively with k and kd but the r 2 values for these correlations are 0 5 as noted in table 6 the p values in our data are significantly α 0 001 correlated positively with m and c and negatively with f and k the r 2 values with m f and c are all 0 5 the strong correlations with m and f are expected because p m f eq 12p fig 15 shows a strong relation of p with c note from eq 8c that c depends on bankfull width and depth the geometric exponent r and the hydraulic coefficient κ thus this relation might prove helpful in estimating ahg or hydraulic relations from measurable channel characteristics we find a strong negative correlation r 2 0 540 between b and δ this is expected since theoretically b 1 δ eq 11b similarly the strong negative correlation between f and m r 2 0 651 and between f and p r 2 0 591 and strong positive correlation between m and p r 2 0 534 arise because p m f eq 12p 9 summary and conclusions soon after leopold and maddock 1953 discovered the ubiquity of the power law ahg relations a review by mackin 1963 p 148 observed that the ahg equations may be terminal engineering conclusions but from the standpoint of science they are statements of problems not conclusions as noted above subsequent attempts to solve this problem by deriving the values of the ahg exponents from various metaphysical considerations have not proved convincing and in a review of world wide data park 1997 noted that there is no significant evidence of central tendencies for the ahg exponents being related to hydrologic climate or geologic setting and stated p 144 that perhaps the greatest problem remains that of accounting for observed variations in the hydraulic geometry relations ferguson 1986 qualitatively and dingman 2007 quantitatively addressed that problem by showing that the ahg relations can be derived from one dimensional hydraulic principles and cross section geometry the present study confirms their conclusions by showing that dingman s 2007 analytical relations are strong predictors of empirical ahg coefficients and exponents in a sample of 109 cross sections at which boundary grain roughness is the dominant source of resistance the geometric part of these relations depends on bankfull width bankfull maximum depth and an exponent characterizing the relationship between those two quantities that can be estimated from paired observations of width and maximum depth the hydraulic part of the analytical relations as used herein incorporates an empirical characterization of the local hydraulic velocity depth relation as a simple power law the coefficient and exponent of which are in general highly variable from cross section to cross section and the exponent of which is generally considerably different from conventional uniform flow equations such as manning chezy theoretically the coefficient in these relations should depend largely on slope and boundary particle size and may differ for different ratios of depth to particle size but the cross section data used here did not permit exploring that question our study also revealed some fairly strong correlations between elements of ahg that are not predicted by theory that if general may prove useful in predicting ahg from remotely sensed information since all the ahg coefficients depend on bankfull width recently established global relations between wbf and drainage area andreadis et al 2013 wilkerson et al 2014 may also be helpful in predicting ahg relations from remotely sensed data thus our results strongly support the conclusion that ferguson s 1986 conceptual and dingman s 2007 analytical relations correctly identify the hydraulic and geometric relations that give rise to ahg it seems reasonable to hope that this verification of the underlying relations that give rise to ahg could provide a basis for understanding the underlying causes of downstream and at many stations hydraulic geometry gleason 2015 however the problem of determining the physically based local hydraulic relation remains acknowledgments we thank murray hicks of the new zealand national institute of water and atmospheric research niwa for providing us

grove school of engineering internal funding comments from two anonymous reviewers were very helpful in streamlining and improving the paper appendix a the duan smearing factor for bias adjustment it is well known that predictions of dependent variables using ordinary linear regression models developed using logarithms as in eq 5 tend to be low biased to correct for this helsel and hirsch 1992 p 257 recommended adjusting those predictions using the duan 1983 smearing factor δ they noted that the validity of this approach relies only on the assumption that the residuals are independent and homoscedastic the method is robust to the distribution of residuals and is the most generally applicable approach for a regression on natural logarithms the residuals ei are a1 e i ln ξ i ln ξ i where ξi is the measured value at case i and ξ i the value of the dependent variable ξ predicted by linear regression of natural logarithms the bias adjustment factor δ is the average of the retransformed

variable and α and β are the regression intercept and slope respectively determined by natural log regression and the prime indicates the bias adjusted coefficient table a 1 summarizes the ranges of
