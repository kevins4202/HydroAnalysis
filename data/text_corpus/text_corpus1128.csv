5640,scientific viewpoints on the long term hydrological responses to factors other than climatic change remain controversial and yet the impacts of these factors are often neglected at the short term such as monthly and annual timescale we developed an analytical method to decompose evapotranspiration e variability to the variability of precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e 0 total water storage change δs and catchment characteristics n such as vegetation soil and climate seasonality global assessment showed that p enhanced e variability in most regions while restrained e variability in some extremely humid regions e 0 controlled monthly e variability in most the energy constrained regions δs had much larger impacts on e variability at monthly scale compared to the annual scale and restrained e variability in many arid regions p e 0 0 66 catchment characteristics had larger impacts on e variability in humid regions p e 0 0 66 especially at annual scale the dominant factors of e variability varied with timescales and regions at a global scale p and catchment characteristics are the dominant factors controlling global e variability at monthly and annual scales respectively in humid regions however the impacts of e 0 on monthly e variability are generally larger than the impacts of precipitation and catchment characteristics we highlight the necessity to consider the impacts of catchment characteristics even at the short term timescales otherwise the simulation and attribution of e variability would be significantly underestimated keywords climate change global evapotranspiration attribution budyko framework different timescales 1 introduction quantitatively attributing the causes of global hydrometeorological change is important to understanding the global hydrological cycle and energy balance and supports hydrological modeling prediction and management berghuijs et al 2017 berghuijs and woods 2016a haddeland et al 2014 liu et al 2017a yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 recent global studies indicated that catchment characteristics as summarized by n or ω in budyko framework also named as other factors such as vegetation soil and climate seasonality have important impacts on water cycle at long term timescale berghuijs et al 2017 berghuijs and woods 2016a berghuijs and woods 2016b chen et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 found that catchment characteristics had a larger impact on water yield runoff precipitation r p in more humid regions and their contribution tended to increase with the increase of wetness index precipitation potential evapotranspiration p e 0 on the contrary gudmundsson et al 2017 advocated that catchment characteristics influenced water yield in more arid conditions and their contribution decreased with the increase of wetness index these discrepancies demonstrated limited understanding of the roles of catchment characteristics in water availability and variability under different dry wet conditions and their conflicting results may cause divergence in both scientific conclusions and water management therefore revisiting the factors affecting hydrometeorological changes globally and clarifying of the impacts of catchment characteristics are necessary for a better understanding of hydrometeorological processes under the changing environment the variability of e which is directly related to water yield reflects the sensitivity of hydroclimatic responses to the changes of climatic variables and catchment characteristics zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 recent years have witnessed increasing efforts in the quantification of causes behind the e variability in different regions and basins koster and suarez 1999 were the first to derive the standard deviation of e at annual scale based on the budyko framework some studies extended the budyko hypothesis to a finer time scale for hydrological sensitivity and variability analysis by considering total water storage change δs liu et al 2018 wang and alimohammadi 2012 ye et al 2015 zeng and cai 2015 integrating the effect of δs zeng and cai 2015 developed a theoretical framework to assess the sources of e variability from variance and covariance of p e 0 and δs 1 σ e 2 w p 2 σ p 2 w e 0 2 σ e 0 2 w twsc 2 σ twsc 2 w p e 0 c o v p e 0 w p t w s c c o v p t w s c w e 0 t w s c c o v e 0 t w s c this equation is meaningful to extend the hydrological attribution from long term timescale to short term timescales such as monthly and annual scales based on this equation zeng and cai 2016 evaluated the influencing factors behind monthly and annual e variability across 32 large rivers over the globe also some studies applied this framework in attribution analysis of e and runoff r variability across china wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 however some issues need to be addressed in the derivation and application of this equation in attribution analysis 1 this method attributes the variance of e to the variance and covariance of p e 0 and δs e g σ p 2 and c o v p e 0 which makes it impossible to know individual contribution of a single factor 2 as shown later in this paper such an approach prohibits accounting for the impacts of catchment characteristics such as vegetation soil and climate seasonality on e variability which biases the simulation and attribution and needs to be resolved if we want to a better quantify the attribution of e variability previous studies have verified the significant impacts of catchment characteristics on hydrometeorological changes at long term timescale berghuijs et al 2017 jaramillo and destouni 2014 lin et al 2014 lin et al 2010 renner and bernhofer 2012 which may also play a role in e variability at short term timescales such as monthly and annual scales however no reports were found to quantify the impacts of catchment characteristics on monthly and annual e variability especially at global scale as suggested by zhang et al 2016 future research is needed to assess the influences of catchment characteristics on the e variability therefore a new analytical method needs to be developed with considering the impacts of catchment characteristics as well as focusing on the individual contribution of each factor instead of the covariance of two factors overall previous global assessments only attributed the hydrometeorological changes at long term timescale berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2017 yang and yang 2011 zhou et al 2015 and there are conflicting findings in the dominant factors of hydrometeorological changes gudmundsson et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 limited attention has been paid to quantitative attribution at short term timescale wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2015 zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 but the methods used in these studies only can assess the impacts of climatic factors without considering the impacts of catchment characteristics furthermore no systematic study concerning the sources of monthly and annual e variability across the globe has been published yet therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to propose a budyko based e variability decomposition method with the inclusion of catchment characteristics to assess the sources of e variability 2 to clarify the impacts of catchment characteristics on e variability under different dry wet conditions and 3 to evaluate global patterns of the effects of p e 0 δs and catchment characteristics on the variability of e at monthly and annual scales this study can help shed a new light on hydrometeorological responses to affecting factors over the globe in a changing environment 2 methods and data 2 1 data global monthly terrestrial water cycle dataset greenland and antarctica were excluded including p e r and δs 1984 2010 0 5 spatial resolution were collected from terrestrial hydrology research group at princeton university http stream princeton edu 8080 opendap measures wc multisources wb 050 zhang et al 2018 this dataset was merged from multiple data sources such as in situ observations remotely sensed data land surface model outputs and reanalysis datasets for example the δs was merged by simulations from vic model and ensemble mean of δs product derived from grace compared to most dataset from only one single data source this dataset was known as the best available global monthly dataset wu et al 2018 besides a constrained kalman filter data assimilation technique was used to obtain the water balance for each month in addition this dataset was validated by in situ observations such as the observed e data from the fluxnet towers and the runoff data from the global runoff data centre grdc and the united states geological survey usgs which shown that the dataset was reliable and can be used to investigate the impacts of climate variability on hydrological cycle more details about this dataset in terms of data sources data assimilation procedures and uncertainty quantification can be found in zhang et al 2018 the global long term 1901 2015 monthly e 0 dataset was calculated at 0 5 grid resolution by harris et al 2014 from climatic research unit cru in the university of east anglia https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg by using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 penman 1948 2 2 analytical derivation of e variability the budyko framework shows the water supply and available energy are the controlling factors behind the mean e which can be presented by a function of p and e 0 based on the budyko framework several water energy balance equations have been deduced among which the equations by choudhury 1999 and yang et al 2008 have been widely used 2 e p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n where n is the controlling parameter which can be calibrated by minimizing the least squares errors between the simulated e by eq 2 and assessed e from global monthly terrestrial water cycle dataset the n accounts for catchment characteristics that impact the partitioning of p on e such as vegetation soil and climate seasonality limited by steady state assumption of budyko framework the eq 2 was generally used at long term timescale although several studies have applied it to annual timescale the assumption on ignoring the impacts of δ s may be not valid therefore by considering the impacts of δs previous studies have extended the budyko framework to shorter timescale wang and alimohammadi 2012 zeng and cai 2015 3 e i p i δ s i e 0 i p i δ s i n i e 0 i n i 1 n i where i is the time if i is the month this equation is a monthly water energy balance equation at monthly scale then the ni is the mean parameter in the budyko model for the ith month within one year during all the study periods tang et al 2017 xing et al 2018 if i is the year that is an annual water energy balance equation at annual scale hydrological cycle and water balance are not only controlled by climatic changes such as p and e 0 but also regulated by catchment characteristics n such as vegetation soil and climate seasonality fig 1 besides δs plays a more important role in the water energy balance at short term timescale fig 2 since water storage dynamics is significant at monthly and annual scales chen et al 2013 the e can be expressed as the function of p e 0 δs and n e f p e 0 δs n the total differential of e can be expressed as 4 d e i f p d p i f e 0 d e 0 i f δ s d δ s i f n d n i using a first order approximation of e change eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 δ e i f p δ p i f e 0 δ e 0 i f δ s δ s i f n δ n i where δ represents the departure of a quantity during year month i from its long term mean value to avoid variance and covariance in the analytical derivation here we evaluate the variability of e by using the mean absolute deviation mad which shows a similar ability to standard deviation σ in the evaluation of e variability fig 3 6 mad e 1 n i 1 n e i e 1 n i 1 n δ e i 1 n i 1 n s i g n δ e i δ e i where n is the sample size substituting δ e i from eq 4 into eq 5 we can develop an analytical derivation for e variability 7 mad e 1 n i 1 n s i g n δ e i f p d p i f e 0 d e 0 i f δ s d δ s i f n d n i the e variability predicated by eq 7 is referred to simulation while the e variability assessed by standard deviation with the e data from zhang et al 2018 is referred to assessment eq 7 can be presented as 8 mad e i p i e 0 i δ s i n where i p i e 0 i δ s and i n indicate the impacts of p e 0 δ s and catchment characteristics on the e variability respectively 9 i x 1 n i 1 n s i g n δ e i f

n 100 the e variability is subject to temporal shifts at different time scales such as daily monthly annual and long term time scales zeng and cai 2015 ideally the analytical derivation of e variability can be applied to assess the sources of e variability at an arbitrary time scale if the e variability can be calculated at that scale in the current study we mainly evaluate the influences of p e 0 δs and catchment characteristics on the monthly and annual e variability 3 results 3 1 performance of analytical method to verify the reliability of the analytical attribution method we compared the simulated e variability evaluated by analytical method with the assessed e variability calculated by standard deviation fig 4 results shown that the analytical method can well capture the e variability at both monthly and annual scales at the monthly scale the determination coefficient r 2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse between assessed and simulated e variabilities were 0 92 and 0 89 respectively with a root mean square error rmse of 2 96 mm fig 4a if catchment characteristics were not considered in the simulation the simulated e variability was significantly underestimated with a regression coefficient of 0 78 and the simulation accuracy decreased with r 2 and nse of0 85 and 0 63 respectively fig 4b at the annual scale the r 2 and nse values were 0 90 and0 89 respectively with a rmse of 5 16 mm fig 4c if catchment characteristics were not considered r 2 and nse reduced to 0 27 and 0 65 and the simulated e variability was also undervalued fig 4d furthermore the simulation accuracy of e variability by the analytical method in arid regions p e 0 0 66 feng and fu 2013 r 2 0 95 was higher than in humid regions p e 0 0 66 r 2 0 84 at both monthly and annual scales fig 5 implying larger uncertainty in the e behavior in humid regions than in arid regions the simulation errors also varied with latitude and there are relatively larger errors around equator by contrast the e variability was simulated using the method proposed by zeng and cai 2015 who deduced the variance of e into p e 0 and δs without considering the n results shows that the e variability simulated by the method from zeng and cai 2015 was subject to larger errors than that by the newly proposed method and the simulated e variability was underestimated at most latitudes fig 6 this difference mainly because the method developed by zeng and cai 2015 ignored the impacts of catchment characteristics 3 2 global patterns of e variability sources based on eq 9 10 we quantified the global pattern of contributions of p e 0 δs and catchment characteristics to the e variability figs 7 and 8 shows the contributions measured by percentages of each factor to e variability as well as their relationships with wetness index wi p e 0 at monthly and annual scales respectively the positive value means the variability of one factor enhancing the e variability while the negative value means restraining effect in general similar global patterns of contributions at the monthly scale can be observed when compared to that at the annual scale however the p and catchment characteristics had larger impacts on the e variability at annual scale while e 0 and δs had larger impacts at the monthly scale in addition the impacts including the positive and negative impacts of p on e variability tend to increase with the wi wetness index p pet while the impacts of δs e 0 and catchment characteristics tend to decrease with the wi p had a positive impact on e variability in most regions across the globe the contribution of p in arid regions was evidently larger than that in humid regions epically at annual scale figs 9 and 10 such as west asia north africa south africa gobi desert most regions of australia southwestern america and patagonian desert with the contribution larger than 50 figs 7 and 8 on the contrary the contributions of p show negative values in some extreme humid regions such as amazon basin congo basin southeast asia which implies that more p lead to less e in these regions because in these extremely humid regions e is mainly controlled by e 0 rather than p more precipitation is often associated with less solar radiation and larger relative humid díaz torres et al 2017 solomon 1967 which reduces the e 0 and further leads to the decrease of e fig 11 δs had a larger influence on e variability at monthly scale than that at annual scale the contributions of δs are negative in many arid regions especially at annual scale the median contribution of δs for arid regions is 2 9 e 0 had much great impacts on e variability in humid regions than that in arid regions especially at monthly scale with median contribution of 36 3 for the former while 1 9 for the later catchment characteristics enhanced e variability across most regions across the globe while restrained e variability in some extreme arid regions such as sahara desert gobi desert besides the contributions of n to e variability at annual scale are much larger than that at monthly scale with median contribution of 41 9 for the former but 15 2 for the later 3 3 identification of key factors behind e variability the key factors behind the e variability were different spatially fig 12 precipitation is a more important factor behind monthly and annual e variability for 46 and 42 of the global land grid cell which mainly located in the arid regions meanwhile δs had the largest contribution to the e variability across 12 and 2 of the globe at the monthly and annual scales respectively in this sense δs had larger impacts on e at shorter time scales which is agree with the findings in previous study wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 therefore budyko framework should be cautious to use at short term timescales when the δs data is not available regions with a largest contribution of e 0 to the annual e variability only accounted for 2 on the contrary e 0 plays a key role in e variability at monthly scale and controls the e variability for 32 of global regions moreover in the humid regions the impacts of e 0 on e variability with median contribution of 36 3 were generally larger than the impacts of p and catchment characteristics catchment characteristics controlled monthly and annual e variability for 10 and 51 of global regions respectively implying that catchment characteristics are the dominant factor for global e variability at annual scale the above mentioned results indicated that p is the largest contributor to monthly e variability while catchment characteristics is the largest contributor to annual e variability δs play an important role in e variability at monthly scale e 0 mainly controlled monthly e variability in energy constrained and moisture adequate regions 4 discussion this study has made incremental process on several important aspects of hydrometeorological attributing study first a new quantitative framework was developed to attribute e variability at short term timescales which has better performance in simulation and attribution of e variability second although several global assessments have investigated the causes of long term hydrometeorological changes berghuijs et al 2017 berghuijs and woods 2016b gudmundsson et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 this study proposed the first quantification attribution of global e variability at short term timescales i e monthly and annual timescales third the results clarified the roles of catchment characteristics in e variability and challenged the widely held view that climate is the primary source of e variability while catchment characteristics are secondary e g berghuijs et al 2017 wu et al 2017 our results indicated that the dominant factor of e variability varied with timescales and dry wet conditions at a global scale precipitation played a dominant role in e variability at monthly timescale while catchment characteristics dominated e variability at annual scale in humid regions however the impacts of e 0 on monthly e variability are generally larger than the impacts of precipitation and catchment characteristics correctly knowledge of the causes of e variability is crucial for understanding of hydrometeorological processes wu et al 2017 finally some interesting results were found in the causes of e variability it is generally recognized that precipitation played a positive role in e variability zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 however the new finding of study is that precipitation restrains e variability in many extremely humid regions such as amazon and congo basins in contrast total water storage changes strengthened e variability in most humid regions while restrained e variability in many arid regions some previous studies have applied the long term budyko equation to annual scale and seems to get reasonable results when neglecting δs ning et al 2017 potter and zhang 2009 this is owing to the limited impacts of δs on variability at annual timescale fig 9b nevertheless the assumption on ignoring δs may be not valid zeng and cai 2016 the regulating effect of δs on hydrological response has been well documented wang and alimohammadi 2012 zhang et al 2016 in the dry months or years δs can provide available water for e and causes larger e than p which enable the budyko curves poorly capture the e variability fig 2a due to different roles of δs under different arid humid conditions δs tends to enhance e variability in humid regions but restrains it in the arid regions figs 7 8 which is also supported by the findings from zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 and wu et al 2017 the δs regulated the temporal distribution of water availability for e in humid regions δs hold p from the energy limited period to a warm period which increases e in the periods with high energy supply and enhances e variability zeng and cai 2016 these results imply that given exclusions of the impacts of δs e variability would be overestimated in arid regions and underestimated in the humid regions the p plays a dominant role in e variability in most arid regions however in the humid regions the effect of p on e variability is going to be significantly diminished by contrast the e 0 has much larger impacts on e variability in humid regions than that in arid regions these are because the e variability in arid and humid regions are prevalently limited by available water and energy respectively karam and bras 2008 the controlling parameter n in budyko type equation is considered to represent the catchment characteristics which not only related to vegetation soil moisture topography but also include climate seasonality ning et al 2017 snow rates zhang et al 2015 and storminess milly 1994 previous studies have found that the values of n have positive relationship with vegetation coverage soil moisture while negative relationship with basin slope climate seasonality storminess li et al 2013 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2017b padrón et al 2017 xu et al 2013 based on the budyko framework a larger value of n tends to result in a smaller e fig 2 consequently the regions with larger vegetation coverage higher soil moisture smaller slope lower climate seasonality and less storminess would expect to have a higher n value and a larger e we emphasized the necessity to consider the impacts of catchment characteristics on the e variability since previous attributing studies often ignored impacts of catchment characteristics on e changes wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 this argument is not just conceptually important it play a key role in the attributing results of e variability for example wu et al 2017 found that e 0 was the dominant influencing factor behind the annual e variabilty in most regions of south china which was different from the results shown in fig 12 this was because that they only assessed the sources of e variability from climatic factors but excluded the impacts of catchment characteristics our study updated the standing findings concerning the factors behind e wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 moreover previous studies showed large errors in the assessment of e variability wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 by attributing monthly e variability to p e 0 and δs wu et al 2017 found that the simulated e variability was significantly underestimated especially in humid regions also the similar cases were obtained in some large river basins over the world zeng and cai 2016 and lots of small basins across china zhang et al 2016 therefore the remaining question to address is then why are there obvious underestimation in these studies our viewpoint is that previous study ignored the influence of catchment characteristics the results showed that considering catchment characteristics can greatly improve the simulation accuracy of e variability while if excluding the impacts of catchment characteristics the e variability could be obvious underestimated and poorly simulated especially in humid regions in addition catchment characteristics had the largest contribution to e changes in humid regions when compared to the impacts of p e 0 and δs therefore our study reveals the reason why e variability was often distinctly underestimated in previous attributing study wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 that is because they ignored the contributions of catchment characteristics although several studies have investigated the impacts of catchment characteristics globally gudmundsson et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 the contribution of catchment characteristics to e is still open for debate berghuijs and woods 2016b chen et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 suggested that the contribution of catchment characteristics to e was larger in humid regions than in arid regions while gudmundsson et al 2017 found a larger contribution of catchment characteristics in arid regions and the same findings were also from gudmundsson et al 2016 and berghuijs et al 2017 therefore no consensus has been reached so far about the impacts of catchment characteristics on e which can be attributed to different definitions of contributions gudmundsson et al 2017 showed the relative average contribution of finite difference change in m controlling parameter of fu equation also referring to the impacts of catchment characteristics to water yield at the variable range of p e 0 p e 0 δp e 0 and m m δm while zhou et al 2015 suggested the relative contribution of infinitesimal change in m to water yield at exact values of p e 0 and m moreover the afore mentioned studies focused on the water availability changes due to a unit change in p e 0 and m instead of real world changes it is noted that a unit change in p e 0 has entirely a different physical interpretation relative to a unit change in m therefore the current assessments are more a theoretical possibility rather than a reality hence taking the monthly and annual variability of e as examples this study helps shed new light on the real world impacts of catchment characteristics our global patterns of the contributions of p e 0 δs and catchment characteristics to the practical e variability showed that catchment characteristics influenced e changes more in humid regions however the previous global assessments deemed p or p e 0 as the primary factors berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 for example berghuijs et al 2017 indicated that p controls 83 of the land grid cells for runoff changes and catchment characteristics for the remaining 17 the difference can be due to different research objects as well as the difference between practical variability and theoretical changes the development in our study was based on the budyko framework however there are still some uncertainties and limitations first the total differential decomposition of the budyko formula has inherent errors and uncertainties here we did not present uncertainty analysis for the analytical derivation based on the budyko framework yang et al 2014 estimated the errors of the first order taylor expansion of the budyko based equation and found that the errors increased with the variability amplitude of the contributor they showed that a 10 mm increase in precipitation would bring about 0 5 5 0 error in the contribution of precipitation in addition we only highlighted the relative contribution of each contributor to the e variability without providing the specific magnitudes of the impacts since we mainly attempted to investigate the relative importance of these contributors in the e variability 5 conclusions in this study we developed an analytical method to assess the sources of e variability the analytical method simulated the e variability well we highlighted the necessity to consider the impacts of catchment characteristics although at short term timescale since the e variability would be significantly underestimated given exclusion of catchment characteristics precipitation played a more important role in e variability in the humid regions and controlled monthly e variability in most regions across the globe catchment characteristics were the primary contributor for the annual e variability with median contributions of 51 e 0 had a limited impact on annual e variability but played a key role in monthly e variability which controls 32 of global land grid cells the δs had a much large impact at the monthly scale than at the annual scale which played a dominant role in the monthly e variability for 12 of global land grid cells in conclusion the development of analytical derivation for disentangling global e variability has profound implication which provides a new framework for hydrological attribution analysis at short term timescales such as monthly and annual the results clarifying the role of catchment characteristics and its dominant regions are helpful to improve our understanding on hydrometeorological processes

5640,scientific viewpoints on the long term hydrological responses to factors other than climatic change remain controversial and yet the impacts of these factors are often neglected at the short term such as monthly and annual timescale we developed an analytical method to decompose evapotranspiration e variability to the variability of precipitation p potential evapotranspiration e 0 total water storage change δs and catchment characteristics n such as vegetation soil and climate seasonality global assessment showed that p enhanced e variability in most regions while restrained e variability

of e variability varied with timescales and regions at a global scale p and catchment characteristics are the dominant factors controlling global e variability at monthly and annual scales respectively in humid regions however the impacts of e 0 on monthly e variability are generally larger than the impacts of precipitation and catchment characteristics we highlight the necessity to consider the impacts of catchment characteristics even at the short term timescales otherwise the simulation and attribution of e variability would be significantly underestimated keywords climate change global evapotranspiration attribution budyko framework different timescales 1 introduction quantitatively attributing the causes of global hydrometeorological change is important to understanding the global hydrological cycle and energy balance and supports hydrological modeling prediction and management berghuijs et al 2017 berghuijs and woods 2016a haddeland et al 2014 liu et al 2017a yang et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 recent global studies indicated that catchment characteristics as summarized by n or ω in budyko framework also named as other factors such as vegetation soil and climate seasonality have important impacts on water cycle at long term timescale berghuijs et al 2017 berghuijs and woods 2016a berghuijs and woods 2016b chen et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 zhou et al 2015 found that catchment characteristics had a larger impact on water yield runoff precipitation r p in more humid regions and their contribution tended to increase with the increase of wetness index precipitation potential evapotranspiration p e 0 on the contrary gudmundsson et al 2017 advocated that catchment characteristics influenced water yield in more arid conditions and their contribution decreased with the increase of wetness index these discrepancies demonstrated limited understanding of the roles of catchment characteristics in water availability and variability under different dry wet conditions and their conflicting results may cause divergence in both scientific conclusions and water management therefore revisiting the factors affecting hydrometeorological changes globally and clarifying of the impacts of catchment characteristics are necessary for a better understanding of hydrometeorological processes under the changing environment the variability of e which is directly related to water yield reflects the sensitivity of hydroclimatic responses to the changes of climatic variables and catchment characteristics zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 recent years have witnessed increasing efforts in the quantification of causes behind the e variability in different regions and basins koster and suarez 1999 were the first to derive the standard deviation of e at annual scale based on the budyko framework some studies extended the budyko hypothesis to a finer time scale for hydrological sensitivity and variability analysis by considering total water storage change δs liu et al 2018 wang and alimohammadi 2012 ye et al 2015 zeng and cai 2015 integrating the effect of δs zeng and cai 2015 developed a theoretical framework to assess the sources of e variability from variance and covariance of p e 0 and δs 1 σ e 2 w p 2 σ p 2 w e 0 2 σ e 0 2 w twsc 2 σ twsc 2 w p e 0 c o v p e 0 w p

in attribution analysis of e and runoff r variability across china wu et al 2017 zhang et al 2016 however some issues need to be addressed in the derivation and application of this equation in attribution analysis 1 this method attributes the variance of e to the variance and covariance of p e 0 and δs e g σ p 2 and c o v p e 0 which makes it impossible to know individual contribution of a single factor 2 as shown later in this paper such an approach prohibits accounting for the impacts of catchment characteristics such as vegetation soil and climate seasonality on e variability which biases the simulation and attribution and needs to be resolved if we want to a better quantify the attribution of e variability previous studies have verified the significant impacts of catchment characteristics on hydrometeorological changes at long term timescale berghuijs et al 2017 jaramillo and destouni 2014 lin et al 2014 lin et al 2010 renner and bernhofer 2012 which may also play a role in e variability at short term timescales such as monthly and annual scales however no reports were found to quantify the impacts of catchment characteristics on monthly and annual e variability especially at global scale as suggested by zhang et al 2016 future research is needed to assess the influences of catchment characteristics on the e variability therefore a new analytical method needs to be developed with considering the impacts of catchment characteristics as well as focusing on the individual contribution of each factor instead of the covariance of two factors overall previous global assessments only attributed the hydrometeorological changes at long term timescale berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2017 yang and yang 2011 zhou et al 2015 and there are conflicting findings in the dominant factors of hydrometeorological changes gudmundsson et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 limited attention has been paid to quantitative attribution at short term timescale wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2015 zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 but the methods used in these studies only can assess the impacts of climatic factors without considering the impacts of catchment characteristics furthermore no systematic study concerning the sources of monthly and annual e variability across the globe has been published yet therefore the objectives of this study are 1 to propose a budyko based e variability decomposition method with the inclusion of catchment characteristics to assess the sources of e variability 2 to clarify the impacts of catchment characteristics on e variability under different dry wet conditions and 3 to evaluate global patterns of the effects of p e 0 δs and catchment characteristics on the variability of e at monthly and annual scales this study can help shed a new light on hydrometeorological responses to affecting factors over the globe in a changing environment 2 methods and data 2 1 data global monthly terrestrial water cycle dataset greenland and antarctica were excluded including p e r and δs 1984 2010 0 5 spatial resolution were collected from terrestrial hydrology research group at princeton university http stream princeton edu 8080 opendap measures wc multisources wb 050 zhang et al 2018 this dataset was merged from multiple data sources such as in situ observations remotely sensed data land surface model outputs and reanalysis datasets for example the δs was merged by simulations from vic model and ensemble mean of δs product derived from grace compared to most dataset from only one single data source this dataset was known as the best available global monthly dataset wu et al 2018 besides a constrained kalman filter data assimilation technique was used to obtain the water balance for each month in addition this dataset was validated by in situ observations such as the observed e data from the fluxnet towers and the runoff data from the global runoff data centre grdc and the united states geological survey usgs which shown that the dataset was reliable and can be used to investigate the impacts of climate variability on hydrological cycle more details about this dataset in terms of data sources data assimilation procedures and uncertainty quantification can be found in zhang et al 2018 the global long term 1901 2015 monthly e 0 dataset was calculated at 0 5 grid resolution by harris et al 2014 from climatic research unit cru in the university of east anglia https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg by using the penman monteith equation monteith 1965 penman 1948 2 2 analytical derivation of e variability the budyko framework shows the water supply and available energy are the controlling factors behind the mean e which can be presented by a function of p and e 0 based on the budyko framework several water energy balance equations have been deduced among which the equations by choudhury 1999 and yang et al 2008 have been widely used 2 e p e 0 p n e 0 n 1 n where n is the controlling parameter which can be calibrated by minimizing the least squares errors between the simulated e by eq 2 and assessed e from global monthly terrestrial water cycle dataset the n accounts for catchment characteristics that impact the partitioning of p on e such as vegetation soil and climate seasonality limited by steady state assumption of budyko framework the eq 2 was generally used at long term timescale although several studies have applied it to annual timescale the assumption on ignoring the impacts of δ s may be not valid therefore by considering the impacts of δs previous studies have extended the budyko framework to shorter timescale wang and alimohammadi 2012 zeng and cai 2015 3 e i p i δ s i e 0 i p i δ s i n i e 0 i n i 1 n i where i is the time if i is the month this equation is a monthly water energy balance equation at monthly scale then the ni is the mean parameter in the budyko model for the ith month within one year during all the study periods tang et al 2017 xing et al 2018 if i is the year that is an annual water energy balance equation at annual scale hydrological cycle and water balance are not only controlled by climatic changes such as p and e 0 but also regulated by catchment characteristics n such as vegetation soil and climate seasonality fig 1 besides δs plays a more important role in the water energy balance at short term timescale fig 2 since water storage dynamics is significant at monthly and annual scales chen et al 2013 the e can be expressed as the function of p e 0 δs and n e f p e 0 δs n the total differential of e can be expressed as 4 d e i f p d p i f e 0 d e 0 i f δ s d δ s i f n d n i using a first order approximation of e change eq 4 can be rewritten as 5 δ e i f p δ p i f e 0 δ e 0 i f δ s δ s i f n δ n i where δ represents the departure of a quantity during year month i from its long term mean value to avoid variance and covariance in the analytical derivation here we evaluate the variability of e by using the mean absolute deviation mad which shows a similar ability to standard deviation σ in the evaluation of e variability fig 3 6 mad e 1 n i 1 n e i e 1 n i 1 n δ e i 1 n i 1 n s i g n δ e i δ e i

presented as 8 mad e i p i e 0 i δ s i n where i p i e 0 i δ s and i n indicate the impacts of p e 0 δ s and catchment characteristics on the e variability respectively 9 i x 1 n i 1 n s i g n δ e i f

n 100 the e variability is subject to temporal shifts at different time scales such as daily monthly annual and long term time scales zeng and cai 2015 ideally the analytical derivation of e variability can be applied to assess the sources of e variability at an arbitrary time scale if the e variability can be calculated at that scale in the current study we mainly evaluate the influences of p e 0 δs and catchment characteristics on the monthly and annual e variability 3 results 3 1 performance of analytical method to verify the reliability of the analytical attribution method we compared the simulated e variability evaluated by analytical method with the assessed e variability calculated by standard deviation fig 4 results shown that the analytical method can well capture the e variability at both monthly and annual scales at the monthly scale the determination coefficient r 2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient nse between assessed and simulated e variabilities were 0 92 and 0 89 respectively with a root mean square error rmse of 2 96 mm fig 4a if catchment characteristics were not considered in the simulation the simulated e variability was significantly underestimated with a regression coefficient of 0 78 and the simulation accuracy decreased with r 2 and nse of0 85 and 0 63 respectively fig 4b at the annual scale the r 2 and nse values were 0 90 and0 89 respectively with a rmse of 5 16 mm fig 4c if catchment characteristics were not considered r 2 and nse reduced to 0 27 and 0 65 and the simulated e variability was also undervalued fig 4d furthermore the simulation accuracy of e variability by the analytical method in arid regions p e 0 0 66 feng and fu 2013 r 2 0 95 was higher than in humid regions p e 0 0 66 r 2 0 84 at both monthly and annual scales fig 5 implying larger uncertainty in the e behavior in humid regions than in arid regions the simulation errors also varied with latitude and there are relatively larger errors around equator by contrast the e variability was simulated using the method proposed by zeng and cai 2015 who deduced the variance of e into p e 0 and δs without considering the n results shows that the e variability simulated by the method from zeng and cai 2015 was subject to larger errors than that by the newly proposed method and the simulated e variability was underestimated at most latitudes fig 6 this difference mainly because the method developed by zeng and cai 2015 ignored the impacts of catchment characteristics 3 2 global patterns of e variability sources based on eq 9 10 we quantified the global pattern of contributions of p e 0 δs and catchment characteristics to the e variability figs 7 and 8 shows the contributions measured by percentages of each factor to e variability as well as their relationships with wetness index wi p e 0 at monthly and annual scales respectively the positive value means the variability of one factor enhancing the e variability while the negative value means restraining effect in general similar global patterns of contributions at the monthly scale can be observed when compared to that at the annual scale however the p and catchment characteristics had larger impacts on the e variability at annual scale while e 0 and δs had larger impacts at the monthly scale in addition the impacts including the positive and negative impacts of p on e variability tend to increase with the wi wetness index p pet while the impacts of δs e 0 and catchment characteristics tend to decrease with the wi p had a positive impact on e variability in most regions across the globe the contribution of p in arid regions was evidently larger than that in humid regions epically at annual scale figs 9 and 10 such as west asia north africa south africa gobi desert most regions of australia southwestern america and patagonian desert with the contribution larger than 50 figs 7 and 8 on the contrary the contributions of p show negative values in some extreme humid regions such as amazon basin congo basin southeast asia which implies that more p lead to less e in these regions because in these extremely humid regions e is mainly controlled by e 0 rather than p more precipitation is often associated with less solar radiation and larger relative humid díaz torres et al 2017 solomon 1967 which reduces the e 0 and further leads to the decrease of e fig 11 δs had a larger influence on e variability at monthly scale than that at annual scale the contributions of δs are negative in many arid regions especially at annual scale the median contribution of δs for arid regions is 2 9 e 0 had much great impacts on e variability in humid regions than that in arid regions especially at monthly scale with median contribution of 36 3 for the former while 1 9 for the later catchment characteristics enhanced e variability across most regions across the globe while restrained e variability in some extreme arid regions such as sahara desert gobi desert besides the contributions of n to e variability at annual scale are much larger than that at monthly scale with median contribution of 41 9 for the former but 15 2 for the later 3 3 identification of key factors behind e variability the key factors behind the e variability were different spatially fig 12 precipitation is a more important factor behind monthly and annual e variability for 46 and 42 of the global land grid cell which mainly located in the arid regions meanwhile δs had the largest contribution to the e variability across 12 and 2 of the globe at the monthly and annual scales respectively in this sense δs had larger impacts on e at shorter time scales which is agree with the findings in previous study wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 therefore budyko framework should be cautious to use at short term timescales when the δs data is not available regions with a largest contribution of e 0 to the annual e variability only accounted for 2 on the contrary e 0 plays a key role in e variability at monthly scale and controls the e variability for 32 of global regions moreover in the humid regions the impacts of e 0 on e variability with median contribution of 36 3 were generally larger than the impacts of p and catchment characteristics catchment characteristics controlled monthly and annual e variability for 10 and 51 of global regions respectively implying that catchment characteristics are the dominant factor for global e variability at annual scale the above mentioned results indicated that p is the largest contributor to monthly e variability while catchment characteristics is the largest contributor to annual e variability δs play an important role in e variability at monthly scale e 0 mainly controlled monthly e variability in energy constrained and moisture adequate regions 4 discussion this study has made incremental process on several important aspects of hydrometeorological attributing study first a new quantitative framework was developed to attribute e variability at short term timescales which has better performance in simulation and attribution of e variability second although several global assessments have investigated the causes of long term hydrometeorological changes berghuijs et al 2017 berghuijs and woods 2016b gudmundsson et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 this study proposed the first quantification attribution of global e variability at short term timescales i e monthly and annual timescales third the results clarified the roles of catchment characteristics in e variability and challenged the widely held view that climate is the primary source of e variability while catchment characteristics are secondary e g berghuijs et al 2017 wu et al 2017 our results indicated that the dominant factor of e variability varied with timescales and dry wet conditions at a global scale precipitation played a dominant role in e variability at monthly timescale while catchment characteristics dominated e variability at annual scale in humid regions however the impacts of e 0 on monthly e variability are generally larger than the impacts of precipitation and catchment characteristics correctly knowledge of the causes of e variability is crucial for understanding of hydrometeorological processes wu et al 2017 finally some interesting results were found in the causes of e variability it is generally recognized that precipitation played a positive role in e variability zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 however the new finding of study is that precipitation restrains e variability in many extremely humid regions such as amazon and congo basins in contrast total water storage changes strengthened e variability in most humid regions while restrained e variability in many arid regions some previous studies have applied the long term budyko equation to annual scale and seems to get reasonable results when neglecting δs ning et al 2017 potter and zhang 2009 this is owing to the limited impacts of δs on variability at annual timescale fig 9b nevertheless the assumption on ignoring δs may be not valid zeng and cai 2016 the regulating effect of δs on hydrological response has been well documented wang and alimohammadi 2012 zhang et al 2016 in the dry months or years δs can provide available water for e and causes larger e than p which enable the budyko curves poorly capture the e variability fig 2a due to different roles of δs under different arid humid conditions δs tends to enhance e variability in humid regions but restrains it in the arid regions figs 7 8 which is also supported by the findings from zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 and wu et al 2017 the δs regulated the temporal distribution of water availability for e in humid regions δs hold p from the energy limited period to a warm period which increases e in the periods with high energy supply and enhances e variability zeng and cai 2016 these results imply that given exclusions of the impacts of δs e variability would be overestimated in arid regions and underestimated in the humid regions the p plays a dominant role in e variability in most arid regions however in the humid regions the effect of p on e variability is going to be significantly diminished by contrast the e 0 has much larger impacts on e variability in humid regions than that in arid regions these are because the e variability in arid and humid regions are prevalently limited by available water and energy respectively karam and bras 2008 the controlling parameter n in budyko type equation is considered to represent the catchment characteristics which not only related to vegetation soil moisture topography but also include climate seasonality ning et al 2017 snow rates zhang et al 2015 and storminess milly 1994 previous studies have found that the values of n have positive relationship with vegetation coverage soil moisture while negative relationship with basin slope climate seasonality storminess li et al 2013 liu et al 2019 liu et al 2017b padrón et al 2017 xu et al 2013 based on the budyko framework a larger value of n tends to result in a smaller e fig 2 consequently the regions with larger vegetation coverage higher soil moisture smaller slope lower climate seasonality and less storminess would expect to have a higher n value and a larger e we emphasized the necessity to consider the impacts of catchment characteristics on the e variability since previous attributing studies often ignored impacts of catchment characteristics on e changes wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 this argument is not just conceptually important it play a key role in the attributing results of e variability for example wu et al 2017 found that e 0 was the dominant influencing factor behind the annual e variabilty in most regions of south china which was different from the results shown in fig 12 this was because that they only assessed the sources of e variability from climatic factors but excluded the impacts of catchment characteristics our study updated the standing findings concerning the factors behind e wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 moreover previous studies showed large errors in the assessment of e variability wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 zhang et al 2016 by attributing monthly e variability to p e 0 and δs wu et al 2017 found that the simulated e variability was significantly underestimated especially in humid regions also the similar cases were obtained in some large river basins over the world zeng and cai 2016 and lots of small basins across china zhang et al 2016 therefore the remaining question to address is then why are there obvious underestimation in these studies our viewpoint is that previous study ignored the influence of catchment characteristics the results showed that considering catchment characteristics can greatly improve the simulation accuracy of e variability while if excluding the impacts of catchment characteristics the e variability could be obvious underestimated and poorly simulated especially in humid regions in addition catchment characteristics had the largest contribution to e changes in humid regions when compared to the impacts of p e 0 and δs therefore our study reveals the reason why e variability was often distinctly underestimated in previous attributing study wu et al 2017 zeng and cai 2016 that is because they ignored the contributions of catchment characteristics although several studies have investigated the impacts of catchment characteristics globally gudmundsson et al 2016 zhou et al 2015 the contribution of catchment characteristics to e is still open for debate berghuijs and woods 2016b chen et al 2016 gudmundsson et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 suggested that the contribution of catchment characteristics to e was larger in humid regions than in arid regions while gudmundsson et al 2017 found a larger contribution of catchment characteristics in arid regions and the same findings were also from gudmundsson et al 2016 and berghuijs et al 2017 therefore no consensus has been reached so far about the impacts of catchment characteristics on e which can be attributed to different definitions of contributions gudmundsson et al 2017 showed the relative average contribution of finite difference change in m controlling parameter of fu equation also referring to the impacts of catchment characteristics to water yield at the variable range of p e 0 p e 0 δp e 0 and m m δm while zhou et al 2015 suggested the relative contribution of infinitesimal change in m to water yield at exact values of p e 0 and m moreover the afore mentioned studies focused on the water availability changes due to a unit change in p e 0 and m instead of real world changes it is noted that a unit change in p e 0 has entirely a different physical interpretation relative to a unit change in m therefore the current assessments are more a theoretical possibility rather than a reality hence taking the monthly and annual variability of e as examples this study helps shed new light on the real world impacts of catchment characteristics our global patterns of the contributions of p e 0 δs and catchment characteristics to the practical e variability showed that catchment characteristics influenced e changes more in humid regions however the previous global assessments deemed p or p e 0 as the primary factors berghuijs et al 2017 gudmundsson et al 2017 zhou et al 2015 for example berghuijs et al 2017 indicated that p controls 83 of the land grid cells for runoff changes and catchment characteristics for the remaining 17 the difference can be due to different research objects as well as the difference between practical variability and theoretical changes the development in our study was based on the budyko framework however there are still some uncertainties and limitations first the total differential decomposition of the budyko formula has inherent errors and uncertainties here we did not present uncertainty analysis for the analytical derivation based on the budyko framework yang et al 2014 estimated the errors of the first order taylor expansion of the budyko based equation and found that the errors increased with the variability amplitude of the contributor they showed that a 10 mm increase in precipitation would bring about 0 5 5 0 error in the contribution of precipitation in addition we only highlighted the relative contribution of each contributor to the e variability without providing the specific magnitudes of the impacts since we mainly attempted to investigate the relative importance of these contributors in the e variability 5 conclusions in this study we developed an analytical method to assess the sources of e variability the analytical method simulated the e variability well we highlighted the necessity to consider the impacts of catchment characteristics although at short term timescale since the e variability would be significantly underestimated given exclusion of catchment characteristics precipitation played a more important role in e variability in the humid regions and controlled monthly e variability in most regions across the globe catchment characteristics were the primary contributor for the annual e variability with median contributions of 51 e 0 had a limited impact on annual e variability but played a key role in monthly e variability which controls 32 of global land grid cells the δs had a much large impact at the monthly scale than at the annual scale which played a dominant role in the monthly e variability for 12 of global land grid cells in conclusion the development of analytical derivation for disentangling global e variability has profound implication which provides a new framework for hydrological attribution analysis at short term timescales such as monthly and annual the results clarifying the role of catchment characteristics and its dominant regions are helpful to improve our understanding on hydrometeorological processes

5641,vegetation cover is a frequently used indicator for assessing terrestrial ecosystem conditions it is important to investigate the spatial and temporal change patterns of vegetation cover and quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover dynamics in this study the cross wavelet analysis was first applied to reveal the detailed associations between the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and precipitation air temperature as well as their evolution characteristics then a support vector machine svm based simulation model was introduced to quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover dynamics results indicated that 1 the proposed ga svm model is reliable in reproducing the observed ndvi series 2 the increasing trend of annual ndvi was primarily contributed by the increase in spring and autumn during which precipitation and air temperature changes lead to the lengthening of vegetation growing season 3 for the wei river basin as a whole climate change effects about 59 3 on ndvi are stronger than those by human activities nearly 40 7 whereas human activities including the large scale grain for green program are exerting the dominant influences in the beiluo river basin the findings of this study are helpful for guiding the ecological restoration practices in the loess plateau under the backdrop of changing environment keywords vegetation cover ndvi quantitative analysis the cross wavelet analysis ga svm 1 introduction vegetation is a critical component of the terrestrial ecosystem and has strong effects on the interception of rainfall runoff yield mechanism soil and water conservation and prevention of desertification in arid and semi arid regions chen et al 2007a mohammad and adam 2010 zhu and zhu 2012 sun et al 2015 han et al 2019 thus it is a frequently used indicator for assessing terrestrial environmental conditions wang et al 2015 variations of vegetation spatiotemporal patterns change the structures and functions of landscape system thus impacting ecological processes smith et al 2013 wang et al 2012 zhao et al 2019a 2020a the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is defined as the difference between the reflectance in the near infrared band 780 890 nm and the red band 610 680 nm it is an index of the greenness and productivity of vegetation and is sensitive to the density presence and dynamics of vegetation bannari et al 1995 a higher ndvi means a larger green vegetation density hence ndvi is regarded as an effective index for analyzing the effects of climate change and human activities on ecological environment pettorelli et al 2005 the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation cover is closely associated with climate change wang et al 2015 sun et al 2015 zhao et al 2020b the changes in vegetation are sensitive to precipitation variations xu et al 2008 theoretically the increase of precipitation could lead to improvement of vegetation cover particularly in the arid and semi arid areas yang et al 2002 zhang et al 2013 ren et al 2019 besides temperature is an important factor controlling the seasonal changes in vegetation growth hao et al 2012 previous studies pointed out that global warming is the primary driver for the prolonged vegetation growing periods observed in middle high latitudes of the northern hemisphere jeong et al 2011 xu et al 2013 many previous studies have also investigated the correlations between vegetation cover and climatic variables chen et al 2005 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 sun et al 2015 dai et al 2020 zhao et al 2019b conducted a copula based detection of the abrupt change in the seasonal vegetation climate relationship in the jing river basin china most of them successfully captured their correlations however as the methods adopted in these previous studies were restricted to the simple correlation analysis they can only reveal the general linkages between vegetation cover and climate variables thus the dynamics of linkages between vegetation cover and climate variables cannot be fully captured by the simple correlation method these dynamics are of important value for better understanding the response of vegetation cover to the changing environment thereby facilitating the adaptive capacity to climate change and environmental and ecological improvement therefore the cross wavelet analysis a new technique based on the cross spectrum analysis and wavelet transform hudgins and huang 1996 torrence and compo 1998 was employed in this study to reveal the evolution characteristics of the linkages between vegetation cover and climate variables in addition to climate change human activities have significantly affected vegetation cover wang et al 2015 variations of land use induced by human activities such as agriculture and urbanization are important factors affecting the spatial patterns of vegetation piao et al 2005 during the last few decades the excessive deforestation and the expansion of cropland and built up areas have led to land degradation desertification and soil erosion maeda et al 2010 garcia ruiz 2010 nunes et al 2011 posing profound impacts on agricultural production as well as social and economic sustainability under the backdrop of growing population and rapid economic development in china yang et al 2005 however previous studies mainly focused on the integrated effects of climate change and human activities on the inter annual variations of vegetation cover wang et al 2008 2014 to the best of our knowledge quantifying the effects of climatic and anthropogenic variations on vegetation cover variations remains to be unresolved in order to bridge this knowledge gap a numerical model based on the support vector machine svm which is one of the most effective prediction tools yu et al 2012 lin et al 2013 huang et al 2014a 2016a was adopted in this study to distinguish the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover changes the svm based numerical model was utilized to model ndvi under the relative natural conditions when the effects of human activities on vegetation cover variations are weak based on meteorological data including precipitation and air temperature based on the difference between model simulations and observations the contribution of climate change and human activities to vegetation cover dynamics can be calculated soil and water erosion caused by vegetation degeneration is one of the most serious problems in the loess plateau of china zheng et al 2012 the wei river is the biggest first level tributary of the yellow river and its biggest tributary the jinghe river flows through the loess plateau the jinghe river is the main source of sediment loads in the yellow river zheng et al 2012 the vegetation cover of the jinghe river basin is low and has a high sediment concentration with a fast flow rate leading to serious erosions as a result there is approximately 3 108 t sediment load flowing into the wei river from the jinghe river every year zhu et al 2012 the soil and water loss in the wei river basin is a very serious issue according to previous studies huang et al 2014b c the climate of wei river basin has showed a warming and drying trend over the past decades which may theoretically reduce the vegetation cover density due to the decreasing water availability in this basin thereby aggravating local water and soil loss to address this environmental problem the chinese government initiated a large scale ecological restoration program referred to as grain to green in 1999 lü et al 2012 which is regarded as one of the most critical and effective approaches for improving local vegetation cover zhao et al 2019a fang et al 2019a however little is known concerning the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to vegetation dynamics in a changing environment thus it is essential to evaluate the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation cover in the wei river basin and quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover dynamics in order to provide a solid basis for regional ecological restoration assessment the primary objectives of this study are to 1 assess the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation cover in the wei river basin 2 investigate the evolution characteristics of the relationship between ndvi and precipitation air temperature 3 quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover dynamics these results could help further understand the present vegetation condition and development facilitate the evaluation of the grain to green program s impacts on environmental restoration and provide a useful reference for future ecological policies in the wei river basin 2 study area and data 2 1 the wei river basin the wei river basin a typical loess plateau watershed in china is chosen as the study area in this present study fig 1 the wei river is situated between 33 5 n 37 5 n and 103 5 e 110 5 e covering a total area of approximately 1 35 105 km2 topographically the altitude decreases from the highest mountainous areas in the northwest portion of the basin to the lowest guanzhong plain in its southeast and southern part located in the continental monsoon climate zone the wei river basin is characterized by abundant precipitation and high temperature in summer with sparse precipitation and low temperature in winter ren et al 2020 its annual precipitation is about 559 mm zhang et

et al 2015 in order to improve the ecological environment the chinese government conducted a large scale ecological restoration program called grain to green in 1999 since then the vegetation cover has rapidly increased in the wei river basin chang et al 2015 therefore the time series from 1982 to 1999 was selected as the baseline period during which the effect of human activities are relatively small fang et al 2019a the svm based numerical model was calibrated and verified based on the ndvi precipitation and air temperature data of the baseline with precipitation and air temperature as the input variables and ndvi as the output variable the genetic algorithm ga was used to obtain the optimal parameters of the svm model chen et al 2007b chang et al 2010 hence the simulated ndvi in the baseline is only affected by climate change then the optimal parameters of the model obtained in the baseline keep unchanged and are used to simulate the ndvi in the period of 2000 2010 which is referred to as the impacted period the difference of observed ndvi between the baseline period and impacted period consists of two aspects δ n c representing the variations resulting from climate change and δ n h denoting the variations caused by human activities thus the difference between the observed ndvi of the two periods represents the effects of both climate change and human activities 2 δ n h δ n c n i n b δ n h n i n m δ n c n m n b where δ n c and δ n h denotes the changes in ndvi resulting from climate change and human activities respectively n b and n i stand for mean observed ndvi of the natural period and impacted period respectively n m denotes the mean ndvi simulated by the svm based model then the contribution of climate change and human activities on ndvi can be calculated following eq 3 3 η c lim δ n c δ n c δ n h 100 η hum δ n h δ n c δ n h 100 where η hum and η c lim are the relative effects of human activities and climate change on ndvi variations respectively the nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc was applied to assess the performance of the svm based simulation model which was expressed as 4 nsc 1 n obs n sim 2 n obs n obs 2 where n obs and n sim represent the observed and simulated ndvi respectively n obs denotes the average value of n obs 4 results and discussion 4 1 spatial distribution characteristic of ndvi in the wei river basin the mean annual ndvi values of each subzone in the wei river basin were calculated and their spatial distribution patterns were shown in fig 2 generally the ndvi values in the east of the basin are larger than those in the west of the basin while those in the south of the basin ranging from 0 51 to 0 60 are higher than those in the north of the basin varying from 0 29 to 0 39 the average of annual ndvi values in the whole basin is about 0 46 4 2 the change trend of ndvi precipitation and air temperature in the wei river basin the modified mann kendall trend test method mmk huang et al 2014b fang et al 2019b was used to calculate the trends of annual fig 3 and seasonal fig 4 ndvi covering 1982 2010 in the wei river basin it can be observed from fig 3 that the annual ndvi in all subzones shows a statistically significant increasing trend at the 99 confidence level except for subzone 3 where the upward trend of annual ndvi is significant at the 95 confidence level in general the whole wei river basin is characterized by statistically significant increasing annual ndvi indicating that the vegetation cover of the basin has exhibited a noticeably increasing trend at the annual scale in the period of 1982 2010 as for the jinghe river basin and the beiluo river basin their annual ndvi values also show a significant increasing trend this finding is consistent with sun et al 2015 which detected a significant increasing trend of annual ndvi in the loess plateau at the seasonal scale the ndvi in the jinghe river basin beiluo river basin and the wei river basin as a whole shows a statistically significant increasing trend at the 95 confidence level in spring and autumn in summer and winter the ndvi of all subzones has no obvious change trend except for subzones 6 and 8 where a statistically significant upward tendency of ndvi in winter is observed at the 95 confidence level besides the ndvi in summer is generally characterized by a non significant decreasing trend in the wei river basin thus the increase of ndvi in spring and autumn contributes to the overall increase of annual ndvi in the wei river basin previous studies randerson et al 1999 zhou et al 2001 have reported that the strikingly increasing trends of ndvi in spring and autumn imply the advancing and delaying of vegetation growing season respectively hence the increasing trends of ndvi occurring in spring and autumn contribute to the lengthened vegetation growing season thus resulting in the increase of the annual ndvi similarly the mmk was applied to calculate the trends of seasonal and annual precipitation and air temperature spanning 1982 2010 in the wei river basin for the sake of brevity we primarily analyzed the trends of seasonal and annual precipitation and air temperature in the jinghe subzone 1 beiluo subzone 2 and whole wei river basin which are shown in table 1 at the seasonal scale precipitation in the three basins shows a non significant trend in four seasons except for winter when precipitation in the beiluo river basin has a statistical significant increasing trend at the 95 confidence level air temperature in the three basins exhibits a statistical significant increasing trend at the 95 confidence level in four seasons except for autumn in the beiluo and wei river basin at the annual scale precipitation in the three basins is characterized by a non significant decreasing trend whilst air temperature is characterized by a statistically significant increasing trend at the 99 confidence level the warming and drying climate may influence the vegetation cover in the wei river basin and the detailed influences will be explored in the following section 4 3 the correlations between ndvi and precipitation air temperature the correlation coefficients between ndvi and precipitation air temperature in the three basins were computed table 2 which help to preliminarily determine the dominate factor of climatic variables at the seasonal scale precipitation shows a weak relationship with ndvi in four seasons except for winter when the negative correlation between precipitation and ndvi is high in the jinghe and beiluo river basin air temperature exhibits a strongly positive correlation with ndvi in four seasons except for summer when the relationship between air temperature and ndvi is weak in the three basins at the annual scale precipitation shows a weak correlation with ndvi in the three basins whilst air temperature shows a strongly positive correlation with ndvi in the three basins at the monthly scale both precipitation and air temperature show a strongly positive correlation with ndvi indicating that the association between precipitation air temperature and ndvi at the monthly scale is stronger than that at the seasonal and annual scales generally the associations between air temperature and ndvi are stronger than those between precipitation and ndvi in the three basins at various time scales in order to further investigate the detailed linkages between ndvi and precipitation air temperature along with the evolution characteristics of their linkages the cross wavelet analysis was employed in this study the cross wavelet transforms between ndvi and precipitation air temperature at the annual scale in the jinehe beiluo and wei river basin are displayed in figs 5 7 respectively fig 5a indicates that the correlations between precipitation and ndvi at the annual scale are weak in the jinghe river basin during the period of 1982 2010 except that it shows a statistically positive correlation with ndvi at the 95 confidence level with a signal of 7 year during 1992 1996 however air temperature exhibits a strongly positive relationship with ndvi with a signal of 3 4 year during 1987 1993 and 1995 2000 these results further verify that the effects of air temperature on ndvi variations are stronger than those by precipitation at the annual scale in the jinghe river basin it can be observed from fig 6a that precipitation shows a strongly negative correlation with ndvi with a signal of 4 6 year during 1983 1992 at the annual scale in the beiluo river basin which is consistent with the findings from table 2 however for the remainder period precipitation shows no obvious correlation with ndvi in the beiluo river basin with regards to air temperature its exhibits a statistically significant positive correlation with ndvi with a signal of 3 5 years during 1984 1999 and a signal of 8 9 years during 1990 1997 at the annual scale in the beiluo river basin fig 6b which is similar to the results from table 2 but showing the changing relationship between precipitation air temperature with ndvi in the beiluo river basin overall the pattern of the wavelet transform between ndvi and precipitation air temperature in the wei rivers basin fig 7 is similar to that in the beiluo river basin fig 6 precipitation shows a statistically significant negative association at the 95 confidence level with ndvi with a signal of 3 6 years during 1984 1991 while air temperature exhibits a strongly positive association with ndvi with a signal of 3 5 years during 1984 1999 in the wei river basin as outlined above the associations between precipitation air temperature and ndvi vary at different time scales in the wei river basin thus the associations between precipitation air temperature and ndvi at the monthly scale in the three basins were explored in addition to the annual scale the cross wavelet transform between ndvi and precipitation a air temperature b at the monthly scale in the wei rivers basin is illustrated in fig 8 it can be obviously observed from fig 8 that both precipitation and air temperature show a statistically significant positive association with ndvi with a signal of 8 16 months during the entire period at the monthly scale in the wei river basin the linkages between air temperature and ndvi are a litter stronger than those between precipitation and ndvi which is consistent with the findings of table 2 the pattern of the associations between precipitation air temperature and ndvi at the monthly scale in the jinghe and beiluo river basin is similar to that in the wei river basin for the sake of brevity their cross wavelet transform figures are omitted these results indicate that the associations between climate variables and ndvi vary at various time scales and those at the monthly scale are obviously stronger than those at the annual scale 4 4 quantifying the effects of climate change and human activities on ndvi dynamics the ndvi precipitation and air temperature data in 1982 1991 were adopted for calibration while the data in 1992 1999 were utilized for verification in the jinghe beiluo and wei river basin the optimal parameters of svm model based on ga in the calibration and verification periods in the three basins are illustrated in table 3 the performances of the svm based model in the three basins are presented in table 4 the nsc values of both the calibration and verification periods are more than 0 90 in the three basins indicating that the svm based simulation model has a good performance in modelling ndvi in the three basins the simulated and observed ndvi in the calibration and verification periods in the three basins are shown in fig 9 in general the simulated ndvi in the calibration and verification periods has a good consistence with the observed ndvi in the three basins hence the simulation accuracy of the svm based simulation model in the calibration and verification periods was acceptable and it can be reliably used to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on ndvi variations in the impacted period according to eqs 2 and 3 the effects of climate change and human activities on ndvi dynamics in the three basins were calculated which are displayed in table 5 for the jinghe and wei river basin the impacts of climate change 59 7 and 59 3 respectively on ndvi variations are stronger than those by human activities 40 3 and 40 7 respectively regarding the beiluo river basin the effects of human activities 50 5 on ndvi variations are slightly stronger than those by climate change 49 5 indicating that human activities are the dominant factor influencing vegetation cover dynamics in the beiluo river basin from the perspective of climate change temperature and precipitation changes xie et al 2015 and their interactions du et al 2019 play an important role in affecting vegetation phenology du et al 2019 pointed out that temperature and precipitation variations in the arid mountains of china contributed more than 30 of the total variations in predicted ecosystem level starting date of vegetation growing season sos therefore temperature and precipitation changes and their interactions can influence the sos thus partly resulting in the increase of ndvi in the wrb from the perspective of human activities the soil conservation practices are a major form soil loss is a very severe issue in the wrb thus soil conservation practices including afforestation grass planting building check dams and creation of level terraces have been conducted since 1960 chang et al 2015 huang et al 2016 the statistics of soil conservation practices in the wrb are shown in table 6 huang et al 2016 table 6 displays that the soil conservation areas have expanded with time and the growth rate increased strikingly after 2000 this could be attributed to the initiation of the large scale grain for green program by the chinese government in 1999 which is designed to replace the poorly performing farmland on steep slopes 25 with forests and grassland to restore ecosystem service the soil conservation practices lead to a significant increase of vegetation cover in the wrb zhao et al 2019a also found that the grain for green program exerted significant influences on vegetation dynamics therefore both climate change and human activities play critical roles in ndvi variations in the wei river basin and the effects of grain to green on local ndvi dynamics are non negligible 5 conclusions it is important to investigate the historical changes in vegetation cover and quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover variations which helps to improve regional ecological environment in this study the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation cover indicated by ndvi in the wei river basin were first examined using the modified mann kendall trend test method then the evolution characteristics of the linkages between ndvi and precipitation air temperature were explored based on the cross wavelet analysis we also quantified the contributions of climate change and human activities to vegetation cover dynamics based on a svm based simulation model the primary conclusions are summarized as follows 1 vegetation cover in the wrb shows a distinct spatial pattern with larger ndvi values in the southeast than the northwest annual vegetation cover of the wrb shows a strikingly upward tendency which is contributed mainly by the increase of ndvi in spring and autumn via the lengthening of vegetation growing season 2 the linkages between precipitation air temperature and ndvi vary at different time scales and those at the monthly scale is stronger than those at the annual scale in general the effects of air temperature on ndvi dynamics are stronger than those by precipitation at various time scales therefore the potential effects of increasing temperature on vegetation greenness should be paid more attentions for improving ecological restoration practices in the loess plateau 3 for the wei river basin as a whole the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to ndvi variations are about 59 3 and 40 7 respectively suggesting that the effects of climate change on ndvi are stronger than those by human activities in contrast human activities including the soil conservation practices and the large scale ggp are the dominant factors regulating ndvi dynamics in the beiluo river basin it should be noted that human activities play a non negligible role in modulating vegetation dynamics in the anthropocene credit authorship contribution statement shengzhi huang conceptualization methodology software xudong zheng data curation

5641,vegetation cover is a frequently used indicator for assessing terrestrial ecosystem conditions it is important to investigate the spatial and temporal change patterns of vegetation cover and quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover dynamics in this study the cross wavelet analysis was first applied to reveal the detailed associations between the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi and precipitation air temperature as well as their evolution characteristics then a support vector machine svm based simulation model was introduced to quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover dynamics results indicated that 1 the proposed ga svm model is reliable in reproducing the observed ndvi series 2 the increasing trend of annual ndvi was primarily contributed by the increase in spring and autumn during which precipitation and air temperature changes lead to the lengthening of vegetation growing season 3 for the wei river basin as a whole climate change effects about 59 3 on ndvi are stronger than those by human activities nearly 40 7 whereas human activities including the large scale grain for green program are exerting the dominant influences in the beiluo river basin the findings of this study are helpful for guiding the ecological restoration practices in the loess plateau under the backdrop of changing environment keywords vegetation cover ndvi quantitative analysis the cross wavelet analysis ga svm 1 introduction vegetation is a critical component of the terrestrial ecosystem and has strong effects on the interception of rainfall runoff yield mechanism soil and water conservation and prevention of desertification in arid and semi arid regions chen et al 2007a mohammad and adam 2010 zhu and zhu 2012 sun et al 2015 han et al 2019 thus it is a frequently used indicator for assessing terrestrial environmental conditions wang et al 2015 variations of vegetation spatiotemporal patterns change the structures and functions of landscape system thus impacting ecological processes smith et al 2013 wang et al 2012 zhao et al 2019a 2020a the normalized difference vegetation index ndvi is defined as the difference between the reflectance in the near infrared band 780 890 nm and the red band 610 680 nm it is an index of the greenness and productivity of vegetation and is sensitive to the density presence and dynamics of vegetation bannari et al 1995 a higher ndvi means a larger green vegetation density hence ndvi is regarded as an effective index for analyzing the effects of climate change and human activities on ecological environment pettorelli et al 2005 the spatiotemporal variations of vegetation cover is closely associated with climate change wang et al 2015 sun et al 2015 zhao et al 2020b the changes in vegetation are sensitive to precipitation variations xu et al 2008 theoretically the increase of precipitation could lead to improvement of vegetation cover particularly in the arid and semi arid areas yang et al 2002 zhang et al 2013 ren et al 2019 besides temperature is an important factor controlling the seasonal changes in vegetation growth hao et al 2012 previous studies pointed out that global warming is the primary driver for the prolonged vegetation growing periods observed in middle high latitudes of the northern hemisphere jeong et al 2011 xu et al 2013 many previous studies have also investigated the correlations between vegetation cover and climatic variables chen et al 2005 li et al 2011 zhang et al 2013 wang et al 2015 sun et al 2015 dai et al 2020 zhao et al 2019b conducted a copula based detection of the abrupt change in the seasonal vegetation climate relationship in the jing river basin china most of them successfully captured their correlations however as the methods adopted in these previous studies were restricted to the simple correlation analysis they can only reveal the general linkages between vegetation cover and climate variables thus the dynamics of linkages between vegetation cover and climate variables cannot be fully captured by the simple correlation method these dynamics are of important value for better understanding the response of vegetation cover to the changing environment thereby facilitating the adaptive capacity to climate change and environmental and ecological improvement therefore the cross wavelet analysis a new technique based on the cross spectrum analysis and wavelet transform hudgins and huang 1996 torrence and compo 1998 was employed in this study to reveal the evolution characteristics of the linkages between vegetation cover and climate variables in addition to climate change human activities have significantly affected vegetation cover wang et al 2015 variations of land use induced by human activities such as agriculture and urbanization are important factors affecting the spatial patterns of vegetation piao et al 2005 during the last few decades the excessive deforestation and the expansion of cropland and built up areas have led to land degradation desertification and soil erosion maeda et al 2010 garcia ruiz 2010 nunes et al 2011 posing profound impacts on agricultural production as well as social and economic sustainability under the backdrop of growing population and rapid economic development in china yang et al 2005 however previous studies mainly focused on the integrated effects of climate change and human activities on the inter annual variations of vegetation cover wang et al 2008 2014 to the best of our knowledge quantifying the effects of climatic and anthropogenic variations on vegetation cover variations remains to be unresolved in order to bridge this knowledge gap a numerical model based on the support vector machine svm which is one of the most effective prediction tools yu et al 2012 lin et al 2013 huang et al 2014a 2016a was adopted in this study to distinguish the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover changes the svm based numerical model was utilized to model ndvi under the relative natural conditions when the effects of human activities on vegetation cover variations are weak based on meteorological data including precipitation and air temperature based on the difference between model simulations and observations the contribution of climate change and human activities to vegetation cover dynamics can be calculated soil and water erosion caused by vegetation degeneration is one of the most serious problems in the loess plateau of china zheng et al 2012 the wei river is the biggest first level tributary of the yellow river and its biggest tributary the jinghe river flows through the loess plateau the jinghe river is the main source of sediment loads in the yellow river zheng et al 2012 the vegetation cover of the jinghe river basin is low and has a high sediment concentration with a fast flow rate leading to serious erosions as a result there is approximately 3 108 t sediment load flowing into the wei river from the jinghe river every year zhu et al 2012 the soil and water loss in the wei river basin is a very serious issue according to previous studies huang et al 2014b c the climate of wei river basin has showed a warming and drying trend over the past decades which may theoretically reduce the vegetation cover density due to the decreasing water availability in this basin thereby aggravating local water and soil loss to address this environmental problem the chinese government initiated a large scale ecological restoration program referred to as grain to green in 1999 lü et al 2012 which is regarded as one of the most critical and effective approaches for improving local vegetation cover zhao et al 2019a fang et al 2019a however little is known concerning the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to vegetation dynamics in a changing environment thus it is essential to evaluate the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation cover in the wei river basin and quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover dynamics in order to provide a solid basis for regional ecological restoration assessment the primary objectives of this study are to 1 assess the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation cover in the wei river basin 2 investigate the evolution characteristics of the relationship between ndvi and precipitation air temperature 3 quantify the effects of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover dynamics these results could help further understand the present vegetation condition and development facilitate the evaluation of the grain to green program s impacts on environmental restoration and provide a useful reference for future ecological policies in the wei river basin 2 study area and data 2 1 the wei river basin the wei river basin a typical loess plateau watershed in china is chosen as the

from the highest mountainous areas in the northwest portion of the basin to the lowest guanzhong plain in its southeast and southern part located in the continental monsoon climate zone the wei river basin is characterized by abundant precipitation and high temperature in summer with sparse precipitation and low temperature in winter ren et al 2020 its annual precipitation is about 559 mm zhang et

statistically significant upward tendency of ndvi in winter is observed at the 95 confidence level besides the ndvi in summer is generally characterized by a non significant decreasing trend in the wei river basin thus the increase of ndvi in spring and autumn contributes to the overall increase of annual ndvi in the wei river basin previous studies randerson et al 1999 zhou et al 2001 have reported that the strikingly increasing trends of ndvi in spring and autumn imply the advancing and delaying of vegetation growing season respectively hence the increasing trends of ndvi occurring in spring and autumn contribute to the lengthened vegetation growing season thus resulting in the increase of the annual ndvi similarly the mmk was applied to calculate the trends of seasonal and annual precipitation and air temperature spanning 1982 2010 in the wei river basin for the sake of brevity we primarily analyzed the trends of seasonal and annual precipitation and air temperature in the jinghe subzone 1 beiluo subzone 2 and whole wei river basin which are shown in table 1 at the seasonal scale precipitation in the three basins shows a non significant trend in four seasons except for winter when precipitation in the beiluo river basin has a statistical significant increasing trend at the 95 confidence level air temperature in the three basins exhibits a statistical significant increasing trend at the 95 confidence level in four seasons except for autumn in the beiluo and wei river basin at the annual scale precipitation in the three basins is characterized by a non significant decreasing trend whilst air temperature is characterized by a statistically significant increasing trend at the 99 confidence level the warming and drying climate may influence the vegetation cover in the wei river basin and the detailed influences will be explored in the following section 4 3 the correlations between ndvi and precipitation air temperature the correlation coefficients between ndvi and precipitation air temperature in the three basins were computed table 2 which help to preliminarily determine the dominate factor of climatic variables at the seasonal scale precipitation shows a weak relationship with ndvi in four seasons except for winter when the negative correlation between precipitation and ndvi is high in the jinghe and beiluo river basin air temperature exhibits a strongly positive correlation with ndvi in four seasons except for summer when the relationship between air temperature and ndvi is weak in the three basins at the annual scale precipitation shows a weak correlation with ndvi in the three basins whilst air temperature shows a strongly positive correlation with ndvi in the three basins at the monthly scale both precipitation and air temperature show a strongly positive correlation with ndvi indicating that the association between precipitation air temperature and ndvi at the monthly scale is stronger than that at the seasonal and annual scales generally the associations between air temperature and ndvi are stronger than those between precipitation and ndvi in the three basins at various time scales in order to further investigate the detailed linkages between ndvi and precipitation air temperature along with the evolution characteristics of their linkages the cross wavelet analysis was employed in this study the cross wavelet transforms between ndvi and precipitation air temperature at the annual scale in the jinehe beiluo and wei river basin are displayed in figs 5 7 respectively fig 5a indicates that the correlations between precipitation and ndvi at the annual scale are weak in the jinghe river basin during the period of 1982 2010 except that it shows a statistically positive correlation with ndvi at the 95 confidence level with a signal of 7 year during 1992 1996 however air temperature exhibits a strongly positive relationship with ndvi with a signal of 3 4 year during 1987 1993 and 1995 2000 these results further verify that the effects of air temperature on ndvi variations are stronger than those by precipitation at the annual scale in the jinghe river basin it can be observed from fig 6a that precipitation shows a strongly negative correlation with ndvi with a signal of 4 6 year during 1983 1992 at the annual scale in the beiluo river basin which is consistent with the findings from table 2 however for the remainder period precipitation shows no obvious correlation with ndvi in the beiluo river basin with regards to air temperature its exhibits a statistically significant positive correlation with ndvi with a signal of 3 5 years during 1984 1999 and a signal of 8 9 years during 1990 1997 at the annual scale in the beiluo river basin fig 6b which is similar to the results from table 2 but showing the changing relationship between precipitation air temperature with ndvi in the beiluo river basin overall the pattern of the wavelet transform between ndvi and precipitation air temperature in the wei rivers basin fig 7 is similar to that in the beiluo river basin fig 6 precipitation shows a statistically significant negative association at the 95 confidence level with ndvi with a signal of 3 6 years during 1984 1991 while air temperature exhibits a strongly positive association with ndvi with a signal of 3 5 years during 1984 1999 in the wei river basin as outlined above the associations between precipitation air temperature and ndvi vary at different time scales in the wei river basin thus the associations between precipitation air temperature and ndvi at the monthly scale in the three basins were explored in addition to the annual scale the cross wavelet transform between ndvi and precipitation a air temperature b at the monthly scale in the wei rivers basin is illustrated in fig 8 it can be obviously observed from fig 8 that both precipitation and air temperature show a statistically significant positive association with ndvi with a signal of 8 16 months during the entire period at the monthly scale in the wei river basin the linkages between air temperature and ndvi are a litter stronger than those between precipitation and ndvi which is consistent with the findings of table 2 the pattern of the associations between precipitation air temperature and ndvi at the monthly scale in the jinghe and beiluo river basin is similar to that in the wei river basin for the sake of brevity their cross wavelet transform figures are omitted these results indicate that the associations between climate variables and ndvi vary at various time scales and those at the monthly scale are obviously stronger than those at the annual scale 4 4 quantifying the effects of climate change and human activities on ndvi dynamics the ndvi precipitation and air temperature data in 1982 1991 were adopted for calibration while the data in 1992 1999 were utilized for verification in the jinghe beiluo and wei river basin the optimal parameters of svm model based on ga in the calibration and verification periods in the three basins are illustrated in table 3 the performances of the svm based model in the three basins are presented in table 4 the nsc values of both the calibration and verification periods are more than 0 90 in the three basins indicating that the svm based simulation model has a good performance in modelling ndvi in the three basins the simulated and observed ndvi in the calibration and verification periods in the three basins are shown in fig 9 in general the simulated ndvi in the calibration and verification periods has a good consistence with the observed ndvi in the three basins hence the simulation accuracy of the svm based simulation model in the calibration and verification periods was acceptable and it can be reliably used to quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on ndvi variations in the impacted period according to eqs 2 and 3 the effects of climate change and human activities on ndvi dynamics in the three basins were calculated which are displayed in table 5 for the jinghe and wei river basin the impacts of climate change 59 7 and 59 3 respectively on ndvi variations are stronger than those by human activities 40 3 and 40 7 respectively regarding the beiluo river basin the effects of human activities 50 5 on ndvi variations are slightly stronger than those by climate change 49 5 indicating that human activities are the dominant factor influencing vegetation cover dynamics in the beiluo river basin from the perspective of climate change temperature and precipitation changes xie et al 2015 and their interactions du et al 2019 play an important role in affecting vegetation phenology du et al 2019 pointed out that temperature and precipitation variations in the arid mountains of china contributed more than 30 of the total variations in predicted ecosystem level starting date of vegetation growing season sos therefore temperature and precipitation changes and their interactions can influence the sos thus partly resulting in the increase of ndvi in the wrb from the perspective of human activities the soil conservation practices are a major form soil loss is a very severe issue in the wrb thus soil conservation practices including afforestation grass planting building check dams and creation of level terraces have been conducted since 1960 chang et al 2015 huang et al 2016 the statistics of soil conservation practices in the wrb are shown in table 6 huang et al 2016 table 6 displays that the soil conservation areas have expanded with time and the growth rate increased strikingly after 2000 this could be attributed to the initiation of the large scale grain for green program by the chinese government in 1999 which is designed to replace the poorly performing farmland on steep slopes 25 with forests and grassland to restore ecosystem service the soil conservation practices lead to a significant increase of vegetation cover in the wrb zhao et al 2019a also found that the grain for green program exerted significant influences on vegetation dynamics therefore both climate change and human activities play critical roles in ndvi variations in the wei river basin and the effects of grain to green on local ndvi dynamics are non negligible 5 conclusions it is important to investigate the historical changes in vegetation cover and quantify the impacts of climate change and human activities on vegetation cover variations which helps to improve regional ecological environment in this study the spatial and temporal variations of vegetation cover indicated by ndvi in the wei river basin were first examined using the modified mann kendall trend test method then the evolution characteristics of the linkages between ndvi and precipitation air temperature were explored based on the cross wavelet analysis we also quantified the contributions of climate change and human activities to vegetation cover dynamics based on a svm based simulation model the primary conclusions are summarized as follows 1 vegetation cover in the wrb shows a distinct spatial pattern with larger ndvi values in the southeast than the northwest annual vegetation cover of the wrb shows a strikingly upward tendency which is contributed mainly by the increase of ndvi in spring and autumn via the lengthening of vegetation growing season 2 the linkages between precipitation air temperature and ndvi vary at different time scales and those at the monthly scale is stronger than those at the annual scale in general the effects of air temperature on ndvi dynamics are stronger than those by precipitation at various time scales therefore the potential effects of increasing temperature on vegetation greenness should be paid more attentions for improving ecological restoration practices in the loess plateau 3 for the wei river basin as a whole the relative contributions of climate change and human activities to ndvi variations are about 59 3 and 40 7 respectively suggesting that the effects of climate change on ndvi are stronger than those by human activities in contrast human activities including the soil conservation practices and the large scale ggp are the dominant factors regulating ndvi dynamics in the beiluo river basin it should be noted that human activities play a non negligible role in modulating vegetation dynamics in the anthropocene credit authorship contribution statement shengzhi huang conceptualization methodology software xudong zheng data curation

5642,climate change in the great lakes basin of north america is expected to have a profound impact on hydrological processes a greater understanding of these impacts must be developed to inform future adaptation strategies this study aims to assess potential watershed response to changing climate conditions in southwestern ontario canada using the fully integrated surface subsurface model hydrogeosphere to account for the uncertainty associated with climate projections and capture a range of possible conditions a diverse set of meteorological forcings are used including projections derived from regional climate models rcms a synthetic scenario based on ipcc fifth assessment report predictions and temporal analogues simulation outputs have been compared to assess the potential influence of changing climate on groundwater hydraulic head surface discharge and net fluid exchange between surface and subsurface domains the modelled projections reveal variability in both direction and magnitude of predicted hydrologic change suggesting that simulation outcomes should be interpreted probabilistically and climate projection uncertainty needs to be characterized nonetheless model outcomes reveal a greater likelihood for a significant reduction in mid century discharge relative to any significant change in groundwater head or net exchange flux this study also examines the influence of meteorological input with different temporal resolutions and the importance of rcm lake model coupling for capturing the regional climate influence of the great lakes the latter of these considerations was found to influence spring and summer hydrologic phenomena while the former showed that both daily and monthly normal forcing yield comparable results if monthly aggregated model outputs are considered these findings are important for informing the design of future hydrologic investigations especially when working with computationally intensive large scale

integrated models give consideration to the inherent interconnection between surface and subsurface flow domains and provide a valuable platform for examining complex watershed processes realistic watershed conceptualization and simulation is exceedingly important given the considerable uncertainty that still exists in future climate change scenarios not only is the science behind climate change projections continually evolving but there remains a large degree of uncertainty due to the unpredictable impact of future human decisions kornelsen and coulibaly 2014 kundzewicz et al 2017 beckage et al 2018 robinson et al 2018 predicting future climate conditions with any degree of certainty is a challenging task and conflicting results in terms of a watershed s predicted future behaviour may be obtained depending on the meteorological forcing used hydrological climate change studies typically feature meteorological forcing from general circulation models gcms which are widely accepted and have become the primary tool for obtaining future global climate change projections the resolution of gcm data is too coarse for direct local scale application and accordingly these data are typically downscaled either statistically or dynamically by a regional climate model rcm to better represent local conditions however the coarse resolution of gcms can prevent regional geographic features from being adequately captured this is particularly relevant in the great lakes region of north america where these large inland water bodies exhibit substantial control on the regional temperature and precipitation e g lake effect snow an extended version of the weather research and forecasting model wrf coupled to the freshwater lake model flake mironov et al 2010 was

the upper parkhill watershed southwestern ontario canada for a mid century future period the primary objective of this study is to examine potential watershed response to climate perturbation with a focus on groundwater levels stream discharge and subsurface surface exchange flux using an integrated modelling approach secondly this study aims to compare the applied future climate scenarios and simulation results to assess at a watershed scale the value of a combined approach for meteorological forcing the importance of lake model incorporation and the influence of meteorological input with

forcing practices for hydrological climate change studies furthermore this study will contribute to our understanding of watershed response to climatic stress in this region of ontario and may be used to support improved water management practices 2 methods 2 1 site description the upper parkhill watershed fig 1 is a headwater catchment draining an area of approximately 130 km2 and located just east of the shores of lake huron the surficial geology is comprised primarily of st joseph s till which is a clayey silt to silty clay diamicton deposited during the late wisconsinan glaciation land use within the watershed is 76 agricultural and the surface topography has relief ranging from 189 to 266 masl parkhill creek also referred to as mud creek is the dominant waterway within the watershed which is fed by natural and artificial tributaries i e surface and subsurface agricultural drains surface flows at the outlet of this watershed are controlled by a dam maintained by the ausable bayfield conservation authority abca this structure was constructed in 1969 to help control downstream flooding especially of agricultural land the upper parkhill watershed features an integrated water and climate monitoring station installed on parkhill creek pc iwcm roughly 4 km from the outlet of the watershed fig 1 this station was established in 2012 at the location of a pre existing water survey canada hydrometric station 02ff008 the pc iwcm station was designed to promote baseline continuous data collection of both water and climate parameters e g surface flows groundwater level temperature precipitation wind speed etc at a centralized location which may be used to better understand the relationship between climate and hydrologic processes from 2013 to 2017 this station recorded a mean daily temperature of 8 c and average annual precipitation of 919 mm year with an average estimated annual potential evapotranspiration pet of 436 mm year 2 2 integrated hydrologic model 2 2 1 conceptual model hydrostratigraphic layers were informed by a pre existing conceptual model which focused on a larger area of southwestern ontario waterloo hydrogeologic 2004 borehole logs from the ontario ministry of the environment conservation and parks mecp water well information system wwis were used to inform layer construction ontario ministry of the environment conservation and parks 2019 boreholes were filtered for both location and elevation reliability prior to use given the coarse geologic descriptions often found in these drilling logs data translation of the geologic materials recorded in this database was necessary to produce a set of units ready for modelling this was completed following a similar protocol to that discussed in burt and dodge 2016 and was particularly important for identifying diamicton layers i e potential glacial till units for example if the original geologic materials were described as three diverse sediments sizes e g clay gravel and silt or as hardpan the layer would be reclassified as diamicton using elevation points inferred from a number of geologic cross sections layer interpolation at a resolution of 5 5 m was completed using an inverse distance weighted scheme a hydrologically enforced digital elevation model dem and bedrock surface top and bottom of the modelling domain respectively were provided by the abca and resampled to a 5 5 m resolution to match the other interpolated layers the final hydrostratigraphic conceptual model generated in hgs layer intersection points removed with a minimum layer thickness of 5 cm is shown in fig 1 this model extends from the ground surface to the top of bedrock and features 7 subsurface units which are representative of the wisconsinan glaciation summarized from top to bottom in table 1 2 2 2 numerical model the hydrological model used in this investigation hgs therrien and sudicky 1996 aquanty 2018 has been successfully applied in a number of past catchment scale investigations e g goderniaux et al 2009 cornelissen et al 2013 von gunten et al 2015 cornelissen et al 2016 ala aho et al 2017 cochand et al 2018 this 3d finite element model simulates physically based hydrologic processes in an integrated manner whereby the diffusion wave approximation of the saint venant equation for 2d surface flow viessman and lewis 2003 is coupled with the richards equation for 3d variably saturated subsurface flow interaction between the surface and subsurface domains is accomplished through a dual node approach and calculations are completed using an adaptive time stepping scheme the surface domain was discretized with a 2d triangular mesh generated using algomesh hydroalgorithmics pty ltd 2016 with the grid refined around surface water features and observation points all subsurface units are vertically discretized by at least two divisions of uniform sublayering resulting in a 3d grid with 136091 nodes in order to simulate the controlled watershed outlet a stage discharge relationship was applied using rating curve data provided by the abca the perimeter of the modelling domain is comprised of a combination of no flow and constant head boundaries highlighted in fig 1 in an attempt to simulate regional groundwater flow patterns towards lake huron inferred from an existing water table map of the area provided by the abca constant head boundary conditions were applied in two hydrostratigraphic zones conceptualized as aquifer units aqint and aq2 and were assumed to be static through time hgs is driven by climate forcing including pet for the study area pet was calculated using the fao penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 using data derived from the pc iwcm station as well as nearby environment and climate change canada meteorological stations to fill data gaps and extend the climate record in the case of historic reference period simulations discussed in section 2 3 onward shortwave and longwave radiation data was obtained from the nasa langley research center larc power project funded through the nasa earth science applied science program nasa 2019 transient leaf area index lai data was incorporated in model evapotranspiration processes this data spatially averaged over the entire study area was obtained from the modis satellite myneni et al 2015 unique daily data was used for model calibration validation section 2 2 3 while an average of this data was used to generate an approximate annual cycle applied for reference and future period climate simulations section 2 3 where real data is lacking to account for winter hydrological processes a built in hgs snowmelt function was applied whereby snow accumulation and melt were simulated based on the analytical degree day method and an assumed snowmelt constant this computationally efficient approach relative to complex energy balance solutions is illustrated in schilling et al 2018 and has since been applied by cochand et al 2018 at the catchment scale hgs is also capable of simulating pore water freeze thaw using a 1d heat conduction model that partitions water between solid and liquid phase based on temperature and thermal diffusivity however to date this approach has only been applied in smaller scale models e g schilling et al 2018 due to computational demands to simulate pore water freeze thaw processes at the watershed scale a hydraulic conductivity k reduction was applied using an impedance factor formulation whereby k is reduced according to the relationship defined in eq 1 aquanty 2018 1 k new k 10 ω θ f o r t o n t t o f f where ton and toff represent the specified start and end times for command application respectively k new is the adjusted hydraulic conductivity ω is the impedance factor and θ is the saturation at ton the impedance factor represents the maximum k reduction in log scale during the freezing season this command reduces k in chosen model elements according to an assigned time schedule thereby mimicking the formation of an impermeable ice layer during the freezing season in this study k reduction by impedance was assigned annually from january to march in the top 0 5 m of the model domain excluding the main surface water channel this schedule was found to approximate soil freezing phenomena observed at the pc iwcm station it should be noted that this approach assumes intra and inter annual stationarity both temporally and spatially this assumption may not hold in the future under circumstances of changing temperature and snowpack nonetheless given the importance of winter processes as emphasized in previous studies e g jutebring sterte et al 2018 cochand et al 2018 schilling et al 2018 it is anticipated that the benefits of freeze thaw approximation outweigh potential uncertainty impedance based approaches have been used in a number of past investigations to incorporate the influence of frozen soil however literature values for the impedance factor are highly variable and dependent on the unique field conditions being examined e g zhao et al 2016 lundin 1990 hansson et al 2004 watanabe 2008 consequently the impedance factor used in the present study was determined from manual trial and error during the calibration process described in section 2 2 3 2 2 3 model calibration and validation model calibration was completed in two stages using 1 an initial steady state spin up period 100 years forced by average 2013 2017 climate conditions followed by 2 a three year 2013 2015 transient simulation period with variable climatic inputs after calibration a two year transient validation period 2016 2017 was also examined during the transient calibration and validation periods daily time series of spatially uniform precipitation and pet were applied to the entire model domain this assumption was justified based on the increased and unfeasible computational demands of daily spatially variable climate forcing moreover the watershed s size and relatively flat topography suggest minimal spatial variation in climate forcing the initial steady state calibration with a focus on k was completed with the aid of the pest software doherty 2018 calibration under transient conditions was then used to fine tune surface roughness impedance k and specific storage ss transient calibration was completed manually given constraints associated with model run time throughout both stages of calibration evapotranspiration and snowmelt parameters table 2 were kept constant finalized surface and subsurface parameters are summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively for the first stage of model calibration steady state conditions model performance was evaluated relative to average discharge at two stream flow monitoring stations watershed outlet and pc iwcm gauge as well as 20 overburden observation wells with static groundwater hydraulic head data from the ontario mecp wwis fig 1 these records consist of water level measurements obtained at the time of well completion for the second stage of model calibration and validation transient conditions model performance was evaluated relative to the same stream flow monitoring stations and three observation wells with transient head monitoring one belonging to the provincial groundwater monitoring network pgmn and two at the pc iwcm station this modelling exercise used mean absolute error mae and normalized root mean square error nrmse to evaluate hydraulic head and mae nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias to evaluate discharge bosson et al 2008 smerdon et al 2008 von gunten et al 2015 tian et al 2015 jutebring sterte et al 2018 cochand et al 2018 d oria et al 2019 acceptable hydraulic head error depends on head variability throughout the catchment accordingly nrmse was calculated to take into consideration the range of observed hydraulic head data for flow evaluation nse can vary between 1 and with 1 representing a perfect fit and a negative value indicating that the modelled hydrograph has been inadequately simulated pbias was used to provide an indication of overestimation positive pbias or underestimation negative pbias for the purposes of this study where a large focus was on examining climate stimulus the groundwater and surface flow calibration which are described in detail below was considered to be acceptable for steady state conditions surface discharge was calibrated with a mae of approximately 0 4 m3 s while the mae and nrmse for hydraulic head were 6 3 masl and 14 respectively fig 2 this nrmse was slightly higher than what is generally recommended for hydraulic head i e less than 10 however it was considered acceptable given reliance on the wwis for which recognized data set errors include inaccuracies in well elevation location and water level measurement as well as assumed temporal stationarity for transient calibration hydraulic head and stream discharge were evaluated with an applied offset corresponding to the respective steady state residual observed simulated at a given transient monitoring point these offsets ranging from 1 3 5 7 m for head and 0 3 0 4 m3 s for flow were applied to allow for a better assessment of temporal agreement between observed and simulated data acknowledging some discrepancy in magnitude there is relatively good temporal agreement for groundwater elevation fluctuations fig 3 indicating that the modelled system responds as would be expected to changing watershed conditions moreover the mae for all wells throughout both the calibration and validation periods was less than 2 0 m which is close to the annual variability in each well however there are some discrepancies in modelled magnitude and amplitude of head change despite the applied offset which is perhaps attributed to data measurement errors as well as geologic uncertainty including potential unaccounted for small scale geologic heterogeneity in the case of the pc iwcm wells the observed hydraulic head data is relatively noisy these wells are suspected to be influenced by fluctuations in the adjacent stream correspondingly model shortcomings in capturing flashy stream hydrograph response discussed below may translate to inadequate simulated head response in the adjacent wells with regards to discharge mae was low at both stations suggesting satisfactory model performance fig 4 at the watershed outlet where low flows are most prominent there is a positive pbias model overestimation whereas at the pc iwcm station where there is a greater number of high flow events the pbias is negative model underestimation nse values were found to be only slightly above 0 at both stations so as a secondary measure of model performance simulated and observed percent flow exceedance was compared over the combined calibration and validation periods fig 4 this comparison shows that the model simulates flow relatively well for low to medium flows up to about 20 exceedance or 80 of the time this suggests that this model may be reasonably used to examine average flow conditions discrepancies in simulated discharge may be explained by potential rating curve inaccuracies and or gauge errors at both the pc iwcm gauge especially under flooding conditions and watershed outlet as well as errors in the meteorological forcing data used for calibration extreme and variable flows observed at both stations may also be the result of tile drainage in the watershed that has not been incorporated in the present model tile drains were excluded from the model due to inadequate drainage network information e g locations and depth additionally the choice of channel conceptualization in hgs is likely to influence generated flows for the sake of computational efficiency channelized flow in this model is represented based on a provided dem and using 2d overland flow rather than the use of 1d channel segments explicitly defined along the river network 2 2 4 sensitivity analysis the relative sensitivity of model outputs hydraulic head and discharge under steady state conditions to changes in k specified head boundary conditions precipitation and pet was evaluated using eqs 2 and 3 adapted from mccuen 1973 2 s 1 n i 1 n s i 3 s i o o ref o ref x x ref x ref where s is the relative sensitivity coefficient averaged over n observation points o is the model output at observation point i with the modified parameter value x and oref is the reference model output at observation point i with the reference parameter value xref the value of s may vary from 0 to infinity where the smaller the value the more robust the model i e the parameter can be adjusted without substantially influencing the model outputs on the other hand larger values represent greater parameter sensitivity for example if s 1 the model results vary by the same percentage and in the same direction as the parameter x minimum and maximum literature derived values of k waterloo hydrogeologic 2004 for the study area were examined all layers were shifted to high values in one iteration and low values in another changes ranging between approximately 1 6 orders of magnitude with an average adjustment used in both cases for si calculation i e denominator of eq 3 the impact of using constant head boundary conditions was also assessed by systemically raising and lowering the specified values by 1 m each boundary condition zone tested independently this range was selected based on observed seasonal head variability at the pc iwcm station during the 2013 2017 period this time frame coincides with the period over which conditions were averaged for the steady state model simulations i e the reference conditions for sensitivity assessment for precipitation and pet the minimum and maximum values observed during 2013 2017 were targeted inclusion of climate forcing in the sensitivity analysis in addition to model structural components allows for a better assessment of the control on watershed dynamics results of this sensitivity analysis indicate that hydraulic head fig 5 is most sensitive to changes in the specified head boundary conditions both zones the relative sensitivity values for these boundary conditions translate to an average absolute head change of 0 15 m less than 0 1 change on the whole discharge table 5 is more sensitive to the examined variables than hydraulic head the aqint specified head boundary has the greatest influence on simulated discharge the relative sensitivity values for the aqint boundary condition correspond to an average absolute change in flow of 40 while seemingly large this response to a 1 m change in head is not unexpected based on the hydrologic behaviour simulated in proximal regions e g erler et al 2019b next to the model boundary conditions both hydraulic head and discharge are most sensitive to low precipitation and least sensitive to high hydraulic conductivity the sensitivity of discharge in particular to the aqint specified head boundary indicates that caution must be taken when interpreting climate change simulation results depending on the predicted behaviour of the groundwater system nevertheless it is believed that alternative no flow groundwater boundary conditions would be afflicted by similar limitations in terms of model predictive capacity for future climate scenarios which therefore warrants an attempted consideration of regional groundwater flow conditions 2 3 future climate projections to examine watershed response to changing climate conditions eight climate projections informed by the rcp 8 5 emission scenario van vuuren et al 2011 were applied to the model domain these diverse scenarios summarized in table 6 and discussed in detail below enabled the comparison of watershed response to meteorological forcing of varied complexity with differences in the consideration of lake effects and input data structure 2 3 1 regional climate modelling system version 4 regcm4 the ontario climate change data portal ccdp wang and huang 2013 wang and huang 2015 provides publicly available dynamically downscaled regcm4 giorgi et al 2012 climate projections at 25 km resolution which are driven by a choice of five different gcms canesm2 hadgem2 es gfdl esm2m ipsl cm5a la and mpi esm mr of these five gcms three models were selected based on mid century 2040 2059 temperature and precipitation change relative to the reference period 1986 2005 specifically maximum temperature and maximum precipitation change canesm2 and mpi esm mr respectively and minimum temperature and precipitation change gfdl esm2m regcm4 products available through the ontario ccdp are coupled to the hostetler lake model hostetler et al 1993 through the bats land surface scheme dickinson et al 1993 giorgi et al 2016 however based on the findings of bennington et al 2014 this lake model is assumed to have minimal influence on the simulated regional climate given poor performance in deep lakes such as the great lakes the selected scenarios were statistically bias corrected using a quantile mapping technique e g chen et al 2013a maraun 2016 n tcha m po 2016 to remove discrepancies between the observed and simulated climate parameters and to help address shortcomings in dynamic downscaling identified by wang and huang 2015 these shortcomings are particularly relevant for the canesm2 model which shows a tendency for precipitation underestimation and temperature overestimation but nonetheless expands the range of potential climate change under consideration the applied bias correction assumes that model bias remains stationary through time and does not adjust the temporal structure of the simulated climate data e g the occurrence of rain events rather the distribution of the simulated data is scaled to that observed in the past this form of bias correction reduces the drizzle effect overestimation of wet day frequency commonly observed in simulated gcm rcm precipitation data gutowski et al 2003 chen et al 2013b wang et al 2016 bias corrected variables were used to calculate pet for hgs input to validate the completed statistical bias correction monthly historical simulations of pet were compared to observed monthly pet for the reference period for which an average r2 value of 0 97 was determined thereby providing confidence in the applied data 2 3 2 weather research and forecasting model wrf this study employed two wrf ensembles coupled to the lake model flake and driven by the community earth system model cesm for reference and mid century future periods of 1979 1994 and 2045 2060 respectively these ensembles differ only in their moist physics configuration refer to erler et al 2019a for supplementary details regarding the wrf model and data preparation contrary to all other projections applied in this study the wrf ensembles referred to as g and t were applied in the form of spatially distributed 10 km resolution monthly normals rather than spatially uniform daily inputs these monthly normals represent monthly mean conditions thereby forming a representative average seasonal cycle hgs is forced by this continuously repeated seasonal cycle until stable hydrologic conditions are reached note that the monthly normal forcing interval is independent of the internal solution time step used in hgs as acknowledged in erler et al 2019a the use of monthly normals is an unconventional approach to hydrologic modelling however this approach serves to address the lack of an established practice for large scale integrated modelling providing a balance between computational limitations and the ability to resolve dominant seasonal change the main effect of this temporal aggregation is the loss of both inter annual variability and the intermittent nature of liquid water flux which may lead to a false increase in infiltration erler et al 2019a the ensembles were bias corrected by erler et al 2019a using an annual average bias correction i e linear scaling to correct the long term mean which was shown to be sufficient to capture the seasonal cycle in the grand river watershed direct outputs from wrf s land surface model noah are used for pet and snowmelt 2 3 3 synthetic scenario a synthetic future climate scenario was derived from multi model mean time series predictions for eastern north america provided in the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report ipcc 2013 time series predictions relative to the 1986 2005 reference period were used to generate new temperature and precipitation data sets for 2040 2059 synthetic future precipitation was developed based on separate winter october to march and summer april to september correction factors while synthetic temperature data was generated based on winter december january february spring march april may summer june july august and fall september october november correction factors in contrast to the regcm4 scenarios remaining parameters used in calculating pet e g solar radiation were left unchanged relative to the 1986 2005 historical reference period data this was due to the limited availability of time series predictions from the ipcc and conducted under the assumption the temperature and precipitation are the main controls on pet it should also be highlighted that unlike the regcm4 scenarios the developed synthetic data set features no change in the temporal structure of climatic events only magnitudes have been adjusted relative to the reference period 2 3 4 analogue historic climate conditions historical reference period climate data 1986 2005 was examined to identify anomalous past conditions that could be indicative of future climate regimes in the upper parkhill watershed and or be used to constrain severe conditions extremes in annually averaged temperature and precipitation identified based on 10th and 90th percentile thresholds within this 20 year period reveal the tendency for cool and wet conditions to occur together and warm and dry conditions to occur together which is not always the case in the rcm scenarios discussed above accordingly watershed response was examined for both a cool wet and warm dry year with comparisons made to a reference period year with average temperature and precipitation it is recognized that anomalous conditions within more recent years may be better suited for this type of analogue scenario analysis however the 1986 2005 time period was selected to be consistent with the commonly used ipcc reference period 2 4 simulation assessment future climate simulations based on the projections described above were examined to assess changes in surface discharge groundwater hydraulic head and net exchange flux surface discharge was evaluated using an average of the two available flow stations watershed outlet and pc iwcm gauge similarly hydraulic head was evaluated using results averaged over the 20 observation points discussed in section 2 2 3 to provide an indication of overall watershed response for the purposes of this study net exchange flux was defined as basin integrated infiltration minus exfiltration i e the overall volumetric transfer of water between surface and subsurface domains divided by the watershed area for instance a negative net exchange flux is representative of subsurface exfiltration which contributes to both runoff and baseflow statistical differences between scenarios and between reference and future periods were examined using a one way analysis of variance anova with α 0 05 when interpreting the results of this study it should be noted that something identified as statistically significant may not be practically significant in terms of apparent watershed impact for each of the examined climate scenarios future changes are statistically assessed relative to a model s respective reference period counterpart the synthetic and analogue scenarios are the only exceptions for which future changes are instead assessed relative to observed historical data mid century predictions for each of the examined models are presented together in section 3 a direct comparison between all scenarios is not possible given their inherent differences e g temporal structure and projection periods nonetheless the examined models present diverse possibilities of mid century climate change and perhaps more importantly enable a discussion concerning input data format and incorporation of lake effects to supplement this analysis model results were also qualitatively examined on a seasonal basis to better understand where throughout an annual cycle the greatest changes are concentrated and to identify differences in behaviour between models 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate projections in order to understand the simulated hydrologic response to applied climate forcing and explain differences between scenarios it is valuable to first examine variability within the projections areas of divergence are likely to generate contrasting hydrologic simulation results a comparison of monthly average liquid water flux i e rain snowmelt for the mid century future period fig 6 generally shows a similar annual cycle in all scenarios with the exception of the regcm4 canesm model opposite to all others the regcm4 canesm model shows a reduction in liquid flux through late spring to early fall the influence of the great lakes is also apparent in fig 6 as there is generally higher liquid flux through the winter and early spring in the wrf models this is assumed to largely reflect improved representation of lake effect snow and associated snowmelt however it is recognized that this phenomenon may be amplified due to snowmelt model differences between the regcm4 degree day and wrf energy balance simulations to assess the change in climate forcing between reference and future periods for a given scenario basin integrated change in net precipitation pnet was calculated for all examined climate projections fig 7 pnet change was calculated using the simulated water balance specifically liquid water flux actual evapotranspiration on average the regcm4 synthetic and wrf ensembles show a reduction in pnet for at least 50 of the year however the timing of this reduction is variable between models as would be expected the warm dry analogue shows reduced pnet from summer through mid fall while the cool wet analogue exhibits a pronounced increase in pnet through most of late spring to early fall 3 2 reference period simulations regcm4 and wrf reference period simulations were compared to observed historic simulations to highlight potential inconsistencies in hydrological response which must be kept in mind when interpreting the future simulation results two historical simulations were run using 1 observed daily climate forcing for 1986 2005 and 2 observed monthly normal forcing for 1979 1996 this accounts for variability in the data structure of the regcm4 versus wrf models and enables an appropriate comparison to each relative to their respective observed simulations a significant difference in head and net exchange was only found for the regcm4 canesm model which indicated lower mean values of each on the other hand a significant difference in surface discharge was found for all regcm4 gcms and the wrf ensembles the majority of which simulate higher flows than those simulated under observed conditions with the exception of the regcm4 canesm model whose flows are lower this indicates that despite bias correction differences in seasonality and the timing of meteorological events e g rainfall relative to historic conditions may be enough to substantially influence the generated hydrological response moreover it is evident that simulated flow is most susceptible to these differences 3 3 future predictions the following section describes mid century change in groundwater hydraulic head surface discharge and net exchange flux for each of the examined climate models table 7 of the regcm4 projections the canesm2 gcm was the only parent model to generate a significant change in groundwater hydraulic head 0 6 for the mid century future period relative to its respective reference period on the other hand all regcm4 models demonstrate a significant decrease in discharge percent change ranging between 6 and 30 while none indicate a significant change in net exchange flux the synthetic scenario indicates a significant change in discharge alone however in contrast to the regcm4 models flow is projected to increase rather than decrease neither of the wrf ensembles indicate a significant future change in hydraulic head or net exchange flux and only the t ensemble indicates a significant change 9 in future flows when compared to its reference period counterpart when the analogue scenarios are compared against an average reference period condition a significant change is only detected for discharge substantial increase of 79 for the cool wet analogue change in median groundwater elevation future reference on a seasonal basis for all models averages less than 0 1 m it should be reiterated that these results are based on the average observation well response which may be masking more localized variability for example when the pc iwcm shallow well is examined individually a significant change in hydraulic head between past and future is detected across most models furthermore depending on the season and model in question seasonal change between past and future may be more or less pronounced relative to the overall watershed perspective for instance the regcm4 canesm model indicates a 12 3 cm reduction in median summer head at the pc iwcm shallow well but only a 1 5 cm reduction in median summer head when all watershed observation points are aggregated these results concur with erler et al 2019b who found significant spatial and seasonal variability in the response of the groundwater table to climate change in their analysis of the grand river watershed possible discrepancy in the amplitude of seasonal head change should also be noted as evidenced through model calibration validation and boundary condition limitations this may result in an under estimation of groundwater change between reference and future periods both the wrf and regcm4 projections generally predict a slight decrease in median flow across all seasons fig 8 a maximum median reduction of 0 3 m3 s was observed for the wrf t ensemble during the fall this reflects the prominently negative pnet change in these models fig 7 especially in the late spring and summer the effects of which are likely to carry throughout the year it should be noted that the interquartile range of wrf spring flows is nearly double that of the regcm4 models suggesting the importance of lake associated precipitation processes both the cool wet analogue and synthetic scenarios show an increase in median future flows across all seasons which is most pronounced in the cool wet scenario maximum median increase of 1 3 m3 s both of these models experience prolonged periods of positive pnet change although at different times of the year which is likely acting to sustain flows fig 7 finally the warm dry analogue suggests an increase in median winter and spring flows followed by a decrease in summer and fall flows median change ranging between 0 5 0 3 m3 s which is clearly mirrored in the pnet trends fig 7 net exchange flux fig 9 extends across a range of positive and negative values where positive net exchange flux indicates net infiltration and negative net exchange flux indicates net exfiltration all scenarios typically exhibit the greatest variability in net exchange flux largest data range in the transition seasons of either spring or fall the regcm4 and synthetic scenarios generally indicate a slight increase in median net exchange flux in all future seasons average median change of 4 the wrf ensembles largely concur with the exception of a predicted decrease in future summer months average summer median reduction of 153 it is possible that this decrease in net exchange flux i e increase in exfiltration signifies the influence of enhanced water storage associated with an increase in winter pnet the effects of which may persist into the summer the cool wet analogue indicates a reduction in median net exchange flux across all seasons the greatest of which is a median reduction of 72 during the fall in contrast the warm dry analogue suggests a decrease in the winter and spring maximum median reduction of 8 along with an increase in the summer and fall maximum median increase of 24 for the most part these changes in net exchange flux coincide with the changes in streamflow discussed previously for example during times of decreased exfiltration there is typically a decrease in streamflow while periods of increased exfiltration are more likely to be associated with an increase in streamflow perhaps seeing stream fluctuations between gaining and losing in relation to pnet these results considered in combination with the noted changes in discharge and head suggest that periods of increased pnet trigger increased exfiltration and vice versa 3 4 differences in future predictions while some general similarities in predicted future change have been noted section 3 3 significant differences exist between the future scenarios themselves the regcm4 canesm model predicts significantly lower heads than the other regcm4 models and synthetic scenario on average 2 5 m lower while the synthetic scenario predicts heads that are significantly higher than the regcm4 canesm and regcm4 gfdl models difference of roughly 0 1 m all regcm4 and synthetic model results for surface flow are significantly different from each other maximum difference of 0 5 m3 s with the regcm4 canesm model predicting the lowest flows and the synthetic model predicting the highest flows the regcm4 canesm and synthetic models predict significantly greater net exchange than the regcm4 gfdl and regcm4 mpi scenarios on average 0 2 mm day higher with regards to the wrf models the future g and t ensembles do not have significantly different heads or net exchange however the models are significantly different with regards to future flow the t ensemble predicts flows that are nearly 11 less than the g ensemble finally when comparing the two analogue scenarios to each other neither scenario produced significantly different heads or net exchange however both the cool wet and warm dry scenarios produce significantly different surface flow with the cool wet scenario having mean flows that are nearly 78 larger than those of the warm dry scenario 3 5 temporal aggregation on a qualitative basis the hydrologic modelling results as well as the nature of the climate projections themselves section 3 1 suggest no obvious reason why models of differing meteorological input structure cannot be examined together in the manner presented nevertheless to evaluate this in more detail 95 confidence intervals fig 10 were determined for simulated future discharge based on the standard error of the mean monthly discharge was selected as a particular variable of interest based on the watershed s apparent heightened surface flow response to changes in climatic stress relative to groundwater hydraulic head and exchange flux in assessing the potential effects of temporal aggregation it was assumed that if the wrf ensemble means lie outside the collective confidence intervals of the other examined projections that a noteworthy difference exists discrepancy is only observed during the months of late winter through the spring which is likely an artifact of lake model coupling in the wrf ensembles as similarly reflected in fig 6 and not an indication of inappropriate model comparison 4 conclusions an integrated numerical model was constructed for the upper parkhill watershed and used to simulate potential hydrological response to future climate conditions under varied meteorological forcing the applied climate scenarios were based on differing data input structures i e daily and monthly normal involved a combination of rcm derived synthetic and analogue projections and examined the influence of lake effects these models differ with regards to projected climate changes e g pnet and accordingly simulated hydrological response fluctuates across models this in itself is an important study outcome as it further emphasizes the uncertainty in climate change predictions that has been similarly observed in previous investigations throughout eastern canada larocque et al 2019 despite this variability a number of general conclusions can be made within the upper parkhill watershed mid century is more likely to experience a significant change in surface discharge than groundwater elevation or net exchange flux with a decrease in overall flow seeming most probable excluding the analogue scenarios the majority of models indicate a slight decrease in flow across all seasons and while statistically insignificant the majority of models correspondingly suggest an increase in net exchange i e more infiltration through most seasons seasonally little to no change in groundwater hydraulic head is detected based on aggregated groundwater monitoring points these results suggest overall resiliency of the groundwater flow system in this watershed however the potential for more pronounced localized change still exists this could have broad implications if for example an agricultural operation redirects previously groundwater based irrigation to a surface water source and vice versa in the case of more widespread reduced flow conditions it is acknowledged that groundwater levels are stabilized to some extent by the imposed regional groundwater boundary conditions which in turn impacts simulated streamflow these boundary conditions may dampen the climate change signal and pull the system towards the state that it was calibrated for a reasonable comparison can be made between models with differing data input structure i e daily versus monthly normal erler et al 2019a made similar conclusions when comparing the wrf monthly normal simulations to wrf monthly transient simulations but it is believed that this can be extended to daily transient data when the model outputs are examined on a coarse scale e g comparison of average reference versus future period conditions or seasonal monthly assessment this has important implications for reducing model run times especially when working with complex large scale integrated models such as hgs where run time constraints may otherwise limit the feasible number of simulations however the utility of this approach depends on the model s intended purpose for example if sub monthly variability is of interest e g for flood forecasting rather than seasonal analysis daily or perhaps even hourly input data would be required the influence of the great lakes as captured in the wrf ensembles is believed to have caused some divergence in simulated spring discharge and summer net exchange relative to the other modelled scenarios while only examined qualitatively in this study the importance of coupling rcms with a robust lake model for climate change assessment in the glb is suggested with regards to the synthetic scenario explored in this investigation it is believed that the simple approach undertaken for scenario generation is viable but perhaps not the most representative in this case when considered with respect to the rcm derived scenarios this is because the synthetic scenario showed similar trends to the wrf g ensemble alone and contrasted all others as intended the analogue scenarios highlight opposite and extreme watershed response it can be inferred that on average mid century hydrologic response will not be as extreme as that experienced during these targeted outlier conditions the applied analogue scenarios therefore delineate thresholds which can inform climate change adaptation strategies and measures of preparedness furthermore the direct incorporation of historic climate data in hydrological climate change simulations facilitates a linkage between watershed response and human behaviour observed during targeted time periods the importance of which has been emphasized by adamson et al 2018 this study would benefit from the simulation of additional climate models including those based on alternative emission scenarios to further address prediction uncertainty future studies may also seek to address modelling limitations such as those imposed by the model boundary conditions this study highlights the fundamental problem of simulating climate change impacts in small watersheds that are not isolated from the regional groundwater flow system a trade off exists between detailed modelling of small watersheds and modelling large watersheds in less detail but with fewer anticipated boundary effects additional strategies for simulating regional groundwater flow under conditions of changing climate should be explored it is also recommended that varied configurations of winter hydrological processes be explored to better constrain the importance of snowmelt and freeze thaw processes in the upper parkhill watershed this study assumes uniform land use properties and does not consider future land use change within the upper parkhill watershed this was deemed beyond the scope of the study but could be examined in future work similarly there are currently no active permits to take water in the upper parkhill watershed i e approved water takings larger than 50 000 l day hypothetical modelling scenarios could be used to explore the impact of intensified water takings to assess the potential for more pronounced hydrological response to climate change it should be noted that while the future climate conditions applied in this study may be similar to those experienced in other areas of the glb predicted hydrological response is likely to vary geographically depending on site specific hydrologic and geologic conditions as well as the modelling approach applied based on the varied hydrologic response observed in this study it is suggested that simulation outcomes should be used to generally assess system response to changing climate stimulus rather than viewed as absolute credit

5642,climate change in the great lakes basin of north america is expected to have a profound impact on hydrological processes a greater understanding of these impacts must be developed to inform future adaptation strategies this study aims to assess potential watershed response to changing climate conditions in southwestern ontario canada using the fully integrated surface subsurface model hydrogeosphere to account for the uncertainty associated with climate projections and capture a range of possible conditions a diverse set of meteorological forcings are used including projections derived from regional climate models rcms a synthetic scenario based on ipcc fifth assessment report predictions and temporal analogues simulation outputs have been compared to assess the potential influence of changing climate on groundwater hydraulic head surface discharge and net fluid exchange between surface and subsurface domains the modelled projections reveal variability in both direction and magnitude of predicted hydrologic change suggesting that simulation outcomes should be interpreted probabilistically and climate projection uncertainty needs to be characterized nonetheless model outcomes reveal a greater likelihood for a significant reduction in mid century discharge relative to any significant change in groundwater head or net exchange flux this study also examines the influence of meteorological input with different temporal resolutions and the importance of rcm lake model coupling for capturing the regional climate influence of the great lakes the latter of these considerations was found to influence spring and summer hydrologic phenomena while the former showed that both daily and monthly normal forcing yield comparable results if monthly aggregated model outputs are considered these findings are important for informing the design of future hydrologic investigations especially when working with computationally intensive large scale

integrated models give consideration to the inherent interconnection between surface and subsurface flow domains and provide a valuable platform for examining complex watershed processes realistic watershed conceptualization and simulation is exceedingly important given the considerable uncertainty that still exists in future climate change scenarios not only is the science behind climate

beckage et al 2018 robinson et al 2018 predicting future climate conditions with any degree of certainty is a challenging task and conflicting results in terms of a watershed s predicted future behaviour may be obtained depending on the meteorological forcing used hydrological climate change studies typically feature meteorological forcing from general circulation models gcms which are widely accepted and have become the primary tool for obtaining future global climate change projections the resolution of gcm data is too coarse for direct local scale application and accordingly these data are typically downscaled either statistically or dynamically by a regional climate model rcm to better represent local conditions however the coarse resolution of gcms can prevent regional geographic features from being adequately captured this is particularly relevant in the great lakes region of north america where these large inland water bodies exhibit substantial control on the

east of the shores of lake huron the surficial geology is comprised primarily of st joseph s till which is a clayey silt to silty clay diamicton deposited during the late wisconsinan glaciation land use within the watershed is 76 agricultural and the surface topography has relief ranging from 189 to 266 masl parkhill creek also referred to as mud creek is the dominant waterway within the watershed which is fed by natural and artificial tributaries i e surface and subsurface agricultural drains surface flows at the outlet of this watershed are controlled by a dam maintained by the ausable bayfield conservation authority abca this structure was constructed in 1969 to help control downstream flooding especially of agricultural land the upper parkhill watershed features an integrated water and climate monitoring station installed on parkhill creek pc iwcm roughly 4 km from the outlet of the watershed fig 1 this station was established in 2012 at the location of a pre existing water survey canada hydrometric station 02ff008 the pc iwcm station was designed to promote baseline continuous data collection of both water and climate parameters e g surface flows groundwater level temperature precipitation wind speed etc at a centralized location which may be used to better understand the relationship between climate and hydrologic processes from 2013 to 2017 this station recorded a mean daily temperature of 8 c and average annual precipitation of 919 mm year with an average estimated annual potential evapotranspiration pet of 436 mm year 2 2 integrated

borehole logs from the ontario ministry of the environment conservation and parks mecp water well information system wwis were used to inform layer construction ontario ministry of the environment conservation and parks 2019 boreholes were filtered for both location and elevation reliability prior to use given the coarse geologic descriptions often found in these drilling logs data translation of the geologic materials recorded in this database was necessary to produce a set of units ready for modelling this was completed following a similar protocol to that discussed in burt and dodge 2016 and was particularly important for identifying diamicton layers i e potential glacial till units for example if the original geologic materials were described as three diverse sediments sizes e g clay gravel and silt or as hardpan the layer would be reclassified as diamicton using elevation points inferred from a number of geologic cross sections layer interpolation at a resolution of 5 5 m was completed using an inverse distance weighted scheme a hydrologically enforced digital elevation model dem and bedrock surface top and bottom of the modelling domain respectively were provided by the abca and resampled to a 5 5 m resolution to match the other interpolated layers the final hydrostratigraphic conceptual model generated in hgs layer intersection points removed with a minimum layer thickness of 5 cm is shown in fig 1 this model extends from the ground surface to the top of bedrock and features 7 subsurface units which are representative of the wisconsinan glaciation summarized

features and observation points all subsurface units are vertically discretized by at least two divisions of uniform sublayering resulting in a 3d grid with 136091 nodes in order to simulate the controlled watershed outlet a stage discharge relationship was applied using rating curve data provided by the abca the perimeter of the modelling domain is comprised of a combination of no flow and constant head boundaries highlighted in fig 1 in an attempt to simulate regional groundwater flow patterns towards lake huron inferred from an existing water table map of the area provided by the abca

data was obtained from the nasa langley research center larc power project funded through the nasa earth science applied science program nasa 2019 transient leaf area index lai data was incorporated in model evapotranspiration processes this data spatially averaged over the entire study area was obtained from the modis satellite myneni et al 2015 unique daily data was used for model calibration validation section 2 2 3 while an average of this data was used to generate an approximate annual cycle applied for reference and future period climate simulations section 2 3 where real data is lacking to account for winter hydrological processes a built in hgs snowmelt function was applied whereby snow accumulation and melt were simulated based on the analytical degree day method and an assumed snowmelt constant this computationally efficient approach relative to complex energy balance solutions is illustrated in schilling et al 2018 and has since been applied by cochand et al 2018 at the catchment scale hgs is also capable of simulating pore water freeze thaw using a 1d heat conduction model that partitions water between solid and liquid phase based on temperature and thermal diffusivity however to date this approach has only been applied in smaller scale models e g schilling et al 2018 due to computational demands to simulate pore water freeze thaw processes at the watershed scale a hydraulic conductivity k reduction was applied using an impedance factor formulation whereby k is reduced according to the relationship defined in eq 1 aquanty 2018 1 k new k 10 ω θ f o r t o n t t o f f where ton and toff represent the specified start and end times for command application respectively k new is the adjusted hydraulic conductivity ω is the impedance factor and θ is the saturation at ton the impedance factor represents the maximum k reduction in log scale during the freezing season this command reduces k in chosen model elements according to an assigned time schedule thereby mimicking the formation of an impermeable ice layer during the freezing season in this study k reduction by impedance was assigned annually from january to march in the top 0 5 m of the model domain excluding the main surface water channel this schedule was found to approximate soil freezing phenomena observed at the pc iwcm station it should be noted that this approach assumes intra and inter annual stationarity both temporally and spatially this assumption may not hold in the future under circumstances of changing temperature and snowpack nonetheless given the importance of winter processes as emphasized in previous studies e g jutebring sterte et al 2018 cochand et al 2018 schilling et al 2018 it is anticipated that the benefits of freeze thaw approximation outweigh potential uncertainty impedance based approaches have been used in a number of past investigations to incorporate the influence of frozen soil however literature values for the impedance factor are highly variable and dependent on the unique field conditions being examined e g zhao et al 2016 lundin 1990 hansson et al 2004 watanabe 2008 consequently the impedance factor used in the present study was determined from manual trial and error during the calibration process described in section 2 2 3 2 2 3 model calibration and validation model calibration was completed in two stages using 1 an initial steady state spin up period 100 years forced by average 2013 2017 climate conditions followed by 2 a three year 2013 2015 transient simulation period with variable climatic inputs after calibration a two year transient validation period 2016 2017 was also examined during the transient calibration and validation periods daily time series of spatially uniform precipitation and pet were applied to the entire model domain this assumption was justified based on the increased and unfeasible computational demands of daily spatially variable climate forcing moreover the watershed s size and relatively flat topography suggest minimal spatial variation in climate forcing the initial steady state calibration with a focus on k was completed with the aid of the pest software doherty 2018 calibration under transient conditions was then used to fine tune surface roughness impedance k and specific storage ss transient calibration was completed manually given constraints associated with model run time throughout both stages of calibration evapotranspiration and snowmelt parameters table 2 were kept constant finalized surface and subsurface parameters are summarized in tables 3 and 4 respectively for the first stage of model calibration steady state conditions model performance was evaluated relative to average discharge at two stream flow monitoring stations watershed outlet and pc iwcm gauge as well as 20 overburden observation wells with static groundwater hydraulic head data from the ontario mecp wwis fig 1 these records consist of water level measurements obtained at the time of well completion for the second stage of model calibration and validation transient conditions model performance was evaluated relative to the same stream flow monitoring stations and three observation wells with transient head monitoring one belonging to the provincial groundwater monitoring network pgmn and two at the pc iwcm station this modelling exercise used mean absolute error mae and normalized root mean square error nrmse to evaluate hydraulic head and mae nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias to evaluate discharge bosson et al 2008 smerdon et al 2008 von gunten et al 2015 tian et al 2015 jutebring sterte et al 2018 cochand et al 2018 d oria et al 2019 acceptable hydraulic head error depends on head variability throughout the catchment accordingly nrmse was calculated to take into consideration the range of observed hydraulic head data for flow evaluation nse can vary between 1 and with 1 representing a perfect fit and a negative value indicating that the modelled hydrograph has been inadequately simulated pbias was used to provide an indication of overestimation positive pbias or underestimation negative pbias for the purposes of this study where a large focus was on examining climate stimulus the groundwater and surface flow calibration which are described in detail below was considered to be acceptable for steady state conditions surface discharge was calibrated with a mae of approximately 0 4 m3 s while the mae and nrmse for hydraulic head were 6 3 masl and 14 respectively fig 2 this nrmse was slightly higher than what is generally recommended for hydraulic head i e less than 10 however it was considered acceptable given reliance on the wwis for which recognized data set errors include inaccuracies in well elevation location and water level measurement as well as assumed temporal stationarity for transient calibration hydraulic head and stream discharge were evaluated with an applied offset corresponding to the respective steady state residual observed simulated at a given transient monitoring point these offsets ranging from 1 3 5 7 m for head and 0 3 0 4 m3 s for flow were applied to allow for a better assessment of temporal agreement between observed and simulated data acknowledging some discrepancy in magnitude there is relatively good temporal agreement for groundwater elevation fluctuations fig 3 indicating that the modelled system responds as would be expected to changing watershed conditions moreover the mae for all wells throughout both the calibration and validation periods was less than 2 0 m which is close to the annual variability in each well however there are some discrepancies in modelled magnitude and amplitude of head change despite the applied offset which is perhaps attributed to data measurement errors as well as geologic uncertainty including potential unaccounted for small scale geologic heterogeneity in the case of the pc iwcm wells the observed hydraulic head data is relatively noisy these wells are suspected to be influenced by fluctuations in the adjacent stream correspondingly model shortcomings in capturing flashy stream hydrograph response discussed below may translate to inadequate simulated head response in the adjacent wells with regards to discharge mae was low at both stations suggesting satisfactory model performance fig 4 at the watershed outlet where low flows are most prominent there is a positive pbias model overestimation whereas at the pc iwcm station where there is a greater number of high flow events the pbias is negative model underestimation nse values were found to be only slightly above 0 at both stations so as a secondary measure of model performance simulated and observed percent flow exceedance was compared over the combined calibration and validation periods fig 4 this comparison shows that the model simulates flow relatively well for low to medium flows up to about 20 exceedance or 80 of the time this suggests that this model may be reasonably used to examine average flow conditions discrepancies in simulated discharge may be explained by potential rating curve inaccuracies and or gauge errors at both the pc iwcm gauge especially under flooding conditions and watershed outlet as well as errors in the meteorological forcing data used for calibration extreme and variable flows observed at both stations may also be the result of tile drainage in the watershed that has not been incorporated in the present model tile drains were excluded from the model due to inadequate drainage network information e g locations and depth additionally the choice of channel conceptualization in hgs is likely to influence generated flows for the sake of computational efficiency channelized flow in this model is represented based on a provided dem and using 2d overland flow rather than the use of 1d channel segments explicitly defined along the river network 2 2 4 sensitivity analysis the relative sensitivity of model outputs hydraulic head and discharge under steady state conditions to changes in k specified head boundary conditions precipitation and pet was evaluated using eqs 2 and 3 adapted from mccuen 1973 2 s 1 n i 1 n s i 3 s i o o ref o ref x x ref x ref where s is the relative sensitivity coefficient averaged over n observation points o is the model output at observation point i with the modified parameter value x and oref is the reference model output at observation point i with the reference parameter value xref the value of s may vary from 0 to infinity where the smaller the value the more robust the model i e the parameter can be adjusted without substantially influencing the model outputs on the other hand larger values represent greater parameter sensitivity for example if s 1 the model results vary by the same percentage and in the same direction as the parameter x minimum and maximum literature derived values of k waterloo hydrogeologic 2004 for the study area were examined all layers were shifted to high values in one iteration and low values in another changes ranging between approximately 1 6 orders of magnitude with an average adjustment used in both cases for si calculation i e denominator of eq 3 the impact of using constant head boundary conditions was also assessed by systemically raising and lowering the specified values by 1 m each boundary condition zone tested independently this range was selected based on observed seasonal head variability at the pc iwcm station during the 2013 2017 period this time frame coincides with the period over which conditions were averaged for the steady state model simulations i e the reference conditions for sensitivity assessment for precipitation and pet the minimum and maximum values observed during 2013 2017 were targeted inclusion of climate forcing in the sensitivity analysis in addition to model structural components allows for a better assessment of the control on watershed dynamics results of this sensitivity analysis indicate that hydraulic head fig 5 is most sensitive to changes in the specified head boundary conditions both zones the relative sensitivity values for these boundary conditions translate to an average absolute head change of 0 15 m less than 0 1 change on the whole discharge table 5 is more sensitive to the examined variables than hydraulic head the aqint specified head boundary has the greatest influence on simulated discharge the relative sensitivity values for the aqint boundary condition correspond to an average absolute change in flow of 40 while seemingly large this response to a 1 m change in head is not unexpected based on the hydrologic behaviour simulated in proximal regions e g erler et al 2019b next to the model boundary conditions both hydraulic head and discharge are most sensitive to low precipitation and least sensitive to high hydraulic conductivity the sensitivity of discharge in particular to the aqint specified head boundary indicates that caution must be taken when interpreting climate change simulation results depending on the predicted behaviour of the groundwater system nevertheless it is believed that alternative no flow groundwater boundary conditions would be afflicted by similar limitations in terms of model predictive capacity for future climate scenarios which therefore warrants an attempted consideration of regional groundwater flow conditions 2 3 future climate projections to examine watershed response to changing climate conditions eight climate projections informed by the rcp 8 5 emission scenario van vuuren et al 2011 were applied to the model domain these diverse scenarios summarized in table 6 and discussed in detail below enabled the comparison of watershed response to meteorological forcing of varied complexity with differences in the consideration of lake effects and input data structure 2 3 1 regional climate modelling system version 4 regcm4 the ontario climate change data portal ccdp wang and huang 2013 wang and huang 2015 provides publicly available dynamically downscaled regcm4 giorgi et al 2012 climate projections at 25 km resolution which are driven by a choice of five different gcms canesm2 hadgem2 es gfdl esm2m ipsl cm5a la and mpi esm mr of these five gcms three models were selected based on mid century 2040 2059 temperature and precipitation change relative to the reference period 1986 2005 specifically maximum temperature and maximum precipitation change canesm2 and mpi esm mr respectively and minimum temperature and precipitation change gfdl esm2m regcm4 products available through the ontario ccdp are coupled to the hostetler lake model hostetler et al 1993 through the bats land surface scheme dickinson et al 1993 giorgi et al 2016 however based on the findings of bennington et al 2014 this lake model is assumed to have minimal influence on the simulated regional climate given poor performance in deep lakes such as the great lakes the selected scenarios were statistically bias corrected using a quantile mapping technique e g chen et al 2013a maraun 2016 n tcha m po 2016 to remove discrepancies between the observed and simulated climate parameters and to help address shortcomings in dynamic downscaling identified by wang and huang 2015 these shortcomings are particularly relevant for the canesm2 model which shows a tendency for precipitation underestimation and temperature overestimation but nonetheless expands the range of potential climate change under consideration the applied bias correction assumes that model bias remains stationary through time and does not adjust the temporal structure of the simulated climate data e g the occurrence of rain events rather the distribution of the simulated data is scaled to that observed in the past this form of bias correction reduces the drizzle effect overestimation of wet day frequency commonly observed in simulated gcm rcm precipitation data gutowski et al 2003 chen et al 2013b wang et al 2016 bias corrected variables were used to calculate pet for hgs input to validate the completed statistical bias correction monthly historical simulations of pet were compared to observed monthly pet for the reference period for which an average r2 value of 0 97 was determined thereby providing confidence in the applied data 2 3 2 weather research and forecasting model wrf this study employed two wrf ensembles coupled to the lake model flake and driven by the community earth system model cesm for reference and mid century future periods of 1979 1994 and 2045 2060 respectively these ensembles differ only in their moist physics configuration refer to erler et al 2019a for supplementary details regarding the wrf model and data preparation contrary to all other projections applied in this study the wrf ensembles referred to as g and t were applied in the form of spatially distributed 10 km resolution monthly normals rather than spatially uniform daily inputs these monthly normals represent monthly mean conditions thereby forming a representative average seasonal cycle hgs is forced by this continuously repeated seasonal cycle until stable hydrologic conditions are reached note that the monthly normal forcing interval is independent of the internal solution time step used in hgs as acknowledged in erler et al 2019a the use of monthly normals is an unconventional approach to hydrologic modelling however this approach serves to address the lack of an established practice for large scale integrated modelling providing a balance between computational limitations and the ability to resolve dominant seasonal change the main effect of this temporal aggregation is the loss of both inter annual variability and the intermittent nature of liquid water flux which may lead to a false increase in infiltration erler et al 2019a the ensembles were bias corrected by erler et al 2019a using an annual average bias correction i e linear scaling to correct the long term mean which was shown to be sufficient to capture the seasonal cycle in the grand river watershed direct outputs from wrf s land surface model noah are used for pet and snowmelt 2 3 3 synthetic scenario a synthetic future climate scenario was derived from multi model mean time series predictions for eastern north america provided in the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report ipcc 2013 time series predictions relative to the 1986 2005 reference period were used to generate new temperature and precipitation data sets for 2040 2059 synthetic future precipitation was developed based on separate winter october to march and summer april to september correction factors while synthetic temperature data was generated based on winter december january february spring march april may summer june july august and fall september october november correction factors in contrast to the regcm4 scenarios remaining parameters used in calculating pet e g solar radiation were left unchanged relative to the 1986 2005 historical reference period data this was due to the limited availability of time series predictions from the ipcc and conducted under the assumption the temperature and precipitation are the main controls on pet it should also be highlighted that unlike the regcm4 scenarios the developed synthetic data set features no change in the temporal structure of climatic events only magnitudes have been adjusted relative to the reference period 2 3 4 analogue historic climate conditions historical reference period climate data 1986 2005 was examined to identify anomalous past conditions that could be indicative of future climate regimes in the upper parkhill watershed and or be used to constrain severe conditions extremes in annually averaged temperature and precipitation identified based on 10th and 90th percentile thresholds within this 20 year period reveal the tendency for cool and wet conditions to occur together and warm and dry conditions to occur together which is not always the case in the rcm scenarios discussed above accordingly watershed response was examined for both a cool wet and warm dry year with comparisons made to a reference period year with average temperature and precipitation it is recognized that anomalous conditions within more recent years may be better suited for this type of analogue scenario analysis however the 1986 2005 time period was selected to be consistent with the commonly used ipcc reference period 2 4 simulation assessment future climate simulations based on the projections described above were examined to assess changes in surface discharge groundwater hydraulic head and net exchange flux surface discharge was evaluated using an average of the two available flow stations watershed outlet and pc iwcm gauge similarly hydraulic head was evaluated using results averaged over the 20 observation points discussed in section 2 2 3 to provide an indication of overall watershed response for the purposes of this study net exchange flux was defined as basin integrated infiltration minus exfiltration i e the overall volumetric transfer of water between surface and subsurface domains divided by the watershed area for instance a negative net exchange flux is representative of subsurface exfiltration which contributes to both runoff and baseflow statistical differences between scenarios and between reference and future periods were examined using a one way analysis of variance anova with α 0 05 when interpreting the results of this study it should be noted that something identified as statistically significant may not be practically significant in terms of apparent watershed impact for each of the examined climate scenarios future changes are statistically assessed relative to a model s respective reference period counterpart the synthetic and analogue scenarios are the only exceptions for which future changes are instead assessed relative to observed historical data mid century predictions for each of the examined models are presented together in section 3 a direct comparison between all scenarios is not possible given their inherent differences e g temporal structure and projection periods nonetheless the examined models present diverse possibilities of mid century climate change and perhaps more importantly enable a discussion concerning input data format and incorporation of lake effects to supplement this analysis model results were also qualitatively examined on a seasonal basis to better understand where throughout an annual cycle the greatest changes are concentrated and to identify differences in behaviour between models 3 results and discussion 3 1 climate projections in order to understand the simulated hydrologic response to applied climate forcing and explain differences between scenarios it is valuable to first examine variability within the projections areas of divergence are likely to generate contrasting hydrologic simulation results a comparison of monthly average liquid water flux i e rain snowmelt for the mid century future period fig 6 generally shows a similar annual cycle in all scenarios with the exception of the regcm4 canesm model opposite to all others the regcm4 canesm model shows a reduction in liquid flux through late spring to early fall the influence of the great lakes is also apparent in fig 6 as there is generally higher liquid flux through the winter and early spring in the wrf models this is assumed to largely reflect improved representation of lake effect snow and associated snowmelt however it is recognized that this phenomenon may be amplified due to snowmelt model differences between the regcm4 degree day and wrf energy balance simulations to assess the change in climate forcing between reference and future periods for a given scenario basin integrated change in net precipitation pnet was calculated for all examined climate projections fig 7 pnet change was calculated using the simulated water balance specifically liquid water flux actual evapotranspiration on average the regcm4 synthetic and wrf ensembles show a reduction in pnet for at least 50 of the year however the timing of this reduction is variable between models as would be expected the warm dry analogue shows reduced pnet from summer through mid fall while the cool wet analogue exhibits a pronounced increase in pnet through most of late spring to early fall 3 2 reference period simulations regcm4 and wrf reference period simulations were compared to observed historic simulations to highlight potential inconsistencies in hydrological response which must be kept in mind when interpreting the future simulation results two historical simulations were run using 1 observed daily climate forcing for 1986 2005 and 2 observed monthly normal forcing for 1979 1996 this accounts for variability in the data structure of the regcm4 versus wrf models and enables an appropriate comparison to each relative to their respective observed simulations a significant difference in head and net exchange was only found for the regcm4 canesm model which indicated lower mean values of each on the other hand a significant difference in surface discharge was found for all regcm4 gcms and the wrf ensembles the majority of which simulate higher flows than those simulated under observed conditions with the exception of the regcm4 canesm model whose flows are lower this indicates that despite bias correction differences in seasonality and the timing of meteorological events e g rainfall relative to historic conditions may be enough to substantially influence the generated hydrological response moreover it is evident that simulated flow is most susceptible to these differences 3 3 future predictions the following section describes mid century change in groundwater hydraulic head surface discharge and net exchange flux for each of the examined climate models table 7 of the regcm4 projections the canesm2 gcm was the only parent model to generate a significant change in groundwater hydraulic head 0 6 for the mid century future period relative to its respective reference period on the other hand all regcm4 models demonstrate a significant decrease in discharge percent change ranging between 6 and 30 while none indicate a significant change in net exchange flux the synthetic scenario indicates a significant change in discharge alone however in contrast to the regcm4 models flow is projected to increase rather than decrease neither of the wrf ensembles indicate a significant future change in hydraulic head or net exchange flux and only the t ensemble indicates a significant change 9 in future flows when compared to its reference period counterpart when the analogue scenarios are compared against an average reference period condition a significant change is only detected for discharge substantial increase of 79 for the cool wet analogue change in median groundwater elevation future reference on a seasonal basis for all models averages less than 0 1 m it should be reiterated that these results are based on the average observation well response which may be masking more localized variability for example when the pc iwcm shallow well is examined individually a significant change in hydraulic head between past and future is detected across most models furthermore depending on the season and model in question seasonal change between past and future may be more or less pronounced relative to the overall watershed perspective for instance the regcm4 canesm model indicates a 12 3 cm reduction in median summer head at the pc iwcm shallow well but only a 1 5 cm reduction in median summer head when all watershed observation points are aggregated these results concur with erler et al 2019b who found significant spatial and seasonal variability in the response of the groundwater table to climate change in their analysis of the grand river watershed possible discrepancy in the amplitude of seasonal head change should also be noted as evidenced through model calibration validation and boundary condition limitations this may result in an under estimation of groundwater change between reference and future periods both the wrf and regcm4 projections generally predict a slight decrease in median flow across all seasons fig 8 a maximum median reduction of 0 3 m3 s was observed for the wrf t ensemble during the fall this reflects the prominently negative pnet change in these models fig 7 especially in the late spring and summer the effects of which are likely to carry throughout the year it should be noted that the interquartile range of wrf spring flows is nearly double that of the regcm4 models suggesting the importance of lake associated precipitation processes both the cool wet analogue and synthetic scenarios show an increase in median future flows across all seasons which is most pronounced in the cool wet scenario maximum median increase of 1 3 m3 s both of these models experience prolonged periods of positive pnet change although at different times of the year which is likely acting to sustain flows fig 7 finally the warm dry analogue suggests an increase in median winter and spring flows followed by a decrease in summer and fall flows median change ranging between 0 5 0 3 m3 s which is clearly mirrored in the pnet trends fig 7 net exchange flux fig 9 extends across a range of positive and negative values where positive net exchange flux indicates net infiltration and negative net exchange flux indicates net exfiltration all scenarios typically exhibit the greatest variability in net exchange flux largest data range in the transition seasons of either spring or fall the regcm4 and synthetic scenarios generally indicate a slight increase in median net exchange flux in all future seasons average median change of 4 the wrf ensembles largely concur with the exception of a predicted decrease in future summer months average summer median reduction of 153 it is possible that this decrease in net exchange flux i e increase in exfiltration signifies the influence of enhanced water storage associated with an increase in winter pnet the effects of which may persist into the summer the cool wet analogue indicates a reduction in median net exchange flux across all seasons the greatest of which is a median reduction of 72 during the fall in contrast the warm dry analogue suggests a decrease in the winter and spring maximum median reduction of 8 along with an increase in the summer and fall maximum median increase of 24 for the most part these changes in net exchange flux coincide with the changes in streamflow discussed previously for example during times of decreased exfiltration there is typically a decrease in streamflow while periods of increased exfiltration are more likely to be associated with an increase in streamflow perhaps seeing stream fluctuations between gaining and losing in relation to pnet these results considered in combination with the noted changes in discharge and head suggest that periods of increased pnet trigger increased exfiltration and vice versa 3 4 differences in future predictions while some general similarities in predicted future change have been noted section 3 3 significant differences exist between the future scenarios themselves the regcm4 canesm model predicts significantly lower heads than the other regcm4 models and synthetic scenario on average 2 5 m lower while the synthetic scenario predicts heads that are significantly higher than the regcm4 canesm and regcm4 gfdl models difference of roughly 0 1 m all regcm4 and synthetic model results for surface flow are significantly different from each other maximum difference of 0 5 m3 s with the regcm4 canesm model predicting the lowest flows and the synthetic model predicting the highest flows the regcm4 canesm and synthetic models predict significantly greater net exchange than the regcm4 gfdl and regcm4 mpi scenarios on average 0 2 mm day higher with regards to the wrf models the future g and t ensembles do not have significantly different heads or net exchange however the models are significantly different with regards to future flow the t ensemble predicts flows that are nearly 11 less than the g ensemble finally when comparing the two analogue scenarios to each other neither scenario produced significantly different heads or net exchange however both the cool wet and warm dry scenarios produce significantly different surface flow with the cool wet scenario having mean flows that are nearly 78 larger than those of the warm dry scenario 3 5 temporal aggregation on a qualitative basis the hydrologic modelling results as well as the nature of the climate projections themselves section 3 1 suggest no obvious reason why models of differing meteorological input structure cannot be examined together in the manner presented nevertheless to evaluate this in more detail 95 confidence intervals fig 10 were determined for simulated future discharge based on the standard error of the mean monthly discharge was selected as a particular variable of interest based on the watershed s apparent heightened surface flow response to changes in climatic stress relative to groundwater hydraulic head and exchange flux in assessing the potential effects of temporal aggregation it was assumed that if the wrf ensemble means lie outside the collective confidence intervals of the other examined projections that a noteworthy difference exists discrepancy is only observed during the months of late winter through the spring which is likely an artifact of lake model coupling in the wrf ensembles as similarly reflected in fig 6 and not an indication of inappropriate model comparison 4 conclusions an integrated numerical model was constructed for the upper parkhill watershed and used to simulate potential hydrological response to future climate conditions under varied meteorological forcing the applied climate scenarios were based on differing data input structures i e daily and monthly normal involved a combination of rcm derived synthetic and analogue projections and examined the influence of lake effects these models differ with regards to projected climate changes e g pnet and accordingly simulated hydrological response fluctuates across models this in itself is an important study outcome as it further emphasizes the uncertainty in climate change predictions that has been similarly observed in previous investigations throughout eastern canada larocque et al 2019 despite this variability a number of general conclusions can be made within the upper parkhill watershed mid century is more likely to experience a significant change in surface discharge than groundwater elevation or net exchange flux with a decrease in overall flow seeming most probable excluding the analogue scenarios the majority of models indicate a slight decrease in flow across all seasons and while statistically insignificant the majority of models correspondingly suggest an increase in net exchange i e more infiltration through most seasons seasonally little to no change in groundwater hydraulic head is detected based on aggregated groundwater monitoring points these results suggest overall resiliency of the groundwater flow system in this watershed however the potential for more pronounced localized change still exists this could have broad implications if for example an agricultural operation redirects previously groundwater based irrigation to a surface water source and vice versa in the case of more widespread reduced flow conditions it is acknowledged that groundwater levels are stabilized to some extent by the imposed regional groundwater boundary conditions which in turn impacts simulated streamflow these boundary conditions may dampen the climate change signal and pull the system towards the state that it was calibrated for a reasonable comparison can be made between models with differing data input structure i e daily versus monthly normal erler et al 2019a made similar conclusions when comparing the wrf monthly normal simulations to wrf monthly transient simulations but it is believed that this can be extended to daily transient data when the model outputs are examined on a coarse scale e g comparison of average reference versus future period conditions or seasonal monthly assessment this has important implications for reducing model run times especially when working with complex large scale integrated models such as hgs where run time constraints may otherwise limit the feasible number of simulations however the utility of this approach depends on the model s intended purpose for example if sub monthly variability is of interest e g for flood forecasting rather than seasonal analysis daily or perhaps even hourly input data would be required the influence of the great lakes as captured in the wrf ensembles is believed to have caused some divergence in simulated spring discharge and summer net exchange relative to the other modelled scenarios while only examined qualitatively in this study the importance of coupling rcms with a robust lake model for climate change assessment in the glb is suggested with regards to the synthetic scenario explored in this investigation it is believed that the simple approach undertaken for scenario generation is viable but perhaps not the most representative in this case when considered with respect to the rcm derived scenarios this is because the synthetic scenario showed similar trends to the wrf g ensemble alone and contrasted all others as intended the analogue scenarios highlight opposite and extreme watershed response it can be inferred that on average mid century hydrologic response will not be as extreme as that experienced during these targeted outlier conditions the applied analogue scenarios therefore delineate thresholds which can inform climate change adaptation strategies and measures of preparedness furthermore the direct incorporation of historic climate data in hydrological climate change simulations facilitates a linkage between watershed response and human behaviour observed during targeted time periods the importance of which has been emphasized by adamson et al 2018 this study would benefit from the simulation of additional climate models including those based on alternative emission scenarios to further address prediction uncertainty future studies may also seek to address modelling limitations such as those imposed by the model boundary conditions this study highlights the fundamental problem of simulating climate change impacts in small watersheds that are not isolated from the regional groundwater flow system a trade off exists between detailed modelling of small watersheds and modelling large watersheds in less detail but with fewer anticipated boundary effects additional strategies for simulating regional groundwater flow under conditions of changing climate should be explored it is also recommended that varied configurations of winter hydrological processes be explored to better constrain the importance of snowmelt and freeze thaw processes in the upper parkhill watershed this study assumes uniform land use properties and does not consider future land use change within the upper parkhill watershed this was deemed beyond the scope of the study but could be examined in future work similarly there are currently no active permits to take water in the upper parkhill watershed i e approved water takings larger than 50 000 l day hypothetical modelling scenarios could be used to explore the impact of intensified water takings to assess the potential for more pronounced hydrological response to climate change it should be noted that while the future climate conditions applied in this study may be similar to those experienced in other areas of the glb predicted hydrological response is likely to vary geographically depending on site specific hydrologic and geologic conditions as well as the modelling approach applied based on the varied hydrologic response observed in this study it is suggested that simulation outcomes should be used to generally assess system response to changing climate stimulus rather than viewed as absolute credit

5643,highly parameterized numerical models are frequently used in environmental sciences to interpret physicochemical processes despite their popularity unjustified model complexity often undermines model generalizability resulting in poor model predictive capabilities a trade off between model performance and complexity can be achieved using model selection techniques which are largely unexplored in biogeochemical modeling our study aims to address this scientific gap by investigating the main advantages and findings of model selection in a typical biogeochemical modeling application in particular the study focuses on the numerical description at five different levels of complexity of the reactive transport processes of nitrogen species in a controlled aquifer model laboratory setup to this end the mechanistic model hydrus is coupled with the multimodal nested sampling algorithm for the estimation of the bayesian model evidence and posterior parameter distributions after successfully calibrating the hydrus 2d model against measurements from a tracer test a lower fidelity surrogate based analysis is carried out to tackle the problem of computational cost as well as to compare five different models which combine first order and monod based parameterization of the microbial nitrogen degradation results demonstrate that measured data contain enough information content to support an increase in the complexity of the monod model which can reproduce the transient accumulation of nitrite at the beginning of the experiment the bayesian analysis reveals that such behavior is related to the particular structure of measured data which plays a fundamental role in the model selection the analysis concludes with a validation of the surrogate based analysis which confirms the reliability of the proposed numerical approach opening up new perspectives on the use of multi fidelity surrogates for the bayesian model selection in environmental modeling keywords modeling model selection lower fidelity surrogate model hydrus nitrification 1 introduction water pollution is a global challenge that has increased in both developed and developing countries undermining economic growth as well as the physical and environmental health of billions of people the european environmental agency eea has recently reported that only 38 of european water bodies met chemical pollution standards european environment agency 2018 with groundwater sites showing high exposure to nutrient pollution from agricultural activities a similar trend was observed in china and the united states where agriculture was identified as the main source of pollution of surface water bodies mateo sagasta et al 2017 extensive use of organic and inorganic fertilizers as well as waste management from livestock is directly related to increased levels of nitrogen pollution in water bodies preventative measures taken in the last few decades such as optimized fertigation strategies and appropriate tillage and manure management have resulted in an appreciable decrease of nitrate concentrations in surface water bodies though their effect on groundwater is still limited eea 2018 groundwater vulnerability to nitrogen byproducts is mainly influenced by reactive transport processes in the vadose zone subsurface redox conditions induced by the coupled water solute transport regulate the microbial transformation of nitrogen species such as nitrification and denitrification an accurate numerical description of these multiple interacting physical and biological processes is crucial for developing effective and reliable strategies to mitigate groundwater nitrogen pollution in the last few decades several models have been developed and applied to describe and predict nitrogen turnover in soils both at small and large scales for example the hydrological model hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 has been successfully used to simulate nitrogen balance in several agricultural applications e g filipović et al 2016 gärdenäs et al 2005 hanson et al 2006 li et al 2015 hydrus numerically solves the richards and advection dispersion reaction equations describing water flow and solute transport in soils respectively nitrogen reactions are generally simulated using a sequential chain with first order coefficients which reduces the number of model parameters but simplifies the description of the microbial degradation on the other hand the model daisy hansen et al 1991 refines the description of nitrogen turnover in the root zone by simulating the effect of microbial growth in multiple conceptual pools a similar approach is used in the models rzwqm ma et al 2012 and century parton 1996 many studies have proven the accuracy of this approach e g cameira et al 1998 kröbel et al 2010 ma et al 2007 salazar et al 2017 however the choice of an appropriate level of model complexity is a constant problem in biogeochemical modeling e g homann et al 2000 kimmins et al 2008 a large number of optimized parameters can pose model calibration issues such as significant parameter uncertainty and limited model predictive capabilities that undermine its generalizability ajami and gu 2010 elsheikh et al 2013 freni et al 2011 schoups et al 2008 since model uncertainty plays a crucial role in optimal decision making for groundwater management peña haro et al 2011 wagner and gorelick 1987 the selected model must be as simple as possible as complex as necessary höge et al 2018 to accurately reproduce observations and reduce predictive uncertainty this approach should be ubiquitous in any modeling application the high conceptual parameterization of complex models often results in the overfitting of measured data and parameter non uniqueness unless large and informative observations are used for calibration pande et al 2015 in contrast simpler models generally have lower predictive uncertainty since their few parameters are easily constrained by observations although the fit quality deteriorates thus a less accurate simple model ranks better than a more complex one that does not provide a good enough fit to justify its higher complexity myung 2000 this trade off between quality of fit and complexity embodies the principle of occam s razor which states that entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity and is at the basis of model selection techniques the bayesian model selection is a formal approach that allows a comparison of alternative models on a statistically rigorous basis in light of observations and any prior information available this evaluation is based on the calculation of the bayesian model evidence often named in the literature as the marginal likelihood computation of the bayesian model evidence is numerically challenging as it involves a multi dimensional integration over the entire parameter space often described by a multimodal peaked likelihood surface such problems are exacerbated for environmental and biogeochemical models characterized by high nonlinearity and strong parameter interactions ajami and gu 2010 brunetti et al 2019 2016 dai et al 2019 to avoid the time consuming monte carlo mc analysis several authors have suggested different analytical approximations of the bayesian model evidence for example the akaike information criterion akaike 1973 stems from the information theory and is frequently applied for its ease of implementation guthery et al 2003 in another study neuman 2003 proposed a maximum likelihood bayesian model averaging approach based on kashyap s information criterion which reduces computational effort a further simplified index is the bayesian information criterion first introduced by schwarz 1978 recently watanabe 2013 proposed a widely applicable bayesian information criterion wbic which starts with the computed log pointwise posterior predictive density and then adds a correction for an effective number of parameters to adjust for overfitting as discussed by gelman et al 2014 this criterion has the advantage of averaging over the posterior distribution rather than conditioning on a point estimate however friel et al 2017 demonstrated that the wbic can overestimate the bayesian model evidence such inaccuracies can lead to contradictory model rankings which complicate the model selection lu et al 2011 further confirmed these findings by highlighting significant differences in the geostatistical model selection between classical information criteria and the monte carlo markov chain mcmc analysis similar results were reported by schöniger et al 2014 who compared nine ways to calculate the bayesian model evidence in a hydrological application concluding that numerical integration is at the basis of the bayesian model selection to this aim multiple studies have focused on developing or improving algorithms for the mc determination of the marginal likelihood the most popular mc approximation is the arithmetic mean of the joint likelihood evaluated for parameter samples obtained by various methods e g mcmc generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation methods however this approximation is affected by slow convergence and overestimation of the marginal likelihood especially if the posterior distribution is much more concentrated than that of the prior kass and raftery 1995 to overcome this limitation pajor 2017 proposed a corrected arithmetic mean estimator in which the prior sample is trimmed to eliminate regions of the parameter space with very low likelihood similarly as in the corrected harmonic mean estimator lenk 2009 various other numerical methods have been proposed in the literature to estimate the bayesian model evidence directly or to compute ratios of two marginal likelihoods i e a bayes factor popular methods are based on the reversible jump algorithm green 1995 and bridge sampling methods meng and wong 1996 recently volpi et al 2017 proposed a gaussian mixture importance game sampling which estimates the evidence via multidimensional numerical integration of the posterior parameter distribution using bridge sampling first a large collection of samples is generated from the posterior parameter distribution using mcmc simulation with the dream algorithm vrugt 2016 by conditioning separately each candidate model on the observed data then a multivariate mixture distribution is fitted to this mcmc collection of posterior samples using the likelihood theory to estimate the marginal likelihood of each competing hypothesis via bridge sampling a popular alternative is to estimate the marginal likelihood from the gibbs sampling output chib 1995 later extended to the metropolis hastings output chib and jeliazkov 2001 however both variants are computationally inefficient friel and pettitt 2008 proposed a thermodynamic integration method inspired by the path sampling of gelman and meng 1998 recently wei et al 2019 applied this method to calculate the marginal likelihood and discriminate between different evapotranspiration models in another study liu et al 2016 showed that thermodynamic integration could outperform semi analytical solutions arithmetic mean harmonic mean and nested sampling in terms of the solution accuracy and consistency for repeated independent runs a difficulty with this method is the choice of the optimal temperature schedule to circumvent this issue weinberg 2012 proposed a novel approach based on lebesgue integration however the thermodynamic integration generally requires a high computational cost which restraints its use in environmental modeling elshall and ye 2019 proposed a variant of the steppingstone sampling algorithm which is less sensitive to sampling errors and more computationally efficient than the thermodynamic integration yet this method is mainly limited to moderately complex problems from this literature background it emerges that an accurate estimation of the marginal likelihood requires a high number of model executions which may not be possible for biogeochemical models due to their high computational cost a viable solution is to use highly efficient mc algorithms which provide a balanced trade off between marginal likelihood accuracy and computational effort this will allow to have a statistical basis for biogeochemical model selection and uncertainty assessment which is of great importance in biogeochemical modeling skilling 2006 proposed a one dimensional re parametrization of the integral of the bayesian model evidence which significantly reduced the computational cost of the bayesian analysis this approach is at the basis of the nested sampling ns algorithm which has been applied successfully in several research fields elsheikh et al 2014 2013 mukherjee et al 2006 paulson et al 2019 schöniger et al 2014 shaw et al 2007 liu et al 2016 evaluated the convergence and accuracy of ns using multiple numerical experiments and concluded that it is computationally more efficient than thermodynamic integration and similarly accurate the low stability in the estimation of the marginal likelihood stems from the necessity to draw efficiently unbiased samples from the likelihood constrained prior several variants of the original algorithm were developed to address this issue brewer et al 2011 proposed a diffusive nested sampling algorithm that uses mcmc to explore a mixture of progressively constrained distributions however for highly correlated and multimodal target distributions multiple particles needs to be considered which increases the computational cost furthermore multiple tuning parameters have to be set making the algorithm very sensitive handley et al 2015 developed the polychord ns algorithm which uses the slice sampling to sample within the nested isolikelihood contours thus making it suited for a high dimensional parameter space a recent study of cao et al 2018 reported how polychord outperformed other ns based algorithms in terms of accuracy and stability in high dimensional inverse problems even though it is computationally expensive in another study zeng et al 2018 used the dreamzs algorithm to sample from the likelihood constrained prior and compared it against the classic ns metropolis hastings results of that study indicate that the ns dreamzs is more efficient and robust which indicates that this algorithm is due to its higher efficiency preferable to the thermodynamic integration when computational resources are inadequate to improve the computational efficiency of the ns higson et al 2019 introduced a dynamic nested sampling algorithm in which the number of live points varies allocating samples more efficiently this results in a speedup of computations by a factor of up to 7 for marginal likelihood calculations feroz et al 2009 proposed an ellipsoidal rejection sampling scheme multinest that allows us to identify and isolate near gaussian posterior modes in small overlapping ellipsoids once identified these modes can be evolved independently thereby automatically accommodating posteriors degeneracies while maintaining high efficiency for simpler problems multinest has proven to be highly efficient and accurate for low dimensional problems i e 20 parameters while its accuracy degrades for highly parameterized analyses later feroz et al 2013 proposed an importance nested sampling which overcomes such limitations and significantly increases the accuracy of multinest despite its computational efficiency the ns still requires thousands of model runs to calculate the bayesian model evidence in this perspective recent studies on the surrogate based analysis have demonstrated their efficiency for computationally expensive model calibration applications asher et al 2015 brunetti et al 2017 elsheikh et al 2014 laloy et al 2013 razavi et al 2012 while most of the existing literature focuses on data driven surrogates previous studies highlighted how lower fidelity surrogates overcome many of the limitations of data driven surrogates asher et al 2015 razavi et al 2012 lower fidelity surrogates are computationally cheap models constructed from the complex model by reducing geometrical complexity numerical resolution or removing processes and generally yield efficient calibration providing that their approximation is limited and assessed against the original model the combination of efficient bayesian model selection techniques i e nested sampling with lower fidelity surrogates is still largely unexplored for biogeochemical modeling applications more research is thus needed in this direction obtained results could apply to other scientific fields as well our study aims to cover these scientific gaps by exploring the main advantages and findings of model selection in a typical biogeochemical application in particular the study focuses on the numerical description at different levels of complexity of the reactive transport processes of nitrogen species in a controlled aquifer model laboratory setup the aquifer model is first subject to a tracer test to characterize its hydraulic functioning and then to an application of cattle slurry to assess biogeochemical reactions involved in nitrogen transformations the problem is addressed in the following way initially the mechanistic model hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 is externally coupled with the multinest algorithm for the estimation of the bayesian model evidence and posterior parameter distributions next the coupled two dimensional hydrus 2d model is employed to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters using measurements from a tracer experiment estimated parameters are then used in the one dimensional hydrus 1d model which simulates transport and biogeochemical reactions in the system during the application of cattle slurry hydrus 1d is used as a lower fidelity surrogate to overcome the impractically high computational cost associated with the 2d model in the computationally intensive bayesian model selection five levels of complexity of the biogeochemical model are investigated either constant first order decay rates or monod kinetics are alternatively used and combined to interpret ammonification and nitrification processes in the aquifer high spatial resolution measurements are used in the bayesian analysis to constrain the inverse problem finally results from the surrogate based analysis are projected in the 2d model for validation it must be noted that the combined use of the multinest algorithm and the lower fidelity surrogate for the bayesian model selection represents a novelty in biogeochemical modeling underlining that the development of efficient model selection frameworks for such applications is of crucial importance 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study description 2 1 1 experimental setup a schematic of the experimental aquifer setup is shown in fig 1 the aquifer model 106 cm long 50 cm high 20 cm wide was divided into two chambers a 100 cm wide chamber for the sediment packing and a 6 cm wide chamber for drainage separated by a water permeable grid the soil was packed up to a height of 50 cm to guarantee uniform irrigation water inflow at the soil surface was pumped from a reservoir to the aquifer model using 4 peristaltic pumps connected to 60 silicone tubes equipped with an injection needle the outflow tube from the drainage chamber was used to simulate water table fluctuations by adjusting its height via a self built automated piston device outflow water was then collected in a waste container and pumped to the sink the sediment used in the experiment originated from a gravel pit in bruckmühl near munich germany the particle size distribution analysis indicated a medium coarse sandy sediment characterized by a negligible silt and clay content i e 1 25 groundwater used for the experiments was taken directly from a well at the institute for groundwater ecology in the helmholtz zentrum münchen germany where all experiments were conducted soil water samplers rhizon sms eijkelkamp and optical dissolved oxygen sensors pst3 presenns were installed in four vertical profiles indicated by letters a b c and d vertical dashed lines in fig 1 with eight ports and spots each respectively pore water samples extracted during the tracer test were analyzed using an isotopic water analyzer picarro l2120 i to reconstruct breakthrough curves btcs ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 concentrations in samples and groundwater were determined using an ion chromatography system ics 1100 dionex while a total organic carbon analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu was used to measure the dissolved organic carbon doc no measurements of organic nitrogen norg were available due to operational issues the soil pressure head was monitored by eleven tensiometers black circles in fig 1 t5 5 ums distributed in three vertical profiles with an acquisition frequency of 30 min the experiment consisted of a tracer test which was conducted before the manure injection the system was equilibrated by irrigating with pure groundwater for 15 weeks before starting with the manure injection in particular during this period the irrigation rate and the water table were set to 13 35 l day and 25 cm respectively 2 1 2 tracer experiments the tracer experiment took place between weeks 6 and 15 of the equilibration period in order to avoid disturbances inside the model aquifer during experiments with cattle slurry i e nitrogen the main objective of the tracer test was to accurately characterize the solute transport processes in the aquifer and to use btc data in the bayesian framework to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and transport parameters the tracer test was conducted under steady state flow conditions by injecting deuterium 2h enriched groundwater into the system in particular a tracer solution volume of 1 6 l with a concentration of 243 mg l was applied at the soil surface for 173 min btcs were obtained by regularly sampling pore water for five days at 16 selected sampling ports fig 1 in total approximately 40 ml of pore water was extracted per sampling port over a period of up to four days which is small compared to the total water volume 30 l and not significant enough to influence water flow within the system 2 1 3 experiments on the fate of ammonium and nitrate nitrogen mineralization was triggered by injecting cattle slurry into the aquifer model for 89 days the main aim of this experiment was to investigate nitrogen reactive processes in a combined saturated unsaturated system under different operating conditions the experiment required four different reservoirs with a volume of 200 l two liters of preconditioned liquid manure were diluted in 198 l of pure groundwater to reach a sufficiently high concentration of nutrients biogeochemical measurements were carried out in both the reservoirs and at the injection needles when connecting a new reservoir to the system because as mentioned previously it was not possible to measure organic nitrogen its concentration was established using measured nh4 concentrations and compared with literature values in particular previous studies indicated that ammonium generally represents about 50 of the nitrogen in the liquid cattle manure e g beauchamp et al 2010 van middelkoop and holshof 2017 therefore the organic nitrogen concentration in the inflow is assumed to be the same as the ammonium during the first 51 days of the experiments considering that nitrite and nitrate concentrations were considerably smaller table 1 the last cattle manure reservoir was connected to the injection system on day 51 measured inflow concentrations indicate that no3 was the predominant n species table 1 this behavior is due to strong mineralization processes likely triggered by preliminary sieving and centrifugation of cattle slurry used to separate liquid and solid fractions indeed previous studies have demonstrated that such treatment results in a monodisperse particle size distribution of the liquid manure characterized by a majority of particles below 25 µm peters et al 2011 such particles are characterized by low carbon nitrogen ratios and a high nitrogen mineralization potential fangueiro et al 2008 thus a norg concentration of 1 mg l was assumed for the last reservoir considering that doc was still detected in the inflow nevertheless preliminary numerical simulations showed that this value plays a negligible role in the nitrification process due to its relatively low magnitude the experiment was divided into three stages table 1 steady state flow conditions were induced for the first 22 days by setting the recharge rate and the water table to 13 35 l day and 25 cm respectively on day 23 the recharge rate was decreased to 6 5 l day to increase transit times between days 54 and 73 transient flow conditions were generated by simulating diurnal water table fluctuations the applied amplitude and periodicity were consistent with water table fluctuations observed in natural environments gribovszki et al 2010 2008 in particular the automated piston device was programmed to raise and lower the outflow tube from 16 to 34 cm providing a complete fluctuation cycle over 24 h on day 73 the fluctuations were terminated when the water table reached its starting position at a depth of 25 cm at that time the peristaltic pumps were deactivated resulting in stagnant water flow measured dissolved oxygen in the aquifer model was always above 2 mg l which indicates suitable aerobic conditions for nitrification and negligible denitrification 2 2 modeling theory 2 2 1 water flow and solute transport the hydrological model hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 is used to model the hydraulic behavior of the aquifer hydrus is a finite element model for simulating the movement of water heat and multiple solutes in variably saturated porous media it numerically solves the richards equation for multi dimensional variably saturated water flow 1 θ t k h z where t is time t z is the vertical coordinate l θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and h is the pressure head l the unimodal van genuchten mualem vgm model van genuchten 1980 is used to describe the soil hydraulic properties 2 θ 1 1 α h n m if h 0 1 if h 0 θ θ θ r θ s θ r 3 k k s θ l 1 1 θ 1 m m 2 if h 0 k s if h 0 m 1 1 n where θ is the effective saturation l3l 3 α is a shape parameter related to the inverse of the air entry pressure head l 1 θs and θr are the saturated and residual water contents respectively l3l 3 n and m are pore size distribution indices ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and l is the tortuosity and pore connectivity parameter the reactive transport of nitrogen species in the aquifer is modeled as a sequential reaction chain in which organic nitrogen is first converted into ammonium by heterotrophic organisms then oxidized by autotrophic bacteria into nitrite and nitrate denitrification processes are neglected due to the persistent oxic conditions observed during the experiment the transport of the kth solute in the aquifer is described using the advection dispersion reaction equation assuming that solutes can exist

are responsible for nitrogen mineralization heterotrophic bacteria convert organic nitrogen into ammonium i e ammonification which is used as a substrate in the next nitrification process operated by autotrophic bacteria ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob such reactions can be numerically described using two different formulations either as constant first order decay reactions or as monod kinetics the former neglects the bacteria growth and assumes constant reaction rates while the latter adjusts the reaction depending on the simulated bacteria population when considering constant first order decay the reaction chain in the solid and liquid phases is described as follow 7 ϕ k μ l k θ c k μ s k ρ s k where µl k and µs k are the first order degradation coefficients for the kth solute providing a connection between chain species in the liquid and solid phases respectively t 1 this numerical approach has been used extensively in the literature e g hanson et al 2006 li et al 2015 ramos et al 2012 the use of this model is also justified by measured inflow concentrations table 1 which exhibit a complete shift towards nitrate after day 54 suggesting a plausible negligible effect of reaction processes towards the end of the experiment on the other hand biomass growth and decay are explicitly modeled using the monod kinetics and the first order reaction respectively 7 d γ dt γ c k s c k γ b γ where γ is the biomass concentration ml 3 γ is the maximum aerobic growth rate t 1 s is the half saturation constant mm 1 and b is the first order coefficient representing lysis t 1 this approach assumes that bacterial degradation only occurs in the liquid phase de wilde et al 2009 and that bacteria are immobile de wilde et al 2009 holden and fierer 2005 wehrer et al 2012 leading to 8 ϕ k γ y γ c k s c k θ where y is the yield coefficient mm 1 the monod kinetics while providing a more coherent description of nitrogen turnover requires more parameters and is computationally more expensive and therefore its use should be statistically justified in light of the information content of measured data a preliminary analysis of measured effluent concentrations showed a transient accumulation of nitrites and a delayed production of nitrates in the aquifer at the beginning of the experiment suggesting the bacterial growth had a significant influence on the mineralization process fig 2 ammonium in injected water was readily available for oxidation into nitrites by aobs as the aobs population grew the nitrite substrate became sufficient to trigger nobs growth which reduced nitrites by producing nitrates after this transient period both bacterial populations were equilibrated and the mineralization process was characterized by fast nitrate production and transport this preliminary data screening theoretically supports the use of monod kinetics for the interpretation of the nitrogen turnover in the aquifer however the most appropriate description of each process e g ammonification ammonium oxidation nitrite oxidation must be identified to avoid unjustified complexity to this aim the first order decay reactions and monod kinetics are combined to obtain a set of five different biogeochemical models of increasing complexity table 2 in particular the simplest m1 model describes all nitrogen reactions using only first order reactions while the most complex m5 model simulates bacteria growth in all reaction processes different model compositions aim not only to identify the most appropriate level of model complexity but also to explain whether bacterial growth plays a crucial role in all reaction steps 2 2 3 numerical domain and boundary conditions in this section model settings used in the following bayesian analysis are described the two dimensional model hydrus 2d is used in combination with tracer data for the bayesian estimation of soil hydraulic and transport properties throughout this manuscript hydrus 2d is considered the high fidelity model due to its comprehensive description of boundary conditions bcs the two dimensional domain has a length and a depth of 100 and 50 cm respectively the domain is discretized into two dimensional triangular elements refined in the right part of the domain to accommodate velocity gradients at the outflow thus reducing mass balance errors the generated fe mesh has 2142 nodes and 4100 two dimensional elements an atmospheric bc green line in fig 3 is specified on the top boundary of the model domain to simulate the irrigation of the aquifer this bc type can exist in three different states a irrigation and or potential evaporation fluxes b a zero pressure head full saturation during ponding when both infiltration and surface runoff occur and c an equilibrium between the soil surface pressure and the atmospheric water vapor pressure when the atmospheric evaporative demand cannot be met by evaporation from the soil profile soil evaporation is neglected due to its limited effect on the experiment cover on top a special time variable pressure head bc blue line in fig 3 is used for the right part of the domain exposed to air and water table fluctuations this bc assigns the specified pressure head value to the lowest nodal point of the boundary while pressure heads at other nodes are adjusted based on the z coordinate at the same time a seepage face bc is assigned to nodes with calculated negative pressure heads the concentration flux along the top and right boundaries is simulated using the cauchy type bc zero water and concentration flux boundary conditions black lines in fig 3 are applied to all remaining boundaries of the domain preliminary tests have shown that the execution time to simulate both ammonification and nitrification using the monod kinetics in hydrus 2d was around 10 000 s on a pc equipped with a cpu intel core i7 8750h 16 gb of ram and ssd since no high performance computing cluster was readily available such computational cost would make the bayesian model selection impractical therefore hydrus 1d is used as a lower fidelity surrogate model due to its limited run time i e 8 s this assumption appears acceptable for several reasons 1 hydrus 1d simplifies only the geometry of the problem while it shares the same parameterization and simulates the same physicochemical processes as hydrus 2d 2 the infiltration process in the unsaturated part of the domain is considered to be strictly vertical and thus the two models are expected to produce similar infiltration pathways 3 since the majority of reactive processes take place near the sediment surface the similarity between hydrus 1d and hydrus 2d in this zone guarantees a good description of the reactive transport also in the surrogate and 4 preliminary simulations showed that the velocities are higher in the saturated zone of the system than in the unsaturated zone due to the limited length of the aquifer model i e 100 cm the delay induced by horizontal flow in the saturated zone is rather limited and the assumption of instantaneous discharge in the surrogate is thus tolerable however it must be emphasized that these assumptions and the used approach are not general but restricted to this particular case study there exist multiple numerical approaches to formally address the discrepancies between low and high fidelity models such as correction functions space mapping and hybrid strategies razavi et al 2012 which are however beyond the scope of the present work nevertheless final model validation is carried out to assess the results of the surrogate based analysis similarly the hydrus 1d vertical domain is discretized in 100 one dimensional elements which are refined near the soil surface an atmospheric bc is specified on the top boundary while a time variable pressure head bc the red line in fig 3 is used for the bottom boundary the quality of the fe mesh is assessed by checking the mass balance error reported by hydrus at the end of the simulation mass balance errors which in this simulation were always below 1 are generally considered acceptable at these low levels initial pressure head conditions are assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium from the lowest located nodal point i e z 0 and h 25 cm measured concentrations from different sampling points were used to set initial solute concentrations in the solute domain since no measured data were available the microbial biomass initial concentration in model m2 was assumed to decrease with depth in particular a value of 10 mg l is assumed for the top 10 cm while 1 mg l is set in all remaining nodes of the numerical domain this is compatible with what was already observed in other studies e g henrichs et al 2007 the standard hydrus code was modified to simulate bacterial degradation in model m2 to this end a separate fortran file was created to solve explicitly in time eq 7 and to calculate zero order reaction rates which are then used to assemble the system of algebraic equations resulting from the discretization of the governing advection dispersion partial differential equations 2 3 model calibration and uncertainty assessment 2 3 1 multinest algorithm in this section the multinest algorithm used in the model selection and inverse parameter estimation is described for simplicity only a general overview of the method is provided while detailed descriptions about the theoretical background and numerical implementation can be found in skilling 2006 mukherjee et al 2006 and feroz et al 2009 the bayesian inference provides a statistically coherent approach for the estimation of a set of parameters ω in a model h for the data d 9 pr ω d h pr d ω h pr ω h pr d h where pr ω d h p ω is the posterior probability of the parameters pr d ω h l ω is the likelihood pr ω h π ω is the prior and pr d h z is the bayesian model evidence which can be expressed as 10 z l ω π ω d d ω where d is the dimensionality of the parameter space the bayesian evidence is the average of the likelihood over the prior and it is expected to be smaller for a model with large areas in its parameter space having low likelihood even if the likelihood function is highly peaked and larger for a model with higher likelihood of model parameters in a larger fraction of its parameter space the numerical estimation of z is at the basis of the model selection and is the core of the ns algorithm ns was first presented by skilling 2006 as an efficient monte carlo method to calculate the evidence and estimate posterior distributions as by products the core of the method is the transformation of the multi dimensional integral in eq 10 to a one dimensional integral to this end the prior mass x can be defined as the cumulative prior mass covering all likelihood values greater than the iso likelihood contour ω 11 x ω l ω ω π ω d d ω for the case of normalized prior probability the prior mass x has a value 1 if ω 0 and decreases to 0 as ω approaches 1 defining the inverse function l x as the likelihood which bounds a prior mass x one can simplify eq 10 from a multi dimensional integral over the prior volume to a one dimensional integral over the prior mass 12 z 0 1 l x d x the ns algorithm provides an iterative process to solve eq 12 at each iteration i n active samples are drawn from the prior samples are then sorted in order of their likelihood and the smallest with likelihood l 0 is removed from the active set and replaced by a point drawn from the prior subject to the constraint that the point has a likelihood l l 0 the iterative process is stopped when the stopping criterion is satisfied the algorithm thus travels through nested shells of likelihood as the prior volume is shrunk once the evidence z is estimated posterior parameter distributions and associated weights can be inferred using the full sequence of discarded points from the nested sampling process in this study the active set consisted of 100 points for all bayesian analyses this value was selected based on a preliminary sensitivity analysis on the effect of active points on the calculated marginal likelihood briefly the coefficient of variation cv of the marginal likelihood was estimated by running the ns algorithm five times using a different number of active points i e 20 50 100 200 as described in zeng et al 2018 only a negligible reduction in the cv was obtained when using more than 100 points this analysis was carried out used to assess the stability of the estimator and its potential effect on models ranking the most challenging task in the ns algorithm is sampling from the prior with the hard constraint l l 0 to overcome this problem several techniques have been proposed in the past in the present study the multinest algorithm proposed by feroz et al 2009 is used multinest is a combination of the ellipsoidal nested sampling mukherjee et al 2006 with the recursive clustering shaw et al 2007 that is particularly suited for degenerated multimodal posterior distributions which are often encountered when inversely estimating soil hydraulic and transport parameters e g brunetti et al 2019 indeed in such circumstances a single ellipsoid also includes low likelihood regions between high likelihood clusters making the algorithm extremely inefficient the solution is to detect these clusters and bind them in separate ellipsoids to achieve this a recursive process with 2 means clustering is adopted if the resulting two ellipsoids have a significantly lower total volume than the parent ellipsoid less than half the split is accepted and the clustering and volume test are repeated on each of the two subsets of points this process continues recursively alternatively if the total ellipse volume is significantly greater than expected this indicates that there may be more than two clusters and that 2 means clustering was not appropriate therefore the algorithm still tries to subdivide the clusters recursively however it only accepts the final clustering if the total volume decrease is significant it can be assumed that the posterior bulk was explored sufficiently when the active points in sum incremented the evidence by only some small fraction of the total accumulated evidence more specifically the currently active point with the highest likelihood gives an estimate of the highest likelihood in the region the remaining evidence at iteration i is estimated according to 13 z est l max x i where xi is the remaining prior volume the stopping criterion is then based on the ratio between the estimated total evidence and the current evidence 14 log z i z est log z est 0 5 to avoid the premature stopping of the algorithm the maximum number of algorithm iterations is set to 100 000 such threshold value has never been reached during the simulations 2 3 2 likelihood function and prior distributions if we assume that error residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed with a constant variance σ 2 the likelihood function l ω can be written as 15 l ω i 1 k 1 2 π σ 2 exp 1 2 σ 2 h i ω y i 2 where h i ω and ỹi are the ith model realization and its corresponding measured value respectively for algebraic simplicity the log likelihood ℓ ω is used 16 ℓ ω k 2 ln 2 π k 2 ln σ 2 1 2 σ 2 i 1 k h i ω y i 2 in the inverse modeling σ 2 is treated as a nuisance parameter and integrated out from the inference equation e g kavetski et al 2006 the new likelihood is then written as 17 ℓ ω k 2 ln i 1 k h i ω y i 2 uniform prior distributions are used in the bayesian analysis parameter bounds are provided in the following sections 2 3 3 inverse estimation of soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters before the bayesian model selection the multinest algorithm is used in conjunction with tracer data to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and transport parameters this modeling scenario is denoted as tr a high resolution dataset consisting of measured btcs from 16 sampling points is used to calibrate hydrus 2d since the tracer breakthrough curves did not show any anomalous behavior such as tailing knorr et al 2016 pedretti et al 2013 the effects of soil heterogeneity have been neglected to have a better agreement between hydrus 1d and hydrus 2d a weight of 0 2 has been assigned to measured deuterium concentrations in the saturated zone where the effect of the horizontal flow is appreciable as such the optimized soil hydraulic parameters are mostly representative of the unsaturated zone which is similarly described by the high and lower fidelity models for such conditions estimated soil hydraulic and transport parameters can be directly transferred to hydrus 1d since they are representative of the soil properties of the aquifer the residual water content θr is fixed to 0 0 which is a common value for coarse textured soils e g brunetti et al 2017 the pore connectivity parameter l is set to 0 5 and the transverse dispersivity λt is assumed 0 1λl due to these simplifications the number of unknown parameters is reduced to 5 the saturated water content θs the vgm shape parameters α and n the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the longitudinal dispersivity λl the parameter bounds used in the analysis are reported in table 2 2 3 4 biogeochemical model selection 50th percentile values of the posterior distributions of soil hydraulic and transport parameters obtained in the scenario tr are then used in hydrus 1d for the bayesian model selection measured nitrite and nitrate concentrations from different vertical profiles are averaged to obtain average concentrations for 8 observation points at different depths fig 1 the number of unknown parameters in biogeochemical models varies between 7 m1 and 14 m5 table 3 a preliminary sensitivity analysis to identify unimportant factors is avoided due to the relatively low dimensionality of the inverse problem in such circumstances the bayesian analysis normally reveals which parameters are influential and can be inferred from measured data the soil bulk density is set to 1 5 g cm3 which is a common value for sandy sediments molecular diffusion coefficients are assumed 1 92 cm2 day 1 for all nitrogen species langergraber and simunek 2006 parameter bounds reported in table 2 are based on a literature review e g bitton 2010 hanson et al 2006 leslie grady et al 2011 and slightly expanded to detect particular patterns in the bayesian optimization indeed posterior parameter distributions located near the bounds of the search space generally indicate the theoretical inadequacy of the model which can only describe measured data by using unphysical parameter values finally the calculated bayesian model evidence is used for the model selection and to summarize model differences 2 3 5 model validation 50th percentile values of the posterior distributions obtained in the bayesian surrogate based analysis i e hydrus 1d are used in the high fidelity model i e hydrus 2d to perform a single forward model run modeled nitrite and nitrate concentrations at four different depths are compared with measured data to validate the results of the surrogate based analysis this aim of this step is to identify plausible significant deviations between the higher and lower fidelity models and to provide a general assessment of the surrogate based analysis 3 results 3 1 inverse estimation of soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters the joint and marginal posterior distributions of the soil hydraulic and transport parameters obtained from scenario tr are shown in fig 4 and have a markedly unimodal pattern characterized by a leptokurtic behavior consequently the confidence intervals table 3 are narrow thus indicating good identifiability of optimized parameters the bayesian analysis reveals a well posed inverse problem characterized by low uncertainty mainly stemming from the simultaneous use of informative measured concentrations at different depths which constrain the inverse estimation problem well this is further confirmed by the limited correlation shown in the joint posterior distributions estimated parameter ranges are in agreement with what has been reported in the literature for sandy soils e g thoma et al 2014 only the saturated hydraulic conductivity exhibits a relatively lower value e g carsel and parrish 1988 indicating the compaction of the aquifer model during the experiment the longitudinal dispersivity λl ranges between 0 11 and 0 19 cm which corresponds with the values reported in sato et al 2003 and vanderborght and vereecken 2007 water flow is characterized by vertical infiltration in the unsaturated zone and by its gradual transition to horizontal flow when approaching the saturated zone such behavior is particularly evident near the outflow posterior predictive checks grey lines in fig 5 confirm the accuracy of the numerical model in describing the coupled water solute transport in the aquifer fig 5 shows a slight underestimation of the tracer concentration at z 20 cm in the vertical profile d fig 1 this can be explained by lower weights assigned to the observation points in the saturated zone i e z 25 cm during the bayesian analysis thus their less accurate fit by the model the overall accuracy of the model predictions confirms the assumption of homogeneous soil and the negligible influence of heterogeneity on water and solute movement the estimated 50th percentile values of soil hydraulic and transport parameters table 3 are used in the next bayesian model selection where only adsorption and reaction parameters are investigated 3 2 biogeochemical model selection 3 2 1 marginal likelihoods the multinest algorithm required from 1211 m1 to 2671 m4 iterations to satisfy the convergence criterion eq 14 in particular scenario m5 required on average approximately 3 days of computation to perform a single bayesian analysis this behavior is related to an increase in both the dimensionality of the inverse problem i e 14 parameters and the mathematical complexity of the numerical model indeed the addition of multiple monod type reactions eq 8 makes the system of partial differential equations eq 4 numerically stiff thus requiring smaller time steps to achieve convergence the coefficient of variation for multiple multinest runs is very low for all modeling scenarios table 4 and does not affect the model ranking thus indicating an overall satisfactory accuracy and stability of the algorithm this is also confirmed by the low error in the estimated marginal likelihoods table 4 the biogeochemical models m1 and m5 exhibit the lowest i e 131 19 0 23 and the highest i e 307 8 0 43 marginal likelihoods respectively indicating that the information content of the measured data supports the use of the full monod model to represent nitrogen turnover in the aquifer a closer look at the intercomparison between different models highlights interesting patterns first the use of the monod kinetics instead of the first order reaction to represent the aobs reaction results in a significant increase in the marginal likelihood which almost doubles from 131 19 m1 to 233 8 m2 similar behavior is encountered when simulating the nobs bacterial growth m3 this provides the first indication that microbial growth and degradation play a fundamental role in the analyzed case study interestingly z is higher for model m3 compared to model m2 although they both share the same level of theoretical model complexity this behavior mainly indicates that the nobs reaction has a larger impact on nitrogen turnover in the aquifer than ammonia reduction though the difference in the estimated bayesian evidence can also be partially attributed to a higher number of parameters of model m3 the use of the monod kinetics for both nitrifying bacteria m4 leads to a further but less substantial increase of the marginal likelihood i e 294 09 0 45 this increase is even less significant when including in the model ammonifying bacteria growth and degradation m5 thus indicating a saturation of the model complexity such behavior can be clearly inferred from fig 6 which shows how the marginal likelihood grows nonlinearly with the number of parameters and how such dynamics seems to follow a second order polynomial trend characterized by a maximum around 14 parameters which corresponds to the parameterization of model m5 from this perspective it can be hypothesized that the use of a more complex model would result in overparameterization and worse model generalizability 3 2 1 1 posterior distributions marginal posterior distributions and median values and 95 confidence intervals of adsorption and reaction parameters for all investigated biogeochemical models are shown in fig 8 and table 4 respectively at the first inspection posteriors exhibit mixed patterns generally parameters uncertainty tends to decrease when the model complexity increases indicating the theoretical inadequacy of simple parameterizations in reproducing nitrogen turnover in the aquifer for model m1 the uniform prior is reduced for four parameters and among them only two factors μ s n org and μ s n h 4 are well identified on the other hand the reduction of almost all priors for models m4 and m5 suggests that bacterial growth dynamics is the mechanism responsible for reaction processes and that the first order reactions are not sufficient to explain this biogeochemical process the posterior distribution of the adsorption coefficient for organic nitrogen k d n org varies significantly between different biogeochemical models on average table 4 its value is high and indicates strong sorption of organic nitrogen to the solid phase which is compatible with observations in the transport studies on organic compounds in soils mariano et al 2016 interestingly the posterior distributions of k d n org for models m3 and m4 are leptokurtic and unimodal though their median values table 4 differ significantly while higher uncertainty is encountered for models m1 and m5 while the behavior of the former can be explained by an overall theoretical inadequacy of the parameterization the difference between m4 and m5 is surprising considering the similar level of complexity and estimated marginal likelihoods however correlation matrices fig 7 can help in explaining this aspect in particular fig 7 shows a strong negative correlation between k d n org and k d n h 4 for model m5 thus implying that low sorption of organic nitrogen is compensated in the simulation by higher ammonium sorption overall there is an increase in parameter correlations in model m5 which can indicate overfitting as already discussed for fig 6 on the other hand the posterior distribution of the adsorption coefficient for ammonium k d n h 4 is skewed in all biogeochemical models thus suggesting its prominent role in nitrogen turnover the uncertainty range decreases with an increase in model complexity and shifts towards more realistic sorption values in particular models m4 and m5 present leptokurtic posterior distributions which are in line with values reported in the literature generally ranging between 0 5 and 3 5 cm3 g hanson et al 2006 jellali et al 2010 li et al 2015 on the other hand models m1 and m3 exhibit a dense probability region near the right boundary of the parameter space i e k d n h 4 10 cm3 g which is significantly overestimated as a consequence of these high sorption rates the first order decay coefficients in the liquid phase for organic nitrogen and ammonium μ l n org and μ l n h 4 are characterized by flat posteriors and high uncertainty suggesting a low influence of these parameters on the simulated process and that their values cannot be inferred from measured data this behavior is common in all models conversely the first order decay coefficients in the solid phase μ s n org and μ s n h 4 are well estimated thus indicating their preeminent role in the numerical description of the nitrogen turnover in the aquifer the posterior distributions of the nitrification rate in the liquid phase μ l n o 2 are highest near the right boundary for both models m1 and m2 confirming an overall model inadequacy again the monod kinetics parameters for the ammonification process in model m5 are generally characterized by high uncertainty suggesting that the information content of the data is not sufficient to well constrain their values the uniform prior is reduced only for the maximum growth rate and the half saturation constant while the yield and the lysis coefficient are only partially inferred this behavior can be an indication of potential overfitting microbial reaction parameters for aobs show mixed posterior patterns the maximum aerobic growth rate γnh4 is characterized by leptokurtic distributions in biogeochemical models m2 m4 and m5 and this behavior exacerbates with an increase in model complexity the growth rate of aobs γnh4 in model m4 ranges between 0 64 and 0 75 1 day which is in line with typical growth rates at 20 c reported in the literature e g leslie grady et al 2011 while its range appears to be underestimated for model m5 again this behavior can be explained by a high correlation shown in fig 7 which indicates potential overfitting posterior distributions of half saturation constants for aobs are right skewed and accumulated near the boundaries the uncertainty is higher for models m2 and m5 while its range shrinks and varies between 0 51 and 0 98 mg l for model m4 which is in agreement with what has been reported in the literature bitton 2010 leslie grady et al 2011 and confirms that aobs have a lower half saturation constant compared to nobs sharma and ahlert 1977 posterior distributions of the yield coefficient ynh4 show a different behavior among models in particular models m2 and m4 have peaks near the left boundary while model m5 is characterized by very low yield values the latter appears to contradict what was observed in other studies e g bitton 2010 which reported a high value of ynh4 thus against suggesting potential overfitting of model m5 a behavior this which is further confirmed by the relatively low value of the lysis coefficient for aobs observed in models m2 and m5 on the other hand microbial reaction parameters for nobs show similar posterior patterns the maximum aerobic growth rate γno2 for models m3 m4 and m5 is well identified and characterized by limited uncertainty the high positive correlation observed in fig 7 for model m5 can explain the slight overestimation of the growth rate the posterior distribution of the half saturation constant sno2 is left skewed and its uncertainty decreases with model complexity all ranges are in agreement with what has been reported in the literature bitton 2010 leslie grady et al 2011 and confirm that nobs have a higher half saturation constant sharma and ahlert 1977 the nobs yield coefficient yno2 is significantly higher for model m5 and suggest that nobs were present in higher number compared to aobs which contradicts what has been reported in the literature bitton 2010 finally lysis rates show a left skewed posterior distribution with bno2 characterized by a lower uncertainty this higher value of the death rate for nobs is compatible with what was reported in copp and murphy 1995 who reported a typical value of 0 14 1 day 3 2 1 2 model predictive checks to better investigate the models behavior the parameter uncertainty is propagated to generate posterior predictive checks which are used to look for systematic discrepancies between real and simulated data gelman et al 2004 thus representing a fundamental tool for model criticism posterior predictive checks of simulated nitrite concentrations for all biogeochemical models are obtained by random sampling of 100 solutions from the posterior parameters distributions fig 9 an increase and a decrease in the quality of fitting and predictive uncertainty respectively is evident at the first inspection in particular the use of constant first order decay reactions in model m1 prevents the model from correctly simulating transient accumulation of nitrites and delayed nitrate production at the beginning of the experiment the situation slightly improves for model m2 which can reproduce the nitrites peak at the beginning of the experiment but significantly overestimate their concentration in the remaining part of the experiment this overestimation is particularly evident in the unsaturated zone and it indicates high aobs growth which is not compensated by the simultaneous growth of nobs in model m2 the situation improves for model m3 which slightly underestimates nitrite accumulation and which is characterized by low predictive uncertainty the anticipation in nitrite production is mainly due to the assumption of a constant first order reaction for aobs which does not account for the delay in the bacteria growth the combination of multiple monod kinetics in models m4 and m5 improves the fitting and limits the uncertainty thus suggesting that bacterial growth and reaction were the mechanisms driving nitrogen turnover in the aquifer this confirms the findings reported in cheyns et al 2010 and de wilde et al 2009 who suggested that monod kinetics performed better when describing pesticide biodegradation in a laboratory mineralization experiment a more precise estimation of the bacteria population at the beginning of the experiment would have further improved model accuracy interestingly model m4 is characterized by a slightly lower predictive uncertainty than model m5 which again can indicate potential overfitting similarly posterior predictive checks of simulated nitrate concentrations for all biogeochemical models are obtained by random sampling of 100 solutions from the posterior parameter distributions fig 10 predictive checks of nitrate concentrations confirm and highlight the inaccuracy of the model that uses first order reactions to describe nitrogen reactions in the aquifer the model bias is particularly evident during the first 50 days of the numerical simulation when the injected manure is characterized by high organic nitrogen and ammonium concentrations that favor mineralization processes and microbial growth table 1 after this period nitrates are dominant in the inflow thus shifting the physical process towards a pure advection dispersion process with limited reactions as expected under such circumstances the simple model m1 accurately reproduced no3 concentrations even capturing the final concentration rise at z 10 cm to summarize posterior predictive checks indicate that the model m1 can only partially reproduce measured data and that it cannot fully account for processes occurring early during the experiment model m2 improves the fitting but exhibits a very high uncertainty while predictions of model m3 are much more generalizable this is interesting since it indicates that nobs growth has a greater influence on nitrogen turnover than aobs growth however both models m2 and m3 are affected by significant underestimation of nitrate concentrations at the beginning of the experiment this behavior disappears in model m4 and to a greater extent in model m5 which accurately reproduces measured nitrate concentrations the uncertainty band encompasses measured data and shows good model generalizability predictive uncertainty in model m5 tends to increase at deeper depths compared to model m4 which is instead more conservative the effect of predictive uncertainty is more evident during the middle time period of the simulation at that stage of the simulation the bacteria population is already established and reaction rates become extremely sensitive to kinetic parameters which cannot be precisely inferred from measured data due to their limited temporal resolution during this period indeed no observations were available between days 37 and 54 few measurements in that period would likely reduce the model predictive uncertainty the improvement in the quality of the fitting is the main reason for the highest estimated marginal likelihood of model m5 which is on the other hand limited by the slightly higher uncertainty compared to model m4 both these factors concur with the small difference in marginal likelihood between models m4 and m5 3 3 model validation the estimated 50th percentile values of reaction parameters for model m5 table 3 are used in the high fidelity model hydrus 2d for validation a comparison between measured and modeled nitrite and nitrate concentrations at four different vertical profiles and depths is shown in fig 11 hydrus 2d can accurately reproduce measured data at several locations in the aquifer thus indicating good predictive capabilities the model correctly describes the transient accumulation of nitrites at the beginning of the experiment although with some underestimation and delay which was already observed with hydrus 1d this can be related to potential uncertainties in the estimation of the soil hydraulic and transport parameters as well as to biased initial conditions indeed such initial deviations between modeled and measured concentrations are also noticeable for nitrates which are overestimated during the first few days of the simulated period even so this effect is small and limited in time after this initial period the model predicts nitrate concentrations at different locations well some bias is evident at z 40 cm but the overall quality of the fitting is satisfactory nevertheless it must be noted that the fit quality does not degenerate but improves compared to hydrus 1d suggesting the overall reliability of the bayesian calibration 4 discussion 4 1 nested sampling performance as mentioned in the introduction this study presents the first application of nested sampling for the bayesian calibration of a biogeochemical mechanistic model results suggest that this algorithm can be successfully used to simultaneously estimate the bayesian model evidence and parameter posterior distributions in typical vadose zone modeling applications thus providing a statistical basis for the model comparison and uncertainty assessment in the light of measured data the possibility of having this combined statistical outcome at no extra cost is one of the main advantages of nested sampling compared to traditional mcmc techniques such as ensemble samplers e g goodman and weare 2010 vrugt 2016 which are frequently used in combination with mechanistic models e g brunetti et al 2019 wöhling and vrugt 2011 in our analysis it is first used to infer the posterior distributions of soil hydraulic and transport parameters then in a classic model selection framework to discriminate between alternative parameterization of reactive processes furthermore as the number of iterations demonstrates it is computationally efficient requiring a lower number of model executions this behavior has already been observed in past studies focused on the comparison of nested sampling with other mcmc samplers allison and dunkley 2013 the coefficients of variation for multiple multinest runs were generally very low indicating good stability of the algorithm as such future research should focus on providing a rigorous assessment of the advantages and drawbacks of nested sampling compared to classical mcmc samplers in high and low dimensions for typical inverse estimation problems in vadose zone modeling 4 2 biogeochemical model parameterization the bayesian model selection suggests that monod kinetics is the more suitable model parameterization for reproducing measured data in particular the higher marginal likelihood for model m5 indicates that bacterial growth played a major role in the entire nitrogen degradation chain during the laboratory experiment even though its effect is more significant for nitrification as indicated by the low difference in the estimated bayesian evidence between models m4 and m5 table 4 on the other hand model m1 which uses the first order reactions underfitted measured data fig 9 and fig 10 especially at the beginning of the experiment this mainly depends on the measured data which indicates that different geochemical processes are dominant in different parts of the experiment during the first part of the experiment the mineralization processes are dominant thus tipping the balance towards complex models which can describe the transient accumulation of nitrite model m1 which cannot account for these processes is instead able to satisfactorily describe the second part of the experiment characterized by negligible mineralization another factor that reduces the fitting quality of the complex model is the uncertainty stemming from the hypothesized initial bacteria population this further confirms the point that the choice of a complex model must be fully justified by the information content of measured data which govern the model selection the higher the information content of observations the higher the model complexity allowed to the modeler in summary this study confirms that monod kinetics is the most suited parameterization for laboratory mineralization experiments which are generally characterized by a strong influence of microbial growth especially in the first part of the experiment this does not imply that this model parameterization is a priori better than the one with the traditional first order coefficients but it is simply more suited to reproduce available measured data for this case study and the bayesian analysis statistically proves this such a numerical approach should be used ubiquitously in any model calibration to have a statistical basis for model selection claiming the appropriateness of a model parameterization by relying only on the results obtained using a single set of optimized parameters as frequently done can be highly misleading and lead to poor model calibration especially for biogeochemical modeling applications 4 3 importance of measured data consequently measured data are crucial in the model calibration they must be exhaustive and representative of the investigated process to maximize the information content of measured data the model can be used in a prognostic way by performing a model based bayesian optimal experimental design which gives the researcher indications of potential experimental designs that reduce the model predictive uncertainty for example in our case few measurements about the initial distribution of bacteria in the aquifer could have improved the predictions of the complex model this is particularly important when novel model parameterizations are investigated since overfitting can undermine their generalizability as well as their applicability for practical applications where the model predictive capability is fundamental for designing purposes 4 4 importance of priors and posteriors assessment the bayesian model selection framework included five parameterizations which combine monod kinetics and first order reactions the dynamics of the estimated marginal likelihood fig 6 and the correlation analysis fig 7 suggest a plausible saturation of the available model complexity and potential overfitting respectively thus indicating that a further increase in the model complexity could not be justifiable however it is not possible to reject a priori the possibility that measured data could be better described in terms of fitting and generalizability by other models that were not considered in this study nevertheless the prior model set was selected based on the available prior information obtained from a preliminary analysis of measured data a new level of model complexity e g denitrification should be carefully justified based on available information considering the computational effort required to calculate the marginal likelihood since a single case study cannot be entirely representative of the physical process investigated and since different unpredictable uncertainties can affect measured data both prior and posterior parameter distributions must be carefully inspected and compared with the existing body of literature to assess their physical meaning priors are fundamental to rule out unphysical solutions and constrain the inverse problem and must be set based on both a thorough literature survey and preliminary experiments for example in our case batch experiments on the adsorption of ammonium to the solid phase could have been used to obtain a more informative prior about the distribution coefficient in contrast posteriors with peaks near the boundary of the search space are generally correlated with model inadequacy a behavior that we encountered mainly in the simple model in our analysis in this regard the bayesian analysis can also be viewed as a diagnostic tool to detect modeling issues 4 5 computational cost computational cost is the bottleneck in the bayesian calibration of environmental models that cannot be performed without carrying out an uncertainty assessment during model calibration in our study the use of hydrus 1d as a lower fidelity surrogate has proven to be extremely useful it allowed us to perform multiple bayesian analyses in a reasonable amount of time furthermore the hydrus 2d validation against measured data suggests that the results of the surrogate based analysis are reliable and that the simplification induced by spatial reduction is acceptable interestingly results in terms of fitting are even better when surrogate based optimized parameters are used in the high fidelity model i e hydrus 2d this indicates that the two models have similar likelihood landscapes and that a proper multi fidelity analysis based on the use of hierarchical models with correction mapping robinson et al 2008 could have improved the bayesian model selection both in terms of accuracy and computational cost in this view future research should explore the use of the multi fidelity surrogate based analysis for environmental model calibration in particular the co kriging techniques to combine data from both the higher and lower fidelity models forrester et al 2007 4 6 surrogate based analysis the combination of the multimodal nested sampling algorithm with a surrogate model can significantly increase the overall computational efficiency of the analysis though a rigorous assessment of the calculated bayesian model evidence and posterior distributions is recommended in this perspective the use of synthetic data is suggested to avoid the influence of unpredictable sources of uncertainty often encountered in measured data 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to investigate the main advantages and findings of model selection in a typical biogeochemical modeling application dealing with nitrogen turnover in a controlled aquifer model setup results from a multilevel numerical analysis raised several interesting points of discussion and provided future research directions on how to handle model complexity in biogeochemical model calibration from both a statistical and computational point of view certainly this research did not pretend to be exhaustive nor conclusive for such a dynamic field as environmental modeling but instead aimed to be a scientific contribution improving the current understanding of model complexity and placing emphasis on the role of parsimony in model selection research advancements in environmental sciences and engineering allow the modeler to simulate multiple physical processes with different levels of complexity this modeling flexibility is undoubtedly a valuable tool but should always be counterbalanced by an overall sense of parsimony which is established by the aim and circumstances of the numerical analysis we want to underline that this concept should be central in any modeling application and especially in environmental sciences which are and will be even more in the next future heavily dependent on numerical models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

5643,highly parameterized numerical models are frequently used in environmental sciences to interpret physicochemical processes despite their popularity unjustified model complexity often undermines model generalizability resulting in poor model predictive capabilities a trade off between model performance and complexity can be achieved using model selection techniques which are largely unexplored in biogeochemical modeling our study aims to address this scientific gap by investigating the main advantages and findings of model selection in a typical biogeochemical modeling application in particular the study focuses on the numerical description at five different levels of complexity of the reactive transport processes of nitrogen species in a controlled aquifer model laboratory setup to this end the mechanistic model hydrus is coupled with the multimodal nested sampling algorithm for the estimation of the bayesian model evidence and posterior parameter distributions after successfully calibrating the hydrus 2d model against measurements from a tracer test a lower fidelity surrogate based analysis is carried out to tackle the problem of computational cost as well as to compare five different models which combine first order and monod based parameterization of the microbial nitrogen degradation results demonstrate that measured data contain enough information content to support an increase in the complexity of the monod model which can reproduce the transient accumulation of nitrite at the beginning of the experiment the bayesian analysis reveals that such behavior is related to the particular structure of measured data which plays a fundamental role in the model selection the analysis concludes with a validation of the surrogate based analysis which confirms the reliability of the proposed numerical approach opening up new perspectives on the use of multi fidelity surrogates for the bayesian model selection in environmental modeling keywords modeling model selection lower fidelity surrogate model hydrus nitrification 1 introduction water pollution is a global challenge that has increased in both developed and developing countries undermining economic growth as well as the physical and environmental health of billions of people the european environmental agency eea has recently reported that only 38 of european water bodies met chemical pollution standards european environment agency 2018 with groundwater sites showing high exposure to nutrient pollution from agricultural activities a similar trend was observed in china and the united states where agriculture was identified as the main source of pollution of surface water bodies mateo sagasta et al 2017 extensive use of organic and inorganic fertilizers as well as waste management from livestock is directly related to increased levels of nitrogen pollution in water bodies preventative measures taken in the last few decades such as optimized fertigation strategies and appropriate tillage and manure management have resulted in an appreciable decrease of nitrate concentrations in surface water bodies though their effect on groundwater is still limited eea 2018 groundwater vulnerability to nitrogen byproducts is mainly influenced by reactive transport processes in the vadose zone subsurface redox conditions induced by the coupled water solute transport regulate the microbial transformation of nitrogen species such as nitrification and denitrification an accurate numerical description of these multiple interacting physical and biological processes is crucial for developing effective and reliable strategies to mitigate groundwater nitrogen pollution in the last few decades several models have been developed and applied to describe and predict nitrogen turnover in soils both at small and large scales for example the hydrological model hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 has been successfully used to simulate nitrogen balance in several agricultural applications e g filipović et al 2016 gärdenäs et al 2005 hanson et al 2006 li et al 2015 hydrus numerically solves the richards and advection dispersion reaction equations describing water flow and solute transport in soils respectively nitrogen reactions are generally simulated using a sequential chain with first order coefficients which reduces the number of model parameters but simplifies the description of the microbial degradation on the other hand the model daisy hansen et al 1991 refines the description of nitrogen turnover in the root zone by simulating the effect of microbial growth in multiple conceptual pools a similar approach is used in the models rzwqm ma et al 2012 and century parton 1996 many studies have proven the accuracy of this approach e g cameira et al 1998 kröbel et al 2010 ma et al 2007 salazar et al 2017 however the choice of an appropriate level of model complexity is a constant problem in biogeochemical modeling e g homann et al 2000 kimmins et al 2008 a large number of optimized parameters can pose model calibration issues such as significant parameter uncertainty and limited model predictive capabilities that undermine its generalizability ajami and gu 2010 elsheikh et al 2013 freni et al 2011 schoups et al 2008 since model uncertainty plays a crucial role in optimal decision making for groundwater management peña haro et al 2011 wagner and gorelick 1987 the selected model must be as simple as possible as complex as necessary höge et al 2018 to accurately reproduce observations and reduce predictive uncertainty this approach should be ubiquitous in any modeling application the high conceptual parameterization of complex models often results in the overfitting of measured data and parameter non uniqueness unless large and informative observations are used for calibration pande et al 2015 in contrast simpler models generally have lower predictive uncertainty since their few parameters are easily constrained by observations although the fit quality deteriorates thus a less accurate simple model ranks better than a more complex one that does not provide a good enough fit to justify its higher complexity myung 2000 this trade off between quality of fit and complexity embodies the principle of occam s razor which states that entities should not be multiplied beyond necessity and is at the basis of model selection techniques the bayesian model selection is a formal approach that allows a comparison of alternative models on a statistically rigorous basis in light of observations and any prior information available this evaluation is based on the calculation of the bayesian model evidence often named in the literature as the marginal likelihood computation of the bayesian model evidence is numerically challenging as it involves a multi dimensional integration over the entire parameter space often described by a multimodal peaked likelihood surface such problems are exacerbated for environmental and biogeochemical models characterized by high nonlinearity and strong parameter interactions ajami and gu 2010 brunetti et al 2019 2016 dai et al 2019 to avoid the time consuming monte carlo mc analysis several authors have suggested different analytical approximations of the bayesian model evidence for example the akaike information criterion akaike 1973 stems from the information theory and is frequently applied for its ease of implementation guthery et al 2003 in another study neuman 2003 proposed a maximum likelihood bayesian model averaging approach based on kashyap s information criterion which reduces computational effort a further simplified index is the bayesian information criterion first introduced by schwarz 1978 recently watanabe 2013 proposed a widely applicable bayesian information criterion wbic which starts with the computed log pointwise posterior predictive density and then adds a correction for an effective number of parameters to adjust for overfitting as discussed by gelman et al 2014 this criterion has the advantage of averaging over the posterior distribution rather than conditioning on a point estimate however friel et al 2017 demonstrated that the wbic can overestimate the bayesian model evidence such inaccuracies can lead to contradictory model rankings which complicate the model selection lu et al 2011 further confirmed these findings by highlighting significant differences in the geostatistical model selection between classical information criteria and the monte carlo markov chain mcmc analysis similar results were reported by schöniger et al 2014 who compared nine ways to calculate the bayesian model evidence in a hydrological application concluding that numerical integration is at the basis of the bayesian model selection to this aim multiple studies have focused on developing or improving algorithms for the mc determination of the marginal likelihood the most popular mc approximation is the arithmetic mean of the joint likelihood evaluated for parameter samples obtained by various methods e g mcmc generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation methods however this approximation is affected by slow convergence and overestimation of the marginal likelihood especially if the posterior distribution is much more concentrated than that of the prior kass and raftery 1995 to overcome this limitation pajor 2017 proposed a corrected arithmetic mean estimator in which the prior sample is trimmed to eliminate regions of the parameter space with very low likelihood similarly as in the corrected harmonic mean estimator lenk 2009 various other numerical methods have been proposed in the literature to estimate the bayesian model evidence directly or to compute ratios of two marginal likelihoods i e a bayes factor popular methods are based on the reversible jump algorithm green 1995 and bridge sampling methods meng and wong 1996 recently volpi et al 2017 proposed a gaussian mixture importance game sampling which estimates the evidence via multidimensional numerical integration of the posterior parameter distribution using bridge sampling first a large collection of samples is generated from the posterior parameter distribution using mcmc simulation with the dream algorithm vrugt 2016 by conditioning separately each candidate model on the observed data then a multivariate mixture distribution is fitted to this mcmc collection of posterior samples using the likelihood theory to estimate the marginal likelihood of each competing hypothesis via bridge sampling a popular alternative is to estimate the marginal likelihood from the gibbs sampling output chib 1995 later extended to the metropolis hastings output chib and jeliazkov 2001 however both variants are computationally inefficient friel and pettitt 2008 proposed a thermodynamic integration method inspired by the path sampling of gelman and meng 1998 recently wei et al 2019 applied this method to calculate the marginal likelihood and discriminate between different evapotranspiration models in another study liu et al 2016 showed that thermodynamic integration could outperform semi analytical solutions arithmetic mean harmonic mean and nested sampling in terms of the solution accuracy and consistency for repeated independent runs a difficulty with this method is the choice of the optimal temperature schedule to circumvent this issue weinberg 2012 proposed a novel approach based on lebesgue integration however the thermodynamic integration generally requires a high computational cost which restraints its use in environmental modeling elshall and ye 2019 proposed a variant of the steppingstone sampling algorithm which is less sensitive to sampling errors and more computationally efficient than the thermodynamic integration yet this method is mainly limited to moderately complex problems from this literature background it emerges that an accurate estimation of the marginal likelihood requires a high number of model executions which may not be possible for biogeochemical models due to their high computational cost a viable solution is to use highly efficient mc algorithms which provide a balanced trade off between marginal likelihood accuracy and computational effort this will allow to have a statistical basis for biogeochemical model selection and uncertainty assessment which is of great importance in biogeochemical modeling skilling 2006 proposed a one dimensional re parametrization of the integral of the bayesian model evidence which significantly reduced the computational cost of the bayesian analysis this approach is at the basis of the nested sampling ns algorithm which has been applied successfully in several research fields elsheikh et al 2014 2013 mukherjee et al 2006 paulson et al 2019 schöniger et al 2014 shaw et al 2007 liu et al 2016 evaluated the convergence and accuracy of ns using multiple numerical experiments and concluded that it is computationally more efficient than thermodynamic integration and similarly accurate the low stability in the estimation of the marginal likelihood stems from the necessity to draw efficiently unbiased samples from the likelihood constrained prior several variants of the original algorithm were developed to address this issue brewer et al 2011 proposed a diffusive nested sampling algorithm that uses mcmc to explore a mixture of progressively constrained distributions however for highly correlated and multimodal target distributions multiple particles needs to be considered which increases the computational cost furthermore multiple tuning parameters have to be set making the algorithm very sensitive handley et al 2015 developed the polychord ns algorithm which uses the slice sampling to sample within the nested isolikelihood contours thus making it suited for a high dimensional parameter space a recent study of cao et al 2018 reported how polychord outperformed other ns based algorithms in terms of accuracy and stability in high dimensional inverse problems even though it is computationally expensive in another study zeng et al 2018 used the dreamzs algorithm to sample from the likelihood constrained prior and compared it against the classic ns metropolis hastings results of that study indicate that the ns dreamzs is more efficient and robust which indicates that this algorithm is due to its higher efficiency preferable to the thermodynamic integration when computational resources are inadequate to improve the computational efficiency of the ns higson et al 2019 introduced a dynamic nested sampling algorithm in which the number of live points varies allocating samples more efficiently this results in a speedup of computations by a factor of up to 7 for marginal likelihood calculations feroz et al 2009 proposed an ellipsoidal rejection sampling scheme multinest that allows us to identify and isolate near gaussian posterior modes in small overlapping ellipsoids once identified these modes can be evolved independently thereby automatically accommodating posteriors degeneracies while maintaining high efficiency for simpler problems multinest has proven to be highly efficient and accurate for low dimensional problems i e 20 parameters while its accuracy degrades for highly parameterized analyses later feroz et al 2013 proposed an importance nested sampling which overcomes such limitations and significantly increases the accuracy of multinest despite its computational efficiency the ns still requires thousands of model runs to calculate the bayesian model evidence in this perspective recent studies on the surrogate based analysis have demonstrated their efficiency for computationally expensive model calibration applications asher et al 2015 brunetti et al 2017 elsheikh et al 2014 laloy et al 2013 razavi et al 2012 while most of the existing literature focuses on data driven surrogates previous studies highlighted how lower fidelity surrogates overcome many of the limitations of data driven surrogates asher et al 2015 razavi et al 2012 lower fidelity surrogates are computationally cheap models constructed from the complex model by reducing geometrical complexity numerical resolution or removing processes and generally yield efficient calibration providing that their approximation is limited and assessed against the original model the combination of efficient bayesian model selection techniques i e nested sampling with lower fidelity surrogates is still largely unexplored for biogeochemical modeling applications more research is thus needed in this direction obtained results could apply to other scientific fields as well our study aims to cover these scientific gaps by exploring the main advantages and findings of model selection in a typical biogeochemical application in particular the study focuses on the numerical description at different levels of complexity of the reactive transport processes of nitrogen species in a controlled aquifer model laboratory setup the aquifer model is first subject to a tracer test to characterize its hydraulic functioning and then to an application of cattle slurry to assess biogeochemical reactions involved in nitrogen transformations the problem is addressed in the following way initially the mechanistic model hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 is externally coupled with the multinest algorithm for the estimation of the bayesian model evidence and posterior parameter distributions next the coupled two dimensional hydrus 2d model is employed to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters using measurements from a tracer experiment estimated parameters are then used in the one dimensional hydrus 1d model which simulates transport and biogeochemical reactions in the system during the application of cattle slurry hydrus 1d is used as a lower fidelity surrogate to overcome the impractically high computational cost associated with the 2d model in the computationally intensive bayesian model selection five levels of complexity of the biogeochemical model are investigated either constant first order decay rates or monod kinetics are alternatively used and combined to interpret ammonification and nitrification processes in the aquifer high spatial resolution measurements are used in the bayesian analysis to constrain the inverse problem finally results from the surrogate based analysis are projected in the 2d model for validation it must be noted that the combined use of the multinest algorithm and the lower fidelity surrogate for the bayesian model selection represents a novelty in biogeochemical modeling underlining that the development of efficient model selection frameworks for such applications is of crucial importance 2 materials and methods 2 1 case study description 2 1 1 experimental setup a schematic of the experimental aquifer setup is shown in fig 1 the aquifer model 106 cm long 50 cm high 20 cm wide was divided into two chambers a 100 cm wide chamber for the sediment packing and a 6 cm wide chamber for drainage separated by a water permeable grid the soil was packed up to a height of 50 cm to guarantee uniform irrigation water inflow at the soil surface was pumped from a reservoir to the aquifer model using 4 peristaltic pumps connected to 60 silicone tubes equipped with an injection needle the outflow tube from the drainage chamber was used to simulate water table fluctuations by adjusting its height via a self built automated piston device outflow water was then collected in a waste container and pumped to the sink the sediment used in the experiment originated from a gravel pit in bruckmühl near munich germany the particle size distribution analysis indicated a medium coarse sandy sediment characterized by a negligible silt and clay content i e 1 25 groundwater used for the experiments was taken directly from a well at the institute for groundwater ecology in the helmholtz zentrum münchen germany where all experiments were conducted soil water samplers rhizon sms eijkelkamp and optical dissolved oxygen sensors pst3 presenns were installed in four vertical profiles indicated by letters a b c and d vertical dashed lines in fig 1 with eight ports and spots each respectively pore water samples extracted during the tracer test were analyzed using an isotopic water analyzer picarro l2120 i to reconstruct breakthrough curves btcs ammonium nh4 nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 concentrations in samples and groundwater were determined using an ion chromatography system ics 1100 dionex while a total organic carbon analyzer toc 5000a shimadzu was used to measure the dissolved organic carbon doc no measurements of organic nitrogen norg were available due to operational issues the soil pressure head was monitored by eleven tensiometers black circles in fig 1 t5 5 ums distributed in three vertical profiles with an acquisition frequency of 30 min the experiment consisted of a tracer test which was conducted before the manure injection the system was equilibrated by irrigating with pure groundwater for 15 weeks before starting with the manure injection in particular during this period the irrigation rate and the water table were set to 13 35 l day and 25 cm respectively 2 1 2 tracer experiments the tracer experiment took place between weeks 6 and 15 of the equilibration period in order to avoid disturbances inside the model aquifer during experiments with cattle slurry i e nitrogen the main objective of the tracer test was to accurately characterize the solute transport processes in the aquifer and to use btc data in the bayesian framework to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and transport parameters the tracer test was conducted under steady state flow conditions by injecting deuterium 2h enriched groundwater into the system in particular a tracer solution volume of 1 6 l with a concentration of 243 mg l was applied at the soil surface for 173 min btcs were obtained by regularly sampling pore water for five days at 16 selected sampling ports fig 1 in total approximately 40 ml of pore water was extracted per sampling port over a period of up to four days which is small compared to the total water volume 30 l and not significant enough to influence water flow within the system 2 1 3 experiments on the fate of ammonium and nitrate nitrogen mineralization was triggered by injecting cattle slurry into the aquifer model for 89 days the main aim of this experiment was to investigate nitrogen reactive processes in a combined saturated unsaturated system under different operating conditions the experiment required four different reservoirs with a volume of 200 l two liters of preconditioned liquid manure were diluted in 198 l of pure groundwater to reach a sufficiently high concentration of nutrients biogeochemical measurements were carried out in both the reservoirs and at the injection needles when connecting a new reservoir to the system because as mentioned previously it was not possible to measure organic nitrogen its concentration was established using measured nh4 concentrations and compared with literature values in particular previous studies indicated that ammonium generally represents about 50 of the nitrogen in the liquid cattle manure e g beauchamp et al 2010 van middelkoop and holshof 2017 therefore the organic nitrogen concentration in the inflow is assumed to be the same as the ammonium during the first 51 days of the experiments considering that nitrite and nitrate concentrations were considerably smaller table 1 the last cattle manure reservoir was connected to the injection system on day 51 measured inflow concentrations indicate that no3 was the predominant n species table 1 this behavior is due to strong mineralization processes likely triggered by preliminary sieving and centrifugation of cattle slurry used to separate liquid and solid fractions indeed previous studies have demonstrated that such treatment results in a monodisperse particle size distribution of the liquid manure characterized by a majority of particles below 25 µm peters et al 2011 such particles are characterized by low carbon nitrogen ratios and a high nitrogen mineralization potential fangueiro et al 2008 thus a norg concentration of 1 mg l was assumed for the last reservoir considering that doc was still detected in the inflow nevertheless preliminary numerical simulations showed that this value plays a negligible role in the nitrification process due to its relatively low magnitude the experiment was divided into three stages table 1 steady state flow conditions were induced for the first 22 days by setting the recharge rate and the water table to 13 35 l day and 25 cm respectively on day 23 the recharge rate was decreased to 6 5 l day to increase transit times between days 54 and 73 transient flow conditions were generated by simulating diurnal water table fluctuations the applied amplitude and periodicity were consistent with water table fluctuations observed in natural environments gribovszki et al 2010 2008 in particular the automated piston device was programmed to raise and lower the outflow tube from 16 to 34 cm providing a complete fluctuation cycle over 24 h on day 73 the fluctuations were terminated when the water table reached its starting position at a depth of 25 cm at that time the peristaltic pumps were deactivated resulting in stagnant water flow measured dissolved oxygen in the aquifer model was always above 2 mg l which indicates suitable aerobic conditions for nitrification and negligible denitrification 2 2 modeling theory 2 2 1 water flow and solute transport the hydrological model hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 is used to model the hydraulic behavior of the aquifer hydrus is a finite element model for simulating the movement of water heat and multiple solutes in variably saturated porous media it numerically solves the richards equation for multi dimensional variably saturated water flow 1 θ t k h z where t is time t z is the vertical coordinate l θ is the volumetric water content l3l 3 k is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and h is the pressure head l the unimodal van genuchten mualem vgm model van genuchten 1980 is used to describe the soil hydraulic properties 2 θ 1 1 α h n m if h 0 1 if h 0 θ θ θ r θ s θ r 3 k k s θ l 1 1 θ 1 m m 2 if h 0 k s if h 0 m 1 1 n where θ is the effective saturation l3l 3 α is a shape parameter related to the inverse of the air entry pressure head l 1 θs and θr are the saturated and residual water contents respectively l3l 3 n and m are pore size distribution indices ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 and l is the tortuosity and pore connectivity parameter the reactive transport of nitrogen species in the aquifer is modeled as a sequential reaction chain in which organic nitrogen is first converted into ammonium by heterotrophic organisms then oxidized by autotrophic bacteria into nitrite and nitrate denitrification processes are neglected due to the persistent oxic conditions observed during the experiment the transport of the kth solute in the aquifer is described using the advection dispersion reaction equation assuming that solutes can exist only in the solid and liquid phases 4 θ c k t ρ s k t θ d k w c k q c k ϕ where ck is the concentration of the kth solute in the liquid phase ml 3 sk is the concentration of the kth solute in the

reactive processes are assumed for deuterium and nitrate linear adsorption to the solid phase is considered for norg and nh4 gärdenäs et al 2005 li et al 2015 mariano et al 2016 while 2h no2 and no3

are responsible for nitrogen mineralization heterotrophic bacteria convert organic nitrogen into ammonium i e ammonification which is used as a substrate in the next nitrification process operated by autotrophic bacteria ammonium oxidizing bacteria aob and nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob such reactions can be numerically described using two different formulations either as constant first order decay reactions or as monod kinetics the former neglects the bacteria growth and assumes constant reaction rates while the latter adjusts the reaction depending on the simulated bacteria population when considering constant first order decay the reaction chain in the solid and liquid phases is described as follow 7 ϕ k μ l k θ c k μ s k ρ s k where µl k and µs k are the first order degradation coefficients for the kth solute providing a connection between chain species in the liquid and solid phases respectively t 1 this numerical approach has been used extensively in the literature e g hanson et al 2006 li et al 2015 ramos et al 2012 the use of this model is also justified by measured inflow concentrations table 1 which exhibit a complete shift towards nitrate after day 54 suggesting a plausible negligible effect of reaction processes towards the end of the experiment on the other hand biomass growth and decay are explicitly modeled using the monod kinetics and the first order reaction respectively 7 d γ dt γ c k s c k γ b γ where γ is the biomass concentration ml 3 γ is the maximum aerobic growth rate t 1 s is the half saturation constant mm 1 and b is the first order coefficient representing lysis t 1 this approach assumes that bacterial degradation only occurs in the liquid phase de wilde et al 2009 and that bacteria are immobile de wilde et al 2009 holden and fierer 2005 wehrer et al 2012 leading to 8 ϕ k γ y γ c k s c k θ where y is the yield coefficient mm 1 the monod kinetics while providing a more coherent description of nitrogen turnover requires more parameters and is computationally more expensive and therefore its use should be statistically justified in light of the information content of measured data a preliminary analysis of measured effluent concentrations showed a transient accumulation of nitrites and a delayed production of nitrates in the aquifer at the beginning of the experiment suggesting the bacterial growth had a significant influence on the mineralization process fig 2 ammonium in injected water was readily available for oxidation into nitrites by aobs as the aobs population grew the nitrite substrate became sufficient to trigger nobs growth which reduced nitrites by producing nitrates after this transient period both bacterial populations were equilibrated and the mineralization process was characterized by fast nitrate production and transport this preliminary data screening theoretically supports the use of monod kinetics for the interpretation of the nitrogen turnover in the aquifer however the most appropriate description of each process e g ammonification ammonium oxidation nitrite oxidation must be identified to avoid unjustified complexity to this aim the first order decay reactions and monod kinetics are combined to obtain a set of five different biogeochemical models of increasing complexity table 2 in particular the simplest m1 model describes all nitrogen reactions using only first order reactions while the most complex m5 model simulates bacteria growth in all reaction processes different model compositions aim not only to identify the most appropriate level of model complexity but also to explain whether bacterial growth plays a crucial role in all reaction steps 2 2 3 numerical domain and boundary conditions in this section model settings used in the following bayesian analysis are described the two dimensional model hydrus 2d is used in combination with tracer data for the bayesian estimation of soil hydraulic and transport properties throughout this manuscript hydrus 2d is considered the high fidelity model due to its comprehensive description of boundary conditions bcs the two dimensional domain has a length and a depth of 100 and 50 cm respectively the domain is discretized into two dimensional triangular elements refined in the right part of the domain to accommodate velocity gradients at the outflow thus reducing mass balance errors the generated fe mesh has 2142 nodes and 4100 two dimensional elements an atmospheric bc green line in fig 3 is specified on the top boundary of the model domain to simulate the irrigation of the aquifer this bc type can exist in three different states a irrigation and or potential evaporation fluxes b a zero pressure head full saturation during ponding when both infiltration and surface runoff occur and c an equilibrium between the soil surface pressure and the atmospheric water vapor pressure when the atmospheric evaporative demand cannot be met by evaporation from the soil profile soil evaporation is neglected due to its limited effect on the experiment cover on top a special time variable pressure head bc blue line in fig 3 is used for the right part of the domain exposed to air and water table fluctuations this bc assigns the specified pressure head value to the lowest nodal point of the boundary while pressure heads at other nodes are adjusted based on the z coordinate at the same time a seepage face bc is assigned to nodes with calculated negative pressure heads the concentration flux along the top and right boundaries is simulated using the cauchy type bc zero water and concentration flux boundary conditions black lines in fig 3 are applied to all remaining boundaries of the domain preliminary tests have shown that the execution time to simulate both ammonification and nitrification using the monod kinetics in hydrus 2d was around 10 000 s on a pc equipped with a cpu intel core i7 8750h 16 gb of ram and ssd since no high performance computing cluster was readily available such computational cost would make the bayesian model selection impractical therefore hydrus 1d is used as a lower fidelity surrogate model due to its limited run time i e 8 s this assumption appears acceptable for several reasons 1 hydrus 1d simplifies only the geometry of the problem while it shares the same parameterization and simulates the same physicochemical processes as hydrus 2d 2 the infiltration process in the unsaturated part of the domain is considered to be strictly vertical and thus the two models are expected to produce similar infiltration pathways 3 since the majority of reactive processes take place near the sediment surface the similarity between hydrus 1d and hydrus 2d in this zone guarantees a good description of the reactive transport also in the surrogate and 4 preliminary simulations showed that the velocities are higher in the saturated zone of the system than in the unsaturated zone due to the limited length of the aquifer model i e 100 cm the delay induced by horizontal flow in the saturated zone is rather limited and the assumption of instantaneous discharge in the surrogate is thus tolerable however it must be emphasized that these assumptions and the used approach are not general but restricted to this particular case study there exist multiple numerical approaches to formally address the discrepancies between low and high fidelity models such as correction functions space mapping and hybrid strategies razavi et al 2012 which are however beyond the scope of the present work nevertheless final model validation is carried out to assess the results of the surrogate based analysis similarly the hydrus 1d vertical domain is discretized in 100 one dimensional elements which are refined near the soil surface an atmospheric bc is specified on the top boundary while a time variable pressure head bc the red line in fig 3 is used for the bottom boundary the quality of the fe mesh is assessed by checking the mass balance error reported by hydrus at the end of the simulation mass balance errors which in this simulation were always below 1 are generally considered acceptable at these low levels initial pressure head conditions are assumed to be in hydrostatic equilibrium from the lowest located nodal point i e z 0 and h 25 cm measured concentrations from different sampling points were used to set initial solute concentrations in the solute domain since no measured data were available the microbial biomass initial concentration in model m2 was assumed to decrease with depth in particular a value of 10 mg l is assumed for the top 10 cm while 1 mg l is set in all remaining nodes of the numerical domain this is compatible with what was already observed in other studies e g henrichs et al 2007 the standard hydrus code was modified to simulate bacterial degradation in model m2 to this end a separate fortran file was created to solve explicitly in time eq 7 and to calculate zero order reaction rates which are then used to assemble the system of algebraic equations resulting from the discretization of the governing advection dispersion partial differential equations 2 3 model calibration and uncertainty assessment 2 3 1 multinest algorithm in this section the multinest algorithm used in the model selection and inverse parameter estimation is described for simplicity only a general overview of the method is provided while detailed descriptions about the theoretical background and numerical implementation can be found in skilling 2006 mukherjee et al 2006 and feroz et al 2009 the bayesian inference provides a statistically coherent approach for the estimation of a set of parameters ω in a model h for the data d 9 pr ω d h pr d ω h pr ω h pr d h where pr ω d h p ω is the posterior probability of the parameters pr d ω h l ω is the likelihood pr ω h π ω is the prior and pr d h z is the bayesian model evidence which can be expressed as 10 z l ω π ω d d ω where d is the dimensionality of the parameter space the bayesian evidence is the average of the likelihood over the prior and it is expected to be smaller for a model with large areas in its parameter space having low likelihood even if the likelihood function is highly peaked and larger for a model with higher likelihood of model parameters in a larger fraction of its parameter space the numerical estimation of z is at the basis of the model selection and is the core of the ns algorithm ns was first presented by skilling 2006 as an efficient monte carlo method to calculate the evidence and estimate posterior distributions as by products the core of the method is the transformation of the multi dimensional integral in eq 10 to a one dimensional integral to this end the prior mass x can be defined as the cumulative prior mass covering all likelihood values greater than the iso likelihood contour ω 11 x ω l ω ω π ω d d ω for the case of normalized prior probability the prior mass x has a value 1 if ω 0 and decreases to 0 as ω approaches 1 defining the inverse function l x as the likelihood which bounds a prior mass x one can simplify eq 10 from a multi dimensional integral over the prior volume to a one dimensional integral over the prior mass 12 z 0 1 l x d x the ns algorithm provides an iterative process to solve eq 12 at each iteration i n active samples are drawn from the prior samples are then sorted in order of their likelihood and the smallest with likelihood l 0 is removed from the active set and replaced by a point drawn from the prior subject to the constraint that the point has a likelihood l l 0 the iterative process is stopped when the stopping criterion is satisfied the algorithm thus travels through nested shells of likelihood as the prior volume is shrunk once the evidence z is estimated posterior parameter distributions and associated weights can be inferred using the full sequence of discarded points from the nested sampling process in this study the active set consisted of 100 points for all bayesian analyses this value was selected based on a preliminary sensitivity analysis on the effect of active points on the calculated marginal likelihood briefly the coefficient of variation cv of the marginal likelihood was estimated by running the ns algorithm five times using a different number of active points i e 20 50 100 200 as described in zeng et al 2018 only a negligible reduction in the cv was obtained when using more than 100 points this analysis was carried out used to assess the stability of the estimator and its potential effect on models ranking the most challenging task in the ns algorithm is sampling from the prior with the hard constraint l l 0 to overcome this problem several techniques have been proposed in the past in the present study the multinest algorithm proposed by feroz et al 2009 is used multinest is a combination of the ellipsoidal nested sampling mukherjee et al 2006 with the recursive clustering shaw et al 2007 that is particularly suited for degenerated multimodal posterior distributions which are often encountered when inversely estimating soil hydraulic and transport parameters e g brunetti et al 2019 indeed in such circumstances a single ellipsoid also includes low likelihood regions between high likelihood clusters making the algorithm extremely inefficient the solution is to detect these clusters and bind them in separate ellipsoids to achieve this a recursive process with 2 means clustering is adopted if the resulting two ellipsoids have a significantly lower total volume than the parent ellipsoid less than half the split is accepted and the clustering and volume test are repeated on each of the two subsets of points this process continues recursively alternatively if the total ellipse volume is significantly greater than expected this indicates that there may be more than two clusters and that 2 means clustering was not appropriate therefore the algorithm still tries to subdivide the clusters recursively however it only accepts the final clustering if the total volume decrease is significant it can be assumed that the posterior bulk was explored sufficiently when the active points in sum incremented the evidence by only some small fraction of the total accumulated evidence more specifically the currently active point with the highest likelihood gives an estimate of the highest likelihood in the region the remaining evidence at iteration i is estimated according to 13 z est l max x i where xi is the remaining prior volume the stopping criterion is then based on the ratio between the estimated total evidence and the current evidence 14 log z i z est log z est 0 5 to avoid the premature stopping of the algorithm the maximum number of algorithm iterations is set to 100 000 such threshold value has never been reached during the simulations 2 3 2 likelihood function and prior distributions if we assume that error residuals are uncorrelated and normally distributed with a constant variance σ 2 the likelihood function l ω can be written as 15 l ω i 1 k 1 2 π σ 2 exp 1 2 σ 2 h i ω y i 2 where h i ω and ỹi are the ith model realization and its corresponding measured value respectively for algebraic simplicity the log likelihood ℓ ω is used 16 ℓ ω k 2 ln 2 π k 2 ln σ 2 1 2 σ 2 i 1 k h i ω y i 2 in the inverse modeling σ 2 is treated as a nuisance parameter and integrated out from the inference equation e g kavetski et al 2006 the new likelihood is then written as 17 ℓ ω k 2 ln i 1 k h i ω y i 2 uniform prior distributions are used in the bayesian analysis parameter bounds are provided in the following sections 2 3 3 inverse estimation of soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters before the bayesian model selection the multinest algorithm is used in conjunction with tracer data to inversely estimate soil hydraulic and transport parameters this modeling scenario is denoted as tr a high resolution dataset consisting of measured btcs from 16 sampling points is used to calibrate hydrus 2d since the tracer breakthrough curves did not show any anomalous behavior such as tailing knorr et al 2016 pedretti et al 2013 the effects of soil heterogeneity have been neglected to have a better agreement between hydrus 1d and hydrus 2d a weight of 0 2 has been assigned to measured deuterium concentrations in the saturated zone where the effect of the horizontal flow is appreciable as such the optimized soil hydraulic parameters are mostly representative of the unsaturated zone which is similarly described by the high and lower fidelity models for such conditions estimated soil hydraulic and transport parameters can be directly transferred to hydrus 1d since they are representative of the soil properties of the aquifer the residual water content θr is fixed to 0 0 which is a common value for coarse textured soils e g brunetti et al 2017 the pore connectivity parameter l is set to 0 5 and the transverse dispersivity λt is assumed 0 1λl due to these simplifications the number of unknown parameters is reduced to 5 the saturated water content θs the vgm shape parameters α and n the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks and the longitudinal dispersivity λl the parameter bounds used in the analysis are reported in table 2 2 3 4 biogeochemical model selection 50th percentile values of the posterior distributions of soil hydraulic and transport parameters obtained in the scenario tr are then used in hydrus 1d for the bayesian model selection measured nitrite and nitrate concentrations from different vertical profiles are averaged to obtain average concentrations for 8 observation points at different depths fig 1 the number of unknown parameters in biogeochemical models varies between 7 m1 and 14 m5 table 3 a preliminary sensitivity analysis to identify unimportant factors is avoided due to the relatively low dimensionality of the inverse problem in such circumstances the bayesian analysis normally reveals which parameters are influential and can be inferred from measured data the soil bulk density is set to 1 5 g cm3 which is a common value for sandy sediments molecular diffusion coefficients are assumed 1 92 cm2 day 1 for all nitrogen species langergraber and simunek 2006 parameter bounds reported in table 2 are based on a literature review e g bitton 2010 hanson et al 2006 leslie grady et al 2011 and slightly expanded to detect particular patterns in the bayesian optimization indeed posterior parameter distributions located near the bounds of the search space generally indicate the theoretical inadequacy of the model which can only describe measured data by using unphysical parameter values finally the calculated bayesian model evidence is used for the model selection and to summarize model differences 2 3 5 model validation 50th percentile values of the posterior distributions obtained in the bayesian surrogate based analysis i e hydrus 1d are used in the high fidelity model i e hydrus 2d to perform a single forward model run modeled nitrite and nitrate concentrations at four different depths are compared with measured data to validate the results of the surrogate based analysis this aim of this step is to identify plausible significant deviations between the higher and lower fidelity models and to provide a general assessment of the surrogate based analysis 3 results 3 1 inverse estimation of soil hydraulic and solute transport parameters the joint and marginal posterior distributions of the soil hydraulic and transport parameters obtained from scenario tr are shown in fig 4 and have a markedly unimodal pattern characterized by a leptokurtic behavior consequently the confidence intervals table 3 are narrow thus indicating good identifiability of optimized parameters the bayesian analysis reveals a well posed inverse problem characterized by low uncertainty mainly stemming from the simultaneous use of informative measured concentrations at different depths which constrain the inverse estimation problem well this is further confirmed by the limited correlation shown in the joint posterior distributions estimated parameter ranges are in agreement with what has been reported in the literature for sandy soils e g thoma et al 2014 only the saturated hydraulic conductivity exhibits a relatively lower value e g carsel and parrish 1988 indicating the compaction of the aquifer model during the experiment the longitudinal dispersivity λl ranges between 0 11 and 0 19 cm which corresponds with the values reported in sato et al 2003 and vanderborght and vereecken 2007 water flow is characterized by vertical infiltration in the unsaturated zone and by its gradual transition to horizontal flow when approaching the saturated zone such behavior is particularly evident near the outflow posterior predictive checks grey lines in fig 5 confirm the accuracy of the numerical model in describing the coupled water solute transport in the aquifer fig 5 shows a slight underestimation of the tracer concentration at z 20 cm in the vertical profile d fig 1 this can be explained by lower weights assigned to the observation points in the saturated zone i e z 25 cm during the bayesian analysis thus their less accurate fit by the model the overall accuracy of the model predictions confirms the assumption of homogeneous soil and the negligible influence of heterogeneity on water and solute movement the estimated 50th percentile values of soil hydraulic and transport parameters table 3 are used in the next bayesian model selection where only adsorption and reaction parameters are investigated 3 2 biogeochemical model selection 3 2 1 marginal likelihoods the multinest algorithm required from 1211 m1 to 2671 m4 iterations to satisfy the convergence criterion eq 14 in particular scenario m5 required on average approximately 3 days of computation to perform a single bayesian analysis this behavior is related to an increase in both the dimensionality of the inverse problem i e 14 parameters and the mathematical complexity of the numerical model indeed the addition of multiple monod type reactions eq 8 makes the system of partial differential equations eq 4 numerically stiff thus requiring smaller time steps to achieve convergence the coefficient of variation for multiple multinest runs is very low for all modeling scenarios table 4 and does not affect the model ranking thus indicating an overall satisfactory accuracy and stability of the algorithm this is also confirmed by the low error in the estimated marginal likelihoods table 4 the biogeochemical models m1 and m5 exhibit the lowest i e 131 19 0 23 and the highest i e 307 8 0 43 marginal likelihoods respectively indicating that the information content of the measured data supports the use of the full monod model to represent nitrogen turnover in the aquifer a closer look at the intercomparison between different models highlights interesting patterns first the use of the monod kinetics instead of the first order reaction to represent the aobs reaction results in a significant increase in the marginal likelihood which almost doubles from 131 19 m1 to 233 8 m2 similar behavior is encountered when simulating the nobs bacterial growth m3 this provides the first indication that microbial growth and degradation play a fundamental role in the analyzed case study interestingly z is higher for model m3 compared to model m2 although they both share the same level of theoretical model complexity this behavior mainly indicates that the nobs reaction has a larger impact on nitrogen turnover in the aquifer than ammonia reduction though the difference in the estimated bayesian evidence can also be partially attributed to a higher number of parameters of model m3 the use of the monod kinetics for both nitrifying bacteria m4 leads to a further but less substantial increase of the marginal likelihood i e 294 09 0 45 this increase is even less significant when including in the model ammonifying bacteria growth and degradation m5 thus indicating a saturation of the model complexity such behavior can be clearly inferred from fig 6 which shows how the marginal likelihood grows nonlinearly with the number of parameters and how such dynamics seems to follow a second order polynomial trend characterized by a maximum around 14 parameters which corresponds to the parameterization of model m5 from this perspective it can be hypothesized that the use of a more complex model would result in overparameterization and worse model generalizability 3 2 1 1 posterior distributions marginal posterior distributions and median values and 95 confidence intervals of adsorption and reaction parameters for all investigated biogeochemical models are shown in fig 8 and table 4 respectively at the first inspection posteriors exhibit mixed patterns generally parameters uncertainty tends to decrease when the model complexity increases indicating the theoretical inadequacy of simple parameterizations in reproducing nitrogen turnover in the aquifer for model m1 the uniform prior is reduced for four parameters and among them only two factors μ s n org and μ s n h 4 are well identified on the other hand the reduction of almost all priors for models m4 and m5 suggests that bacterial growth dynamics is the mechanism responsible for reaction processes and that the first order reactions are not sufficient to explain this biogeochemical process the posterior distribution of the adsorption coefficient for organic nitrogen k d n org varies significantly between different biogeochemical models on average table 4 its value is high and indicates strong sorption of organic nitrogen to the solid phase which is compatible with observations in the transport studies on organic compounds in soils mariano et al 2016 interestingly the posterior distributions of k d n org for models m3 and m4 are leptokurtic and unimodal though their median values table 4 differ significantly while higher uncertainty is encountered for models m1 and m5 while the behavior of the former can be explained by an overall theoretical inadequacy of the parameterization the difference between m4 and m5 is surprising considering the similar level of complexity and estimated marginal likelihoods however correlation matrices fig 7 can help in explaining this aspect in particular fig 7 shows a strong negative correlation between k d n org and k d n h 4 for model m5 thus implying that low sorption of organic nitrogen is compensated in the simulation by higher ammonium sorption overall there is an increase in parameter correlations in model m5 which can indicate overfitting as already discussed for fig 6 on the other hand the posterior distribution of the adsorption coefficient for ammonium k d n h 4 is skewed in all biogeochemical models thus suggesting its prominent role in nitrogen turnover the uncertainty range decreases with an increase in model complexity and shifts towards more realistic sorption values in particular models m4 and m5 present leptokurtic posterior distributions which are in line with values reported in the literature generally ranging between 0 5 and 3 5 cm3 g hanson et al 2006 jellali et al 2010 li et al 2015 on the other hand models m1 and m3 exhibit a dense probability region near the right boundary of the parameter space i e k d n h 4 10 cm3 g which is significantly overestimated as a consequence of these high sorption rates the first order decay coefficients in the liquid phase for organic nitrogen and ammonium μ l n org and μ l n h 4 are characterized by flat posteriors and high uncertainty suggesting a low influence of these parameters on the simulated process and that their values cannot be inferred from measured data this behavior is common in all models conversely the first order decay coefficients in the solid phase μ s n org and μ s n h 4 are well estimated thus indicating their preeminent role in the numerical description of the nitrogen turnover in the aquifer the posterior distributions of the nitrification rate in the liquid phase μ l n o 2 are highest near the right boundary for both models m1 and m2 confirming an overall model inadequacy again the monod kinetics parameters for the ammonification process in model m5 are generally characterized by high uncertainty suggesting that the information content of the data is not sufficient to well constrain their values the uniform prior is reduced only for the maximum growth rate and the half saturation constant while the yield and the lysis coefficient are only partially inferred this behavior can be an indication of potential overfitting microbial reaction parameters for aobs show mixed posterior patterns the maximum aerobic growth rate γnh4 is characterized by leptokurtic distributions in biogeochemical models m2 m4 and m5 and this behavior exacerbates with an increase in model complexity the growth rate of aobs γnh4 in model m4 ranges between 0 64 and 0 75 1 day which is in line with typical growth rates at 20 c reported in the literature e g leslie grady et al 2011 while its range appears to be underestimated for model m5 again this behavior can be explained by a high correlation shown in fig 7 which indicates potential overfitting posterior distributions of half saturation constants for aobs are right skewed and accumulated near the boundaries the uncertainty is higher for models m2 and m5 while its range shrinks and varies between 0 51 and 0 98 mg l for model m4 which is in agreement with what has been reported in the literature bitton 2010 leslie grady et al 2011 and confirms that aobs have a lower half saturation constant compared to nobs sharma and ahlert 1977 posterior distributions of the yield coefficient ynh4 show a different behavior among models in particular models m2 and m4 have peaks near the left boundary while model m5 is characterized by very low yield values the latter appears to contradict what was observed in other studies e g bitton 2010 which reported a high value of ynh4 thus against suggesting potential overfitting of model m5 a behavior this which is further confirmed by the relatively low value of the lysis coefficient for aobs observed in models m2 and m5 on the other hand microbial reaction parameters for nobs show similar posterior patterns the maximum aerobic growth rate γno2 for models m3 m4 and m5 is well identified and characterized by limited uncertainty the high positive correlation observed in fig 7 for model m5 can explain the slight overestimation of the growth rate the posterior distribution of the half saturation constant sno2 is left skewed and its uncertainty decreases with model complexity all ranges are in agreement with what has been reported in the literature bitton 2010 leslie grady et al 2011 and confirm that nobs have a higher half saturation constant sharma and ahlert 1977 the nobs yield coefficient yno2 is significantly higher for model m5 and suggest that nobs were present in higher number compared to aobs which contradicts what has been reported in the literature bitton 2010 finally lysis rates show a left skewed posterior distribution with bno2 characterized by a lower uncertainty this higher value of the death rate for nobs is compatible with what was reported in copp and murphy 1995 who reported a typical value of 0 14 1 day 3 2 1 2 model predictive checks to better investigate the models behavior the parameter uncertainty is propagated to generate posterior predictive checks which are used to look for systematic discrepancies between real and simulated data gelman et al 2004 thus representing a fundamental tool for model criticism posterior predictive checks of simulated nitrite concentrations for all biogeochemical models are obtained by random sampling of 100 solutions from the posterior parameters distributions fig 9 an increase and a decrease in the quality of fitting and predictive uncertainty respectively is evident at the first inspection in particular the use of constant first order decay reactions in model m1 prevents the model from correctly simulating transient accumulation of nitrites and delayed nitrate production at the beginning of the experiment the situation slightly improves for model m2 which can reproduce the nitrites peak at the beginning of the experiment but significantly overestimate their concentration in the remaining part of the experiment this overestimation is particularly evident in the unsaturated zone and it indicates high aobs growth which is not compensated by the simultaneous growth of nobs in model m2 the situation improves for model m3 which slightly underestimates nitrite accumulation and which is characterized by low predictive uncertainty the anticipation in nitrite production is mainly due to the assumption of a constant first order reaction for aobs which does not account for the delay in the bacteria growth the combination of multiple monod kinetics in models m4 and m5 improves the fitting and limits the uncertainty thus suggesting that bacterial growth and reaction were the mechanisms driving nitrogen turnover in the aquifer this confirms the findings reported in cheyns et al 2010 and de wilde et al 2009 who suggested that monod kinetics performed better when describing pesticide biodegradation in a laboratory mineralization experiment a more precise estimation of the bacteria population at the beginning of the experiment would have further improved model accuracy interestingly model m4 is characterized by a slightly lower predictive uncertainty than model m5 which again can indicate potential overfitting similarly posterior predictive checks of simulated nitrate concentrations for all biogeochemical models are obtained by random sampling of 100 solutions from the posterior parameter distributions fig 10 predictive checks of nitrate concentrations confirm and highlight the inaccuracy of the model that uses first order reactions to describe nitrogen reactions in the aquifer the model bias is particularly evident during the first 50 days of the numerical simulation when the injected manure is characterized by high organic nitrogen and ammonium concentrations that favor mineralization processes and microbial growth table 1 after this period nitrates are dominant in the inflow thus shifting the physical process towards a pure advection dispersion process with limited reactions as expected under such circumstances the simple model m1 accurately reproduced no3 concentrations even capturing the final concentration rise at z 10 cm to summarize posterior predictive checks indicate that the model m1 can only partially reproduce measured data and that it cannot fully account for processes occurring early during the experiment model m2 improves the fitting but exhibits a very high uncertainty while predictions of model m3 are much more generalizable this is interesting since it indicates that nobs growth has a greater influence on nitrogen turnover than aobs growth however both models m2 and m3 are affected by significant underestimation of nitrate concentrations at the beginning of the experiment this behavior disappears in model m4 and to a greater extent in model m5 which accurately reproduces measured nitrate concentrations the uncertainty band encompasses measured data and shows good model generalizability predictive uncertainty in model m5 tends to increase at deeper depths compared to model m4 which is instead more conservative the effect of predictive uncertainty is more evident during the middle time period of the simulation at that stage of the simulation the bacteria population is already established and reaction rates become extremely sensitive to kinetic parameters which cannot be precisely inferred from measured data due to their limited temporal resolution during this period indeed no observations were available between days 37 and 54 few measurements in that period would likely reduce the model predictive uncertainty the improvement in the quality of the fitting is the main reason for the highest estimated marginal likelihood of model m5 which is on the other hand limited by the slightly higher uncertainty compared to model m4 both these factors concur with the small difference in marginal likelihood between models m4 and m5 3 3 model validation the estimated 50th percentile values of reaction parameters for model m5 table 3 are used in the high fidelity model hydrus 2d for validation a comparison between measured and modeled nitrite and nitrate concentrations at four different vertical profiles and depths is shown in fig 11 hydrus 2d can accurately reproduce measured data at several locations in the aquifer thus indicating good predictive capabilities the model correctly describes the transient accumulation of nitrites at the beginning of the experiment although with some underestimation and delay which was already observed with hydrus 1d this can be related to potential uncertainties in the estimation of the soil hydraulic and transport parameters as well as to biased initial conditions indeed such initial deviations between modeled and measured concentrations are also noticeable for nitrates which are overestimated during the first few days of the simulated period even so this effect is small and limited in time after this initial period the model predicts nitrate concentrations at different locations well some bias is evident at z 40 cm but the overall quality of the fitting is satisfactory nevertheless it must be noted that the fit quality does not degenerate but improves compared to hydrus 1d suggesting the overall reliability of the bayesian calibration 4 discussion 4 1 nested sampling performance as mentioned in the introduction this study presents the first application of nested sampling for the bayesian calibration of a biogeochemical mechanistic model results suggest that this algorithm can be successfully used to simultaneously estimate the bayesian model evidence and parameter posterior distributions in typical vadose zone modeling applications thus providing a statistical basis for the model comparison and uncertainty assessment in the light of measured data the possibility of having this combined statistical outcome at no extra cost is one of the main advantages of nested sampling compared to traditional mcmc techniques such as ensemble samplers e g goodman and weare 2010 vrugt 2016 which are frequently used in combination with mechanistic models e g brunetti et al 2019 wöhling and vrugt 2011 in our analysis it is first used to infer the posterior distributions of soil hydraulic and transport parameters then in a classic model selection framework to discriminate between alternative parameterization of reactive processes furthermore as the number of iterations demonstrates it is computationally efficient requiring a lower number of model executions this behavior has already been observed in past studies focused on the comparison of nested sampling with other mcmc samplers allison and dunkley 2013 the coefficients of variation for multiple multinest runs were generally very low indicating good stability of the algorithm as such future research should focus on providing a rigorous assessment of the advantages and drawbacks of nested sampling compared to classical mcmc samplers in high and low dimensions for typical inverse estimation problems in vadose zone modeling 4 2 biogeochemical model parameterization the bayesian model selection suggests that monod kinetics is the more suitable model parameterization for reproducing measured data in particular the higher marginal likelihood for model m5 indicates that bacterial growth played a major role in the entire nitrogen degradation chain during the laboratory experiment even though its effect is more significant for nitrification as indicated by the low difference in the estimated bayesian evidence between models m4 and m5 table 4 on the other hand model m1 which uses the first order reactions underfitted measured data fig 9 and fig 10 especially at the beginning of the experiment this mainly depends on the measured data which indicates that different geochemical processes are dominant in different parts of the experiment during the first part of the experiment the mineralization processes are dominant thus tipping the balance towards complex models which can describe the transient accumulation of nitrite model m1 which cannot account for these processes is instead able to satisfactorily describe the second part of the experiment characterized by negligible mineralization another factor that reduces the fitting quality of the complex model is the uncertainty stemming from the hypothesized initial bacteria population this further confirms the point that the choice of a complex model must be fully justified by the information content of measured data which govern the model selection the higher the information content of observations the higher the model complexity allowed to the modeler in summary this study confirms that monod kinetics is the most suited parameterization for laboratory mineralization experiments which are generally characterized by a strong influence of microbial growth especially in the first part of the experiment this does not imply that this model parameterization is a priori better than the one with the traditional first order coefficients but it is simply more suited to reproduce available measured data for this case study and the bayesian analysis statistically proves this such a numerical approach should be used ubiquitously in any model calibration to have a statistical basis for model selection claiming the appropriateness of a model parameterization by relying only on the results obtained using a single set of optimized parameters as frequently done can be highly misleading and lead to poor model calibration especially for biogeochemical modeling applications 4 3 importance of measured data consequently measured data are crucial in the model calibration they must be exhaustive and representative of the investigated process to maximize the information content of measured data the model can be used in a prognostic way by performing a model based bayesian optimal experimental design which gives the researcher indications of potential experimental designs that reduce the model predictive uncertainty for example in our case few measurements about the initial distribution of bacteria in the aquifer could have improved the predictions of the complex model this is particularly important when novel model parameterizations are investigated since overfitting can undermine their generalizability as well as their applicability for practical applications where the model predictive capability is fundamental for designing purposes 4 4 importance of priors and posteriors assessment the bayesian model selection framework included five parameterizations which combine monod kinetics and first order reactions the dynamics of the estimated marginal likelihood fig 6 and the correlation analysis fig 7 suggest a plausible saturation of the available model complexity and potential overfitting respectively thus indicating that a further increase in the model complexity could not be justifiable however it is not possible to reject a priori the possibility that measured data could be better described in terms of fitting and generalizability by other models that were not considered in this study nevertheless the prior model set was selected based on the available prior information obtained from a preliminary analysis of measured data a new level of model complexity e g denitrification should be carefully justified based on available information considering the computational effort required to calculate the marginal likelihood since a single case study cannot be entirely representative of the physical process investigated and since different unpredictable uncertainties can affect measured data both prior and posterior parameter distributions must be carefully inspected and compared with the existing body of literature to assess their physical meaning priors are fundamental to rule out unphysical solutions and constrain the inverse problem and must be set based on both a thorough literature survey and preliminary experiments for example in our case batch experiments on the adsorption of ammonium to the solid phase could have been used to obtain a more informative prior about the distribution coefficient in contrast posteriors with peaks near the boundary of the search space are generally correlated with model inadequacy a behavior that we encountered mainly in the simple model in our analysis in this regard the bayesian analysis can also be viewed as a diagnostic tool to detect modeling issues 4 5 computational cost computational cost is the bottleneck in the bayesian calibration of environmental models that cannot be performed without carrying out an uncertainty assessment during model calibration in our study the use of hydrus 1d as a lower fidelity surrogate has proven to be extremely useful it allowed us to perform multiple bayesian analyses in a reasonable amount of time furthermore the hydrus 2d validation against measured data suggests that the results of the surrogate based analysis are reliable and that the simplification induced by spatial reduction is acceptable interestingly results in terms of fitting are even better when surrogate based optimized parameters are used in the high fidelity model i e hydrus 2d this indicates that the two models have similar likelihood landscapes and that a proper multi fidelity analysis based on the use of hierarchical models with correction mapping robinson et al 2008 could have improved the bayesian model selection both in terms of accuracy and computational cost in this view future research should explore the use of the multi fidelity surrogate based analysis for environmental model calibration in particular the co kriging techniques to combine data from both the higher and lower fidelity models forrester et al 2007 4 6 surrogate based analysis the combination of the multimodal nested sampling algorithm with a surrogate model can significantly increase the overall computational efficiency of the analysis though a rigorous assessment of the calculated bayesian model evidence and posterior distributions is recommended in this perspective the use of synthetic data is suggested to avoid the influence of unpredictable sources of uncertainty often encountered in measured data 5 conclusions the aim of this study was to investigate the main advantages and findings of model selection in a typical biogeochemical modeling application dealing with nitrogen turnover in a controlled aquifer model setup results from a multilevel numerical analysis raised several interesting points of discussion and provided future research directions on how to handle model complexity in biogeochemical model calibration from both a statistical and computational point of view certainly this research did not pretend to be exhaustive nor conclusive for such a dynamic field as environmental modeling but instead aimed to be a scientific contribution improving the current understanding of model complexity and placing emphasis on the role of parsimony in model selection research advancements in environmental sciences and engineering allow the modeler to simulate multiple physical processes with different levels of complexity this modeling flexibility is undoubtedly a valuable tool but should always be counterbalanced by an overall sense of parsimony which is established by the aim and circumstances of the numerical analysis we want to underline that this concept should be central in any modeling application and especially in environmental sciences which are and will be even more in the next future heavily dependent on numerical models declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

5644,the floridan aquifer consists of a high presence of karst features that make the landscape prone to sinkholes karst conduits can conduct high amounts of water and affect processes such as groundwater transport a karst conduit evolution model based on dissolution chemistry is applied to the silver springs springshed in ocala florida the model is able to reproduce the observed potentiometric head profiles more accurately than the one dimensional groundwater flow model for confined aquifer with leaky conditions in addition based on the initial fracture geometry and dissolution chemistry the model predicts the age of the conduits from the analyzed head profiles to be approximately 9 60 myrs old the understanding of the karst conduit geometric evolution and mapping can improve conduit age prediction as well as better characterize conduit flow patterns and subsequent groundwater processes keywords karst evolution dissolution chemistry floridan aquifer groundwater conduit age 1 introduction karst aquifers are distinct groundwater systems in nature where physical processes behave differently as compared to non karstic systems in the floridan aquifer system there is a high presence of carbonate rock i e karst limestone which is subjected to dissolution continuously due to infiltrated water over time this can lead to the formation and evolution of conduits which can influence potentiometric surfaces hanna and rajaram 1998 andre and rajaram 2005 worthington 2009 this dynamic shaping of the floridan aquifer system can have implications on certain processes such as groundwater flow contaminant transport and even seawater intrusion xu et al 2016 it is documented that karst landscapes are present in about 20 of earth s surface palmer 1991 ronayne 2013 therefore there is an interest in characterizing karst features as they may vary depending on local basin geological history and climate conditions i e sea level changes glaciation across geographic locations florea and vacher 2006a bakalowicz 2015 for modeling karst system processes and dynamics one has to consider dynamic karst conduits coupled with the rock matrix several models especially numerical models have been used to simulate the evolution of conduits in karst aquifers clemens et al 1996 dreybrodt 1996 kaufmann and braun 1999 kaufmann 2009 de rooij and graham 2017 these karst evolution models employ dissolution chemistry along a fracture to simulate conduit enlargement followed by hydraulics to model flow patterns early studies advocated the use of dissolution mechanisms in karst initiation and evolution to understand how fast low order and slow high order kinetics are necessary to model the initial karst evolution dreybrodt 1990 palmer 1991 karst evolution in peninsular florida occurs when sea levels fluctuate allowing meteoric water i e rainfall to infiltrate and dissolve the carbonate rocks that have been deposited over time beck 1986 randazzo 1997 upchurch et al 2019 in particular widespread cave formations have occurred during periods of low sea level when florida s land area was exposed gulley and florea 2016 during periods of high sea level karst features i e sinkholes springs caves become submerged preventing cave development and reversing head gradients tihansky 1999 gulley and florea 2016 thus it has been suggested that karst conduit evolution acts as a punctual and cyclic process rather than continuous gulley and florea 2016 in addition as hydraulic heads in conduits may differ from heads in the soil matrix some studies suggest water being exchanged from a conduit to the matrix or vice versa martin and dean 2001 ronayne 2013 the florida karst has been uniquely characterized as eogenetic due to is relatively young geologic age and due to the presence of limestone near the land surface in contrast karst elsewhere in the united states is telogenetic florea and vacher 2006a gulley et al 2011 upchurch et al 2019 the floridan aquifer system consists of the soil and rock matrix and evolving karst fractures commonly referred to as conduits once they reach a diameter of 1 cm white 2002 which can differ considerably in terms of hydraulic conductivities slug tests for the upper floridan aquifer ufa in the north central florida area revealed matrix hydraulic conductivity values between 1 74 10 5 m s and 2 20 10 4 m s langston et al 2012 whereas core samples have indicated an average matrix conductivity of 10 6 m s florea and vacher 2007 hydraulic conductivities in fractures or conduits are in general several orders of magnitude greater than matrix conductivities for example a conduit diameter of 1 cm can correspond to a conductivity of about 10 m s kaufmann 2016 the ufa aquifer is mostly confined in southern areas yet slowly becomes thinly confined and unconfined towards the northwest direction indicating a certain degree of heterogeneity williams and kuniansky 2015 according to the survey data on the hydraulic nature of the ufa the karst conduits are spaced out and connected to one another with segments of varying lengths particularly near the ocala area in florida and are mostly oriented in the northeast southwest and northwest southeast directions vernon 1951 phelps 1994 florea and vacher 2006b one conduit property that can be difficult to quantify is the diameter especially throughout the conduit s length cave exploration is one method that has been used to characterize conduit size florea and vacher 2006b in the ufa in north florida the average conduit dimensions i e width and height range from 12 m to 24 m moore et al 2010 for silver springs the spring vent diameter was measured as 11 m sepúlveda 2009 whereas in the santa fe river the average conduit diameters calculated ranged between 22 m and 25 m langston et al 2012 in recent decades the silver springs discharge has been on a decline see changes in mean streamflow in fig 1 a due to increased groundwater pumping for growing population demands shoemaker et al 2004 and only recently there has been an effort to restore discharge levels back to natural conditions given the area s susceptibility to sinkholes and the increase in human activities e g groundwater pumping in recent years there is an interest in understanding and characterizing the complex karst features in the ufa see e g fig 1 to gain such an understanding this study aims to model karst conduit evolution in the silver springs area to describe the head profiles and to quantify conduit properties that would improve understanding of karst conduit flow and complex karst geology in addition conduit age can be predicted by simulating conduit evolution and resulting head profiles over time based on conduit properties the paper is structured as follows the following section discusses the models used in this study section 3 presents the data and site description and section 4 provides the results and discussion the summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methods 2 1 model description karst evolution model k model a cylindrical conduit is discretized into logarithmically equal increments to compute dissolution rates and calcium concentrations along the conduit the calcium dissolution process is modeled as dreybrodt 1996 siemers and dreybrodt 1998 kaufmann and braun 1999 1 f k i 1 c x t c eq n i i 1 2 where f is the dissolution rate i refers to the kinetic behavior of the dissolution process i e 1 for low order kinetics and 2 for high order kinetics k is the kinetic rate c is the calcium concentration ceq is the calcium equilibrium concentration and n is the kinetic exponent n 1 1 and n 2 4 the kinetic rate k for low order conditions is computed as 2 k 1 k 0 1 k 0 d x t 6 d c eq 1 where k0 is the kinetic rate constant d is the conduit diameter and d is the diffusion coefficient for high order conditions the kinetic rate is obtained from 3 k 2 k 1 1 c t c eq n 1 n 2 here ct is the threshold concentration where low order kinetics transitions to high order kinetics as dissolution is being simulated inside the conduit the increase in calcium concentration in the water as it flows through the conduit can be determined afterwards the conduit growth rate and the increase in conduit diameter can be computed by defining time steps and a number of iterations dreybrodt 1996 kaufmann and braun 1999 kaufmann 2009 using the darcy weisbach equation the head loss can be modeled as 4 δ h fl v 2 2 g d where δh is the head loss f is the friction factor l is the conduit length v is the average flow velocity and g is the acceleration due to gravity the reynold s number re vd υ where υ is kinematic viscosity characterizes laminar and turbulent flow when it is below or above a critical threshold respectively in this study a critical threshold of 2200 is used which has been considered in previous studies kaufmann and braun 1999 for both laminar and turbulent flows the friction factor is modeled using the following equation swamee and swamee 2007 5 f 64 re 8 9 5 ln 3 7 d 5 74 re 0 9 2500 re 6 16 0 125 where is the wall roughness coefficient in the model the conduit discharge is calculated using eq 4 the k model was tested using the initial conditions obtained from past studies for verification fig 2 shows flow evolution and breakthrough times in an evolving karst conduit using initial and boundary conditions assumed in kaufmann 2009 as can be seen breakthrough is sensitive to changes in initial fracture geometry and hydraulic conditions as a result simulated head profiles for different conditions may vary as well following verification the model was applied to the florida karst system fig 3 fig 1b shows the modeled flow rate evolution based on initial fracture geometry and hydraulic conditions from cross section ss see fig 3b near silver springs the flow rate in the filled in dot closely matches the average flow rate in fig 1a although fig 1b and 2 show similar flow evolution shapes due to different initial parameters the time scales and discharge magnitudes can vary significantly 2 2 model description one dimensional groundwater leakage model l model the k model is compared to a groundwater leakage model l model here the general governing equation for one dimensional groundwater flow for a confined leaky aquifer at steady state is written as the following where h is the head at a location mays 2011 6 x t h x k h 0 h b 0 where t is transmissivity h 0 is the initial head b and k are the confining layer thickness and conductivity respectively the solution for one dimensional confined aquifer with leakage at steady state can be expressed as 7 h x h 0 c 1 e x p x b c 2 e x p x b where b t b k is the leakage factor and c1 and c2 are constants 3 data and site description data on the potentiometric levels from twenty two 22 observation wells within the springshed of silver springs were obtained from the st johns river water management district sjrwmd the springshed boundary is shown in fig 3a water levels only for the ufa where karst features are present are considered for unconfined areas the well depths range from 12 to 37 m whereas the depths in confined areas range from 37 to 73 m the thickness of the ufa is roughly 200 m near the ocala area with the top of the ufa being a few meters below ground surface williams and kuniansky 2015 the mean value of water elevation for each well was computed from which a potentiometric surface was generated via kriging fig 3a kitanidis 1997 the estimated transmissivity values for silver springs ranged from 4000 to 52 000 m2 day the vast range in magnitude of transmissivity values is due to the high presence of carbonate rock in the aquifer kuniansky et al 2012 the upper confining thickness ranges from about 0 to 56 m williams and kuniansky 2015 these values can serve as a reference for modeling groundwater flow under confined conditions and are shown in fig 3b karst maps obtained from the united states geological survey usgs show that within the study area carbonate rocks are present at or near the surface as well as buried 90 m beneath sediments which can be seen in fig 3c therefore the profiles of potentiometric levels can be examined further to investigate whether and to what degree they follow the previously observed nonlinear relationship concave down seen in karst simulations dreybrodt and gabrovšek 2003 romanov et al 2004 perne et al 2014 de rooij and graham 2017 the following hydraulic and chemistry parameters were used in this study based on kaufmann 2009 υ 0 012 cm2 s and ct 0 9 ceq in addition k 0 1 10 11 mol cm2 s and a ceq value of 3 10 6 mol cm3 were assumed although the latter value may range from 5 10 7 to 3 10 6 mol cm3 gabrovšek 2007 a d value of 10 6 cm2 s is assumed as noted in yobbi 1996 due to the presence of scallops and other microtopographies in the conduit walls in florida gulley et al 2011 1 cm is assumed which has been used elsewhere shoemaker et al 2008 4 results and discussion modeling karst conduit evolution requires knowledge of the processes that drive karst dissolution and subsequent evolution palmer 1991 dreybrodt 1996 aggressive water assumed conceptually to be infiltrated rainfall or recharge with respect to calcium entering karst conduits dissolves the surrounding limestone slowly enlarging the conduits i e increasing diameter as water continues to dissolve limestone at some point it becomes saturated this means that conduit dissolution no longer occurs when water is saturated with limestone as a result incoming under saturated water assumed to have a calcium concentration 0 mol cm3 further dissolves the conduit and this behavior propagates throughout the karst conduit system the dissolution is modeled for low order and high order kinetics for simplification this study assumes continuous karst conduit evolution and assumes no water exchange between the conduits and the matrix fig 3b d indicate the sample cross sections from which the potentiometric head profiles are analyzed these profiles correspond to fractures that have been mapped out based on aerial photographs and remote sensing of photolinears in previous studies vernon 1951 florea and vacher 2006b by superimposing fracture maps to scale various fracture cross sections were then traced in areas where the aquifer is confined fig 4 a shows the head profiles of the traced fracture cross sections whereas normalized head profiles with respect to maximum elevation head are shown in fig 4b as can be seen these profiles display nonlinear concave down behavior therefore the karst evolution model k model can be appropriately employed to simulate head profiles to see if it can mimic the observed values furthermore the k model is also able to predict the age of the conduits this analysis is based on initial conditions for fracture geometry and dissolution chemistry fig 4c shows a sample output for predicting the age of cross section aa fig 3b in the k model the head profile changes as a function of time due to the continuous conduit dissolution for predicting conduit age the simulations were run until the modeled head profiles overlapped with the observed ones and the elapsed time was recorded see fig 4c note that for brevity we only show the age prediction for aa however simulations were run for all cross sections shown in fig 3b d in general fractures can have varying initial aperture diameters e g 10 μm 10 mm white 2007 these aperture diameter values can provide an estimate for initial fracture size in this study the k model simulates the observed head profiles for each cross section by assuming an initial fracture diameter of 1 mm and the lengths of each cross section the hydraulic gradient is derived from measured head levels to compare the accuracy of the k model with respect to the observed profile the root mean square error rmse was employed and can be calculated as r m s e i n p i o i 2 n where p o and n are the predicted value observed value and number of observations respectively applying the k model for example for cross section aa we observe that it takes approximately 54 myrs for the karst conduit to evolve and reproduce the observed head profile with the fit having an rmse of 0 001 m fig 5 a fig 5b shows the head profiles for cross section bb which can be considered thinly confined the k model plots a similar head profile with an rmse of 0 006 m this head profile would occur after 36 myrs fig 5c and 5d show the observed head for cross sections cc and dd respectively the associated rmse and age for cc and dd were 0 004 m 45 myrs and 0 004 m 21 myrs respectively fig 5e shows the head profiles for cross section ee whereas fig 5f shows the head profile for cross section ff the corresponding rmse and the age for ee and ff were 0 008 m 30 myrs and 0 004 m 9 myrs respectively these rmse values for the k model are also listed in table 1 out of the six profiles the k model profiles for cross sections aa and dd best resemble their observed profiles whereas cross sections bb and cc do not fit well enough compared to their observed profiles for example for cross sections bb and cc at that the end of the observed profiles fig 5b and 5c the evident concave up behavior is not accurately captured by the k model this concavity change could be due to processes such as groundwater withdrawals that may induce lower water levels in the observed profiles than what was simulated by the k model ghasemizadeh et al 2016 it should be noted that a nonlinear concave down head distribution may be also attributed to leakage flowing to the confined aquifer through a semi confining layer the available data on transmissivity and thickness of the confining layer pertaining to each fracture cross section are used to fit a value for k modeling both karst and leakage processes can help characterize the terrain of the ufa and can also suggest which of these two processes can explain the observed profiles better fig 5a also shows the modeled profile using the one dimensional groundwater flow leakage model l model this profile was fit using average rock parameters i e a t value of 4 98 10 2 m2 s and a b value of 23 m from these values a minimum error rmse between observed and l model predicted heads of 0 011 m is obtained when a fitted k value of 1 3 10 7 m s is used the leakage parameter values t b and k along with rmse values for cross sections bb ff can be seen in table 1 whereas the cross section profiles along with the simulated head profiles are shown in fig 5 given on average that the rmse in the case of k model is one order smaller than the rmse in l model these results indicate k model can reproduce the observed head with much higher accuracy compared to the l model in addition for all the analyzed cases the simulated head profiles using the k model with the initial conditions occurred before breakthrough yet the continuous dynamic enlargement of the conduits would imply that turbulent flow would occur eventually as a result this occurrence would carry implications on flow and transport processes for instance there would be a greater tendency for conduits to transfer flow as compared to flow in the rock matrix the hydraulic conductivities modeled for the confining layers indicate aquitard behavior as expected for reference aquitard conductivities range from 1 3 10 6 t o 2 4 10 9 m s sepúlveda 2009 thus the values obtained here with the exception of cross section bb fall within the range of estimated values for the most part the rmse from the k model was less than the l model with the exception of cross sections bb and ff suggesting that the potentiometric head profiles can be better explained by karst dissolution estimates on conduit age were obtained by applying the k model in which the modeled head profiles indicate that it would take between 9 and 60 myrs see table 1 to achieve the observed head profiles based on the initial fracture assumptions from earlier studies it is suggested that the rock geology of the ufa in the ocala area is from the eocene and oligocene series florea and vacher 2006b williams and kuniansky 2015 which occurred roughly 25 50 myrs ago in fact the aquifer age of silver springs is listed at 40 myrs florea and vacher 2006a on a larger scale the region of caves and springs in west central florida is estimated to have been developed roughly 29 42 myrs ago florea 2008 further the ocala limestone was suggested to have been deposited 34 37 myrs ago williams and kuniansky 2015 upchurch et al 2019 the extracted nonlinear head profiles estimated ages for most sample cross sections are reasonable in the sense that the predicted ages fall within the age range of the geologic rock florea and vacher 2006a the predicted ages for two of the sample cross sections are overestimated assuming no water exchange between conduits and the matrix as well as interpolating the head field via kriging may explain the overestimated values for the profiles exhibiting early karst evolution to predict an older conduit age for the geologic rock in florida the initial fracture size would need to be smaller than initially assumed however other parameters may also affect conduit age simulations for instance simulating karst evolution with a lower ceq and or a higher k0 value would slow down the dissolution process and prolong breakthrough this implies that it would take more time for the simulated head profiles to overlap the observed head profiles which would lead to overestimating the conduit age relative to prior reports 5 summary and conclusions this study modeled the piezometric head profiles of the ufa in the silver springs area by applying karst dissolution and subsequent conduit evolution and confined groundwater flow conditions piezometric head data on the ufa were obtained in which extracted head profiles revealed nonlinear behavior the evolution of karst conduits was simulated and the modeled head profiles k model overlapped the observed head levels suggesting a strong presence of karstic systems although the modeled head profiles from the k model were associated with laminar flow for all cross sections dissolution is ongoing and at some point the flow regime becomes turbulent implying a greater tendency for flow to pass through conduits as for groundwater flow with leakage modeled head profiles l model also approximately matched observed head levels with reasonable aquifer parameters however the rmse were nearly one order of magnitude larger in some cases than in the k model this implies that the ufa can be more accurately characterized by the k model compared to the l model in areas where karst features are present karst dissolution shows potential in modeling conduit segments in addition to the k model reproducing observed heads it can also predict the age of conduit segments although initial assumptions on fracture size length and dissolution parameters may vary one can compute head profiles across time and compare them with observed levels until an overlap occurs at a specific time which would imply a current conduit s age based on the analyzed head profiles the k model predicts approximately 9 60 myrs for the conduits to achieve the observed head profiles with an average age of 35 myrs for all sample cross sections which is consistent with earlier reports overestimated values could have been due to model simplifications more accurate mapping of karst conduits and their geometries would help improve conduit age prediction relative to the geologic age of the present rock that makes up the ufa 25 50 myrs for a karstic area like the floridan aquifer applying dissolution chemistry to simulate karst conduit evolution allows for the modeling of the conduit geometry and head profiles over time as well as the age of the present

5644,the floridan aquifer consists of a high presence of karst features that make the landscape prone to sinkholes karst conduits can conduct high amounts of water and affect processes such as groundwater transport a karst conduit evolution model based on dissolution chemistry is applied to the silver springs springshed in ocala florida the model is able to reproduce the observed potentiometric head profiles more accurately than the one dimensional groundwater flow model for confined aquifer with leaky conditions in addition based on the initial fracture geometry and dissolution chemistry the model predicts the age of the conduits from the analyzed head profiles to be approximately 9 60 myrs old the understanding of the karst conduit geometric evolution and mapping can improve conduit age prediction as well as better characterize conduit flow patterns and subsequent groundwater processes keywords karst evolution dissolution chemistry floridan aquifer groundwater conduit age 1 introduction karst aquifers are distinct groundwater systems in nature where physical processes behave differently as compared to non karstic systems in the floridan aquifer system there is a high presence of carbonate rock i e karst limestone which is subjected to dissolution continuously due to infiltrated water over time this can lead to the formation and evolution of conduits which can influence potentiometric surfaces hanna and rajaram 1998 andre and rajaram 2005 worthington 2009 this dynamic shaping of the floridan aquifer system can have implications on certain processes such as groundwater flow contaminant transport and even seawater intrusion xu et al 2016 it is documented that karst landscapes are present in about 20 of earth s surface palmer 1991 ronayne 2013 therefore there is an interest in characterizing karst features as they may vary depending on local basin geological history and climate conditions i e sea level changes glaciation across geographic locations florea and vacher 2006a bakalowicz 2015 for modeling karst system processes and dynamics one has to consider dynamic karst conduits coupled with the rock matrix several models especially numerical models have been used to simulate the evolution of conduits in karst aquifers clemens et al 1996 dreybrodt 1996 kaufmann and braun 1999 kaufmann 2009 de rooij and graham 2017 these karst evolution models employ dissolution chemistry along a fracture to simulate conduit enlargement followed by hydraulics to model flow patterns early studies advocated the use of dissolution mechanisms in karst initiation and evolution to understand how fast low order and slow high order kinetics are necessary to model the initial karst evolution dreybrodt 1990 palmer 1991 karst evolution in peninsular florida occurs when sea levels fluctuate allowing meteoric water i e rainfall to infiltrate and dissolve the carbonate rocks that have been deposited over time beck 1986 randazzo 1997 upchurch et al 2019 in particular widespread cave formations have occurred during periods of low sea level when florida s land area was exposed gulley and florea 2016 during periods of high sea level karst features i e sinkholes springs caves become submerged preventing cave development and reversing head gradients tihansky 1999 gulley and florea 2016 thus it has been suggested that karst conduit evolution acts as a punctual and cyclic process rather than continuous gulley and florea 2016 in addition as hydraulic heads in conduits may differ from heads in the soil matrix some studies suggest water being exchanged from a conduit to the matrix or vice versa martin and dean 2001 ronayne 2013 the florida karst has been uniquely characterized as eogenetic due to is relatively young geologic age and due to the presence of limestone near the land surface in contrast karst elsewhere in the united states is telogenetic florea and vacher 2006a gulley et al 2011 upchurch et al 2019 the floridan aquifer system consists of the soil and rock matrix and evolving karst fractures commonly referred to as conduits once they reach a diameter of 1 cm white 2002 which can differ considerably in terms of hydraulic conductivities slug tests for the upper floridan aquifer ufa in the north central florida area revealed matrix hydraulic conductivity values between 1 74 10 5 m s and 2 20 10 4 m s langston et al 2012 whereas core samples have indicated an average matrix conductivity of 10 6 m s florea and vacher 2007 hydraulic conductivities in fractures or conduits are in general several orders of magnitude greater than matrix conductivities for example a conduit diameter of 1 cm can correspond to a conductivity of about 10 m s kaufmann 2016 the ufa aquifer is mostly confined in southern areas yet slowly becomes thinly confined and unconfined towards the northwest direction indicating a certain degree of heterogeneity williams and kuniansky 2015 according to the survey data on the hydraulic nature of the ufa the karst conduits are spaced out and connected to one another with segments of varying lengths particularly near the ocala area in florida and are mostly oriented in the northeast southwest and northwest southeast directions vernon 1951 phelps 1994 florea and vacher 2006b one conduit property that can be difficult to quantify is the diameter especially throughout the conduit s length cave exploration is one method that has been used to characterize conduit size florea and vacher 2006b in the ufa in north florida the average conduit dimensions i e width and height range from 12 m to 24 m moore et al 2010 for silver springs the spring vent diameter was measured as 11 m sepúlveda 2009 whereas in the santa fe river the average conduit diameters calculated ranged between 22 m and 25 m langston et al 2012 in recent decades the silver springs discharge has been on a decline see changes in mean streamflow in fig 1 a due to increased groundwater pumping for growing population demands shoemaker et al 2004 and only recently there has been an effort to restore discharge levels back to natural conditions given the area s susceptibility to sinkholes and the increase in human activities e g groundwater pumping in recent years there is an interest in understanding and characterizing the complex karst features in the ufa see e g fig 1 to gain such an understanding this study aims to model karst conduit evolution in the silver springs area to describe the head profiles and to quantify conduit properties that would improve understanding of karst conduit flow and complex karst geology in addition conduit age can be predicted by simulating conduit evolution and resulting head profiles over time based on conduit properties the paper is structured as follows the following section discusses the models used in this study section 3 presents the data and site description and section 4 provides the results and discussion the summary and conclusions are presented in section 5 2 methods 2 1 model description karst evolution model k model a cylindrical conduit is discretized into logarithmically equal increments to compute dissolution rates and calcium concentrations along the conduit the calcium dissolution process is modeled as dreybrodt 1996 siemers and dreybrodt 1998 kaufmann and braun 1999 1 f k i 1 c x t c eq n i i 1 2 where f is the dissolution rate i refers to the kinetic behavior of the dissolution process i e 1 for low order kinetics and 2 for high order kinetics k is the kinetic rate c is the calcium concentration ceq is the calcium equilibrium concentration and n is the kinetic exponent n 1 1 and n 2 4 the kinetic rate k for low order conditions is computed as 2 k 1 k 0 1 k 0 d x t 6 d c eq 1 where k0 is the kinetic rate constant d is the conduit diameter and d is the diffusion coefficient for high order conditions the kinetic rate is obtained from 3 k 2 k 1 1 c t c eq n 1 n 2 here ct is the threshold concentration where low order kinetics transitions to high order kinetics as dissolution is being simulated inside the conduit the increase in calcium concentration in the water as it flows through the conduit can be determined afterwards the conduit growth rate and the increase in conduit diameter can be computed by defining time steps and a number of iterations dreybrodt 1996 kaufmann and braun 1999 kaufmann 2009 using the darcy weisbach equation the head loss can be modeled as 4 δ h fl v 2 2 g d where δh is the head loss f is the friction factor l is the conduit length v is the average flow velocity and g is the acceleration due to gravity the reynold s number re vd υ where υ is kinematic viscosity characterizes laminar and turbulent flow when it is below or above a critical threshold respectively in this study a critical threshold of 2200 is used which has been considered in previous studies kaufmann and braun 1999 for both laminar and turbulent flows the friction factor is modeled using the following equation swamee and swamee 2007 5 f 64 re 8 9 5 ln 3 7 d 5 74 re 0 9 2500 re 6 16 0 125 where is the wall roughness coefficient in the model the conduit discharge is calculated using eq 4 the k model was tested using the initial conditions obtained from past studies for verification fig 2 shows flow evolution and breakthrough times in an evolving karst conduit using initial and boundary conditions assumed in kaufmann 2009 as can be seen breakthrough is sensitive to changes in initial fracture geometry and hydraulic conditions as a result simulated head profiles for different conditions may vary as well following verification the model was applied to the florida karst system fig 3 fig 1b shows the modeled flow rate evolution based on initial fracture geometry and hydraulic conditions from cross section ss see fig 3b near silver springs the flow rate in the filled in dot closely matches the average flow rate in fig 1a although fig 1b and 2 show similar flow evolution shapes due to different initial parameters the time scales and discharge magnitudes can vary significantly 2 2 model description one dimensional groundwater leakage model l model the k model is compared to a groundwater leakage model l model here the general governing equation for one dimensional groundwater flow for a confined leaky aquifer at steady state is written as the following where h is the head at a location mays 2011 6 x t h x k h 0 h b 0 where t is transmissivity h 0 is the initial head b and k are the confining layer thickness and conductivity respectively the solution for one dimensional confined aquifer with leakage at steady state can be expressed as 7 h x h 0 c 1 e x p x b c 2 e x p x b where b t b k is the leakage factor and c1 and c2 are constants 3 data and site description data on the potentiometric levels from twenty two 22 observation wells within the springshed of silver springs were obtained from the st johns river water management district sjrwmd the springshed boundary is shown in fig 3a water levels only for the ufa where karst features are present are considered for unconfined areas the well depths range from 12 to 37 m whereas the depths in confined areas range from 37 to 73 m the thickness of the ufa is roughly 200 m near the ocala area with the top of the ufa being a few meters below ground surface williams and kuniansky 2015 the mean value of water elevation for each well was computed from which a potentiometric surface was generated via kriging fig 3a kitanidis 1997 the estimated transmissivity values for silver springs ranged from 4000 to 52 000 m2 day the vast range in magnitude of transmissivity values is due to the high presence of carbonate rock in the aquifer kuniansky et al 2012 the upper confining thickness ranges from about 0 to 56 m williams and kuniansky 2015 these values can serve as a reference for modeling groundwater flow under confined conditions and are shown in fig 3b karst maps obtained from the united states geological survey usgs show that within the study area carbonate rocks are present at or near the surface as well as buried 90 m beneath sediments which can be seen in fig 3c therefore the profiles of potentiometric levels can be examined further to investigate whether and to what degree they follow the previously observed nonlinear relationship concave down seen in karst simulations dreybrodt and gabrovšek 2003 romanov et al 2004 perne et al 2014 de rooij and graham 2017 the following hydraulic and chemistry parameters were used

10 6 mol cm3 gabrovšek 2007 a d value of 10 6 cm2 s is assumed as noted in yobbi 1996 due to the presence of scallops and other microtopographies in the conduit walls in florida gulley et al 2011 1 cm

profile was fit using average rock parameters i e a t value of 4 98 10 2 m2 s and a b value of 23 m from these values a minimum error rmse between observed and l model predicted heads of 0 011 m is obtained when a fitted k value of 1 3 10 7 m s is used the leakage parameter values t b and k along with rmse values for cross sections bb ff can be seen in table 1 whereas the cross section profiles

floridan aquifer applying dissolution chemistry to simulate karst conduit evolution allows for the modeling of the conduit geometry and head profiles over time as well as the age of the present conduit features thus there is potential in utilizing karst dissolution chemistry to model existing head profiles to characterize karst systems this information has a potential to improve decision making regarding human activities such as groundwater pumping and other interactions that may indirectly induce sinkhole activity declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have
