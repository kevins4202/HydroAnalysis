9220,reducing ineffective evaporation of soil water is an important way to relieve drought in semi arid rainfed agricultural areas an infiltration hole is a supplemental measure for slope rainwater harvesting measure and is commonly used in vegetation restoration and orchard management of slopes however the evaporation effects of infiltration holes are unclear in this study we determined the evaporation effects of infiltration holes under a high initial soil water content and compared the differences in inhibition of soil evaporation among infiltration holes mulching and their combination after a rainstorm event the results showed that the infiltration holes at different depths increased soil daily evaporation in the first 26 days under the high initial soil water content after which it decreased compared with the control the average daily evaporation while covering the top surface and the hole sidewall and bottom decreased by 74 3 and 4 3 respectively after the rainstorm event cumulative evaporation 97 days significantly decreased by 42 0 and 34 0 under the infiltration hole compared to gravel mulching and branch mulching respectively overall the infiltration hole increased soil evaporation at the early stage soil water mainly evaporated through the top surface of the soil column rather than through the hole itself in the long term after rainstorms infiltration holes have better effects in inhibiting evaporation than mulching our findings determine the evaporation effects of infiltration holes in the process of harvesting rainwater to replenish soil water in semi

and widespread degradation of land carbon sinks schwalm et al 2017 reich et al 2018 humphrey et al 2021 soil water loss alone can reduce gross primary productivity by up to 40 in semi arid and arid regions stocker et al 2018 in the context of global warming soil water is playing an increasingly important role in ensuring food security and promoting sustainable agriculture to achieve the united nations sustainable development goals smith et al 2021 therefore it is necessary to study ways to increase the replenishment of soil water and prevent ineffective water loss precipitation is the ultimate source of soil water miguez macho and fan 2021 and the only source of soil water replenishment for areas with a low underground water table fu et al 2017 wei et al 2019 arid and semi arid areas are generally characterized by low precipitation and intense evaporation and rainwater is insufficient to adequately replenish soil owing to evaporation loss and the demand for plant growth fensholt et al 2012 marek et al 2016 wang et al 2020 more importantly soil evaporation is increasing with global warming berg et al 2017 zastrow 2019 thus reducing the evaporation consumption of soil water replenished by rainfall is an effective approach to retain more water in soils to relive soil drought in arid and semi arid areas slope engineering measures such as terraces fish scale pits and level ditches are usually constructed in slope ecosystems in arid and semi arid areas to intercept and infiltrate slope runoff to reduce the loss of soil and water and promote the growth of plants garcia franco et al 2014 bayen et al 2016 feng et al 2018 infiltration holes have been proven to be an effective supplemental measure to existing slope engineering measures to enhance the interception of slope runoff and improve the utilization of rainwater song et al 2017 cheng et al 2020 wang et al 2021a infiltration holes have been developed and used for vegetation restoration and orchard management of sloping land guo et al 2019 meng et al 2019a 2019b wang et al 2020 infiltration holes are holes that are generally drilled vertically into the ground of existing slope engineering measures into a cylinder or cube rainwater and runoff intercepted by slope engineering rapidly flow into the hole and then directly infiltrate into the root zone via the bottom and sidewall of the infiltration hole rather than the ground surface wang et al 2021a this can increase the availability of rainwater to plants zheng et al 2019 song et al 2020 which is important for plant growth in slope ecosystems in arid and semi arid areas soil evaporation is the transition of soil water from the liquid phase to the vapor phase after which water vapor diffuses into the atmosphere through the evaporation surface wang et al 2019 the evaporation surfaces of infiltration holes are the top surface sidewall and bottom of the hole the infiltration hole increases the evaporation area of the energy exchange between the soil and atmosphere and the increase is related to the diameter and depth of the hole hence the increase in evaporation area using infiltration holes increases the probability of aggravating soil evaporation which may reduce or even reverse the potential benefits of the hole on the water replenishment of deep soil especially in intense evaporation areas however the effects of infiltration holes on soil evaporation remain unclear therefore it is essential to determine the effects of soil evaporation in the presence of infiltration holes previous research has shown that adding mulch to surface land can effectively decrease soil evaporation fan et al 2014 prosdocimi et al 2016 the evaporation effect of the infiltration hole can be reasonably and precisely evaluated by comparing it with that of the mulching measure thus the specific objectives of this study were to 1 quantify the evaporation effects of infiltration holes at different depths 2 determine the evaporation effects under different evaporation channels of infiltration holes and 3 compare the effects of infiltration holes mulching and their combination on soil evaporation after a rainstorm event 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site soil and equipment the experiment was conducted at the institute of soil and water conservation chinese academy of sciences yangling shaanxi province china 108 04 e 34 16 n 439 m a s l the average annual temperature here is 12 9 Âºc the average annual pan evaporation is 1500 mm zhang et al 2022 daily average air temperature and relative air humidity during the experimental period were monitored using an automated weather station fig 1 the soil used in this study was collected from nangou village ansai county yan an city shaanxi province china 109 19 e 36 51 n the soil type was loess soil the soils were air dried at room temperature and passed through a 2 mm sieve the experimental soil consisted of 60 6 sand 0 02 2 mm 20 5 silt 0 002 0 02 mm and 18 9 clay 0 002 mm the experiment was conducted under an outdoor canopy to eliminate the effects of rainfall fig 2a the experimental soil column consisted of a column body composed of polyethylene and a plug composed of polyvinyl chloride fig 2b the soil column had an internal diameter of 23 cm and height of 150 cm the wall of the soil column had a thickness of 1 cm and was used to protect the interior soils from the external environment the bottom of the column was then blocked using a plug a hole diameter 1 cm was placed at the center of the plug the hole was used to exhaust air from the soil column during the process of water infiltration a gauze the same size as the bottom of the soil column was placed at the bottom of the column to prevent soil particles from spilling before filling the soil column vaseline was uniformly daubed on the inner wall of the soil column to eliminate the effects of the dominant water flow of the wall when filling the soil column the soil bulk density in the column and the height of the filling soils were controlled at 1 3 g cm 3 and 120 cm respectively the soil was filled into the column via layered filling the filling thickness of each layer was 5 cm and the surface of the filled layer was roughened via a brush to avoid structural and hydrodynamic changes between layers 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 evaporation effects of the infiltration holes with different depths infiltration holes at four depths were constructed to estimate their evaporation effects 20 cm ih20 40 cm ih40 60 cm ih60 and 80 cm ih80 and treatment without infiltration holes ih0 used for comparison the evaporation areas under ih0 ih20 ih40 ih60 and ih80 were 415 729 1043 1357 and 1671 cm2 respectively three replicates were used for each treatment the infiltration holes were drilled vertically at the center of the surface of the soil column using an auger with an internal diameter of 5 cm fig 2c before building the infiltration hole the initial soil water content in all the experimental columns was controlled to the field capacity of the experimental soil 18 9 using irrigation method every column was irrigated with water exceeding the field capacity subsequently the surface of the soil column was sealed with plastic wrap to prevent the evaporation of water after the gravitational water was drained the soil water content in the soil column was controlled to the field capacity the experimental period was from august 18 2021 to november 22 2021 soil water evaporation was measured as the reduction of water in the column all experimental columns were weighed using a custom made device and electronic scale fig 2d on days 2 4 6 11 16 21 26 31 52 79 and 96 after evaporation the process of weighing all soil columns was completed before 8 00 a m to decrease the effects caused by changes in air temperature due to sun irradiation 2 2 2 evaporation effects under the different evaporation channels of infiltration hole the evaporation channels of the infiltration hole consist of the top surface sidewall and bottom of the hole an infiltration hole was used as a supplemental measure for slope rainwater harvesting under field conditions slope runoff contains a large amount of sediment the overflow of sediments in the infiltration hole should be considered an important problem to be solved the usable time of the infiltration hole increased with the construction depth thus the diameter and depth of the infiltration holes in this experiment were 5 and 80 cm respectively five treatments were conducted for the experiment fig 2e including a hole without any cover ih covered top surface of the soil column ih sc covered sidewall and bottom of the hole ih hc covered top surface and sidewall of the hole ih sc hwc and covered top surface and bottom of the hole ih sc hbc three replicates were used for each treatment a thin iron sheet with strong thermal conductivity was used as the cover material to reduce the effects of the material on the heat exchange between the soil and atmosphere the initial soil water content experimental period measurement dates and method of soil evaporation were the same as those described in section 2 2 1 2 2 3 effects of infiltration hole mulching and their combination on soil evaporation the evaporation effect of the infiltration hole was evaluated by comparing it with the mulching effect after a rainstorm event six treatments were conducted for the experiment fig 2f including treatment without infiltration holes ck with infiltration holes ih gravel mulching gm branch mulching bm combination of infiltration holes and gravel mulching ih gm and combination of infiltration holes and branch mulching ih bm three replicates were used for each treatment the diameter and depth of the infiltration holes were 5 and 80 cm respectively gravel 1 3 cm in diameter 1 3 kg weight and 2 2 5 cm thick when spread and branch 2 3 cm in length 0 26 kg weight and 3 cm thick when spread were used to completely cover the top surface of the soil column for the combined measures a square plastic mesh with a side length of 6 cm was placed at the orifice of the infiltration hole to protect the gravel and branch from falling into the hole which did not affect the water flow from the surface into the hole the initial soil water content was controlled by the water content under air drying conditions 0 8 the rainfall process of a rainstorm of 100 mm h 1 was simulated using a sprinkler the experimental period was from august 17 2021 to november 22 2021 all experimental columns were weighed on days 2 4 6 8 14 20 26 32 53 80 and 97 after evaporation the soil evaporation measurement method was the same as that described in section 2 2 1 2 3 data

discussion 4 1 infiltration holes with different depths increased first and then reduced soil evaporation under a high initial soil water content water loss from the soil surface via evaporation is an essential component of the terrestrial water cycle xiang et al 2021 evaporation area is an important factor that affects the soil evaporation process zhang et al 2021 infiltration holes with different depths are often constructed to satisfy the demands of management practice song et al 2017 which increases the surface area of evaporation and leads to different effects in the soil water evaporation process in this study the infiltration holes at different depths increased the daily evaporation in the first 26 days and subsequently decreased it fig 3 soil evaporation depends on the soil water supply capacity wang et al 2019 2021b the initial soil water content in this study was controlled by the field capacity 18 9 thus soil water supply was not a limiting factor in the early stage of evaporation and soil evaporation was mainly controlled by the atmospheric environment the infiltration holes increased the area of heat exchange between the soil surface and the atmosphere which resulted in an increase in daily evaporation in the first 26 days the results based on multiple linear regression showed that the daily soil evaporation under the infiltration holes was more sensitive to air temperature and relative air humidity than the control table 2 after day 26 with a decrease in soil water content the soil water supply capacity gradually became the key factor affecting soil evaporation part of the soil needed to be removed to build the infiltration hole in the soil column the presence of infiltration holes disrupted the water conduction channel and the infiltration holes weakened the conduction of the soil water that needed to move from deeper soil to the evaporation surface and diffuse into the atmosphere the decrease in soil water and disruption of the water conduction channel in the soil column were responsible for the decrease in the daily evaporation of infiltration holes in the later stage of evaporation daily evaporation did not increase with an increase in the depth of the infiltration hole a possible reason for this is that the effects of the atmospheric environment on the microenvironment inside the infiltration hole were gradually attenuated with an increasing depth of the infiltration hole despite this we found that the cumulative evaporation during the entire experimental period gradually decreased with the depth of the infiltration hole and no statistical difference in cumulative evaporation was detected between the control and infiltration hole with a depth of 80 cm fig 3 the results were based on the experimental conditions for high initial soil water content in practice the initial soil water content is usually lower than the field capacity therefore the evaporation effects of infiltration holes at different depths may be much weaker than the results in this study the loss of soil water evaporation owing to the construction of the infiltration hole decreased with the depth of the infiltration hole however the economic cost and difficulty of constructing infiltration holes increase with construction depth in summary using an infiltration hole with a depth of 80 cm under field management can effectively reduce the loss of water evaporation caused by the construction of an infiltration hole 4 2 soil water mainly evaporated through the top surface of the soil column the construction of infiltration holes increases the soil evaporation surface the evaporation surfaces of the infiltration hole consist of the top surface sidewall and bottom of the hole in this study soil water mainly evaporated through the top surface rather than through the hole itself fig 4 a thin iron sheet with strong thermal conductivity was used as the cover material on the top surface thus it was difficult to affect the heat exchange between the soil and atmosphere covering the top surface blocked the diffusion of water vapor to the atmosphere which may be the main reason for the decrease in soil evaporation the hole itself the sidewall and bottom had a large evaporation area but the evaporation effect of the hole was much lower than that of the top surface this might be because the infiltration hole was constructed by vertical drilling on the ground and the evaporation surface of the hole itself was hardly affected by direct solar radiation thus the effects of the atmospheric environment in the hole on soil evaporation were much weaker the results based on the multiple linear regression showed that the sensitivity of soil daily evaporation in response to air temperature and relative humidity decreased under treatments that covered the top surface of the soil column table 2 furthermore the evaporation effects of the sidewall and bottom of the hole were further analyzed by covering the top surface the results showed that covering the sidewall could effectively reduce soil evaporation but covering the bottom was not effective in decreasing evaporation fig 4 for the infiltration hole with a depth of 80 cm and diameter of 5 cm the evaporation areas of the sidewall and bottom were 1256 and 19 6 cm2 respectively thus the different effects of the sidewall and bottom in reducing soil evaporation can be ascribed to the differences in their evaporation areas overall the results show that covering the top and sidewalls of the hole is the most effective measure to reduce soil evaporation and conserve soil water however considering the cost of the cover material and the complexity of covering the sidewall of the infiltration hole under field conditions covering only the top surface of the infiltration hole should be a reasonable choice for field management practice 4 3 effects of infiltration hole mulching and their combination on reducing soil evaporation after the rainstorm event reducing ineffective soil evaporation is an important method to enhance the effective utilization of rainfall the addition of mulch to the soil surface is a common method for reducing ineffective evaporation and retaining more soil water fan et al 2014 kader et al 2017 combining infiltration holes with slope engineering measures has proven to be an effective measure to improve the water environment of deep soil zheng et al 2019 wang et al 2021a in this study all the infiltration holes mulching and their combinations effectively reduced soil evaporation after the rainstorm event fig 5 the results based on the multiple linear regression showed that all measures decreased the sensitivity of daily soil evaporation in response to air temperature and relative humidity table 2 mulching can prevent direct solar radiation and reduce soil evaporation by setting physical barrier layers on the soil surface zribi et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 an infiltration hole can rapidly transport rainwater into the hole and infiltrate rainwater into the deeper soil layer via the bottom and sidewall of the hole rather than just through the top surface song et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 wang et al 2021a the results showed that the infiltration hole was more effective in reducing soil evaporation than mulching after day 6 after a rainstorm event the infiltration hole can transport rainfall into the hole but part of the rainfall can still be retained in the shallow soils therefore the shallow soils had high water content under all treatments in the early evaporation period day 0 6 compared with an infiltration hole mulching could effectively inhibit soil evaporation by reducing the heat exchange between soil and atmosphere and weakening the effects of the atmospheric environment on the soil surface with the decrease in the shallow soil water content after day 6 the water supply to shallow soil under the infiltration hole was not sufficient to satisfy the evaporation demand of the atmospheric environment however after day 6 the shallow soil under the mulching still had adequate soil water supply capacity in general combining mulching with an infiltration hole should have a greater effect on reducing soil evaporation than an infiltration hole alone the daily evaporation was higher under the combined measure than under the single infiltration hole after day 14 fig 5 a possible reason for this may be that the addition of gravel or branches on the top surface of the infiltration hole prevented parts of rainwater from flowing into the hole and more rainwater was conserved in the surface soil rather than the bottom of the hole thus the shallow soils under the combined measure still had water to be evaporated when the water in the shallow soils under a single infiltration hole had difficulty satisfying the demand for atmospheric evaporation the effects of reducing soil evaporation also depend on the mulching material in this study the cumulative evaporation was always significantly lower under branch mulching than under gravel mulching fig 5 the coverage was 100 under mulching measures gravel blocked more water from infiltrating into soils and retained it at the soil surface compared with branches after the rainstorm event which led to increase evaporation loss of water under gravel mulching although the daily evaporation under the infiltration hole was the lowest among all treatments after day 14 the cumulative evaporation during the entire experimental period was not significantly different between the infiltration hole and the combination of the infiltration hole and branch mulching fig 5 this was because of the high consumption of soil water in the first six days under the infiltration hole in summary in the short term after a rainstorm single infiltration holes were prone to losing large amounts of water under intense evaporation at this stage both mulching and the combination of mulching and infiltration holes had better effects on reducing soil evaporation than the infiltration hole alone however in the long term after rainstorms the effects of reducing evaporation were greater under infiltration holes than under mulching at any time the combination of infiltration holes and branch mulching was the most effective measure to decrease ineffective evaporation and conserve soil water after rainfall it is worth noting that the bottom of the hole was only 40 cm from the bottom of the soil column in this study and the rainwater transported and infiltrated to the bottom of the hole was stored only in the soil profile of 40 cm in fact under field conditions rainwater may rapidly and directly infiltrate into the deeper soil layer via the bottom and sidewall of the hole rather than just being stored in the soil profile of 40 cm hence the effects of using the infiltration hole to reduce soil evaporation may have been underestimated in this study and the results need to be verified through further field experiments 5 conclusion our results showed that infiltration holes increased soil daily evaporation in the first 26 days under high initial soil water content and subsequently reduced it the daily evaporation under the infiltration hole did not increase with increasing depth the 80 cm depth infiltration hole did not significantly aggravate the cumulative soil evaporation the top surface of the soil column was the primary channel for evaporation loss of soil water the hole itself had little effect on soil evaporation with the sidewall of the hole having a greater effect than the bottom all infiltration holes mulching and their combinations significantly decreased soil evaporation after the rainstorm event in the short term after the rainstorm the effects of reducing evaporation were greater under mulching than under infiltration hole however in the long term the infiltration hole better inhibited evaporation than mulching throughout the experiment the combination of infiltration holes and branch mulching was the most effective measure to decrease ineffective evaporation and conserve soil water after rainfall our findings revealed the

silt 0 002 0 02 mm and 18 9 clay 0 002 mm the experiment was conducted under an outdoor canopy to eliminate the effects of rainfall fig 2a the experimental soil column consisted of a column body composed of polyethylene and a plug composed of polyvinyl chloride fig 2b the soil column had an internal diameter of 23 cm and height of 150 cm the wall of the soil column had a thickness of 1 cm and was used to protect the interior soils from the external environment the bottom of the column was then blocked using a plug a hole diameter 1 cm was placed at the center of the plug the hole was used to exhaust air from the soil column during the process of water infiltration a gauze the same size as the bottom of the soil column was placed at the bottom of the column to prevent soil particles from spilling before filling the soil column vaseline was uniformly daubed on the inner wall of the soil column to eliminate the effects of the dominant water flow of the wall when filling the soil column the soil bulk density in the column and the height of the filling soils were controlled at 1 3 g cm 3 and 120 cm respectively the soil was filled into the column via layered filling the filling thickness of each layer was 5 cm and the surface of the filled layer was roughened via a brush to avoid structural and hydrodynamic changes between layers 2 2 experimental design 2 2 1 evaporation

each treatment the infiltration holes were drilled vertically at the center of the surface of the soil column using an auger with an internal diameter of 5 cm fig 2c before building the infiltration hole the initial soil water content in all the experimental columns was controlled to the field capacity of the experimental soil 18 9 using irrigation method every column was irrigated with water exceeding the field capacity subsequently the surface of the soil column was sealed with plastic wrap to prevent the evaporation of water after the gravitational water was drained the soil water content in the soil column was controlled to the field capacity the experimental period was from august 18 2021 to november 22 2021 soil water evaporation was measured as the reduction of water in the column all experimental columns were weighed using a custom made device and electronic scale fig 2d on days 2 4 6 11 16 21 26 31 52 79 and 96 after evaporation the process of weighing all soil columns was completed before 8 00 a m to decrease the effects caused by changes in air temperature due to sun irradiation 2 2 2 evaporation effects under the different evaporation channels of infiltration hole the evaporation channels of the infiltration hole consist of the top surface sidewall and bottom of the hole an infiltration hole was used as a supplemental measure for slope rainwater harvesting under field conditions slope runoff contains a large amount of sediment the overflow of sediments in the infiltration hole should be considered an important problem to be solved the usable time of the infiltration hole increased with the construction depth thus the diameter and depth of the infiltration holes in this experiment were 5 and 80 cm respectively five treatments were conducted for the experiment fig 2e including a hole without any cover ih covered top surface of the soil column ih sc covered sidewall and bottom of the hole ih hc covered top surface and sidewall of the hole ih sc hwc and covered top surface and bottom of the hole ih sc hbc three replicates were used for each treatment a thin iron sheet with strong thermal conductivity was used as the cover material to reduce

thick when spread were used to completely cover the top surface of the soil column for the combined measures a square plastic mesh with a side length of 6 cm was placed at the orifice of the infiltration hole to protect the gravel and branch from falling into the hole which did not affect the water flow from the surface into the hole the initial soil water content was controlled by the water content under air drying conditions 0 8 the rainfall process of a rainstorm of 100 mm h 1 was simulated using a sprinkler the experimental period was from august 17 2021 to november 22 2021 all

discussion 4 1 infiltration holes with different depths increased first and then reduced soil evaporation under a high initial soil water content water loss from the soil surface via evaporation is an essential component of the terrestrial water cycle xiang et al 2021 evaporation area is an important factor that affects the soil evaporation process zhang et al 2021 infiltration holes with different depths are often constructed to satisfy the demands of management practice song et al 2017 which increases the surface area of evaporation and leads to different effects in the soil water evaporation process in this study the infiltration holes at different depths increased the daily evaporation in the first 26 days and subsequently decreased it fig 3 soil evaporation depends on the soil water supply capacity wang et al 2019 2021b the initial soil water content in this study was controlled by the field capacity 18 9 thus soil water supply was not a limiting factor in the early stage of evaporation and soil evaporation was mainly controlled by the atmospheric environment the infiltration holes increased the area of heat exchange between the soil surface and the atmosphere which resulted in an increase in daily evaporation in the first 26 days the results based on multiple linear regression showed that the daily soil evaporation under the infiltration holes was more sensitive to air temperature and relative air humidity than the control table 2 after day 26 with a decrease in soil water content the soil water supply capacity gradually became the key factor affecting soil evaporation part of the soil needed to be removed to build the infiltration hole in the soil column the presence of infiltration holes disrupted the water conduction channel and the infiltration holes weakened the conduction of the soil water that needed to move from deeper soil to the evaporation surface and diffuse into the atmosphere the decrease in soil water and disruption of the water conduction channel in the soil column were responsible for the decrease in the daily evaporation of infiltration holes in the later stage of evaporation daily evaporation did not increase with an increase in the depth of the infiltration hole a possible reason for this is that the effects of the atmospheric environment on the microenvironment inside the infiltration hole were gradually attenuated with an increasing depth of the infiltration hole despite this we found that the cumulative evaporation during the entire experimental period gradually decreased with the depth of the infiltration hole and no statistical difference in cumulative evaporation was detected between the control and infiltration hole with a depth of 80 cm fig 3 the results were based on the experimental conditions for high initial soil water content in practice the initial soil water content is usually lower than the field capacity therefore the evaporation effects of infiltration holes at different depths may be much weaker than the results in this study the loss of soil water evaporation owing to the construction of the infiltration hole decreased with the depth of the infiltration hole however the economic cost and difficulty of constructing infiltration holes increase with construction depth in summary using an infiltration hole with a depth of 80 cm under field management can effectively reduce the loss of water evaporation caused by the construction of an infiltration hole 4 2 soil water mainly evaporated through the top surface of the soil column the construction of infiltration holes increases the soil evaporation surface the evaporation surfaces of the infiltration hole consist of the top surface sidewall and bottom of the hole in this study soil water mainly evaporated through the top surface rather than through the hole itself fig 4 a thin iron sheet with strong thermal conductivity was used as the cover material on the top surface thus it was difficult to affect the heat exchange between the soil and atmosphere covering the top surface blocked the diffusion of water vapor to the atmosphere which may be the main reason for the decrease in soil evaporation the hole itself the sidewall and bottom had a large evaporation area but the evaporation effect of the hole was much lower than that of the top surface this might be because the infiltration hole was constructed by vertical drilling on the ground and the evaporation surface of the hole itself was hardly affected by direct solar radiation thus the effects of the atmospheric environment in the hole on soil evaporation were much weaker the results based on the multiple linear regression showed that the sensitivity of soil daily evaporation in response to air temperature and relative humidity decreased under treatments that covered the top surface of the soil column table 2 furthermore the evaporation effects of the sidewall and bottom of the hole were further analyzed by covering the top surface the results showed that covering the sidewall could effectively reduce soil evaporation but covering the bottom was not effective in decreasing evaporation fig 4 for the infiltration hole with a depth of 80 cm and diameter of 5 cm the evaporation areas of the sidewall and bottom were 1256 and 19 6 cm2 respectively thus the different effects of the sidewall and bottom in reducing soil evaporation can be ascribed to the differences in their evaporation areas overall the results show that covering the top and sidewalls of the hole is the most effective measure to reduce soil evaporation and conserve soil water however considering the cost of the cover material and the complexity of covering the sidewall of the infiltration hole under field conditions covering only the top surface of the infiltration hole should be a reasonable choice for field management practice 4 3 effects of infiltration hole mulching and their combination on reducing soil evaporation after the rainstorm event reducing ineffective soil evaporation is an important method to enhance the effective utilization of rainfall the addition of mulch to the soil surface is a common method for reducing ineffective evaporation and retaining more soil water fan et al 2014 kader et al 2017 combining infiltration holes with slope engineering measures has proven to be an effective measure to improve the water environment of deep soil zheng et al 2019 wang et al 2021a in this study all the infiltration holes mulching and their combinations effectively reduced soil evaporation after the rainstorm event fig 5 the results based on the multiple linear regression showed that all measures decreased the sensitivity of daily soil evaporation in response to air temperature and relative humidity table 2 mulching can prevent direct solar radiation and reduce soil evaporation by setting physical barrier layers on the soil surface zribi et al 2015 zheng et al 2019 an infiltration hole can rapidly transport rainwater into the hole and infiltrate rainwater into the deeper soil layer via the bottom and sidewall of the hole rather than just through the top surface song et al 2017 zheng et al 2019 wang et al 2021a the results showed that the infiltration hole was more effective in reducing soil evaporation than mulching after day 6 after a rainstorm event the infiltration hole can transport rainfall into the hole but part of the rainfall can still be retained in the shallow soils therefore the shallow soils had high water content under all treatments in the early evaporation period day 0 6 compared with an infiltration hole mulching could effectively inhibit soil evaporation by reducing the heat exchange between soil and atmosphere and weakening the effects of the atmospheric environment on the soil surface with the decrease in the shallow soil water content after day 6 the water supply to shallow soil under the infiltration hole was not sufficient to satisfy the evaporation demand of the atmospheric environment however after day 6 the shallow soil under the mulching still had adequate soil water supply capacity in general combining mulching with an infiltration hole should have a greater effect on reducing soil evaporation than an infiltration hole alone the daily evaporation was higher under the combined measure than under the single infiltration hole after day 14 fig 5 a possible reason for this may be that the addition of gravel or branches on the top surface of the infiltration hole prevented parts of rainwater from flowing into the hole and more rainwater was conserved in the surface soil rather than the bottom of the hole thus the shallow soils under the combined measure still had water to be evaporated when the water in the shallow soils under a single infiltration hole had difficulty satisfying the demand for atmospheric evaporation the effects of reducing soil evaporation also depend on the mulching material in this study the cumulative evaporation was always significantly lower under branch mulching than under gravel mulching fig 5 the coverage was 100 under mulching measures gravel blocked more water from infiltrating into soils and retained it at the soil surface compared with branches after the rainstorm event which led to increase evaporation loss of water under gravel mulching although the daily evaporation under the infiltration hole was the lowest among all treatments after day 14 the cumulative evaporation during the entire experimental period was not significantly different between the infiltration hole and the combination of the infiltration hole and branch mulching fig 5 this was because of the high consumption of soil water in the first six days under the infiltration hole in summary in the short term after a rainstorm single infiltration holes were prone to losing large amounts of water under intense evaporation at this stage both mulching and the combination of mulching and infiltration holes had better effects on reducing soil evaporation than the infiltration hole alone however in the long term after rainstorms the effects of reducing evaporation were greater under infiltration holes than under mulching at any time the combination of infiltration holes and branch mulching was the most effective measure to decrease ineffective evaporation and conserve soil water after rainfall it is worth noting that the bottom of the hole was only 40 cm from the bottom of the soil column in this study and the rainwater transported and infiltrated to the bottom of the hole was stored only in the soil profile of 40 cm in fact under field conditions rainwater may rapidly and directly infiltrate into the deeper soil layer via the bottom and sidewall of the hole rather than just being stored in the soil profile of 40 cm hence the effects of using the infiltration hole to reduce soil evaporation may have been underestimated in this study and the results need to be verified through further field experiments 5 conclusion our results showed that infiltration holes increased soil daily evaporation in the first 26 days under high initial soil water content and subsequently reduced it the daily evaporation under the infiltration hole did not increase with increasing depth the 80 cm depth infiltration hole did not significantly aggravate the cumulative soil evaporation the top surface of the soil column was the primary channel for evaporation loss of soil water the hole itself had little effect on soil evaporation with the sidewall of the hole having a greater effect than the bottom all infiltration holes mulching and their combinations significantly decreased soil evaporation after the rainstorm event in the short term after the rainstorm the effects of reducing evaporation were greater under mulching than under infiltration hole however in the long term the infiltration hole better inhibited evaporation than mulching throughout the experiment the combination of infiltration holes and branch mulching was the most effective measure to decrease ineffective evaporation and conserve soil water after rainfall our findings revealed the evaporation effects of infiltration holes in the process of effectively utilizing rainwater to replenish soil water in arid and semi arid rainfed agricultural areas declaration of competing interest

9221,crop simulation models are still little used for sugarcane crops due to the lack of understanding of their capabilities and experience in calibration as compared to other crops realistic assessment of future environmental change effects on crop production is also necessary for successful agricultural management and planning the objective of this study is to provide dssat canegro

rainfall temperature relative humidity sunshine hours etc or time independent previous land use soil type soil depth topography etc bÃ©guÃ© et al 2008 crop modelling potentially can contribute to nutrition and global food security mehrabi and sepaskhah 2020 crop simulation models are computer based software application tools which are used to evaluate the effect of agronomic hydrologic edaphic and climatic factors on crop growth and yield these models are quantitative tools based on scientific knowledge that conceptually present a simplified crop production system crop simulation models have been developed by understanding the interaction of all underlying environmental conditions and plant growth processes as well as factors of weather soil pests irrigation and other management practices that affect plant growth and yield battisti et al 2018 therefore they can be used for local and global applications under different management conditions which may not be possible through empirical or regression modelling the general indication with respect to the use of simulation models in crop yield forecasting is that the models hold promise as a tool for the future the accuracy of the method depends partly on the adequacy of the crop model and partly on the technique used to complete the seasonal data record duchon 1986 model outputs should be verified during the development phase of a forecasting system using accurate data from the area the crop yield simulation model is an important tool for planners scientists and farm managers it can predict yield under different soil

from 2012 13 to 2016 17 and estimated the genetic coefficient for sugarcane variety co 99004 and co 86032 by using the glue program inbuilt package of dssat software poor model estimates may not entirely be due to the functional relations that are involved in the model but may also be due to errors associated with input parameters the successful application of any crop growth model for indian conditions should invariably consider both these aspects because of varied agro climatic and physiographic conditions therefore a sensitivity analysis for some input parameters were carried out in various studies marin et al 2013 and singels et al 2014 used sugarcane models to evaluate sugarcane yield responses to future climate situations ramachandran et al 2017 has utilized the canegro

five years from 1979 to 2013 was averaged to create a single weather file for the year 2013 this data were considered as baseline data to obtain a base yield this research work has been performed with the canegro model under the given inputs of weather soil and crop genetic coefficients for a particular management practice defined in the experimental treatments all packages of practices soil parameters file and other input files were remain same other than weather parameter file to predict the effects of climate variables alone on sugarcane yield impact assessment of climate change in yield of sugarcane has been made putting different values of tmax Âºc tmin Âºc solar radiation mj m2 day and co2 levels ppm in the model as the higher yielded variety cose 98231 and lower yielded variety cos 767 have been taken for analysis so the base yield for cose 98231 and cos 767 are obtained 845 6 qt ha 688 7 qt ha respectively the planting date 15th march 2013 and harvesting date 5th february 2014 are used for this simulation 4 results 4 1 models calibration and validation in order to calibrate the canegro model field experiments were performed at twelve locations of muzaffarnagar district under three different dates of planting i e 2nd february 2013 early planting 15th march 2013 mid planting and 28th april 2013 late planting data on growth development and yield were recorded for each planting date during field visits and created 180 treatment combinations using five sugarcane varieties at twelve different locations thereafter the canegro model was executed using actual crop management soil weather data and genetic coefficient data the canegro simulated sugarcane yield for the variety cos 767 cose 95422 cos 8436 cose 92423 and cose 98231 during the spring season 2013 2014 is presented in table 4 to validate the performance of the model input data required by the canegro were provided for two consecutive years 2014 15 and 2015 16 and sugarcane district level yield data were used for validation the twelve different locations sugarcane yield data were collected during field visits while the district level data were collected from the directorate of agriculture lucknow uttar pradesh the canegro simulated variety wise sugarcane yield for the entire district during spring season 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 are presented in table 5 the generated models are calibrated and validated under the three different dates of planting 4 2 models accuracy assessment to evaluate the performance of canegro model different statistical indicators such as percent deviation coefficient of determination r2 correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute percent error mape and willmott index of agreement d are used for the accuracy assessment of model results the coefficient of determination r2 between observed and simulated sugarcane yield for twelve different locations of muzaffarnagar district 2014 15 and 2015 16 is presented in fig 4 and the other parameters r rmse mape and d are shown in fig 5 in fig 4 r2 values between observed and predicted yield for the year 2014 15 is 0 60 0 66 and 0 62 for three simulation models i e early mid and late planting sugarcane respectively similar r2 values were found for the year 2015 16 as 0 62 for early planting model 0 70 for mid planting model and 0 57 for late planting model correlation represents the relationship between two quantitative variables and the values of correlation coefficient r varies from 1 to 1 in this study r values fig 5a between observed and predicted sugarcane yield were found as 0 77 0 81 0 78 year 2014 15 and as 0 78 0 83 0 75 year 2015 16 for early mid and late planting models respectively in addition the performance of the models was also evaluated by rmse and mape parameters rmse is the square root of the variance of the residuals that indicates the absolute fit of the model to the data how close the observed data points are to the model s predicted values the mean absolute percentage error mape is one of the most commonly used kpis key performance indicator to measure forecast accuracy it is the sum of the individual absolute errors divided by the demand each period separately that measures the deviation in terms of from the actual data the rmse values are 10 4 q ha 1 for early planting 8 37 q ha 1 for mid planting and 12 29 q ha 1 for late planting for the year 2014 15 while these were 22 21 q ha 1 for early planting 10 7 q ha 1 for mid planting and 12 64 q ha 1 for late planting for the year 2015 16 fig 5b in this study very low mape values were observed for all three planting models the ranges varies between 1 10 and 1 90 and 1 30 3 10 for the year 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively fig 5c willmott index of agreement d is a measure of the degree of model prediction error and its value ranges between 0 indicates no agreement to 1 indicates a perfect match this represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error and can also detect additive and proportional differences in the observed and simulated means and variances it is seen in fig 5 d that the values of d ranges between 0 81 and 0 88 for the year 2014 15 and between 0 69 and 0 91 for the year 2015 16 respectively this index value is highest for the mid planting models 0 88 for 2014 15 0 91 for 2015 16 as compared to early and late planting models which indicates that the canegro model can be used for sugarcane yield simulation with relatively good accuracy the sugarcane yield simulation by mid planting model was found to be better presenting the highest r 0 81 0 83 and d 0 88 0 91 and the lowest errors rmse 8 37 q ha 1 10 70 q ha 1 and mape 1 10 1 30 for the years 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively as compared to the other two models the district level predicted sugarcane yield by canegro model shows the percent error ranges from 2 80 to 31 64 the model gave percent error from 8 62 to 9 60 for early planting 20 13 to 31 64 for late planting and 2 80 to 5 20 for mid planting the yield estimation for the mid planting model thus proved superior over early and late planting models table 6 the simulated sugarcane yield of different varieties during 2013 14 2014 15 and 2015 16 are presented in fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 climate change impact on yield the climate scenario simulated for maximum temperature 1 to 3 Âºc minimum temperature 1 to 3 Âºc solar radiation 1 to 3 mj m2 day and 500 ppm 720 ppm against present co2 concentration of 380 ppm looking for the complexity in climatic pattern the yield was simulated due to change in individual parameters table 7 and in combination with other parameters table 8 5 2 effect of tmax on yield the canegro model simulated yield under incremental values of tmax in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc which shows gradual decrement in the yield range of 677 6 664 0 qt ha 1 0 09 0 33 and 2 09 of base yield for variety cos 767 we observed that the response for incremental values of tmax is similar for variety cose 98231 except that there is a higher reduction in yield as compared to variety cos 767 for variety cose 98231 the yield is decreasing in the range of 824 0 798 2 qt ha 1 1 03 2 34 and 4 13 of base yield similarly in case of gradual downscale of tmax in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc we have noticed an incremental pattern in yield ranging from 682 4 to 692 3 qt ha 1 0 62 1 16 and 2 08 of base yield for variety cos 767 in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc the variety cose 98231 yield is also increasing in the range of 843 6 857 1 qt ha 1 1 32 2 07 and 2 94 of base yield the results show that the variety cose 98231 is more sensitive to the maximum temperature change as compared to variety cos 767 5 3 effect of tmin on yield the increment of tmin in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc shows gradual decrement in the yield range of 670 2 642 2 qt ha 1 1 18 2 64 and 5 31 of base yield for variety cos 767 the same results were obtained for the variety cose 98231 the yield decreases in the range of 822 5 793 2 qt ha 1 1 21 2 68 and 4 73 of base yield we have noticed that the yield decrement is maximum at the 3 Âºc for both the variety in case of downscaling of tmin from 1 to 2 Âºc the sugarcane variety cos 767 yield increases from 680 3 to 683 3 qt ha 1 0 31 to 0 75 of base yield while it decreased by 1 64 of base yield 678 2 qt ha 1 at 3 Âºc the cose 98231 variety yield is gradually increasing in the range of 844 6 857 6 qt ha 1 1 44 2 16 and 3 00 of base yield for the scale of tmin 1 to 3 Âºc 5 4 effect of solar radiation on yield for both the varieties gradual increment of solar radiation from 1 to 3 mjm 2day 1 showed a yield increment 8 82 16 48 and 23 49 of base yield for cos 767 and 7 23 13 86 and 19 66 of base yield for cose 98231 in case of decrement of solar radiation from 1 to 3 mjm 2day 1 reverse trend was noticed the maximum increment in yield was reported 23 49 of base yield for variety cos 767 at 3 mjm 2day 1 whereas the maximum reduction in yield was noticed 27 13 of base yield for variety cos 767 with reduction of solar radiation by 3 mjm 2day 1 the results indicate that both the sugarcane varieties are very sensitive to the solar radiation effect but the variety cos 767 is more sensible as compared to cose 98231 5 5 effect of co2 concentration on yield increased levels of co2 directly affected crop species which changes the crop physical structures and in turn affects crop growth and yield water use efficiency ritchie and otter 1985 and susceptibility to insect pests and diseases mitchell et al 2003 paherson 1993 the impact of increasing co2 concentration in the level of 720 ppm and 500 ppm as their base value of 380 ppm showed a gradual increment in sugarcane yield for both the variety in the high emission a2 scenario for co2 concentration of 720 ppm variety cos 767 and cose 98231 yield were increased by 5 69 and 6 02 of base yield respectively in case of b2 low emission scenario co2 concentration of 550 ppm the yield is incrementing by 3 34 for variety cos 767 and 3 39 for variety cose 98231 5 6 combined effect of tmax and tmin on yield both the tmax and tmin temperatures are changed in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc and their simulated yield levels are compared with base yield table 5 the canegro model yield of sugarcane under incremental units of tmax and tmin 1 to 3 Âºc showed a gradual decrement in yield ranging from 667 5 to 606 6 qt ha 1 1 58 5 06 and 10 56 of base yield for variety cos 767 the similar decreasing yield pattern was noticed for the variety cose 98231 having ranges from 811 8 to 726 7 qt ha 1 2 50 6 73 and 12 72 of base yield other combinations did not show any significant trend the drastically yield reduction was observed at 3 Âºc for variety cos 767 5 7 combined effect of tmax tmin and solar radiation on yield maximum temperature tmax minimum temperatures tmin and solar radiation are altered in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc and their yield was compared with base yield table 5 the maximum increment of yield was reported at 2 Âºc for both the variety the variety cos 767 and cose 98231 yield were increased by 9 75 and 4 46 of base yield respectively the maximum yield reduction was noticed at 3 Âºc the yield is decreased by 39 47 variety cos 767 and 31 10 variety cose 98231 of base yield the yield is drastically decreasing at 2 Âºc and 3 Âºc 6 conclusions the dssat canegro was able to simulate sugarcane yield fairly realistically when compared with the observed yield these models were successfully calibrated and validated for the muzaffarnagar district under three different dates of planting sugarcane yield simulation mid planting model presented the highest r 0 81 0 83 and d 0 88 0 91 and the lowest errors rmse 8 37 q ha 1 10 70 q ha 1 and mape 1 10 1 30 for the years 2014 15 and 2015 16 as compared to the other two models the mid planted sugarcane district level yields percent error ranged from 2 80 to 5 20 which is the minimum among all the three planting models the results revealed that the mid planting model 3rd week of march gives higher sugarcane yield as compared to the early and late planting models sugarcane requires about 25 32 Âºc for good germination therefore early before 2 fn of february and late planting after 1 fn of april may be the cause of yield loss due to low and high temperatures respectively the genetic potential of a crop variety also plays an important role in determining the yield some varieties have a high yield potential while others have lower the canegro model simulated the yield for the five sugarcane varieties namely cos 767 cose 95422 cos 8436 cose 92423 and cose 98231 results showed that the variety cose 98231 produces higher yields whereas variety cos 767 gives the lowest yield for all three planting dates therefore varieties cose 98231 cose 95422 cose 92423 are recommended for sugarcane growers and sugar industries for higher cane yield sensitivity analysis has been also successfully performed for chhapar site location to understand the effect of climate variability on sugarcane yield canegro model was simulated for single weather parameters solar radiation tmax tmin as well as combinations of these parameters this study indicates that the canegro model simulated yield under incremental values of tmax and tmin in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc shows gradual decrement in the yield ranges for both the sugarcane varieties while gradual increment of solar radiation from 1 to 3 mj m2 day showed a yield increment 8 82 16 48 and 23 49 of base yield for cos 767 and 7 23 13 86 and 19 66 of base yield for cose 98231 the study highlighted that the generated sugarcane yield model is sensitive to the solar radiation maximum temperature minimum temperature and co2 concentration levels

9221,crop simulation models are still little used for sugarcane crops due to the lack of understanding of their capabilities and experience in calibration as compared to other crops realistic assessment of future environmental change effects on crop production is also necessary for successful agricultural management and planning the objective of this study is to provide dssat canegro simulated variety wise sugarcane yield models for twelve different locations of muzaffarnagar district of india the canegro model calibration is performed under three different dates of planting early mid late during the spring season 2013 2014 the results of the models are validated for consecutive two years datasets 2014 15 and 2015 16 the model shows the best calibration and validation results under the mid planting date scenario simulated yield 0 85 2 80 and 5 20 the impact of climate change sensitivity analysis on yield of sugarcane has also been made putting different values of tmax 1 to 3 Âºc tmin 1 to 3 Âºc solar radiation 1 to 3mj m2 day and atmospheric co2 concentration of 380 ppm 720 ppm scenario a2 500 ppm scenario b2 the study highlighted that sugarcane yield simulation mid planting model presenting the highest r 0 81 0 83 and d 0 88 0 91 and the lowest errors rmse 8 37 q ha 1 10 70 q ha 1 and mape 1 10 1 30 for the years 2014 15 and 2015 16 as compared to the other two models the canegro model simulated yield under incremental values of tmax and tmin in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc shows gradual decrement in the yield ranges while gradual increment of solar radiation from 1 to 3 mj m2 day showed a yield increment keywords dssat canegro simulation sugarcane yield data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction agriculture plays a critical role in the economy of numerous nations particularly in developing countries virnodkar et al 2020 crop growth variability is related to various parameters that can be time dependent rainfall temperature relative humidity sunshine hours etc or time independent previous land use soil type soil depth topography etc bÃ©guÃ© et al 2008 crop modelling potentially can contribute to nutrition and global food security mehrabi and sepaskhah 2020 crop simulation models are computer based software application tools which are used to evaluate the effect of agronomic hydrologic edaphic and climatic factors on crop growth and yield these models are quantitative tools based on scientific knowledge that conceptually present a simplified crop production system crop simulation models have been developed by understanding the interaction of all underlying environmental conditions and plant growth processes as well as factors of weather soil pests irrigation and other management practices that affect plant growth and yield battisti et al 2018 therefore they can be used for local and global applications under different management conditions which may not be possible through empirical or regression modelling the general indication with respect to the use of simulation models in crop yield forecasting is that the models hold promise as a tool for the future the accuracy of the method depends partly on the adequacy of the crop model and partly on the technique used to complete the seasonal data record duchon 1986 model outputs should be verified during the development phase of a forecasting system using accurate data from the area the crop yield simulation model is an important tool for planners scientists and farm managers it can predict yield under different soil and climatic conditions these models simulate the development and growth of a crop through its different growth stages until maturity hammer et al 1996b input data required by simulation models commonly relate to climate variables properties of soil genetic coefficients and field management factors climate data usually include daily solar radiation rainfall minimum and maximum temperatures duchon 1986 lourens 1995 the advancement of simulation models begun after the accomplishment of a model created by ritchie 1972 to anticipate evapotranspiration from the row crops the model is more empirical and as an input it required seasonal variation in leaf area index lai several simulation models viz dssat hoogenboom et al 1999 wofost boogaard et al 1998 cropsyst stockle et al 1994 and infocrop aggarwal et al 2006 have been used in recent years to anticipate regional yield forecast for various crops india is the second largest producer of sugarcane sonkar et al 2020 a few studies have been reported using the simulation crop growth model in india sugarcane is an important crop in the tropical and sub tropical regions due to its high sucrose content gilbert et al 2008 it is also the world s largest biomass crop which is commercially produced in over 100 countries white et al 2020 this crop is a good source for the production of sugar ethanol and electricity de aquino et al 2017 there is a need to assess the efficiency capability of sugarcane in various agro climatic zones of the nation therefore various sugarcane models such as apsim canegro and qcane have been introduced the apsim canegro and qcane are three main models used for sugarcane simulation the apsim and canegro are currently used in the major sugarcane producing regions of the world whereas qcane is a less used well known model the apsim and qcane are australian models while canegro is a south african model o leary 1999 the canegro sugarcane model employs the dssat that has been widely utilized in america africa and asia o leary 2000 in recent years several yield forecasting studies have been conducted for sugarcane crops using the dssat canegro simulation model singh et al 2010 calibrated and validated the canegro model for four different field locations lucknow kushinagar gorakhpur and varanasi in eastern uttar pradesh region of india this study revealed that the canegro model satisfactorily simulated the potential development and yield in this model stalk fresh mass stalk height and sucrose yield within 15 of range as compared to the observed values brazil is the largest sugarcane producer country in the world and sugarcane is the most important bioenergy crop as well as the main source of sugar cardozo et al 2015 marin et al 2011 parameterized and assessed the canegro model for brazilian sugarcane this model is parameterized for two sugarcane varieties at four different locations in southern brazil in each sugarcane variety ten genetic coefficients out

yield forecast simulation models apsim fao azm and dssat canegro in a single and multi model approach for the commercial managed sugarcane fields of brazil the weather data tmax tmin rainfall sunshine hours and solar radiation are used in the model yield data from several seasons 2000 01 2013 14 and sixteen locations are utilized for model calibration and validation the three models presented a weak performance with low precision r2 and high mean absolute error mae the multi model approach by using the ensemble of apsim fao azm and dssat canegro improved the sugarcane yield estimates as well as minimizing the errors bhengra et al 2016 calibrated and validated the canegro sugarcane model with the help of field experiment data from 1997 to 2013 in the northern part of india four locations the 43 years of weather parameters minimum and maximum temperature rainfall and solar radiation from 1971 to 2013 and other input parameters such as soil property nitrogen content dates of planting maturity harvesting and cane yield information are collected the twenty genetic coefficients for ten sugarcane varieties are assessed by repeated interaction in the model counts until a nearby match among observed and predicted phenology growth and yield is achieved parmar et al 2019 calibrated and validated the canegro model for the south gujarat region india they utilized daily weather data from 2012 13 to 2016 17 and estimated the genetic coefficient for sugarcane variety co 99004 and co 86032 by using the glue program inbuilt package of dssat software poor model estimates may not entirely be due to the functional relations that are involved in the model but may also be due to errors associated with input parameters the successful application of any crop growth model for indian conditions should invariably consider both these aspects because of varied agro climatic and physiographic conditions therefore a sensitivity analysis for some input parameters were carried out in various studies marin et al 2013 and singels et al 2014 used sugarcane models to evaluate sugarcane yield responses to future climate situations ramachandran et al 2017 has utilized the canegro sugarcane ceres rice and cropgro legume modules to simulate the future yield under varying climate scenarios for the chengalpet district of tamilnadu south india the rcp 4 5 representative

2009 the canegro simulated yields were correlated in view of the expected future scenario of climate change in northern uttar pradesh as per the report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2014 the ipcc has developed four possible co2 emission scenarios viz a1 a2 b1 and b2 for every country according to its topography economical technological and social backgrounds the a2 high emission and b2 low emission scenario were taken under this study for the a2 and b2 scenario co2 was fixed at 720 ppm 500 ppm respectively arnell 2004 these values of co2 had been close to the conditions under which sugarcane has been examined for co2 effects de souza et al 2008 vu and allen 2009 the baseline value was simulated at 380 ppm of co2 the aim of this study is to provide dssat canegro simulated variety wise crop yield models for sugarcane crop the sensitivity analysis impact of various climatic parameters of these generated models is also taken into consideration using the

february 2014 are used for this simulation 4 results 4 1 models calibration and validation in order to calibrate the canegro model field experiments were performed at twelve locations of muzaffarnagar district under three different dates of planting i e 2nd february 2013 early planting 15th march 2013 mid planting and 28th april 2013 late planting data on growth development and yield were recorded for each planting date during field visits and created 180 treatment combinations using five sugarcane varieties at twelve different locations thereafter the canegro model was executed using actual crop management soil weather data and genetic coefficient data the canegro simulated sugarcane yield for the variety cos 767 cose 95422 cos 8436 cose 92423 and cose 98231 during the spring season 2013 2014 is presented in table 4 to validate the performance of the model input data required by the canegro were provided for two consecutive years 2014 15 and 2015 16 and sugarcane district level yield data were used for validation the twelve different locations sugarcane yield data were collected during field visits while the district level data were collected from the directorate of agriculture lucknow uttar pradesh the canegro simulated variety wise sugarcane yield for the entire district during spring season 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 are presented in table 5 the generated models are calibrated and validated under the three different dates of planting 4 2 models accuracy assessment to evaluate the performance of canegro model different statistical indicators such as percent deviation coefficient of determination r2 correlation coefficient r root mean square error rmse mean absolute percent error mape and willmott index of agreement d are used for the accuracy assessment of model results the coefficient of determination r2 between observed and simulated sugarcane yield for twelve different locations of muzaffarnagar district 2014 15 and 2015 16 is presented in fig 4 and the other parameters r rmse mape and d are shown in fig 5 in fig 4 r2 values between observed and predicted yield for the year 2014 15 is 0 60 0 66 and 0 62 for three simulation models i e early mid and late planting sugarcane respectively similar r2 values were found for the year 2015 16 as 0 62 for early planting model 0 70 for mid planting model and 0 57 for late planting model correlation represents the relationship between two quantitative variables and the values of correlation coefficient r varies from 1 to 1 in this study r values fig 5a between observed and predicted sugarcane yield were found as 0 77 0 81 0 78 year 2014 15 and as 0 78 0 83 0 75 year 2015 16 for early mid and late planting models respectively in addition the performance of the models was also evaluated by rmse and mape parameters rmse is the square root of the variance of the residuals that indicates the absolute fit of the model to the data how close the observed data points are to the model s predicted values the mean absolute percentage error mape is one of the most commonly used kpis key performance indicator to measure forecast accuracy it is the sum of the individual absolute errors divided by the demand each period separately that measures the deviation in terms of from the actual data the rmse values are 10 4 q ha 1 for early planting 8 37 q ha 1 for mid planting and 12 29 q ha 1 for late planting for the year 2014 15 while these were 22 21 q ha 1 for early planting 10 7 q ha 1 for mid planting and 12 64 q ha 1 for late planting for the year 2015 16 fig 5b in this study very low mape values were observed for all three planting models the ranges varies between 1 10 and 1 90 and 1 30 3 10 for the year 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively fig 5c willmott index of agreement d is a measure of the degree of model prediction error and its value ranges between 0 indicates no agreement to 1 indicates a perfect match this represents the ratio of the mean square error and the potential error and can also detect additive and proportional differences in the observed and simulated means and variances it is seen in fig 5 d that the values of d ranges between 0 81 and 0 88 for the year 2014 15 and between 0 69 and 0 91 for the year 2015 16 respectively this index value is highest for the mid planting models 0 88 for 2014 15 0 91 for 2015 16 as compared to early and late planting models which indicates that the canegro model can be used for sugarcane yield simulation with relatively good accuracy the sugarcane yield simulation by mid planting model was found to be better presenting the highest r 0 81 0 83 and d 0 88 0 91 and the lowest errors rmse 8 37 q ha 1 10 70 q ha 1 and mape 1 10 1 30 for the years 2014 15 and 2015 16 respectively as compared to the other two models the district level predicted sugarcane yield by canegro model shows the percent error ranges from 2 80 to 31 64 the model gave percent error from 8 62 to 9 60 for early planting 20 13 to 31 64 for late planting and 2 80 to 5 20 for mid planting the yield estimation for the mid planting model thus proved superior over early and late planting models table 6 the simulated sugarcane yield of different varieties during 2013 14 2014 15 and 2015 16 are presented in fig 6 5 discussion 5 1 climate change impact on yield the climate scenario simulated for maximum temperature 1 to 3 Âºc minimum temperature 1 to 3 Âºc solar radiation 1 to 3 mj m2 day and 500 ppm 720 ppm against present co2 concentration of 380 ppm looking for the complexity in climatic pattern the yield was simulated due to change in individual parameters table 7 and in combination with other parameters table 8 5 2 effect of tmax on yield the canegro model simulated yield under incremental values of tmax in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc which shows gradual decrement in the yield range of 677 6 664 0 qt ha 1 0 09 0 33 and 2 09 of base yield for variety cos 767 we observed that the response for incremental values of tmax is similar for variety cose 98231 except that there is a higher reduction in yield as compared to variety cos 767 for variety cose 98231 the yield is decreasing in the range of 824 0 798 2 qt ha 1 1 03 2 34 and 4 13 of base yield similarly in case of gradual downscale of tmax in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc we have noticed an incremental pattern in yield ranging from 682 4 to 692 3 qt ha 1 0 62 1 16 and 2 08 of base yield for variety cos 767 in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc the variety cose 98231 yield is also increasing in the range of 843 6 857 1 qt ha 1 1 32 2 07 and 2 94 of base yield the results show that the variety cose 98231 is more sensitive to the maximum temperature change as compared to variety cos 767 5 3 effect of tmin on yield the increment of tmin in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc shows gradual decrement in the yield range of 670 2 642 2 qt ha 1 1 18 2 64 and 5 31 of base yield for variety cos 767 the same results were obtained for the variety cose 98231 the yield decreases in the range of 822 5 793 2 qt ha 1 1 21 2 68 and 4 73 of base yield we have noticed that the yield decrement is maximum at the 3 Âºc for both the variety in case of downscaling of tmin from 1 to 2 Âºc the sugarcane variety cos 767 yield increases from 680 3 to 683 3 qt ha 1 0 31 to 0 75 of base yield while it decreased by 1 64 of base yield 678 2 qt ha 1 at 3 Âºc the cose 98231 variety yield is gradually increasing in the range of 844 6 857 6 qt ha 1 1 44 2 16 and 3 00 of base yield for the scale of tmin 1 to 3 Âºc 5 4 effect of solar radiation on yield for both the varieties gradual increment of solar radiation from 1 to 3 mjm 2day 1 showed a yield increment 8 82 16 48 and 23 49 of base yield for cos 767 and 7 23 13 86 and 19 66 of base yield for cose 98231 in case of decrement of solar radiation from 1 to 3 mjm 2day 1 reverse trend was noticed the maximum increment in yield was reported 23 49 of base yield for variety cos 767 at 3 mjm 2day 1 whereas the maximum reduction in yield was noticed 27 13 of base yield for variety cos 767 with reduction of solar radiation by 3 mjm 2day 1 the results indicate that both the sugarcane varieties are very sensitive to the solar radiation effect but the variety cos 767 is more sensible as compared to cose 98231 5 5 effect of co2 concentration on yield increased levels of co2 directly affected crop species which changes the crop physical structures and in turn affects crop growth and yield water use efficiency ritchie and otter 1985 and susceptibility to insect pests and diseases mitchell et al 2003 paherson 1993 the impact of increasing co2 concentration in the level of 720 ppm and 500 ppm as their base value of 380 ppm showed a gradual increment in sugarcane yield for both the variety in the high emission a2 scenario for co2 concentration of 720 ppm variety cos 767 and cose 98231 yield were increased by 5 69 and 6 02 of base yield respectively in case of b2 low emission scenario co2 concentration of 550 ppm the yield is incrementing by 3 34 for variety cos 767 and 3 39 for variety cose 98231 5 6 combined effect of tmax and tmin on yield both the tmax and tmin temperatures are changed in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc and their simulated yield levels are compared with base yield table 5 the canegro model yield of sugarcane under incremental units of tmax and tmin 1 to 3 Âºc showed a gradual decrement in yield ranging from 667 5 to 606 6 qt ha 1 1 58 5 06 and 10 56 of base yield for variety cos 767 the similar decreasing yield pattern was noticed for the variety cose 98231 having ranges from 811 8 to 726 7 qt ha 1 2 50 6 73 and 12 72 of base yield other combinations did not show any significant trend the drastically yield reduction was observed at 3 Âºc for variety cos 767 5 7 combined effect of tmax tmin and solar radiation on yield maximum temperature tmax minimum temperatures tmin and solar radiation are altered in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc and their yield was compared with base yield table 5 the maximum increment of yield was reported at 2 Âºc for both the variety the variety cos 767 and cose 98231 yield were increased by 9 75 and 4 46 of base yield respectively the maximum yield reduction was noticed at 3 Âºc the yield is decreased by 39 47 variety cos 767 and 31 10 variety cose 98231 of base yield the yield is drastically decreasing at 2 Âºc and 3 Âºc 6 conclusions the dssat canegro was able to simulate sugarcane yield fairly realistically when compared with the observed yield these models were successfully calibrated and validated for the muzaffarnagar district under three different dates of planting sugarcane yield simulation mid planting model presented the highest r 0 81 0 83 and d 0 88 0 91 and the lowest errors rmse 8 37 q ha 1 10 70 q ha 1 and mape 1 10 1 30 for the years 2014 15 and 2015 16 as compared to the other two models the mid planted sugarcane district level yields percent error ranged from 2 80 to 5 20 which is the minimum among all the three planting models the results revealed that the mid planting model 3rd week of march gives higher sugarcane yield as compared to the early and late planting models sugarcane requires about 25 32 Âºc for good germination therefore early before 2 fn of february and late planting after 1 fn of april may be the cause of yield loss due to low and high temperatures respectively the genetic potential of a crop variety also plays an important role in determining the yield some varieties have a high yield potential while others have lower the canegro model simulated the yield for the five sugarcane varieties namely cos 767 cose 95422 cos 8436 cose 92423 and cose 98231 results showed that the variety cose 98231 produces higher yields whereas variety cos 767 gives the lowest yield for all three planting dates therefore varieties cose 98231 cose 95422 cose 92423 are recommended for sugarcane growers and sugar industries for higher cane yield sensitivity analysis has been also successfully performed for chhapar site location to understand the effect of climate variability on sugarcane yield canegro model was simulated for single weather parameters solar radiation tmax tmin as well as combinations of these parameters this study indicates that the canegro model simulated yield under incremental values of tmax and tmin in the range of 1 to 3 Âºc shows gradual decrement in the yield ranges for both the sugarcane varieties while gradual increment of solar radiation from 1 to 3 mj m2 day showed a yield increment 8 82 16 48 and 23 49 of base yield for cos 767 and 7 23 13 86 and 19 66 of base yield for cose 98231 the study highlighted that the generated sugarcane yield model is sensitive to the solar radiation maximum temperature minimum temperature and co2 concentration levels

9222,strengthening water resource management and improving water use efficiency are crucial for sustainable development as described in the target 6 4 of the sustainable development goals compared with developed countries developing countries are facing some general obstacles on agricultural water management from policy making pricing mechanisms infrastructure and subsidy implementations which has left developing countries with little progress in improving agricultural water management through water pricing however china is moving towards more sustainable water resource management in the agricultural sector by implementing a nationwide agricultural water pricing reform the ongoing reform contributes to the improvement of water use efficiency and water saving rate through the core pricing mechanisms of reasonable pricing and precise subsidies and water saving incentives in the meanwhile the measure of infrastructure development and management safeguards the reform implementation and water pricing combined with quota control management is the tool to improve the agricultural water management the progress of the reform shows that china has achieved remarkable results in water conservation and increasing water use efficiency but has also revealed uneven progress across the country and challenges to financial sustainability china s changes in agricultural water pricing shows that an integrated water pricing method based on farmers affordability is a pragmatic option for developing countries but the implementation urgently requires upgrading of irrigation infrastructure and management systems the policies of precise subsidies and water saving incentives provide a solution to price failure caused by excessive subsidies that are common in developing countries the financial constraints of current reform highlight the importance of diversifying funding channels for financial sustainability the lessons and implications of china could provide insights for developing countries on sustainable water management in the agricultural sector keywords sustainable water resource management agricultural water pricing reform water conservation

resources is growing at a rate of 1 per year driven by population growth economic development and shifting consumption patterns un 2020 however the continued growth of agriculture and other water intensive industries has resulted in the depletion of freshwater resources and water pollution jÃ¤germeyr et al 2017 the 2030 agenda for sustainable development identifies water as an essential factor

global water use efficiency increased by 9 between 2015 and 2018 reaching 32 usd m3 for industry and 112 usd m3 for services however agriculture is still the world s lowest total value added sector with an efficiency of 0 6 usd m3 the industrial sector worldwide has reduced water withdrawals by 18 between 2006 and 2018 while the total value added has increased by more than 30 which appears to be a sign of decoupling that can be attributed to effective water use policies un 2021 in contrast agriculture the economic sector that needs the most water should intensify its efforts kehl 2020 mcnabb 2019 to address the challenges faced by the agricultural sector there is an urgent need to change past water management policies to increase water use efficiency the promotion of justice efficiency and sustainability in the water sector may be accomplished in a variety of ways with water pricing being perhaps the conceptually easiest to execute but also the most challenging politically rogers et al 2002 water pricing reforms are powerful measures for improving water use efficiency and sustainability in the agriculture sector dinar 2000 however because of the special characteristics that distinguish water from ordinary commodities economic principles for managing water resources should be applied alongside a broad social and institutional perspective rogers 1998 the national level agricultural water pricing reform in china is the integration of a series of top down agricultural water management policy innovations which require a series of supports such as legal framework incentive and subsidy funds and infrastructure construction the water use efficiency is not constant and declines as more water is supplied because farmers are likely to alter their cropping patterns with varying supplies of water therefore farmers motivation is an important factor in water pricing reform and changing the perception of water as a private goods supports the implementation of full cost pricing in agricultural sector toan et al 2016 toan 2016 some developed countries such as the united state and eu member states have taken steps in agricultural water pricing reform in the past few decades however agricultural water pricing reform remains a challenging and difficult task in developing countries china the largest developing country in the world faces a severe water shortage with a per capita water resource of approximately 1972 m3 2018 which corresponds to only 28 of the world average cwrsy 2019 in china the agricultural sector consumed the highest amount of water accounting for 61 4 of the country s water consumption in 2018 mwrc 2019 additionally the use of agricultural water is inefficient and waste water issues are pervasive resulting in a low effective use coefficient of irrigation water on farmland of 0 554 far below the world advanced level of 0 7 0 8 mwrc 2019 therefore the agriculture sector is a major water consumer in china and has considerable potential to save water huang et al 2020 zhang and guo 2016 zhang and oki 2021 between 1950 and 1980 most large and medium sized irrigation districts were built with government support in china liu et al 2013 however owing to the low price or even free availability of agricultural water the lack of funds for operation and maintenance has resulted in aging irrigation infrastructure inefficient operation and high leakage rates wang and chen 2014 although the chinese government is committed to optimizing policies for agricultural water management it has not made progress on the issues of agricultural water pricing for a long time facing challenges such as weak infrastructure insufficient funding inadequate management and unsound pricing mechanisms wang et al 2020 consequently since 2006 an agricultural water pricing reform has been implemented in pilot areas and china s state council issued opinions on promoting comprehensive reform of agricultural water pricing in 2016 ndrc 2016 estimating that nationwide implementation of the reform will require ten years more than halfway through the agricultural water pricing reform process to date improvements in agricultural water conservation have been highlighted which has enhanced water use efficiency by the end of 2020 the area of water saving irrigation had reached 567 million mu 1 15 ha of which 350 million mu were irrigated with high efficiency water saving irrigation mwrc 2021 the effective use coefficient of irrigation water for farmland increased from 0 5 in 2010 0 565 in 2020 mfac 2021 some provinces have completed or are close to implementing the reform at which point the reform scheme will be analyzed and summarized to contribute to resolving issues related to water resource management in the agricultural sector china s agricultural water pricing reform is an exploration of sustainable water management on behalf of developing countries however few studies have reported the results of the agricultural water pricing reform in china and most reviews of agricultural water management in china have paid little attention to the latest reform schemes reform mechanisms and policy changes therefore this study conducts an international assessment of agricultural water management schemes of developed and developing countries to analyze the water pricing mechanisms from perspectives of legal frameworks institutional organizations pricing methods obstacles for water pricing and subsidy implementations furthermore the policy frontier and progress of china s agricultural water pricing reform are summarized to analyze the changes in water management schemes and the innovations of the reform on this basis the reform lessons and inspiration for policy development and implementation in china s agricultural water pricing reform are discussed compared with other countries providing insights and policy implications for common issues faced by other developing countries in the sustainable development of the agricultural water sector this review conducted a comprehensive search of academic databases research institutions government websites and development organizations oecd fao and world bank for the comprehensive review of agricultural water management schemes in developed and developing countries and refer to the information of statistical bulletins from chinese government reports and information disclosures of chinese local governments and some unpublished documents which related to china s agricultural water pricing reform this review involved 89 related academic publications reports and documents search terms included agricultural water pricing reform water management in the agricultural sector water pricing sustainable management of water resources china agricultural water pricing practice and sustainable water pricing 2 agricultural water pricing and supported measures the concept of full cost pricing was introduced over 30 years ago goldstein 1986 and has been applied in the water pricing reforms of a few countries assimacopoulos 2002 johansson et al 2002 massarutto 2015 decision makers can be better informed about the full cost of water consumption in agriculture by having a solid understanding of the economics of water hanemann 2006 as shown in fig 1 understanding these concepts is helpful for policy analysis because it makes the costs of agriculture s use of water resources more transparent rogers et al 1998 rogers et al 2002 agenda 21 defines sustainability to include economic development social development and environmental protection spangenberg et al 2002 water pricing reform can increase economic efficiency of water use promote social justice and contribute to environmental issues by promoting water conservation and efficiency in principle water price should recover the full cost which includes full supply cost opportunity cost and environmental externalities in fig 1 rogers et al 1998 and the full supply cost includes the operation and maintenance o m cost and capital cost however even though the principle of full cost recovery has been introduced in some national water policies of agricultural sector few countries have achieved full cost water pricing or even full water supply cost pricing parris 2010 in most countries the water charges paid by agricultural users reflect only a fraction of the full cost toan 2016 parris 2010 this is partly due to the difficulty of assessing opportunity costs and environmental costs and benefits more importantly water for agricultural irrigation is usually provided through public irrigation projects with government investment so that water price for farmers covers only o m cost of the water supply and part of capital cost or less o m cost is related to the daily operation of the water supply such as electricity for pumping labor and repair cost capital cost covers both capital for renewing infrastructure and new investment cost such as canal network construction for farmers after recognizing the difficulties faced by countries to reach full cost recovery the concept of sustainable cost recovery was proposed and gradually accepted promoting the provision of water services on a financially sustainable basis and ensuring the sustainability of water resources camdessus 2003 parris 2010 wu 2011 the main characteristics of sustainable cost recovery include 1 the appropriate prices and taxes to finance o m and capital costs 2 planned public subsidies to promote investment 3 affordable pricing policies for providing financially sustainable water services camdessus 2003 compared to full cost pricing sustainable pricing is intended to provide a compromise to keep irrigation facilities operating especially for developing countries it means that agricultural water pricing should recover o m cost or water supply cost o m cost and capital cost while actively finding ways to subsidize where cost recovery is insufficient and make reasonable pricing policies on the basis of farmer s affordability improving the sustainability of water supply in the agricultural sector requires a gradual increase in water price through pricing policies starting from partial to full recovery of o m cost then from partial to full recovery of capital cost and finally to paying for water externalities and opportunity resource costs parris 2010 however incremental pricing methods may have minimal impact if water price is too low in comparison to sustainable cost recovery necessitating more aggressive measures to change water use behaviors cost recovery through water pricing requires a comprehensive approach including reforming price levels and structures improving water supply service and establishing legal frameworks the pricing process and assignment of responsibilities are an important agenda in some countries the water pricing structure is determined by the central government and implemented by local governments which requires a balance of obligations and responsibilities water pricing is difficult to use as a stand alone tool to facilitate agricultural water management subsidies can be used as support measures for water pricing in many countries agricultural water prices can not cover the cost of irrigation and subsidies are an important tool to guarantee the irrigation services in agricultural management in most cases in developing countries governments have to invest in large subsidies to guarantee food security which usually resulted in price failures and overuse of low priced water excessive subsidies are not sustainable in the long run therefore appropriate subsidies or precise subsidies should be adopted to cooperate with the implementation of water pricing precise subsidies refer to differentiated subsidies for different regions crops irrigation methods etc and guide changes in water use behavior combined with water pricing besides quota control is the common policies to reduce agricultural water use which correspond to administrative management water quota refers to the water consumption per unit product or unit area in unit time and it s the most direct way to limit water supply and reduce water use quota management can help to control the total amount of water consumption so that the water pricing can have more room for adjustment when the total water fee remains unchanged therefore to enhance the effects of water price in optimal allocation and efficiency of agricultural water use water pricing should be combined with a series of comprehensive measures such as subsidies policy and quota control management 3 comparison and obstacles of implementing water pricing in agricultural water management in developed and developing countries china is promoting agricultural water pricing reform and many countries have already carried out such reforms or are in the process of reforming agricultural water prices dinar et al 2015 therefore we review agricultural water pricing policies and practice in developed and developing countries in table 1 and make an analysis from perspectives of legal frameworks institutional organizations pricing methods obstacles for water pricing and subsidy implementations table 1 shows specific agricultural water pricing policies and practice in some representative developed and developing countries some developed countries are further along in their water pricing policies than developing countries because the rapid breakthroughs in agricultural productivity in developed countries have made them earlier face the great challenges of intense water conflicts between different sectors serious water level decline and water pollution problems gopalakhrishnan and huffaker 2000 scanlon et al 2012 ec 2000 rouillard and rinaudo 2020 for the national level policy planning the legal frameworks supporting water management schemes are essential in developed countries as shown in table 1 in the united state the federal government developed a legal framework to perform agricultural water pricing reform in which the core element is the establishment of a block water pricing structure based on full water supply cost pricing wichelns 2010 the eu has launched water framework directive wfd since 2000 for solving water shortage and pollution problems and member states such as france spain and italy have transposed wfd into national law for guiding their water policy however there appears to be a general lack of targeted legal frameworks in developing countries table 1 in countries like vietnam and thailand where water is still free for agriculture the water policies support food security than sustainability chu and grafton 2020 toan 2016 in india the lack of regulatory consistency across states and the problems of uncertainties about government management responsibilities hinder the planning of agricultural water parween et al 2021 similarly china has been in the free and low water pricing period for a long time before the introduction of water pricing reform and lacks clear policy guidance the development of a legal framework means that the government needs to put in place a series of policies and safeguards and incorporate them into national medium and long term planning rather than blindly raising prices as in the case of the wfd and the agricultural water prices in china institutional organizations for water resource governance in table 1 involve complex top down implementing agencies e g mexico and china and streamlined implementing agencies e g israel and spain for instance in mexico the national water council nwd with the participation of other federal ministries is responsible for the structure of national planning nwd devolves power to irrigation water basins which supply water to farmers through water user associations wilder and romero lankao 2006 china s water management structure is similar to the mexico s but the farmers water associations in china do not carry out its functions well hu et al 2014 in israel the governmental water and sewerage authority was established in 2007 which is responsible for implementing water supply schemes and regulating water pricing gruÃ¨re et al 2020 this brings enough support to implement israel s strict quota system and to develop water saving agriculture molle 2009 oecd 2020 the process of agricultural water pricing in developed countries provides excellent lessons for developing countries in france water pricing requires an assessment of the investment in water supply projects and the average income of farmers as well as the reasonable investigation of water prices by river basin committees and local water commissions table 1 the final agricultural water prices are negotiated by local governments farmers and farmers water associations berbel et al 2019 in the whole pricing process the responsibilities of each department are clear the pricing is transparent and multiple stakeholders are involved in the water pricing yang et al 2013 however developing countries are constrained by inadequate mechanisms conflicting departmental functions difficulties in water metering poor water services and lack of basis for pricing making it difficult to develop a reasonable water price formation mechanism therefore in order to ensure that the water pricing process is reasonable and effective the central government of china has emphasized both the construction of mechanisms such as pricing mechanisms water rights allocation water project management system as well as the construction of engineering support such as the construction of the final canal system and the popularization of metering facilities developed countries pursue not only covers o m cost but also the recovery of capital cost such as australia in these countries irrigation services are provided by profitable companies and their agricultural water prices are more market based and tend to reflect the scarcity of water resources this difference also occurs in developing countries for example mexico started the market operation of agricultural water decades ago but in china because irrigation services are provided by the government it is difficult to market the pricing of agricultural water in these countries where agricultural irrigation s costs are borne by the government for food security cost recovery is very slow and puts more pressure on national finance what s more some eu member states are trying to cover the environmental and resource costs erc of water following the wfd however no member state has been able to propose a workable plan for the assessment of erc berbel and expÃ³sito 2020 agricultural water pricing in developing countries is more pragmatic due to their economic development and food security the pricing methods in developing countries are shown in table 1 some developing countries take covering o m cost as the main target of pricing such as mexico pakistan and china in china the water pricing reform is to recover o m cost as much as possible to ensure daily operations and to gradually recover full water supply cost to promote financial sustainability a few countries have implemented full water supply cost pricing such as south africa speelman et al 2009 however almost all developing countries need subsidy policies to support pricing to be accepted and enforced there are many practical obstacles to implement agricultural water pricing reform in developing countries the iranian water authority started working on raising agricultural water prices in 2019 but study shows that raising agricultural water prices will never effectively reduce water use unless price adjustments are accompanied by infrastructure development momeni et al 2019 in india volume based pricing has not been implemented to date due to the lack of water metering infrastructure this highlights the embarrassment that agricultural water management in developing countries still faces inadequate infrastructure therefore poor and inadequate infrastructure development is a major impediment to the implementation of water pricing in developing countries in addition higher water prices have put pressure on farmers in developing countries a study in south africa showed that the poorer farmers were most affected by higher water prices and would no longer be profitable at higher water prices speelman et al 2009 therefore in the absence of appropriate subsidies water pricing reforms are likely to be caught in a dilemma in developing countries moderate subsidies are beneficial to improve farmers acceptance of higher water price and guarantee the daily operation of irrigation facilities as shown in table 1 in the united states financial subsidies are offered to infrastructure to reduce investment costs and impoverished farmers are able to receive direct subsidies from a family support fund fsl berbel et al 2007 in israel the government is responsible for the construction of the irrigation project and water supply network as well as sharing 30 of the o m costs katz 2013 in japan farmers bear the o m costs a flat rate based on area and the government bears most of the capital costs nickum and ogura 2010 similar subsidy methods are reflected in developing countries such as south africa mexico pakistan and china however over subsidization is detrimental to sustainability in the agricultural sector despite the higher economic benefits it can bring to farmers in korea the irrigation of rice fields in some large irrigation projects is free of charge table 1 nickum and ogura 2010 the over subsidization for water price causes the overexploitation of water resources and unsustainable water supply lessons from the extensive analysis of agricultural water management in developed countries can be learned by developing countries price leverage is a common tool used to regulate water use efficiency however increasing the water price is a challenge in developing countries where farmers are used to having access to inexpensive or free water hellegers and perry 2006 wang et al 2016 sustainable water pricing requires the support of management structure and multi sectoral collaboration chen et al 2020 for developing countries the infrastructure is a safeguard for water pricing reform which is still lacking in the agricultural sector subsidy policies can avoid exceeding farmers affordability but affordability assessment and negotiation are required to reduce over subsidization 4 the reform scheme and progress of agricultural water pricing reform in china for china the first feature of agricultural water management is that smallholder farmers are the mainstay of china s agriculture and extremely sensitive to water prices the affordability of farmers should be considered in the water pricing the second feature is that china s irrigation services have long been provided by the government and water prices in most areas have to be shared by the government it will be hard to reflect the water resource scarcity only by water pricing and the effect of improving water efficiency will be limited however the water quota management allocation of water rights and the incentive and subsidy system could make up for this shortcoming the third feature is that as the most populous country and a major agricultural country food security is an important bottom line for agricultural policy making in china which is also a priority for most developing countries therefore agricultural water pricing has to minimize the impact on agricultural productivity therefore china s agricultural water pricing reform implements a comprehensive scheme for promoting sustainable water management in the agricultural sector the reform is committed to improving the efficiency of agricultural water use and promoting the development of water saving agriculture through the adjustment of the agricultural water price structure reasonable pricing and precise subsidies and water saving incentives are the core water pricing mechanisms which try to cover o m costs or full water supply costs through water price increases and use precise subsidies and water saving incentives to reduce farmers burdens in the meanwhile the measure of infrastructure development and management provides a guarantee mechanism for the implementation of water pricing the popularization of accurate metering facilities the construction of water supply networks and the construction and repair of farmland water conservancy projects have all effectively supported the formulation of reasonable water prices on this basis reformed water pricing combined with strict quota control management will become an important tool for agricultural water management the comprehensive agricultural water pricing reform scheme is illustrated in fig 2 a to show how the reform mitigates the threat of water shortage to china s sustainable agricultural development and the scheme before the reform is shown in fig 2 b for comparison 4 1 reasonable pricing as with most developing countries china has a long standing policy of low agricultural water prices to ensure food security and develop agricultural productivity resulting in low water use efficiency the issue of how to improve water efficiency and change farmers perceptions of water use through reasonable water pricing is a common problem faced by developing countries since 1965 the government has been trying to redefine water prices to reflect the cost of the water supply through policy changes as shown in fig 3 however a better price formation mechanism has yet to be developed zhong and mol 2010 before the reform the collection rate of water fees was 62 covering only 22 of the water supply costs wang 2021 therefore one of the reform objectives is to establish a reasonable water pricing mechanism that reflects the water supply cost to ensure the operation and maintenance of water supply projects according to the reform goals from the china central government the agricultural water prices in china will generally reach the price level of o m costs by 2026 and in developed regions are suggested to be increased to the level of full supply costs o m costs and capital costs the water pricing process is shown in fig 2 a by green lines the irrigation districts and water conservancy stations develop the initial agricultural water pricing plans based on the water supply cost of irrigation backbone projects following which the initial plans are submitted to the local government for approval the local governments determine the final water pricing plan by negotiating with the farmers water associations to ensure that the increased water price is acceptable by farmers the whole process highlights the flexible pricing principle to respond to the actual pricing needs of different irrigation districts different water sources and different irrigation methods section 5 the new agricultural water price formed in this reform does not cover environmental costs and opportunity costs because china s agricultural sector which is dominated by small farmers cannot afford the extremely high agricultural water price increases brought about by these two aspects in the current stage the reform is not to blindly raise water prices but to follow the principle of not increasing too much burden on farmers reasonable pricing means trying to tap the price space within the affordability of farmers to reflect the value of water resources especially after the reduce of the total water consumption an appropriate increase in the water price will not bring too much water expenses to farmers 4 2 precise subsidies and water saving incentive raising water prices without increasing the burden on farmers is a common challenge in developing countries sampath 1992 therefore precise subsidies and water saving incentive mechanisms are required to support the implementation of water pricing orange line in fig 2 a the funding of precise subsidies and water saving incentive policies provided by central government grants and local government support are mainly used for daily operation and investment of irrigation districts and water saving of water users orange boxes in fig 2 a the precise subsidies are granted based on the detailed standards of each region in order to improve the efficiency of the funding and avoid over subsidization subsidies to farmers reduce the burden of water use and subsidies to irrigation districts guarantee daily operation and maintenance similarly diverse incentives have stimulated farmers to save water and contributed to a shift in their cropping pattern fang and zhang 2020 han and zhao 2007 mu et al 2019 4 3 infrastructure development and management the construction of farmland water projects management system reform momeni et al 2019 and improvement of water supply services pirages 2000 are necessary conditions for the implementation of the water pricing reform prior to the reform the lack of metering facilities led to inaccurate accounting of water volume and inefficient management systems resulted in inadequate water supply services therefore the mechanism of infrastructure development and management provides an important safeguard for the implementation of water pricing the infrastructure primarily focuses on water metering facilities and the construction of water supply facilities which are financially supported by central and local governments orange boxes in fig 2 a well developed water supply facilities help farmers save labor time and cost and accurate metering facilities enable volumetric pricing based on water consumption as shown by the blue lines in fig 2 a services related to water supply are mainly provided by irrigation districts water conservancy stations and farmers water associations the management reform of irrigation districts and water conservancy stations involves strengthening o m management and the efficient use of funds and the management reform of farmers water associations aims to standardize development and improve services for water users 4 4 quota control management the relatively homogeneous water management structure and ambiguous division of responsibilities prior to the reform led to inefficient agricultural water management fig 2 b clarifying water rights can delineate the boundaries of responsibility for management departments at different levels and improve the efficiency and equity of water resources allocation hence the mechanism of quota control management is adopted to implement the water rights system as shown in fig 2 a by gray line the provincial government controls total consumption and implements a strict water quota gradually diluting water rights water rights are clarified by the area cultivated irrigation water use coefficient and water quota for different crops which ensures fairness in water allocation and avoids waste caused by water management uncertainty in addition agricultural water trading is promoted in some provinces and both irrigation districts and farmers water associations authorized by farmers are able to participate in water rights transactions purple lines in fig 2 a which improves the efficiency of water allocation and maximize water use benefits delorit and block 2018 the establishment of an agricultural water rights system is the basis for strengthening agricultural water management as a special commodity water resources need to be allocated in an administrative manner according to the combination of supply and demand by limiting the total amount of water use in the region and the amount of water used by each water using subject agricultural water rights can be clearly defined so that measures such as progressive price increase over the limit water saving incentives and government water rights buy back can be implemented to stimulate agricultural water saving based on water rights 4 5 progress of water pricing reform a series of comprehensive reform measures support the promotion of the reform in china leading to more sustainable agricultural water management schemes as of the end of 2020 the cumulative area of reform implementation in china has exceeded 430 million mu the reform is being promoted through local pilot demonstrations to the country beijing shanghai jiangsu and zhejiang have taken the lead in completing the reform tasks and the reform progress in tianjin inner mongolia liaoning shandong yunnan shaanxi gansu and qinghai has exceeded 50 ndrc 2021 however there has been an inconsistency in the progress of reform in china the 31 provinces in china were divided into seven geographical divisions as shown in table 2 at the end of 2019 only east china and northwest china had achieved the expected reform implementation progress over 40 indicating that the reform gap across provinces had continued to increase the northern areas made more progress than the southern and eastern areas and are well ahead in the reform progress compared to central and western areas as the central government needs to achieve the reform goals by the end of the 14th five year plan in 2025 the provinces especially the areas where the reform progress is lagging need to formulate or adjust the reform schedule to reasonably arrange the reform work the agricultural water pricing reform has increased the water use efficiency and the agricultural water saving effects are shown in table 3 the water saving rates ranging from 17 5 to 40 in demonstration areas which confirm the reform measures in various regions have made progress in saving water and increasing efficiency water saving per unit area ranges from 315 to 5888 m3 hm 2 showing the potential for water savings in the agricultural sector progress in water saving in the agricultural sector releases more water rights for trading some regions have attempted market based trading of agricultural water rights svensson et al 2021 for instance the saved water rights are bought back by the government at a price of 1 cny m3 and pooled for new industrial water demand in chengan county hebei province cui et al 2019 however current water trading has limited influence relies on administrative means and lacks market regulations to guide stakeholders 5 innovation and practice of reform mechanisms and measures with the advancement of agricultural water pricing reform from 2006 to 2020 relevant policies guiding reform activities have been regularly updated the chinese government has consistently emphasized mechanism establishment and agricultural infrastructure development fig 4 and eventually creating a policy direction of mechanism establishment first and then agricultural infrastructure development from 2017 ndrc 2021 for example the water pricing mechanism for the end canal system was established in 2008 with the implementation of water saving renovation projects water supply cost accounting and precision measurement facility development were used to promote reasonable water pricing when the water pricing mechanism was enhanced from 2014 to 2018 from the pilot reform stage to the full scale promotion stage these two strategies have complemented each other and made great contributions to agricultural water pricing reform owing to disparity in the economic development of various regions in china water pricing reforms need to be tailored according to specific local conditions several flexible pricing methods such as full cost and block water pricing are combined to meet the requirements for reasonable pricing on this basis local government departments have explored and innovated a variety of ways to set agricultural water prices contributing to the formation of a reasonable agricultural water pricing mechanism the main water pricing methods are summarized in fig 5 including uniform pricing negotiated pricing differential pricing quota pricing classified pricing and block pricing even within the same province there may be multiple pricing approaches because of significant difference in farmers income infrastructure development and financial levels as the reform situation improves the current price systems for agricultural water will be changed the reasonable water prices cover higher water supply costs and raises awareness of water commodities among the farmers table 4 shows the agricultural water pricing formation mechanism and practice in the eight pilot areas of shandong and xinjiang provinces although the agricultural water prices in different areas are different the reformed agricultural water prices have covered o m costs and some areas have achieved full water supply cost pricing or even micro profit pricing beyond full water supply cost most reformed areas have adopted a water quota system combined with a block water pricing structure to promote water saving in the agricultural sector in addition flexible pricing methods have been adopted for special areas such as converting the power consumption of well irrigation into water consumption various incentives and subsidy policies have been implemented to encourage water saving and reduce the burden on farmers the characteristics of the local incentives are determined by each region s distinctive policy requirement the specific classification of subsidies is shown in fig 6 the incentive and subsidy methods can be flexibly applied to agricultural water management in different regions in some major grain producing regions e g northeast central and southwest china water prices for grain within the quota are reduced lower and subsidies are provided after modest increase in water prices agricultural areas where water is scarce and dependent on irrigation incentives such as water saving rewards water rights repurchase and water rights trading to encourage water conservation are provided at the same time high water prices for high water consumption crops and low water prices for low water consumption crops encourage planting structure changes in water rich irrigation areas the water quota is closely reviewed and approved and all or part of the water consumed within the quota is not charged however if the water consumption exceeds the quota the tariffs will increase significantly for the economically developed regions e g eastern coastal areas local governments can implement precise subsidy policies in more flexible way to promote water saving behaviors through incentives and subsidies to farmers water associations irrigation districts and major water saving households in addition in some large and medium sized irrigation areas the government will subsidize the pumping station s electricity price as well as the difference between the water price and the operating and maintenance costs in response to the reform requirements local governments have actively developed regulations and standards to strictly enforce subsidies and incentives table 5 shows the implementation and practice of precise subsidies and rational incentives in different regions the scope of the subsidy covers water users irrigation equipment irrigation districts and water saving facilities with detailed subsidy standards incentives are mostly differentiated according to the actual percentage of water savings or the amount of water saved by water users some regions have also introduced incentive policies for water rights trading such as yanchi city although the policies and standards for subsidies and incentives vary greatly from region to region they implement the principles of precise and rational which are conducive to water efficiency and policy sustainability 6 lessons and implications china s water pricing reform is an exploration by developing country on the road to sustainable development of the agricultural sector it has improved water use efficiency and increased cost recovery through reasonable pricing precise subsidies and water saving incentives infrastructure development and management and quota control management 1 reasonable water pricing and implementation the water pricing reform has promoted accurate agricultural water supply cost accounting and provided a basis for water price formulation most of the reformed areas in china adopt o m water pricing for agricultural sector and a few areas and irrigation districts are able to implement full water supply cost pricing there is a marked improvement in the economic sustainability of agricultural water supply compared to before the reform however due to different economic development and actual needs in china it is a more stable solution to fully consider farmers affordability and set the pricing target step by step or one step with the improvement of water use efficiency and the reduction of total water consumption the pricing space will be gradually released and the impact of the gradual increase in water prices on farmers water expenses will be minimized china s lessons illustrate that sustainable agricultural water pricing based on farmers affordability is a pragmatic option for developing countries on this basis differential pricing and negotiated pricing are widely applied with the former able to guide farmers to change their planting structure and the latter promoting acceptance of water pricing reform 2 improved water supply services for better acceptance of reform a common dilemma in developing countries is the difficulty of incentivizing agricultural water use efficiency after raising water prices such as india and iran parween et al 2021 momeni et al 2019 the main reasons are the delayed construction of irrigation water supply networks especially end canal systems and the volumetric metering facilities resulting in low quality water services and non transparent water pricing besides the acceptance of water prices by farmers is significantly affected by the service level of the water supply pirages 2000 improvements in water supply services depend on infrastructure construction and related management systems and it is a huge challenge for developing countries due to the huge budgets and long term planning fortunately the infrastructure development and management in china provides a positive practice for facing this challenge adequate metering facility plays an important role in achieving volume based billing and blocking water pricing structures and the reform started with the transformation of the water supply network aiming to facilitate farmers access to water therefore for developing countries with weak infrastructure it is more important to prioritize the improvement of water supply facilities and services than to increase water prices momeni et al 2019 3 avoiding excessive subsidies and emphasizing financial sustainability even in developed countries subsidy policies are still a common means of supporting the establishment of a water pricing system toan 2016 in developing countries it is necessary to share increased water prices between farmers and other stakeholders to increase farmers acceptance but it usually accompanied by excessive subsidies chu and grafton 2020 toan 2016 china s reform experience shows that precise subsidy policies with clear standards can help avoid excessive subsidies water saving incentive policies have a positive effect on stimulating farmers enthusiasm for water conservation and applying water saving technologies however precise subsidies and water saving incentives require substantial financial support which could create long term economic pressure on governments in developing countries the current reform in china is facing the dilemma of insufficient funds for some local governments and needs to expand funding channels and find third party investments feng 2021 4 strengthening the role of grassroots organizations the total amount of water use control and quota systems is an effective measure in china s reform to promote water equity and develop water saving agriculture both china and israel have demonstrated the role of government leadership in advancing their strict water quota systems gruÃ¨re et al 2020 farmers water associations serve as the foundation for water allocation and are expected to be crucial in advancing the reform at the community level hu et al 2014 however it is found that farmers water associations have not played a full role in the reform facing problems such as overlapping functions with village committees uneven acceptance by farmers and limited influence in local areas hu et al 2014 qiao et al 2009 chen et al 2020 financial support and professional technical training are required to make a better performance in the daily work which is where china should make further efforts feng 2021 in addition the reform work needs to be evaluated by a sound performance evaluation system that can supervise the efficiency and stimulate enthusiasm for promoting reform work ndrc 2021 5 applicability of water rights trading water rights trading has been piloted in some regions under the guidance of the chinese government and has initially demonstrated its benefits in improving agricultural water use efficiency although several studies found that water rights systems can reduce water consumption fang and zhang 2020 li and zhao 2018 more studies highlight that the high transaction costs caused by land fragmentation and uncertain hydrological conditions make it unrealistic to conduct large scale water rights transactions in china chen et al 2014 wang 2012 wang et al 2018 therefore the potential and feasibility of establishing water rights trading markets in developing countries should receive more attention the policymakers should consider clarifying trading conditions and norms defining the roles of stakeholders in the water rights trading and providing conflict resolution to avoid negative effects 7 conclusions agricultural water pricing reform and the upgrades of water management schemes and policies are essential for developing countries to move towards a sustainable agricultural sector a review of frontier reform policies and progress shows that agricultural water pricing reform in china has achieved remarkable results in terms of saving water and increasing water use efficiency which provides inspiration for developing countries in terms of policy making of water pricing an integrated pricing method based on farmers affordability is a pragmatic option for sustainable water pricing policies in developing countries it is a mechanism based on the water supply cost accounting that flexibly combines government unified pricing pricing negotiated with farmers quota pricing differential pricing of crops or water sources and classified pricing changing in different regions according to local conditions but the pricing mechanism urgently requires upgrading and matching of irrigation and metering facilities and management systems the precise subsidies and water saving incentives proposed by china provide a solution to price failure caused by excessive subsidies that are common in developing countries some highlight policies such as substitute incentives for subsidies subsidies for water supplier and water price discounts based on crops have effectively guaranteed farmers income and inspired farmers to save water however the current financial constraints of china s reforms highlight the importance of diversifying funding channels for financial sustainability and the execution and work efficiency of grassroots organizations and departments should be stimulated by the comprehensive performance evaluation system in order to exert the reform effect for a long time declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9222,strengthening water resource management and improving water use efficiency are crucial for sustainable development as described in the target 6 4 of the sustainable development goals compared with developed countries developing countries are facing some general obstacles on agricultural water management from policy making pricing mechanisms infrastructure and subsidy implementations which has left developing countries with little progress in improving agricultural water management through water pricing however china is moving towards more sustainable water resource management in the agricultural sector by implementing a nationwide agricultural water pricing reform the ongoing reform contributes to the improvement of water use efficiency and water saving rate through the core pricing mechanisms of reasonable pricing and precise subsidies and water saving incentives in the meanwhile the measure of infrastructure development and management safeguards the reform implementation and water pricing combined with quota control management is the tool to improve the agricultural water management the progress of the reform shows that china has achieved remarkable results in water conservation and increasing water use efficiency but has also revealed uneven progress across the country and challenges to financial sustainability china s changes in agricultural water pricing shows that an integrated water pricing method based on farmers affordability is a pragmatic option for developing countries but the implementation urgently requires upgrading of irrigation infrastructure and management systems the policies of precise subsidies and water saving incentives provide a solution to price failure caused by excessive subsidies that are common in developing countries the financial constraints of current reform highlight the importance of diversifying funding channels for financial sustainability the lessons and implications of china could provide insights for developing countries on sustainable water management in the agricultural sector keywords sustainable water resource management agricultural water pricing reform water conservation incentives and subsides data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction clean and adequate water supply is essential for sustainable human development and

resources is growing at a rate of 1 per year driven by population growth economic development and shifting consumption patterns un 2020 however the continued growth of agriculture and other water intensive industries has resulted in the depletion of freshwater resources and water pollution jÃ¤germeyr et al 2017 the 2030 agenda for sustainable development identifies water as an essential factor in achieving the diverse sustainable development goals sdgs sdg 6 4 states that addressing water scarcity by 2030 will require substantially increasing water use efficiency across all sectors and ensuring sustainable withdrawals and freshwater supply desa un 2016 improving water use efficiency over time decouples a country s economic growth from its water use according to un water un 2021 global water use efficiency increased by 9 between 2015 and 2018 reaching 32 usd m3 for industry and 112 usd m3 for services however agriculture is still the world s lowest total value added sector with an efficiency of 0 6 usd m3 the industrial sector worldwide has reduced water withdrawals by 18 between 2006 and 2018 while the total value added has increased by more than 30 which appears to be a sign of decoupling that can be attributed to effective water use policies un 2021 in contrast agriculture the economic sector that needs the most water should intensify its efforts kehl 2020 mcnabb 2019 to address the challenges faced by the agricultural sector there is an urgent need to change past water management policies to increase water use efficiency the promotion of justice efficiency and sustainability in the water sector may be accomplished in a variety of ways with water pricing being perhaps the conceptually easiest to execute but also the most challenging politically rogers et al 2002 water pricing reforms are powerful measures for improving water use efficiency and sustainability in the agriculture sector dinar 2000 however because of the special characteristics that distinguish water from ordinary commodities economic principles for managing water resources should be applied alongside a broad social and institutional perspective rogers 1998 the national level agricultural water pricing reform in china is the integration of a series of top down agricultural water management policy innovations which require a series of supports such as legal framework incentive and subsidy funds and infrastructure construction the water use efficiency is not constant and declines as more water is supplied because farmers are likely to alter their cropping patterns with varying supplies of water therefore farmers motivation is an important factor in water pricing reform and changing the perception of water as a private goods supports the implementation of full cost pricing in agricultural sector toan et al 2016 toan 2016 some developed countries such as the united state and eu member states have taken steps in agricultural water pricing reform in the past few decades however agricultural water pricing reform remains a challenging and difficult task in developing countries china the largest developing country in the world faces a severe water shortage with a per capita water resource of approximately 1972 m3 2018 which corresponds to only 28 of the world average cwrsy 2019 in china the agricultural sector consumed the highest amount of water accounting for 61 4 of the country s water consumption in 2018 mwrc 2019 additionally the use of agricultural water is inefficient and waste water issues are pervasive resulting in a low effective use coefficient of irrigation water on farmland of 0 554 far below the world advanced level of 0 7 0 8 mwrc 2019 therefore the agriculture sector is a major water consumer in china and has considerable potential to save water huang et al 2020 zhang and guo 2016 zhang and oki 2021 between 1950 and 1980 most large and medium sized irrigation districts were built with government support in china liu et al 2013 however owing to the low price or even free availability of agricultural water the lack of funds for operation and maintenance has resulted in aging irrigation infrastructure inefficient operation and high leakage rates wang and chen 2014 although the chinese government is committed to optimizing policies for agricultural water management it has not made progress on the issues of agricultural water pricing for a long time facing challenges such as weak infrastructure insufficient funding inadequate management and unsound pricing mechanisms wang et al 2020 consequently since 2006 an agricultural water pricing reform has been implemented in pilot areas and china s state council issued opinions on promoting comprehensive reform of agricultural water pricing in 2016 ndrc 2016 estimating that nationwide implementation of the reform will require ten years more than halfway through the agricultural water pricing reform process to date improvements in agricultural water conservation have been highlighted which has enhanced water use efficiency by the end of 2020 the area of water saving irrigation had reached 567 million mu 1 15 ha of which 350 million mu were irrigated with high efficiency water saving irrigation mwrc 2021 the effective use coefficient of irrigation water for farmland increased from 0 5 in 2010 0 565 in 2020 mfac 2021 some provinces have completed or are close to implementing the reform at which point the reform scheme will be analyzed and summarized to contribute to resolving issues related to water resource management in the agricultural sector china s agricultural water pricing reform is an exploration of sustainable water management on behalf of developing countries however few studies have reported the results of the agricultural water pricing reform in china and most reviews of agricultural water management in china have paid little attention to the latest reform schemes reform mechanisms and policy changes therefore this study conducts an international assessment of agricultural water management schemes of developed and developing countries to analyze the water pricing mechanisms from perspectives of legal frameworks institutional organizations pricing methods obstacles for water pricing and subsidy implementations furthermore the policy frontier and progress of china s agricultural water pricing reform are summarized to analyze the changes in water management schemes and the innovations of the reform on this basis the reform lessons and inspiration for policy development and implementation in china s agricultural water pricing reform are discussed compared with other countries providing insights and policy implications for common issues faced by other developing countries in the sustainable development of the agricultural water sector this review conducted a comprehensive search of academic databases research institutions government websites and development organizations oecd fao and world bank for the comprehensive review of agricultural water management schemes in developed and developing countries and refer to the information of statistical bulletins from chinese government reports and information disclosures of chinese local governments and some unpublished documents which related to china s agricultural water pricing reform this review involved 89 related academic publications reports and documents search terms included agricultural water pricing reform water management in the agricultural sector water pricing sustainable management of water resources china agricultural water pricing practice and sustainable water pricing 2 agricultural water pricing and supported measures the concept of full cost pricing was introduced over 30 years ago goldstein 1986 and has been applied in the water pricing reforms of a few countries assimacopoulos 2002 johansson et al 2002 massarutto 2015 decision makers can be better informed about the full cost of water consumption in agriculture by having a solid understanding of the economics of water hanemann 2006 as shown in fig 1 understanding these concepts is helpful for policy analysis because it makes the costs of agriculture s use of water resources more transparent rogers et al 1998 rogers et al 2002 agenda 21 defines sustainability to include economic development social development and environmental protection spangenberg et al 2002 water pricing reform can increase economic efficiency of water use promote social justice and contribute to environmental issues by promoting water conservation and efficiency in principle water price should recover the full cost which includes full supply cost opportunity cost and environmental externalities in fig 1 rogers et al 1998 and the full supply cost includes the operation and maintenance o m cost and capital cost however even though the principle of full cost recovery has been introduced in some national water policies of agricultural sector few countries have achieved full cost water pricing or even full water supply cost pricing parris 2010 in most countries the water charges paid by agricultural users reflect only a fraction of the full cost toan 2016 parris 2010 this is partly due to the difficulty of assessing opportunity costs and environmental costs and benefits more importantly water for agricultural irrigation is usually provided through public irrigation projects with government investment so that water price for farmers covers only o m cost of the water supply and part of capital cost or less o m cost is related to the daily operation of the water supply such as electricity for pumping labor and repair cost capital cost covers both capital for renewing infrastructure and new investment cost such as canal network construction for farmers after recognizing the difficulties faced by countries to reach full cost recovery the concept of sustainable cost recovery was proposed and gradually accepted promoting the provision of water services on a financially sustainable basis and ensuring the sustainability of water resources camdessus 2003 parris 2010 wu 2011 the main characteristics of sustainable cost recovery include 1 the appropriate prices and taxes to finance o m and capital costs 2 planned public subsidies to promote investment 3 affordable pricing policies for providing financially sustainable water services camdessus 2003 compared to full cost pricing sustainable pricing is intended to provide a compromise to keep irrigation facilities operating especially for developing countries it means that agricultural water pricing should recover o m cost or water supply cost o m cost and capital cost while actively finding ways to subsidize where cost recovery is insufficient and make reasonable pricing policies on the basis of farmer s affordability improving the sustainability of water supply in the agricultural sector requires a gradual increase in water price through pricing policies starting from partial to full recovery of o m cost then from partial to full recovery of capital cost and finally to paying for water externalities and opportunity resource costs parris 2010 however incremental pricing methods may have minimal impact if water price is too low in comparison to sustainable cost recovery necessitating more aggressive measures to change water use behaviors cost recovery through water pricing requires a comprehensive approach including reforming price levels and structures improving water supply service and establishing legal frameworks the pricing process and assignment of responsibilities are an important agenda in some countries the water pricing structure is determined by the central government and implemented by local governments which requires a balance of obligations and responsibilities water pricing is difficult to use as a stand alone tool to facilitate agricultural water management subsidies can be used as support measures for water pricing in many countries agricultural water prices can not cover the cost of irrigation and subsidies are an important tool to guarantee the irrigation services in agricultural management in most cases in developing countries governments have to invest in large subsidies to guarantee food security which usually resulted in price failures and overuse of low priced water excessive subsidies are not sustainable in the long run therefore appropriate subsidies or precise subsidies should be adopted to cooperate with the implementation of water pricing precise subsidies refer to differentiated subsidies for different regions crops irrigation methods etc and guide changes in water use behavior combined with water pricing besides quota control is the common policies to reduce agricultural water use which correspond to administrative management water quota refers to the water consumption per unit product or unit area in unit time and it s the most direct way to limit water supply and reduce water use quota management can help to control the total amount of water consumption so that the water pricing can have more room for adjustment when the total water fee remains unchanged therefore to enhance the effects of water price in optimal allocation and efficiency of agricultural water use water pricing should be combined with a series of comprehensive measures such as subsidies policy and quota control management 3 comparison and obstacles of implementing water pricing in agricultural water management in developed and developing countries china is promoting agricultural water pricing reform and many countries have already carried out such reforms or are in the process of reforming agricultural water prices dinar et al 2015 therefore we review agricultural water pricing policies and practice in developed and developing countries in table 1 and make an analysis from perspectives of legal frameworks institutional organizations pricing methods obstacles for water pricing and subsidy implementations table 1 shows specific agricultural water pricing policies and practice in some representative developed and developing countries some developed countries are further along in their water pricing policies than developing countries because the rapid breakthroughs in agricultural productivity in developed countries have made them earlier face the great challenges of intense water conflicts between different sectors serious water level decline and water pollution problems gopalakhrishnan and huffaker 2000 scanlon et al 2012 ec 2000 rouillard and rinaudo 2020 for the national level policy planning the legal frameworks supporting water management schemes are essential in developed countries as shown in table 1 in the united state the federal government developed a legal framework to perform agricultural water pricing reform in which the core element is the establishment of a block water pricing structure based on full water supply cost pricing wichelns 2010 the eu has launched water framework directive wfd since 2000 for solving water shortage and pollution problems and member states such as france spain and italy have transposed wfd into national law for guiding their water policy however there appears to be a general lack of targeted legal frameworks in developing countries table 1 in countries like vietnam and thailand where water is still free for agriculture the water policies support food security than sustainability chu and grafton 2020 toan 2016 in india the lack of regulatory consistency across states and the problems of uncertainties about government management responsibilities hinder the planning of agricultural water parween et al 2021 similarly china has been in the free and low water pricing period for a long time before the introduction of water pricing reform and lacks clear policy guidance the development of a legal framework means that the government needs to put in place a series of policies and safeguards and incorporate them into national medium and long term planning rather than blindly raising prices as in the case of the wfd and the agricultural water prices in china institutional organizations for water resource governance in table 1 involve complex top down implementing agencies e g mexico and china and streamlined implementing agencies e g israel and spain for instance in mexico the national water council nwd with the participation of other federal ministries is responsible for the structure of national planning nwd devolves power to irrigation water basins which supply water to farmers through water user associations wilder and romero lankao 2006 china s water management structure is similar to the mexico s but the farmers water associations in china do not carry out its functions well hu et al 2014 in israel the governmental water and sewerage authority was established in 2007 which is responsible for implementing water supply schemes and regulating water pricing gruÃ¨re et al 2020 this brings enough support to implement israel s strict quota system and to develop water saving agriculture molle 2009 oecd 2020 the process of agricultural water pricing in developed countries provides excellent lessons for developing countries in france water pricing requires an assessment of the investment in water supply projects and the average income of farmers as well as the reasonable investigation of water prices by river basin committees and local water commissions table 1 the final agricultural water prices are negotiated by local governments farmers and farmers water associations berbel et al 2019 in the whole pricing process the responsibilities of each department are clear the pricing is transparent and multiple stakeholders are involved in the water pricing yang et al 2013 however developing countries are constrained by inadequate mechanisms conflicting departmental functions difficulties in water metering poor water services and lack of basis for pricing making it difficult to develop a reasonable water price formation mechanism therefore in order to ensure that the water pricing process is reasonable and effective the central government of china has emphasized both the construction of mechanisms such as pricing mechanisms water rights allocation water project management system as well as the construction of engineering support such as the construction of the final canal system and the popularization of metering facilities developed countries pursue not only covers o m cost but also the recovery of capital cost such as australia in these countries irrigation services are provided by profitable companies and their agricultural water prices are more market based and tend to reflect the scarcity of water resources this difference also occurs in developing countries for example mexico started the market operation of agricultural water decades ago but in china because irrigation services are provided by the government it is difficult to market the pricing of agricultural water in these countries where agricultural irrigation s costs are borne by the government for food security cost recovery is very slow and puts more pressure on national finance what s more some eu member states are trying to cover the environmental and resource costs erc of water following the wfd however no member state has been able to propose a workable plan for the assessment of erc berbel and expÃ³sito 2020 agricultural water pricing in developing countries is more pragmatic due to their economic development and food security the pricing methods in developing countries are shown in table 1 some developing countries take covering o m cost as the main target of pricing such as mexico pakistan and china in china the water pricing reform is to recover o m cost as much as possible to ensure daily operations and to gradually recover full water supply cost to promote financial sustainability a few countries have implemented full water supply cost pricing such as south africa speelman et al 2009 however almost all developing countries need subsidy policies to support pricing to be accepted and enforced there are many practical obstacles to implement agricultural water pricing reform in developing countries the iranian water authority started working on raising agricultural water prices in 2019 but study shows that raising agricultural water prices will never effectively reduce water use unless price adjustments are accompanied by infrastructure development momeni et al 2019 in india volume based pricing has not been implemented to date due to the lack of water metering infrastructure this highlights the embarrassment that agricultural water management in developing countries still faces inadequate infrastructure therefore poor and inadequate infrastructure development is a major impediment to the implementation of water pricing in developing countries in addition higher water prices have put pressure on farmers in developing countries a study in south africa showed that the poorer farmers were most affected by higher water prices and would no longer be profitable at higher water prices speelman et al 2009 therefore in the absence of appropriate subsidies water pricing reforms are likely to be caught in a dilemma in developing countries moderate subsidies are beneficial to improve farmers acceptance of higher water price and guarantee the daily operation of irrigation facilities as shown in table 1 in the united states financial subsidies are offered to infrastructure to reduce investment costs and impoverished farmers are able to receive direct subsidies from a family support fund fsl berbel et al 2007 in israel the government is responsible for the construction of the irrigation project and water supply network as well as sharing 30 of the o m costs katz 2013 in japan farmers bear the o m costs a flat rate based on area and the government bears most of the capital costs nickum and ogura 2010 similar subsidy methods are reflected in developing countries such as south africa mexico pakistan and china however over subsidization is detrimental to sustainability in the agricultural sector despite the higher economic benefits it can bring to farmers in korea the irrigation of rice fields in some large irrigation projects is free of charge table 1 nickum and ogura 2010 the over subsidization for water price causes the overexploitation of water resources and unsustainable water supply lessons from the extensive analysis of agricultural water management in developed countries can be learned by developing countries price leverage is a common tool used to regulate water use efficiency however increasing the water price is a challenge in developing countries where farmers are used to having access to inexpensive or free water hellegers and perry 2006 wang et al 2016 sustainable water pricing requires the support of management structure and multi sectoral collaboration chen et al 2020 for developing countries the infrastructure is a safeguard for water pricing reform which is still lacking in the agricultural sector subsidy policies can avoid exceeding farmers affordability but affordability assessment and negotiation are required to reduce over subsidization 4 the reform scheme and progress of agricultural water pricing reform in china for china the first feature of agricultural water management is that smallholder farmers are the mainstay of china s agriculture and extremely sensitive to water prices the affordability of farmers should be considered in the water pricing the second feature is that china s irrigation services have long been provided by the government and water prices in most areas have to be shared by the government it will be hard to reflect the water resource scarcity only by water pricing and the effect of improving water efficiency will be limited however the water quota management allocation of water rights and the incentive and subsidy system could make up for this shortcoming the third feature is that as the most populous country and a major agricultural country food security is an important bottom line for agricultural policy making in china which is also a priority for most developing countries therefore agricultural water pricing has to minimize the impact on agricultural productivity therefore china s agricultural water pricing reform implements a comprehensive scheme for promoting sustainable water management in the agricultural sector the reform is committed to improving the efficiency of agricultural water use and promoting the development of water saving agriculture through the adjustment of the agricultural water price structure reasonable pricing and precise subsidies and water saving incentives are the core water pricing mechanisms which try to cover o m costs or full water supply costs through water price increases and use precise subsidies and water saving incentives to reduce farmers burdens in the meanwhile the measure of infrastructure development and management provides a guarantee mechanism for the implementation of water pricing the popularization of accurate metering facilities the construction of water supply networks and the construction and repair of farmland water conservancy projects have all effectively supported the formulation of reasonable water prices on this basis reformed water pricing combined with strict quota control management will become an important tool for agricultural water management the comprehensive agricultural water pricing reform scheme is illustrated in fig 2 a to show how the reform mitigates the threat of water shortage to china s sustainable agricultural development and the scheme before the reform is shown in fig 2 b for comparison 4 1 reasonable pricing as with most developing countries china has a long standing policy of low agricultural water prices to ensure food security and develop agricultural productivity resulting in low water use efficiency the issue of how to improve water efficiency and change farmers perceptions of water use through reasonable water pricing is a common problem faced by developing countries since 1965 the government has been trying to redefine water prices to reflect the cost of the water supply through policy changes as shown in fig 3 however a better price formation mechanism has yet to be developed zhong and mol 2010 before the reform the collection rate of water fees was 62 covering only 22 of the water supply costs wang 2021 therefore one of the reform objectives is to establish a reasonable water pricing mechanism that reflects the water supply cost to ensure the operation and maintenance of water supply projects according to the reform goals from the china central government the agricultural water prices in china will generally reach the price level of o m costs by 2026 and in developed regions are suggested to be increased to the level of full supply costs o m costs and capital costs the water pricing process is shown in fig 2 a by green lines the irrigation districts and water conservancy stations develop the initial agricultural water pricing plans based on the water supply cost of irrigation backbone projects following which the initial plans are submitted to the local government for approval the local governments determine the final water pricing plan by negotiating with the farmers water associations to ensure that the increased water price is acceptable by farmers the whole process highlights the flexible pricing principle to respond to the actual pricing needs of different irrigation districts different water sources and different irrigation methods section 5 the new agricultural water price formed in this reform does not cover environmental costs and opportunity costs because china s agricultural sector which is dominated by small farmers cannot afford the extremely high agricultural water price increases brought about by these two aspects in the current stage the reform is not to blindly raise water prices but to follow the principle of not increasing too much burden on farmers reasonable pricing means trying to tap the price space within the affordability of farmers to reflect the value of water resources especially after the reduce of the total water consumption an appropriate increase in the water price will not bring too much water expenses to farmers 4 2 precise subsidies and water saving incentive raising water prices without increasing the burden on farmers is a common challenge in developing countries sampath 1992 therefore precise subsidies and water saving incentive mechanisms are required to support the implementation of water pricing orange line in fig 2 a the funding of precise subsidies and water saving incentive policies provided by central government grants and local government support are mainly used for daily operation and investment of irrigation districts and water saving of water users orange boxes in fig 2 a the precise subsidies are granted based on the detailed standards of each region in order to improve the efficiency of the funding and avoid over subsidization subsidies to farmers reduce the burden of water use and subsidies to irrigation districts guarantee daily operation and maintenance similarly diverse incentives have stimulated farmers to save water and contributed to a shift in their cropping pattern fang and zhang 2020 han and zhao 2007 mu et al 2019 4 3 infrastructure development and management the construction of farmland water projects management system reform momeni et al 2019 and improvement of water supply services pirages 2000 are necessary conditions for the implementation of the water pricing reform prior to the reform the lack of metering facilities led to inaccurate accounting of water volume and inefficient management systems resulted in inadequate water supply services therefore the mechanism of infrastructure development and management provides an important safeguard for the implementation of water pricing the infrastructure primarily focuses on water metering facilities and the construction of water supply facilities which are financially supported by central and local governments orange boxes in fig 2 a well developed water supply facilities help farmers save labor time and cost and accurate metering facilities enable volumetric pricing based on water consumption as shown by the blue lines in fig 2 a services related to water supply are mainly provided by irrigation districts water conservancy stations and farmers water associations the management reform of irrigation districts and water conservancy stations involves strengthening o m management and the efficient use of funds and the management reform of farmers water associations aims to standardize development and improve services for water users 4 4 quota control management the relatively homogeneous water management structure and ambiguous division of responsibilities prior to the reform led to inefficient agricultural water management fig 2 b clarifying water rights can delineate the boundaries of responsibility for management departments at different levels and improve the efficiency and equity of water resources allocation hence the mechanism of quota control management is adopted to implement the water rights system as shown in fig 2 a by gray line the provincial government controls total consumption and implements a strict water quota gradually diluting water rights water rights are clarified by the area cultivated irrigation water use coefficient and water quota for different crops which ensures fairness in water allocation and avoids waste caused by water management uncertainty in addition agricultural water trading is promoted in some provinces and both irrigation districts and farmers water associations authorized by farmers are able to participate in water rights transactions purple lines in fig 2 a which improves the efficiency of water allocation and maximize water use benefits delorit and block 2018 the establishment of an agricultural water rights system is the basis for strengthening agricultural water management as a special commodity water resources need to be allocated in an administrative manner according to the combination of supply and demand by limiting the total amount of water use in the region and the amount of water used by each water using subject agricultural water rights can be clearly defined so that measures such as progressive price increase over the limit water saving incentives and government water rights buy back can be implemented to stimulate agricultural water saving based on water rights 4 5 progress of water pricing reform a series of comprehensive reform measures support the promotion of the reform in china leading to more sustainable agricultural water management schemes as of the end of 2020 the cumulative area of reform implementation in china has exceeded 430 million mu the reform is being promoted through local pilot demonstrations to the country beijing shanghai jiangsu and zhejiang have taken the lead in completing the reform tasks and the reform progress in tianjin inner mongolia liaoning shandong yunnan shaanxi gansu and qinghai has exceeded 50 ndrc 2021 however there has been an inconsistency in the progress of reform in china the 31 provinces in china were divided into seven geographical divisions as shown in table 2 at the end of 2019 only east china and northwest china had achieved the expected reform implementation progress over 40 indicating that the reform gap across provinces had continued to increase the northern areas made more progress than the southern and eastern areas and are well ahead in the reform progress compared to central and western areas as the central government needs to achieve the reform goals by the end of the 14th five year plan in 2025 the provinces especially the areas where the reform progress is lagging need to formulate or adjust the reform schedule to reasonably arrange the reform work the agricultural water pricing reform has increased the water use efficiency and the agricultural water saving effects are shown in table 3 the water saving rates ranging from 17 5 to 40 in demonstration areas which confirm the reform measures in various regions have made progress in saving water and increasing efficiency water saving per unit area ranges from 315 to 5888 m3 hm 2 showing the potential for water savings in the agricultural sector progress in water saving in the agricultural sector releases more water rights for trading some regions have attempted market based trading of agricultural water rights svensson et al 2021 for instance the saved water rights are bought back by the government at a price of 1 cny m3 and pooled for new industrial water demand in chengan county hebei province cui et al 2019 however current water trading has limited influence relies on administrative means and lacks market regulations to guide stakeholders 5 innovation and practice of reform mechanisms and measures with the advancement of agricultural water pricing reform from 2006 to 2020 relevant policies guiding reform activities have been regularly updated the chinese government has consistently emphasized mechanism establishment and agricultural infrastructure development fig 4 and eventually creating a policy direction of mechanism establishment first and then agricultural infrastructure development from 2017 ndrc 2021 for example the water pricing mechanism for the end canal system was established in 2008 with the implementation of water saving renovation projects water supply cost accounting and precision measurement facility development were used to promote reasonable water pricing when the water pricing mechanism was enhanced from 2014 to 2018 from the pilot reform stage to the full scale promotion stage these two strategies have complemented each other and made great contributions to agricultural water pricing reform owing to disparity in the economic development of various regions in china water pricing reforms need to be tailored according to specific local conditions several flexible pricing methods such as full cost and block water pricing are combined to meet the requirements for reasonable pricing on this basis local government departments have explored and innovated a variety of ways to set agricultural water prices contributing to the formation of a reasonable agricultural water pricing mechanism the main water pricing methods are summarized in fig 5 including uniform pricing negotiated pricing differential pricing quota pricing classified pricing and block pricing even within the same province there may be multiple pricing approaches because of significant difference in farmers income infrastructure development and financial levels as the reform situation improves the current price systems for agricultural water will be changed the reasonable water prices cover higher water supply costs and raises awareness of water commodities among the farmers table 4 shows the agricultural water pricing formation mechanism and practice in the eight pilot areas of shandong and xinjiang provinces although the agricultural water prices in different areas are different the reformed agricultural water prices have covered o m costs and some areas have achieved full water supply cost pricing or even micro profit pricing beyond full water supply cost most reformed areas have adopted a water quota system combined with a block water pricing structure to promote water saving in the agricultural sector in addition flexible pricing methods have been adopted for special areas such as converting the power consumption of well irrigation into water consumption various incentives and subsidy policies have been implemented to encourage water saving and reduce the burden on farmers the characteristics of the local incentives are determined by each region s distinctive policy requirement the specific classification of subsidies is shown in fig 6 the incentive and subsidy methods can be flexibly applied to agricultural water management in different regions in some major grain producing regions e g northeast central and southwest china water prices for grain within the quota are reduced lower and subsidies are provided after modest increase in water prices agricultural areas where water is scarce and dependent on irrigation incentives such as water saving rewards water rights repurchase and water rights trading to encourage water conservation are provided at the same time high water prices for high water consumption crops and low water prices for low water consumption crops encourage planting structure changes in water rich irrigation areas the water quota is closely reviewed and approved and all or part of the water consumed within the quota is not charged however if the water consumption exceeds the quota the tariffs will increase significantly for the economically developed regions e g eastern coastal areas local governments can implement precise subsidy policies in more flexible way to promote water saving behaviors through incentives and subsidies to farmers water associations irrigation districts and major water saving households in addition in some large and medium sized irrigation areas the government will subsidize the pumping station s electricity price as well as the difference between the water price and the operating and maintenance costs in response to the reform requirements local governments have actively developed regulations and standards to strictly enforce subsidies and incentives table 5 shows the implementation and practice of precise subsidies and rational incentives in different regions the scope of the subsidy covers water users irrigation equipment irrigation districts and water saving facilities with detailed subsidy standards incentives are mostly differentiated according to the actual percentage of water savings or the amount of water saved by water users some regions have also introduced incentive policies for water rights trading such as yanchi city although the policies and standards for subsidies and incentives vary greatly from region to region they implement the principles of precise and rational which are conducive to water efficiency and policy sustainability 6 lessons and implications china s water pricing reform is an exploration by developing country on the road to sustainable development of the agricultural sector it has improved water use efficiency and increased cost recovery through reasonable pricing precise subsidies and water saving incentives infrastructure development and management and quota control management 1 reasonable water pricing and implementation the water pricing reform has promoted accurate agricultural water supply cost accounting and provided a basis for water price formulation most of the reformed areas in china adopt o m water pricing for agricultural sector and a few areas and irrigation districts are able to implement full water supply cost pricing there is a marked improvement in the economic sustainability of agricultural water supply compared to before the reform however due to different economic development and actual needs in china it is a more stable solution to fully consider farmers affordability and set the pricing target step by step or one step with the improvement of water use efficiency and the reduction of total water consumption the pricing space will be gradually released and the impact of the gradual increase in water prices on farmers water expenses will be minimized china s lessons illustrate that sustainable agricultural water pricing based on farmers affordability is a pragmatic option for developing countries on this basis differential pricing and negotiated pricing are widely applied with the former able to guide farmers to change their planting structure and the latter promoting acceptance of water pricing reform 2 improved water supply services for better acceptance of reform a common dilemma in developing countries is the difficulty of incentivizing agricultural water use efficiency after raising water prices such as india and iran parween et al 2021 momeni et al 2019 the main reasons are the delayed construction of irrigation water supply networks especially end canal systems and the volumetric metering facilities resulting in low quality water services and non transparent water pricing besides the acceptance of water prices by farmers is significantly affected by the service level of the water supply pirages 2000 improvements in water supply services depend on infrastructure construction and related management systems and it is a huge challenge for developing countries due to the huge budgets and long term planning fortunately the infrastructure development and management in china provides a positive practice for facing this challenge adequate metering facility plays an important role in achieving volume based billing and blocking water pricing structures and the reform started with the transformation of the water supply network aiming to facilitate farmers access to water therefore for developing countries with weak infrastructure it is more important to prioritize the improvement of water supply facilities and services than to increase water prices momeni et al 2019 3 avoiding excessive subsidies and emphasizing financial sustainability even in developed countries subsidy policies are still a common means of supporting the establishment of a water pricing system toan 2016 in developing countries it is necessary to share increased water prices between farmers and other stakeholders to increase farmers acceptance but it usually accompanied by excessive subsidies chu and grafton 2020 toan 2016 china s reform experience shows that precise subsidy policies with clear standards can help avoid excessive subsidies water saving incentive policies have a positive effect on stimulating farmers enthusiasm for water conservation and applying water saving technologies however precise subsidies and water saving incentives require substantial financial support which could create long term economic pressure on governments in developing countries the current reform in china is facing the dilemma of insufficient funds for some local governments and needs to expand funding channels and find third party investments feng 2021 4 strengthening the role of grassroots organizations the total amount of water use control and quota systems is an effective measure in china s reform to promote water equity and develop water saving agriculture both china and israel have demonstrated the role of government leadership in advancing their strict water quota systems gruÃ¨re et al 2020 farmers water associations serve as the foundation for water allocation and are expected to be crucial in advancing the reform at the community level hu et al 2014 however it is found that farmers water associations have not played a full role in the reform facing problems such as overlapping functions with village committees uneven acceptance by farmers and limited influence in local areas hu et al 2014 qiao et al 2009 chen et al 2020 financial support and professional technical training are required to make a better performance in the daily work which is where china should make further efforts feng 2021 in addition the reform work needs to be evaluated by a sound performance evaluation system that can supervise the efficiency and stimulate enthusiasm for promoting reform work ndrc 2021 5 applicability of water rights trading water rights trading has been piloted in some regions under the guidance of the chinese government and has initially demonstrated its benefits in improving agricultural water use efficiency although several studies found that water rights systems can reduce water consumption fang and zhang 2020 li and zhao 2018 more studies highlight that the high transaction costs caused by land fragmentation and uncertain hydrological conditions make it unrealistic to conduct large scale water rights transactions in china chen et al 2014 wang 2012 wang et al 2018 therefore the potential and feasibility of establishing water rights trading markets in developing countries should receive more attention the policymakers should consider clarifying trading conditions and norms defining the roles of stakeholders in the water rights trading and providing conflict resolution to avoid negative effects 7 conclusions agricultural water pricing reform and the upgrades of water management schemes and policies are essential for developing countries to move towards a sustainable agricultural sector a review of frontier reform policies and progress shows that agricultural water pricing reform in china has achieved remarkable results in terms of saving water and increasing water use efficiency which provides inspiration for developing countries in terms of policy making of water pricing an integrated pricing method based on farmers affordability is a pragmatic option for sustainable water pricing policies in developing countries it is a mechanism based on the water supply cost accounting that flexibly combines government unified pricing pricing negotiated with farmers quota pricing differential pricing of crops or water sources and classified pricing changing in different regions according to local conditions but the pricing mechanism urgently requires upgrading and matching of irrigation and metering facilities and management systems the precise subsidies and water saving incentives proposed by china provide a solution to price failure caused by excessive subsidies that are common in developing countries some highlight policies such as substitute incentives for subsidies subsidies for water supplier and water price discounts based on crops have effectively guaranteed farmers income and inspired farmers to save water however the current financial constraints of china s reforms highlight the importance of diversifying funding channels for financial sustainability and the execution and work efficiency of grassroots organizations and departments should be stimulated by the comprehensive performance evaluation system in order to exert the reform effect for a long time declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

9223,insufficient soil moisture and heat often limit crop productivity in semiarid regions the effects of the ridge furrow mulching system rfms on improving the soil water and temperature conditions have been confirmed in many studies but the effects of different ridge furrow ratios on the changes in soil water temperature and the interception rate of canopy photosynthetically active radiation parir and thus crop productivity remain unclear therefore we conducted a field experiment from 2015 to 2020 in the loess plateau region of northwest china by testing conventional tillage without mulch ck as a control treatment and three ridge furrow ratios 60 60 cm 80 40 cm and 50 10 cm we studied the changes in the soil hydrothermal characteristics and the response of maize canopy under continuous mulching with different ridge furrow ratios compared with ck rfms increased the soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil layer by 5 2 9 3 and the effective accumulated soil temperature by 10 4 29 1 the hydrothermal properties affected the maize canopy under rfms where compared with ck parir increased by 6 3 11 7 at 61 to 90 days after planting dap and the maize yield finally increased by 44 8 77 9 correlation analysis showed that the contribution of precipitation from 0 to 90 dap to the maize yield was greater than that of the effective accumulated soil temperature whereas the contribution of the effective accumulated soil temperature was greater at 91 to 150 dap the precipitation during 61 to 90 dap was the most important factor that affected the yield during the whole growth period thus increasing the ridge furrow ratio can improve the soil hydrothermal properties and maize productivity to ensure food security and avoid resource shortages in the loess plateau region and similar areas keywords soil water storage effective accumulated soil temperature leaf area index dry matter accumulation photosynthetically active radiation grain yield data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction crop growth depends on the interception of photosynthetically active radiation par by the plant canopy there is often a linear relationship between the par intercepted by field crops and the accumulated biomass monteith and moss 1977 increasing par interception by crops can improve their productivity especially by increasing the photosynthetic period and interception rate of canopy photosynthetically active radiation parir during reproductive growth which are extremely important for obtaining high crop yields uribelarrea et al 2009 the silking stage is the critical stage for entering reproductive growth in maize and increasing parir in the silking stage provides sufficient assimilates to support grain formation which is beneficial for high grain yields zhou et al 2021 water and temperature are the most important environmental factors that affect crop growth and development the jointing silking stage in maize is the most vigorous stage of vegetative growth and the water requirements in this stage account for 43 51 of the total required during the growth period when other environmental factors are not limited the crop development process is mainly controlled by the accumulated temperature zhang 2019 the soil temperature in the root zone significantly affects the photosynthetic characteristics and growth rate of leaves by influencing root growth jia et al 2018 which changes the distribution of leaves in the canopy liu et al 2009a liu et al 2009b to directly affect the parir wang et al 2017 therefore increasing the soil moisture and temperature can accelerate crop canopy growth and provide the basis for dry matter formation expansion of the canopy can improve the absorption and utilization of soil water and nutrients thereby exerting a feedback regulatory effect on crop growth in order to ensure the sustainability of agricultural production the ridge furrow mulching system rfms technique has been applied widely in dryland farming systems in recent years including in areas such as the eastern africa plateau mo et al 2016 australia daryanto et al 2017 northern turkey yildirim et al 2022 and tibet plateau duan et al 2022 studies have confirmed that rfms can help achieve the aim of high crop yields the loess plateau in northwest china is a typical arid and semi arid region where abundant light resources provide sufficient energy for crop production bu et al 2013 however due to the insufficient availability of agricultural water this region has been hindered by low crop productivity and food insecurity for a long time studies of crop production in this region have demonstrated significant yield increases following the adoption rfms liu et al 2009a liu et al 2009b mo et al 2018 the beneficial effect of rfms on crop productivity in dryland farming is mainly due to the significantly increased soil water content in the planting furrows xu et al 2021 and thus the impact of rfms on crop yields is closely related to the precipitation during the growth period zhang et al 2018 in addition the film applied to cover the ridges effectively retains soil thermal radiation by condensing water droplets under the film thereby increasing the surface soil temperature zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c and limiting the soil cooling rate at night gan et al 2013 to accelerate the growth of the canopy a good canopy reduces the proportion of light that reaches the ground to ultimately increase parir and provide the basis for higher crop yields gong et al 2021 the ridge furrow structure and mulching ratios are important technical indexes that affect the regulatory effect of rfms on the soil hydrothermal conditions and the capacity to increase crop yields and they can directly lead to differences in the parir and yield li et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c therefore optimizing the ridge furrow ratio in rfms is essential for increasing the crop productivity in dryland farming wang et al 2015 studies have shown that increasing the width of the film mulched ridge can improve the soil hydrothermal properties and accumulation of dry matter liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020a luo et al 2021 in addition increasing the width of the film covered ridge can reflect more par into the canopy by enlarging the row spacing of adjacent ridges awal et al 2006 to improve the par conditions for the crop canopy thereby increasing the leaf area index lai and parir by contrast reducing the width of the film mulched ridge weakens the ability of par to penetrate the lower crop canopy by reducing the plant row spacing which can lead to premature leaf senescence in the lower canopy borrÃ¡s et al 2003 and ultimately reduce the yield the effects of testing different ridge furrow ratios on the parir and yield were inconsistent in previous studies thereby limiting the further technical optimization of rfms moreover few long term studies have investigated how to improve the soil hydrothermal properties and parir by using different ridge furrow ratios and the cumulative effects on the soil hydrothermal properties and parir under long term positioning remain unclear therefore we conducted a field positioning experiment with three different ridge furrow ratios for six consecutive years to assess the variations in the soil hydrothermal properties and the response in terms of parir the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to determine the characteristic variations in the soil hydrothermal properties under different ridge furrow ratios in rfms 2 to assess the effects of different ridge furrow ratios on maize growth and the canopy characteristics and 3 to determine the regulatory effects of different ridge furrow ratios on the grain yield in order to provide a theoretical basis for improved sustainable maize production in semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field positioning experiment was conducted during 2015 to 2020 in pengyang

furrow zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c in the present study sws increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased in wet years and similar results were obtained by liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b in normal and dry years the water storage was higher under ck than rfms during 91 to 120 dap because film mulching under rfms led to rapid maize growth and the consumption of soil water was especially rapid during 61 to 90 dap thereby offsetting the effect of rfms on improving the water status in the early growth stage zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c where the differences were more obvious as the ridge furrow ratio increased as maize plants mature transpiration and soil evaporation decrease and thus the effect of rfms on increasing the soil moisture gradually recovers mo et al 2016 we found that the sws capacity in the fallow period was positively correlated with the ridge furrow ratio which provided favorable conditions for seed germination and the emergence of the next season s crop film mulching reduces the loss of heat by impeding the exchange of water and air between the soil and atmosphere as well as increasing the absorption of solar radiation in the surface soil to increase the soil temperature zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c rfms significantly increased eat during the growing season compared with ck hu et al 2014 li et al 2017 wang et al 2005 found that the surface temperature of furrows covered with film was 3 6 c higher than that of furrows without film mulching in the initial crop growth stage but there was no difference in the later growth stage in this study compared with ck the maximum increase in the soil temperature occurred at 31 to 60 dap because the crop was in the seeding establishment state in the early growth stage and thus the surface area of the canopy was small so most areas of the film covered ridge received solar radiation lee and park 2020 at this time the area of the furrow without film mulching had a positive impact on the soil temperature after 31 to 60 dap the canopy gradually expanded until the canopy closed thereby reducing the warming effect of rfms on the soil gan et al 2013 in addition precipitation in the growing season greatly affects eat in the present study eat was significantly higher under rfms than ck in normal and dry years but there was no significant difference in eat under r6f6 and ck in wet years possibly because r6f6 increased the soil water content but the specific heat capacity of water increased the soil temperature slowly wang et al 2008 the heat required to evaporate soil water led to heat losses which weakened the capacity to increase the soil temperature and retain it under insulation with r6f6 4 2 lai and dm by improving the soil moisture and temperature conditions rfms promotes the capture and absorption of par by crops thereby allowing the leaf canopy to expand and lai is increased as a direct consequence zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c the maximum lai values in the growing seasons all occurred at 90 dap except in 2017 fig 6 which was mainly due to the severe drought in the early maize growth stage during 2017 in 2017 maize plants were subjected to drought and high temperatures in the early growth stage and the precipitation was only 21 mm during 61 to 90 dap which hindered plant growth as well as causing leaf wilting and curling during 91 to 120 dap the increased precipitation allowed more water to reach the leaves and the lai reached the maximum when the leaves expanded fully crop yields are closely related to the amount of precipitation in the growing season in rain fed regions mo et al 2017 rfms increases the soil water availability and soil temperature to promote crop growth and ultimately increase the yield in this study increasing the ridge furrow ratio increased the total biomass mainly because in addition to the occurrence of strong evaporation light 5 mm and heavy 10 20 mm precipitation events frequently occurred in this region and the alternating ridge furrow arrangement structure under rfms collected the rain in addition the ridge furrow structure provided protection to prevent losses of rainfall by runoff when the precipitation was heavy mo et al 2018 the ridge furrow ratio directly increased the amount of precipitation collected and increased the crop yield as also shown by liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b 4 3 par interception light is essential for plant growth and development and it is the main factor that determines crop productivity fang et al 2018 rfms promotes crop growth by improving the soil water availability and soil temperature thereby facilitating expansion of the canopy to increase par interception by the canopy liu et al 2010 and thus parir increased in the present study fig 6 table 2 as also found by ali et al 2019 the treatment with the largest ridge furrow ratio obtained the largest average parir because this treatment covered a larger area and increased the par reflected from the ground to crops to increase parir in addition the relatively large ridge furrow ratio under r8f4 utilized narrow rows in the field compared with r6f6 and ck equal row spacing of 60 cm the alternate wide and narrow rows was advantageous for improving the light distribution in the field and increasing parir raza et al 2019 increasing the ridge furrow ratio increased par in the reproductive growth period by increasing parir during the silking stage and thus more light was available in the critical period for grain growth and maturity so the dm and grain yield were higher bu et al 2013 liu et al 2010 studies have shown that increasing parir in the crop canopy can help to maximize yields fang et al 2006 in the six growing seasons in the present study the average parir was 11 6 higher under r5f1 than ck thereby providing the basis for higher yields 4 4 yield and yield components from agronomic and physiological perspectives improving the crop emergence rate and seeding growth rate are important for enhancing crop growth the yield components and final yield unger 1975 the temperature in the early stage of crop growth and effective precipitation in the critical growth stage significantly affect the crop yield mo et al 2017 our results showed that the improved soil moisture before silking and increased eat after silking were mainly associated with the increased maize yield the film mulching conditions under rfms improved the capacity for collecting precipitation to alleviate the low seedling emergence rate and unsuccessful development caused by drought in the early growth stage after silking according to field observations the treatment with the highest ridge furrow ratio avoided the effects of low temperature and freezing before ripening and physiological maturity was reached earlier due to the better soil hydrothermal properties and thus the grain yield increased and similar results were obtained by zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c the impact of rfms on the grain yield was also affected by the climatic conditions schwartz et al 2019 rfms reduced the effects of drought stress on the grain yield in drought years liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020a in this study only 2017 was a dry year and the continuous high temperatures and dry weather severely affected maize growth and development osakabe et al 2014 and thus almost no grain yield was obtained without rfms under the severe drought conditions the grain yield under r5f1 was significantly higher than that under ck possibly because r5f1 obtained the optimal evapotranspiration redistribution strategy where the alternate wetting and drying of the soil adapted to the local precipitation characteristics thereby promoting the utilization of deep soil water by the crop to alleviate the impact of extreme drought on productivity in the sensitive stages to some extent zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c the crop yield is related to the amount of precipitation each year but also to the distribution of the precipitation in different growth stages wang et al 2016 in the present study the precipitation during 61 to 90 dap pgp3 was the most critical factor that determined the maize yield fig 8 table 4 to ensure sustainable production using the r5f1 ridge furrow ratio maize will not fail even when the precipitation is only 18 7 mm during 61 to 90 dap 5 conclusion in the present study rfms inhibited soil evaporation and increased eat in a semi arid region the precipitation before 90 dap significantly affected the grain yield but the contribution of eat to the grain yield gradually increased after 90 dap among the different ridge furrow ratios r5f1 significantly increased the sws before 90 dap which facilitated canopy expansion to increase parir and promote photosynthate formation in addition r5f1 significantly increased eat in the later growth stage to increase the grain yield thereby achieving the goal of high and stable spring maize yields r5f1 can ensure successful spring maize production when the precipitation is more than 18 7 mm during 61 to 90 dap in general r5f1 obtained the best soil hydrothermal properties and the highest grain yield was obtained when the precipitation during 61 to 90 dap was only 18 7 mm the results obtained in the present study provide a theoretical and empirical basis for optimizing the ridge furrow ratio under

9223,insufficient soil moisture and heat often limit crop productivity in semiarid regions the effects of the ridge furrow mulching system rfms on improving the soil water and temperature conditions have been confirmed in many studies but the effects of different ridge furrow ratios on the changes in soil water temperature and the interception rate of canopy photosynthetically active radiation parir and thus crop productivity remain unclear therefore we conducted a field experiment from 2015 to 2020 in the loess plateau region of northwest china by testing conventional tillage without mulch ck as a control treatment and three ridge furrow ratios 60 60 cm 80 40 cm and 50 10 cm we studied the changes in the soil hydrothermal characteristics and the response of maize canopy under continuous mulching with different ridge furrow ratios compared with ck rfms increased the soil water storage in the 0 200 cm soil layer by 5 2 9 3 and the effective accumulated soil temperature by 10 4 29 1 the hydrothermal properties affected the maize canopy under rfms where compared with ck parir increased by 6 3 11 7 at 61 to 90 days after planting dap and the maize yield finally increased by 44 8 77 9 correlation analysis showed that the contribution of precipitation from 0 to 90 dap to the maize yield was greater than that of the effective accumulated soil temperature whereas the contribution of the effective accumulated soil temperature was greater at 91 to 150 dap the precipitation during 61 to 90 dap was the most important factor that affected the yield during the whole growth period thus increasing the ridge furrow ratio can improve the soil hydrothermal properties and maize productivity to ensure food security and avoid resource shortages in the loess plateau region and similar areas keywords soil water storage effective accumulated soil temperature leaf area index dry matter accumulation photosynthetically active radiation grain yield data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction crop growth depends on the interception of photosynthetically active radiation par by the plant canopy there is often a linear relationship between the par intercepted by field crops and the accumulated biomass monteith and moss 1977 increasing par interception by crops can improve their productivity especially by increasing the photosynthetic period and interception rate of canopy photosynthetically active radiation parir during reproductive growth which are extremely important for obtaining high crop yields uribelarrea et al 2009 the silking stage is the critical stage for entering reproductive growth in maize and increasing parir in the silking stage provides sufficient assimilates to support grain formation which is beneficial for high grain yields zhou et al 2021 water and temperature are the most important environmental factors that affect crop growth and development the jointing silking stage in maize is the most vigorous stage of vegetative growth and the water requirements in this stage account for 43 51 of the total required during the growth period when other environmental factors are not limited the crop development process is mainly controlled by the accumulated temperature zhang 2019 the soil temperature in the root zone significantly affects the photosynthetic characteristics and growth rate of leaves by influencing root growth jia et al 2018 which changes the distribution of leaves in the canopy liu et al 2009a liu et al 2009b to directly affect the parir wang et al 2017 therefore increasing the soil moisture and temperature can accelerate crop canopy growth and provide the basis for dry matter formation expansion of the canopy can improve the absorption and utilization of soil water and nutrients thereby exerting a feedback regulatory effect on crop growth in order to ensure the sustainability of agricultural production the ridge furrow mulching system rfms technique has been applied widely in dryland farming systems in recent years including in areas such as the eastern africa plateau mo et al 2016 australia daryanto et al 2017 northern turkey yildirim et al 2022 and tibet plateau duan et al 2022 studies have confirmed that rfms can help achieve the aim of high crop yields the loess plateau in northwest china is a typical arid and semi arid region where abundant light resources provide sufficient energy for crop production bu et al 2013 however due to the insufficient availability of agricultural water this region has been hindered by low crop productivity and food insecurity for a long time studies of crop production in this region have demonstrated significant yield increases following the adoption rfms liu et al 2009a liu et al 2009b mo et al 2018 the beneficial effect of rfms on crop productivity in dryland farming is mainly due to the significantly increased soil water content in the planting furrows xu et al 2021 and thus the impact of rfms on crop yields is closely related to the precipitation during the growth period zhang et al 2018 in addition the film applied to cover the ridges effectively retains soil thermal radiation by condensing water droplets under the film thereby increasing the surface soil temperature zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c and limiting the soil cooling rate at night gan et al 2013 to accelerate the growth of the canopy a good canopy reduces the proportion of light that reaches the ground to ultimately increase parir and provide the basis for higher crop yields gong et al 2021 the ridge furrow structure and mulching ratios are important technical indexes that affect the regulatory effect of rfms on the soil hydrothermal conditions and the capacity to increase crop yields and they can directly lead to differences in the parir and yield li et al 2017 zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c therefore optimizing the ridge furrow ratio in rfms is essential for increasing the crop productivity in dryland farming wang et al 2015 studies have shown that increasing the width of the film mulched ridge can improve the soil hydrothermal properties and accumulation of dry matter liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020a luo et al 2021 in addition increasing the width of the film covered ridge can reflect more par into the canopy by enlarging the row spacing of adjacent ridges awal et al 2006 to improve the par conditions for the crop canopy thereby increasing the leaf area index lai and parir by contrast reducing the width of the film mulched ridge weakens the ability of par to penetrate the lower crop canopy by reducing the plant row spacing which can lead to premature leaf senescence in the lower canopy borrÃ¡s et al 2003 and ultimately reduce the yield the effects of testing different ridge furrow ratios on the parir and yield were inconsistent in previous studies thereby limiting the further technical optimization of rfms moreover few long term studies have investigated how to improve the soil hydrothermal properties and parir by using different ridge furrow ratios and the cumulative effects on the soil hydrothermal properties and parir under long term positioning remain unclear therefore we conducted a field positioning experiment with three different ridge furrow ratios for six consecutive years to assess the variations in the soil hydrothermal properties and the response in terms of parir the objectives of this study were as follows 1 to determine the characteristic variations in the soil hydrothermal properties under different ridge furrow ratios in rfms 2 to assess the effects of different ridge furrow ratios on maize growth and the canopy characteristics and 3 to determine the regulatory effects of different ridge furrow ratios on the grain yield in order to provide a theoretical basis for improved sustainable maize production in semi arid regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site description the field positioning experiment was conducted during 2015 to 2020 in pengyang

1954 2 2 experimental design and field management a randomized block design was used in the experiment conventional tillage without mulching was implemented as the control ck the three ridge furrow ratios used in the rfms treatments were as follow r6f6 ridge furrow ratio 60 60 cm r8f4 80 40 cm and r5f1 50 10 cm fig 3 the film mulch was applied on the ridge for rainfall harvesting where the height of the ridge was 15 cm and no film mulch was placed in the furrow the seeds were planted at the side of the film in the furrow the planting density was 82500 plants ha 1 and each treatment was repeated three times in 12 plots with an area of 60 m2 6 m 10 m ten days before sowing alternate ridges and furrows were established the same amount of fertilizer was applied for each treatment and all fertilizer was applied as base fertilizer once before sowing n 230 kg ha 1 p2o5 115 kg ha 1 finally transparent polyethylene plastic film was applied to cover the ridges thickness 0 008 mm spring maize dafeng 30 was sown using a manually powered hole drilling machine at a depth of 5 cm in the furrows between the ridges in late april and harvested in early october throughout the growing season weeds were manually removed and no irrigation was supplied after harvesting the plastic film was not removed to retain moisture in the soil until the next sowing season 2 3 sampling and measurements 2

fig 4 shows that rfms significantly increased the sws in the 0 200 cm soil layer and increasing the ridge furrow ratio had a positive effect on the sws in the six growing seasons the sws values under all treatments tended to increase before decreasing and then increasing again and the increases were significant during 0 to 90 dap from 2015 to 2017 when the rainfall was low normal normal and dry years respectively the increases compared with ck were 10 8 under r6f6 14 9 under r8f4 and 17 5 under r5f1 in 2018 to 2020 the increases were 6 0 6 3 and 10 0 respectively and the differences between the different ridge furrow ratios were larger than those in wet years compared with ck the average sws values at sowing were 7 7 9 4 and 15 9 higher under r6f6 r8f4 and r5f1 respectively during the six growing seasons the eat of the surface soil 0 20 cm was significantly higher under the rfms treatments than ck fig 5 in the six growing seasons compared with ck the average eat was 113 6 c higher under r6f6 245 6 c higher under r8f4 and 316 4 c higher under r5f1 the effect of rfms on increasing the eat mainly occurred in eat2 and eat3 in the six growing seasons compared with ck r6f6 r8f4 and r5f1 increased eat2 by 31 4 c 62 8 c and 67 8 c respectively and increased eat3 by 23 6 c 44 1 c and 50 3 c 3 2 changes in lai and dm increasing the ridge furrow ratio significantly increased the lai fig 6 in the six growing seasons the lai generally increased under all treatments and the maximum values occurred during 61 to 90 dap followed by 91 to 120 dap the rfms treatments obtained the largest increases in the lai values in the dry year 2017 compared with ck the lai values increased by 91 6 110 1 and 111 6 under r6f6 r8f4 and r5f1 from 61 to 120 dap in the dry year 2017 respectively by 24 5 34 9 and 40 6 in normal years 2015 to 2016 and by 13 6 22 3 and 31 3 in wet years 2018 to 2020 the increases in the dm values under rfms were consistent with those in the lai values fig 7 compared with ck the accumulated dm value under each treatment was highest in the dry year but moderate in the wet years and lowest in the normal years compared with ck the average dm values in the mature stage were 90 9 104 3 and 115 1 higher under r6f6 r8f4 and r5f1 in the dry year respectively 19 8 40 9 and 44 5 higher in wet years and 21 6 21 9 and 33 8 higher in normal years 3 3 parir the parir values on the ridges and in the furrows differed significantly under the different ridge furrow ratios during the filling stage table 2 the maximum average parir values on the ridge and in the furrow were obtained under r5f1 and r8f4 respectively compared with ck the average parir values were 6 7 8 7 and 11 6 higher under r6f6 r8f4 and r5f1 respectively in particular the increase was greatest during the severe drought in 2017 when the values under r6f6 r8f4 and r5f1 were 18 5 25 3 and 31 8 higher respectively compared with ck 3 4 gy grain yield components and hi overall rfms positively affected the maize grain yield components table 3 compared with ck under r6f6 r8f4 and r5f1 the number of grains per ear increased by 24 2 40 1 and 44 4 respectively and the 100 grain weight increased by 11 9 14 4 and 18 7 and both contributed to the grain yield improvements thus compared with ck the gy was 40 9 higher under r6f6 64 8 higher under r8f4 and 73 7 higher under r5f1 similar improvements were found in the tb 26 3 45 8 and hi 10 0 13 5 anova showed that the year and ridge furrow ratio significantly affected the 100 grain weight gy and tb p 0 01 and the interaction between the year and ridge furrow ratio significantly affected the 100 grain weight and tb p 0 05 3 5 relationships between maize yield and soil hydrothermal properties the rda ordination diagram in fig 8 shows the relationships between the tb gy and soil hydrothermal properties the result showed that the tb and gy were positively correlated the soil hydrothermal properties and precipitation accounted for 92 7 of the variations in the tb and gy precipitation from jointing to silking pgp3 f 14 8 p 0 002 had the strongest correlations with the tb and gy followed by sws before sowing swsb f 22 3 p 0

eat4 pgp4 eat5 pgp5 fitting the precipitation and grain yield data from 61 to 90 dap pgp3 in the six growing seasons fig 9 showed that the minimum precipitation levels during 61 to 90 dap under r6f6 r8f4 r5f1 and ck were 22 8 21 1 18 7 and 25 6 mm respectively and the maize did not fail 4 discussion 4 1 sws and eat in the semi arid loess plateau region spring crops are subjected to both drought and low temperature stresses during the early growth stage especially in the seedling establishment stage rfms enhances the capture of precipitation for crops where water is retained in the planting furrow zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c in the present study sws increased as the ridge furrow ratio increased in wet years and similar results were obtained by liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b in normal and dry years the water storage was higher under ck than rfms during 91 to 120 dap because film mulching under rfms led to rapid maize growth and the consumption of soil water was especially rapid during 61 to 90 dap thereby offsetting the effect of rfms on improving the water status in the early growth stage zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c where the differences were more obvious as the ridge furrow ratio increased as maize plants mature transpiration and soil evaporation decrease and thus the effect of rfms on increasing the soil moisture gradually recovers mo et al 2016 we found that the sws capacity in the fallow period was positively correlated with the ridge furrow ratio which provided favorable conditions for seed germination and the emergence of the next season s crop film mulching reduces the loss of heat by impeding the exchange of water and air between the soil and atmosphere as well as increasing the absorption of solar radiation in the surface soil to increase the soil temperature zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c rfms significantly increased eat during the growing season compared with ck hu et al 2014 li et al 2017 wang et al 2005 found that the surface temperature of furrows covered with film was 3 6 c higher than that of furrows without film mulching in the initial crop growth stage but there was no difference in the later growth stage in this study compared with ck the maximum increase in the soil temperature occurred at 31 to 60 dap because the crop was in the seeding establishment state in the early growth stage and thus the surface area of the canopy was small so most areas of the film covered ridge received solar radiation lee and park 2020 at this time the area of the furrow without film mulching had a positive impact on the soil temperature after 31 to 60 dap the canopy gradually expanded until the canopy closed thereby reducing the warming effect of rfms on the soil gan et al 2013 in addition precipitation in the growing season greatly affects eat in the present study eat was significantly higher under rfms than ck in normal and dry years but there was no significant difference in eat under r6f6 and ck in wet years possibly because r6f6 increased the soil water content but the specific heat capacity of water increased the soil temperature slowly wang et al 2008 the heat required to evaporate soil water led to heat losses which weakened the capacity to increase the soil temperature and retain it under insulation with r6f6 4 2 lai and dm by improving the soil moisture and temperature conditions rfms promotes the capture and absorption of par by crops thereby allowing the leaf canopy to expand and lai is increased as a direct consequence zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c the maximum lai values in the growing seasons all occurred at 90 dap except in 2017 fig 6 which was mainly due to the severe drought in the early maize growth stage during 2017 in 2017 maize plants were subjected to drought and high temperatures in the early growth stage and the precipitation was only 21 mm during 61 to 90 dap which hindered plant growth as well as causing leaf wilting and curling during 91 to 120 dap the increased precipitation allowed more water to reach the leaves and the lai reached the maximum when the leaves expanded fully crop yields are closely related to the amount of precipitation in the growing season in rain fed regions mo et al 2017 rfms increases the soil water availability and soil temperature to promote crop growth and ultimately increase the yield in this study increasing the ridge furrow ratio increased the total biomass mainly because in addition to the occurrence of strong evaporation light 5 mm and heavy 10 20 mm precipitation events frequently occurred in this region and the alternating ridge furrow arrangement structure under rfms collected the rain in addition the ridge furrow structure provided protection to prevent losses of rainfall by runoff when the precipitation was heavy mo et al 2018 the ridge furrow ratio directly increased the amount of precipitation collected and increased the crop yield as also shown by liu et al 2020a liu et al 2020b 4 3 par interception light is essential for plant growth and development and it is the main factor that determines crop productivity fang et al 2018 rfms promotes crop growth by improving the soil water availability and soil temperature thereby facilitating expansion of the canopy to increase par interception by the canopy liu et al 2010 and thus parir increased in the present study fig 6 table 2 as also found by ali et al 2019 the treatment with the largest ridge furrow ratio obtained the largest average parir because this treatment covered a larger area and increased the par reflected from the ground to crops to increase parir in addition the relatively large ridge furrow ratio under r8f4 utilized narrow rows in the field compared with r6f6 and ck equal row spacing of 60 cm the alternate wide and narrow rows was advantageous for improving the light distribution in the field and increasing parir raza et al 2019 increasing the ridge furrow ratio increased par in the reproductive growth period by increasing parir during the silking stage and thus more light was available in the critical period for grain growth and maturity so the dm and grain yield were higher bu et al 2013 liu et al 2010 studies have shown that increasing parir in the crop canopy can help to maximize yields fang et al 2006 in the six growing seasons in the present study the average parir was 11 6 higher under r5f1 than ck thereby providing the basis for higher yields 4 4 yield and yield components from agronomic and physiological perspectives improving the crop emergence rate and seeding growth rate are important for enhancing crop growth the yield components and final yield unger 1975 the temperature in the early stage of crop growth and effective precipitation in the critical growth stage significantly affect the crop yield mo et al 2017 our results showed that the improved soil moisture before silking and increased eat after silking were mainly associated with the increased maize yield the film mulching conditions under rfms improved the capacity for collecting precipitation to alleviate the low seedling emergence rate and unsuccessful development caused by drought in the early growth stage after silking according to field observations the treatment with the highest ridge furrow ratio avoided the effects of low temperature and freezing before ripening and physiological maturity was reached earlier due to the better soil hydrothermal properties and thus the grain yield increased and similar results were obtained by zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c the impact of rfms on the grain yield was also affected by the climatic conditions schwartz et al 2019 rfms reduced the effects of drought stress on the grain yield in drought years liu et al 2020b liu et al 2020a in this study only 2017 was a dry year and the continuous high temperatures and dry weather severely affected maize growth and development osakabe et al 2014 and thus almost no grain yield was obtained without rfms under the severe drought conditions the grain yield under r5f1 was significantly higher than that under ck possibly because r5f1 obtained the optimal evapotranspiration redistribution strategy where the alternate wetting and drying of the soil adapted to the local precipitation characteristics thereby promoting the utilization of deep soil water by the crop to alleviate the impact of extreme drought on productivity in the sensitive stages to some extent zhang et al 2019a 2019b 2019c the crop yield is related to the amount of precipitation each year but also to the distribution of the precipitation in different growth stages wang et al 2016 in the present study the precipitation during 61 to 90 dap pgp3 was the most critical factor that determined the maize yield fig 8 table 4 to ensure sustainable production using the r5f1 ridge furrow ratio maize will not fail even when the precipitation is only 18 7 mm during 61 to 90 dap 5 conclusion in the present study rfms inhibited soil evaporation and increased eat in a semi arid region the precipitation before 90 dap significantly affected the grain yield but the contribution of eat to the grain yield gradually increased after 90 dap among the different ridge furrow ratios r5f1 significantly increased the sws before 90 dap which facilitated canopy expansion to increase parir and promote photosynthate formation in addition r5f1 significantly increased eat in the later growth stage to increase the grain yield thereby achieving the goal of high and stable spring maize yields r5f1 can ensure successful spring maize production when the precipitation is more than 18 7 mm during 61 to 90 dap in general r5f1 obtained the best soil hydrothermal properties and the highest grain yield was obtained when the precipitation during 61 to 90 dap was only 18 7 mm the results obtained in the present study provide a theoretical and empirical basis for optimizing the ridge furrow ratio under

9224,drought priming at the vegetative growth stage has been demonstrated to be an effective water regulation strategy to enhance drought resistance in wheat therefore exploring the stress response of winter wheat to different soil water changes during this stage can improve the drought priming strategies this study examined the physiological response of winter wheat during two seasons of greenhouse pot experiments 2018 2019 2019 2020 in the following four treatments adequate water supply control c persistent drought p intermittent drought i and gradual drought g an adequate water supply 75 85 fc field capacity was always maintained for treatment c before jointing plants in treatment p were maintained in a drought state 55 65 fc while in treatment i plants underwent a change in soil water status from 55 65 fc to re watering up to 75 85 fc and back to 55 65 fc after entering the jointing stage plants in treatments p and i were re watered to 75 85 fc there was no water supplied in treatment g throughout the experiment the soil water content swc in treatment g gradually decreased with time 100 34 fc at the same time abscisic acid aba and osmotic substances accumulated exponentially with the reduction of swc the activity of antioxidant protective enzymes increased significantly and the change in the stomatal closure rate was faster than the decrease in photosynthetic rate pn drought priming before jointing in treatments p and i prompted photosynthetic compensation after re watering at the jointing stage with the highest pn in treatment i followed by treatment p and lastly treatment c the drought re watering cycle stimulated the stress response indicators in primed plants hence they were significantly higher than the stable levels in non primed plants specifically the aba level in the leaves increased faster than the other indicators under repeated drought moreover the relationship between photosynthesis and aba was stronger than with antioxidative enzymes and osmolytes besides increasing the number of drought re watering cycles enabled the primed plants to achieve a higher maximum pn after re watering and enhanced the association between soluble sugar and pn overall increasing the frequency of drought re watering enhanced the drought priming effect on the wheat stress response besides there is a time difference in the response of different drought stress indicators to soil water changes the findings in this study provide an empirical reference for better utilization of drought priming strategies to stimulate crop production keywords drought priming photosynthesis abscisic acid anti oxidation enzymes osmolyte accumulation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction agriculture under changing climate conditions is constrained by limited resources the growing human population and adverse environmental changes which together place higher demands on the sustainable production and resilience of crops bailey serres et al 2019 climate change increases the odds of severe and widespread droughts in many regions dai 2012 for example model projections suggest that increased warming of 1 5 2 c could double drought related losses in china su et al 2018 wheat a critical staple crop is highly sensitive to drought stress however with the global population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050 a 60 increase in global wheat production from 3 3 t ha 1 to 5 t ha 1 is needed to cater to their food needs abid et al 2016a daryanto et al 2016 thus improving the productivity of wheat under adverse conditions is a meaningful scientific goal for enhancing food security gupta et al 2020 indeed as the energy and resources obtained by crops are limited maintaining a balance between their growth and stress responses under drought conditions is crucial for crops to thrive zhang et al 2020 therefore exploring the plant stress response under different soil water change regimes is helpful to elucidate this balance and provide a valuable empirical reference for increasing and maintaining wheat productivity under adverse conditions research has shown that crops have stress memory of the adversity they have suffered which affects their response to subsequent adverse conditions backhaus et al 2014 molinier et al 2006 tombesi et al 2018 drought priming involves the exposure of crops to drought in advance to promote their expression of effective drought resistance mechanisms to better cope with subsequent adverse conditions li et al 2015 drought priming in the vegetative growth stage of wheat weakens the adverse effects of drought after flowering abid et al 2017 2016a wang et al 2011 2014 in addition drought priming parents could also have beneficial effects on the resistance of offspring wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2016 the vegetative growth stage is a period of suitable water regulation with 55 65 field capacity fc being a suitable water deficit level to reduce the negative impacts of drought abid et al 2018 daryanto et al 2016 mu et al 2021 drought priming at 55 60 fc at the tillering stage maintains significantly higher yields in wheat than at the jointing stage with different response intensities among different varieties though the trend is similar abid et al 2016a moreover the impact of drought on crops is related to the period extent duration and frequency of its occurrence stallmann et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zou et al 2021 thus drought priming before jointing is an effective strategy for stabilizing wheat yields though different watering regimes may have different effects on the stress response the limitation of photosynthesis under drought plays a critical role in determining crop growth survival and yield in drought prone regions flexas et al 2004a therefore photosynthesis which is closely related to yield provides insight into crop adaptability to environmental stress aliyeva et al 2020 huseynova et al 2016 the photosynthesis rate under water deficit is limited by stomatal related factors where the degree of recovery after rehydration is dependent on the water deficit conditions and other stress responses abid et al 2016b aliyeva et al 2020 farooq et al 2009 mu et al 2022 crops respond to stress degrees by selectively activating different stress response pathways watkinson et al 2003 the stress response on wheat leaves following a short term drought priming is significant which effectively enhances the stress resistance of primed plants abid et al 2016a wang et al 2021a 2021b abscisic acid aba plays an important role in stomatal control stress signaling and grain development in drought primed plants abid et al 2017 wang et al 2021b zhang et al 1987 for example primed wheat plants control their root growth through aba regulation in different zones along the root apex wang et al 2021a in addition aba is involved in both the production of reactive oxygen species ros and stomatal closure in leaves gupta et al 2020 liu et al 2005 wang et al 2013 yan et al 2007 aba activates multiple aba responding genes via snrk2 to trigger stomatal closure and improve water balance gupta et al 2020 ros are involved in the regulation of stomatal closure and opening by aba as a signaling intermediate which is related to h2o2 generation the mehler reaction and photorespiration cruz de carvalho 2008 yan et al 2007 the relationship between aba and ros under drought stress stimulates the up regulation of the antioxidant defense system jiang and zhang 2002 zhu 2016 including superoxide dismutase sod and peroxidase pod in the leaves gechev et al 2006 huseynova et al 2014 in addition the osmotic stress caused by drought leads to the accumulation of carbon rich molecules such as soluble sugar ss and proline pro in the leaves which act as solutes in cells to protect cellular structures from damage farooq et al 2009 muller et al 2011 besides the accumulation of osmolytes in the leaves during drought priming is associated with enhanced drought tolerance in wheat wang et al 2019 owing to their sensitivity to drought the above physiological traits i e aba pro ss sod pod are often used to assess the stress state of crops under water deficit conditions in recent years the production potential of crops and more refined agronomic management have received more attention than ever bailey serres et al 2019 considerable research progress has been made in elucidating the principles and effects of drought priming however treatments are usually relatively simple mimicking and maintaining mild drought conditions for a few days during the designated growth period accordingly it is necessary to evaluate the priming effect on the stress response of winter wheat under more specific water regulation schemes and the recovery after re watering abid et al 2017 2016b since strategies to increase crop productivity by reducing sensitivity to stress responses may fail when stress is very severe zhang et al 2020 besides there is an imbalance between crop stress response and growth under water stress hence necessary to clarify the dynamic link between the stress response of winter wheat and drought intensity in this study winter wheat was subjected to gradual persistent and intermittent drought during the vegetative growth stage to 1 clarify the relationship between physiological responses and the different soil water content levels 2 explore the response and recovery of physiological indicators under different drought priming schemes 3 evaluate the difference in stress response between primed and non primed plants and its relationship with photosynthesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental layout pot experiments were conducted in a glass greenhouse for two seasons at northwest agriculture and forestry university yangling district xianyang shaanxi province china located in a semi humid and drought prone area with annual average sunshine of 2164 h xiaoyan 22 a winter wheat variety commonly grown in this area was used in this study the experiments were conducted from october 2018 to april 2019 during season 1 s1 and october 2019 to april 2020 in season 2 s2 plastic pots top diameter 19 cm bottom diameter 14 cm height 17 cm and pipes diameter 11 cm height 1 m were used in the experiment and the diagrams of the two containers were shown in fig 1 the two containers were arranged in the same greenhouse a strainer was placed on the bottoms of the pots to prevent soil leakage each plastic pipe was longitudinally cut into two along its central axis sealed and covered with plastic wrap bags and tape to prevent water leakage and facilitate the sampling of roots and soil the soil in each container came from the 0 20 cm soil layer of nearby farmland which had been naturally air dried and sieved each pot contained the following 3 5 kg of dry soil 15 g of base fertilizer and three seedlings each pipe contained the following 9 kg of dry soil 36 g of base fertilizer and two seedlings the fertilizer n p k 19 19 19 total nutrients 44 was mixed into the soil as the base fertilizer and there was no top dressing the soil parameters before fertilizer application were as follows nh 4 n 3 6 mg kg 1 no 3 n 47 3 mg kg 1 available p olsen 4 1 mg kg 1 exchangeable k 104 7 mg kg 1 these soil parameters were determined using the methods described in kachurina et al 2000 and page et al 1982 in addition the bulk density of soil was 1 2 g cm3 and the field water holding capacity was 30 1 volumetric water content 2 2 crop and water management two separate experiments were designed according to the research objectives of this study drought priming and gradual drought the drought priming treatments maintained fixed soil water levels for specified durations to explore the physiological responses of winter wheat to different drought re watering conditions the gradual drought treatment explored the relationship between physiological responses and varying degrees of drought when the soil water was gradually depleted as the crop grew large diameter pots that were easy to weigh were used in the drought priming experiment to facilitate frequent irrigation for the gradual drought treatment to simulate the gradual decrease of water in the top one meter soil layer a long small diameter pipe was selected as the container additionally the pipe was processed to facilitate sampling soil at different depths to measure water content the purposes of the two experiments were different and their results were not directly compared therefore the effect of container differences had no direct influence on the results the water management on all wheat seedlings was the same before transplantation into the respective treatments in the greenhouse the wheat seeds were sown into an artificial climate box and then transferred to a freezer at 4 c for vernalization 20 days after vernalization the wheat seedlings at the three leaf stage were transplanted into containers in the greenhouse in the first week the soil in the pots received a sufficient water supply 75 85 fc to enhance wheat adaptability to the environment one week later the water control schemes were initiated 2 2 1 water management schemes for drought priming the three water management schemes are described below adequate water supply c persistent drought p and intermittent drought i treatment c served as the control group and it was maintained with an adequate water supply 75 85 fc throughout the experiment treatment p was maintained with a 55 65 fc water deficit before the jointing stage and was re watered to 75 85 fc after jointing the water management scheme under treatment i included a first drought 55 65 fc a first re watering 75 85 fc a second drought 55 65 fc before jointing and a second re watering 75 85 fc after jointing the specific water management scheme is shown in table 1 potted plants were weighed daily to determine their soil water content the three treatments c p i were replicated 24 and 20 times in s1 and s2 respectively 2 2 2 water management schemes for gradual drought at the beginning of the gradual drought g treatment the soil in the pipe was irrigated to 100 fc in s1 and 85 fc in s2 there was no water supply after the beginning of the treatment the soil moisture in the pipe gradually decreased as the wheat grew the variation range of the average water content in the pipe was 100 56 1 fc in s1 and 85 34 2 fc in s2 the soil water content in each pipe was determined using the drying method this treatment was comprised of 16 replicates in both seasons 2 3 sample collection the leaves and roots of six wheat plants per treatment c p and i in the drought priming experiment were sampled five times before jointing and two times after jointing sampling across the three treatments was done on the same day and a specific sampling arrangement each time as shown in table 2 the sampling time points before the jointing stage during the two experimental seasons were the same while after jointing was conducted in the first and second weeks in s1 and s2 respectively in the gradual drought g treatment sampling was done at an interval of 7 days the leaves and roots of four wheat plants and the soil at different depths in the pipe were collected each time changes in soil water in the pipes between sampling time points are shown in fig 2 leaves and roots were sampled from plants using the destructive method first all the leaves on the plants were collected then the soil mass from the container was removed to allow root collection after the leaves were picked they were cleaned and quickly put into liquid nitrogen the roots were separated from the soil by washing and then frozen in liquid nitrogen subsequently the plant samples were transferred to a 80 c freezer for storage 2 4 measurement of physiological traits all plant samples were ground in liquid nitrogen centrifuged and the supernatant collected and used for crude enzyme extraction owing to the limitations in sample quantity the roots were preferentially used to determine hormone content the determination of antioxidant protective enzyme activity and osmoprotectant was conducted by the colorimetric method using a spectrophotometer uv 2600a unico inc shanghai china following the methods described in the classical literature and a modified version from a test guide book bates et al 1973 beauchamp and fridovich 1971 chance and maehly 1955 dubois et al 1956 hu et al 2006 wang et al 2016 2 4 1 determination of the antioxidant protective enzyme activity peroxidase pod activity was determined by the guaiacol colorimetric method chance and maehly 1955 hu et al 2006 wang et al 2016 the mixed solution contained 0 1 v v guaiacol 0 18 v v h2o2 distilled water and the crude enzyme extract the pod activity was determined by measuring the absorbance of the samples at a wavelength of 470 nm after a 25 c water bath 10 min superoxide dismutase sod activity was determined by the nitro blue tetrazolium nbt photoreduction method beauchamp and fridovich 1971 hu et al 2006 wang et al 2016 the mixed solution contained 50 mmol l phosphate buffer ph 7 8 750 Î¼mol l nbt 20 Î¼mol l riboflavin 130 mmol l methionine 100 Î¼mol l edta na2 and the crude enzyme extract the sod activity was determined by measuring the absorbance of the samples at a wavelength of 560 nm after induction of the light reaction 4000 lx for 20 min at 25 2 4 2 determination of osmolyte content the content of free proline pro was determined by the ninhydrin method bates et al 1973 hu et al 2006 wang et al 2016 the mixed solution contained ninhydrin 6 mol l h3po4 glacial acetic acid distilled water and sample liquid samples were measured at a wavelength of 520 nm after a 30 min 100 c water bath and extraction by toluene soluble sugar ss content was determined by the anthrone method dubois et al 1956 1951 hu et al 2006 the mixed solution contained anthrone 80 h2so4 distilled water and sample liquid the ss in each sample was elucidated by measuring absorbance at a wavelength of 620 nm after a 10 min water bath at 100 c 2 4 3 abscisic acid content the aba content was determined using an enzyme linked immunoassay assay elisa asch 2000 weiler 1982 specifically the aba content was determined from a 0 5 g fresh sample using abscisic acid kits china agricultural university beijing china after centrifugation extraction color reaction and other steps of the sample extraction solution the results were obtained by colorimetry 490 nm 2 4 4 photosynthesis the date of photosynthesis measurement was synchronized with the sample collection the photosynthesis measurements started at 9 00 in the morning using the photosynthesis measuring system li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa to measure the photosynthetic rate pn and stomatal conductance gs since chlorophyll mainly absorbs the red and blue light for photosynthesis li 6400 was equipped with a standard leaf chamber with red and blue light sources 6400 02b led light source this light source was able to simulate natural light and maintain the specified light intensity within the leaf chamber the light intensity of the light source in the leaf chamber was set at 1500 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 and the leaf temperature around 25 c the content of carbon dioxide in the greenhouse during the measurement was around 480 Î¼mol co2 mol 1 the second fully expanded leaf at the top of each assayed plant was selected for photosynthesis measurement the measurement location was on the widest part of the leaf blade for the c p and i treatments measurements were done on five plants each time and four plants for treatment g 2 5 measurement of soil water content aluminum tins were labelled oven dried and weighed before adding soil samples next the soil samples were immediately placed in the aluminum tins their wet weight determined and subsequently placed in an oven 105 c until dry to a constant weight their final weight was determined to obtain their dry weight mass water content was calculated as grams of moisture lost per dry soil weight the volumetric water content was the mass water content multiplied by the bulk density 2 6 statistical analysis this spss23 ibm inc armonk ny usa was used to perform a one way anova of data from the c p and i treatments the difference between the means was separated using the least significant difference lsd multiple comparison test a threshold of p 0 05 indicated significant results origin 2021 originlab northampton ma usa was used to draw all pictures and conduct the model fitting and principal component analysis pca the grey correlation analysis gra was conducted using dps v9 01 zhejiang university hangzhou zhejiang china the two season data for treatment g were combined during the analysis while data on drought priming treatments c p i per season was analyzed independently except for the grey correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 photosynthetic characteristic response both pn and gs exhibited obvious responses to changes in soil water figs 3 and 4 under gradual drought conditions g pn and gs were exponentially suppressed r 2 0 75 as the swc decreased fig 3a and b the model fitting results showed that the decreasing trend of pn was relatively more stable than that of gs indicating that the response speed of gs may be faster than that of pn during gradual drought in the drought priming treatment fig 4a and b the control group c with a sufficient water supply 75 85 fc maintained higher pn and gs values both of which increased after entering the jointing stage the pn and gs values under the persistent drought treatment p 55 65 fc were significantly lower than those of the c treatment and gs significantly decreased over time the pn and gs values in the intermittent drought treatment i recovered to a level slightly higher than that of treatment c at the first re watering fr but decreased at the second drought sd in addition the gs of treatment i at the sd stage were slightly lower than treatment c and significantly higher than treatment p however there was no significant difference in the gs values of the three treatments c p and i after re watering to full water supply sr at the jointing stage while pn was highest under treatment i followed by treatment p and lastly treatment c overall the drought primed winter wheat exhibited a photosynthetic compensation effect at the jointing stage which reached a significant level during s2 p 0 05 3 2 abscisic acid response the abscisic acid content of leaves laba and roots raba increased exponentially as swc decreased r 2 0 80 with laba significantly higher than raba fig 3c and d when swc 0 243 80 fc laba and raba slightly increased the laba and raba at the lowest swc were about six and seven times at 100 fc respectively relative to raba the laba of the c p and i treatments was also significantly higher fig 4c and d the laba and raba in treatment p gradually increased with time besides there was a significant difference in laba and raba between treatment c and p treatments before jointing re watering p 0 05 the laba and raba in treatment i during the fr period were reduced to below the levels of treatment p in the sd period the laba in treatment i recovered to a value significantly higher than in c treatment p 0 05 and treatment p in s2 p 0 05 however according to their raba values the treatments were stably ranked with treatment p being the highest followed by treatment i and lastly treatment c after re watering at the jointing stage the aba content in treatments p and i decreased but was still higher than that of treatment c the laba in treatments c p and i were significantly different in the second week of re watering in s2 while the raba was significantly different in the first week of re watering in s1 3 3 anti oxidation enzyme responses 3 3 1 peroxidase the change in pod activity in the leaves following swc changes conformed to a sigmoid function r 2 0 956 which stabilized at swc 0 243 80 fc and swc 0 121 40 fc fig 5a the pod activity at swc 0 121 was about twice that at swc 0 243 in the process of water regulation the pod activity in treatment p was always significantly higher than that of treatment c p 0 05 but the gap between the two during the sr stage was significantly reduced fig 6 a the pod activity in treatment i decreased in the fr period and was significantly lower than in the p treatment p 0 05 after entering the sd period the pod activity in treatment i was enhanced and was significantly higher than that of treatment c p 0 05 but below treatment p in the sr period the pod activity in treatments p and i was higher than that of treatment c and the difference was significant in both s1 and s2 p 0 05 this indicated that the pod activity of the primed plants was still higher than that of the non primed plants in the sr stage 3 3 2 superoxide dismutase the response of sod to swc in the leaves showed an exponential relationship r 2 0 931 fig 5b the sod activity was significantly increased as swc decreased and the maximum sod activity was about three times that at 100 fc during persistent drought fd fr and sd periods the sod activity in treatment p was significantly increased with time and was consistently significantly higher than in treatment c p 0 05 fig 6b the sod activity in treatment i during the fr period was significantly lower than that of treatment p p 0 05 but slightly higher than that of treatment c owing to re watering in the sd period the sod activity of treatment i was increased compared to treatment c but was lower than in treatment p after re watering at the jointing stage sr there was no significant difference in the sod activity between treatments p and i overall the sod activity in treatment i was significantly higher than in treatment c and treatment p was significantly higher than treatment c during s1 p 0 05 thus the sod activity of primed plants did not fully return to non primed levels within two weeks of jointing re watering 3 4 osmoprotection response 3 4 1 proline response the pro content in the leaves increased exponentially as swc decreased r 2 0 909 when swc dropped to 0 103 34 fc pro accumulated about 25 times the initial content fig 5c at swc 0 243 80 fc the pro content was lower and relatively stable in addition the pro content in treatment p was significantly higher than in treatment c during the fd period p 0 05 and was slightly increased as the drought duration continued fig 6c however the re watering in the fr period significantly reduced the pro content in treatment i p 0 05 which was maintained between the pro contents in treatments c and p after the sd period the pro content in treatment i re accumulated but did not reach the level in treatment p besides in the sr stage the pro content of the primed plants p and i was significantly different p 0 05 from that of non primed plants in s1 but this difference disappeared in s2 3 4 2 soluble sugar response during the gradual drought process the response of ss in the leaves showed an exponential accumulation r 2 0 962 fig 5d however when swc dropped to 0 103 34 fc the ss content was increased to 5 28 approximately five times the initial value the ss content in treatment p was consistently significantly higher than that of treatment c p 0 05 during the drought stage fd fr and sd stages and was higher in s2 than in s1 fig 6d besides the ss content in treatment i was significantly reduced during the fr period and was increased to a level similar to treatment p during the sd period after jointing re watering sr the ss content in primed plants was significantly higher than that of the control in s1 p 0 05 but was not significantly different from the control in s2 3 5 evaluation of drought resistance physiological state under changing water conditions 3 5 1 effects of gradual drought on the stress state of wheat in the results presented in sections 3 2 to 3 4 the content and activity of different drought indicators were increased at different magnitudes with decreases in the swc therefore pca was used to evaluate the wheat stress response under different swc values under gradual drought conditions the physiological traits of winter wheat laba raba pod sod pro ss were assigned to two principal components pc pc1 and pc2 by pca these two pc comprehensively reflected 96 6 of the variation in the six indicators fig 7 according to the stress response of winter wheat swc was divided into three ranges range 1 r1 0 301 0 243 100 80 fc range 2 r2 0 210 0 136 70 45 fc and range 3 r3 0 121 0 103 40 34 fc when swc was at r1 80 fc the physiological state was relatively stable within r2 the data points were uniformly distributed but with some variation this indicated that the stress states corresponding to different swcs were similar but not completely identical when swc dropped to r3 40 fc the distribution of the data points changed substantially and the variation among the points increased this suggested that the stress state was significantly changed relative to r1 and r2 and the change in swc at this time was associated with a more intense stress response 3 5 2 effects of drought priming on the drought stress state as the responses of each stress indicator to water changes were not completely consistent pca was used to integrate the indicators into two pc the distribution of data points reflected the stress response state of wheat at different water states for the three treatments c p i pc1 and pc2 reflected 82 1 of the variation in the six measured physiological traits fig 8 there were seasonal differences in the physiological state of winter wheat in the two experimental seasons but the effect of water changes on the stress response was consistent the physiological state under treatment c was relatively stable and the drought priming treatments p and i influenced the stress states as the drought duration continued the state of treatment p gradually diverged from the control in the fr stage in treatment i re watering restored the state of the primed plants to near control levels however drought in the sd stage brought the physiological state of plants in treatment i closer to those in treatment p in the sr stage the physiological states of the primed plants p and i were still different from those of the non primed plants c this indicated that the stress response caused by pre jointing drought priming was not completely recovered within two weeks after re watering in the jointing stage 3 5 3 correlation between stress response and photosynthesis the grey relational analysis showed that the relationship between stress response and photosynthesis pn and gs differed among the water regulation schemes fig 9 treatment c and p maintained a fixed swc for a certain period and their grey relational results were relatively similar under treatments c and p the grey correlation coefficient gcc between osmolytes pro and ss and photosynthesis was less than that between aba and anti oxidation enzymes fig 9a b e f in contrast the p treatment with a lower swc level exhibited increased ss fig 9b f this increased effect was more obvious in treatment i with an increased frequency of swc changes based on the two grey relational ordinals gro ss was third with pn and first with gs respectively fig 9c g in the comprehensive analysis of the three treatments the gro results of pn and gs were consistent with the variables ranked in the following descending order laba raba ss sod pod and pro overall under changing swc 55 85 fc aba content was closely related to photosynthesis among all the assessed variables fig 9d h 4 discussion 4 1 effects of soil water change on photosynthesis in wheat the net photosynthetic rate reflects the level of photosynthesis in wheat which was influenced by both stomatal and non stomatal factors the decrease in leaf gs and the damage to the photosynthetic apparatus of photosystem ii by ros under abiotic stress decreases pn which reduces the energy supply to the crop flexas et al 2006 gururani et al 2015 medrano et al 2002 in this pot study gs and pn of wheat significantly decreased under three drought scenarios p i g treatments the reduction in gs lowers water loss and reduces the co2 content within the leaves jones 1998 in the g treatment the gs dropped rapidly to less than 0 1 mol h2o m 2s 1 swc 0 204 fig 3b however pn did not immediately drop to the lowest level due to the sudden drop in gs fig 3a this means that the decrease in pn may be affected by metabolic impairment during the drought phase swc 0 204 this is consistent with several studies that revealed that the metabolic damage of leaf photosynthesis usually occurs at lower values of gs 0 05 0 1 mol h2o m 2s 1 which is an indirect result 0 1 0 2 mol h2o m 2s 1 of the previous leaf oxidative stress response bota et al 2004 flexas et al 2006 in addition the impairment degree of specific metabolic processes under low gs ranges from 0 to 100 depending on the research protocol and crop species flexas et al 2004a 2004b accordingly this indicates that the difference in stress response under different drought conditions may lead to different degrees of metabolic damage to crops leading to differences in pn moreover in the present pot study the gs of the primed groups p and i were higher than 0 1 mol h2o m 2s 1 thus the primed plants did not suffer from metabolic damage which enhanced the recovery of pn after re watering the pn of primed plants treatments p and i recovered to the c levels within one week after re watering at the jointing stage s1 sr and pn exceeded the levels in c in the second week s2 sr after re watering this indicates that the primed plants obtained more energy than the non primed plants during the re watering stage however there was no significant difference in gs between the primed and non primed plants at this time point therefore stomatal factors may not have caused photosynthetic overcompensation for photosynthesis to be restored to the control level during the re watering stage besides the pca results showed that the stress state of the primed plants was significantly different from the control after re watering in the jointing stage pod and sod were two important factors contributing to the difference in stress response after re watering in the jointing stage while laba had relatively less influence fig 8 in addition it has been observed that drought acclimatization increases the electron transfer rate in leaves flexas et al 2006 considering the control effect of aba on the stomata and the stronger antioxidant capacity contributing to the restoration of photosynthesis in crops after re watering the stress response after re watering may be related to photosynthetic compensation aliyeva et al 2020 yan et al 2003 this is owing to the fact that drought stress causes a reduction in the photosynthetic electron transport chain resulting in the production of superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen in chloroplasts and the excessive accumulation of ros which can lead to photosynthetic organ damage shao et al 2008 sod and pod play important roles as antioxidant enzymes for the scavenging of ros in chloroplasts mitochondria and cytoplasm gechev et al 2006 a study showed that drought tolerant and drought sensitive wheat showed significant differences in their thylakoid membrane structures after drought re watering and that the drought tolerant variety showed stronger dynamic responses in photosynthetic and antioxidant capacity aliyeva et al 2020 these results suggest may imply that stronger antioxidant capacity helps maintain the dynamic balance of ros in leaf cells safeguarding the restoration and stability of the photosynthetic environment and creating favorable conditions for the production of photosynthetic compensation 4 2 stimulating effect of soil water change on crop stress responses the content of osmotic substances pro and ss and the antioxidant enzyme activity pod and sod in treatment p were higher than those in treatment i during the sd period of pre jointing drought and in the sr period after re watering in the jointing stage this implies that prolonging the duration of drought at the same drought level enhances the stress response of wheat and increases the time required to recover to the control level after re watering the increase in pro ss and antioxidant enzyme activity with the duration of drought at the same drought level has also been demonstrated in previous studies abid et al 2018 hao et al 2019 sun et al 2015 in addition previous studies have confirmed that short term water stress 10 days of 55 60 fc in the vegetative growth stage increases the content and activity of stress indicators sod pod ss and pro in wheat leaves which are restored to control levels within two weeks after re watering abid et al 2018 mu et al 2021 drought levels in this pot study were also 55 65 fc however the stress responses did not fully restore the control levels within two weeks after re watering owing to the increased drought duration 16 days during water status changes there are time differences in the stress responses between different indicators as observed in the present study 1 the laba level in treatment i at the second drought stage increased before other indicators to a higher level than in treatment p 2 the raba level and the content of osmotic substances pro and ss was restored to the control level after two weeks of re watering at the jointing stage s2 and sr but the other indicators were not restored figs 4 and 6 the response of the antioxidant protective enzyme system lagging behind laba is due to the involvement of antioxidant enzymes in the scavenging of excess ros and the synthesis of ros induced by aba gechev et al 2006 jiang and zhang 2002 yan et al 2007 zhu 2016 in addition the response of sod and cat under drought priming conditions is regulated by aba wang et al 2021b therefore the relatively rapid recovery of the two osmolytes in the sr stage indicates that other stress mechanisms are still working after the osmotic stress is relieved which might be a factor in the observed compensatory effect on photosynthesis grey relational analysis indicated that aba is the most related to photosynthesis and the increase in drought rehydration times can strengthen the correlation between ss and pn the importance of aba in crop responses to drought is well documented gupta et al 2020 liu et al 2005 rowe et al 2016 wang et al 2021b in the present study the content of aba in the leaves was significantly higher than in the roots under drought this is because the rapid synthesis of aba under stress in angiosperms only occurs in the leaves zhang et al 2018 therefore the aba content in the leaves is higher than in other tissues the increased correlation between ss and pn is due to the involvement of ss in osmoregulation and being a product of photosynthesis farooq et al 2009 muller et al 2011 4 3 reference role of stress states in winter wheat for drought degree assessment field trials in winter wheat have shown that regulated deficit irrigation rdi is beneficial for growth of wheat and improving its water use efficiency du et al 2010 wang et al 2018b zhang et al 2006 1998 accordingly many studies have been focusing on wheat s growth and yield at a field scale to explore suitable regulated deficit irrigation schemes ali et al 2007 du et al 2010 zhang et al 2006 in these field trials the advantages and limitations of regulated deficit irrigation usually have been evaluated based on its growth yield and water use efficiency however in fact the physiological response of the crop to water changes can also be informative in estimating the effect of regulated deficit irrigation this is because crops under adverse conditions would divert energy and resources from normal growth to stress responses which may reduce their productivity zhang et al 2020 in the regulated deficit irrigation scheme for winter wheat the gradual decrease of soil water over time after irrigation was coincided with the g treatment in this pot study while the wet dry wet variation in soil owing to the different frequency of irrigation was coincided with that of the p and i treatments the g treatment classified soil water content swc by stress status as r1 0 301 0 243 100 80 fc r2 0 210 0 136 70 45 fc and r3 0 121 0 103 40 34 fc in contrast swc was broadly classified in many studies according to production experience as no water deficit 70 fc mild 60 fc moderate 50 fc and severe drought 45 fc and usually severe drought leads to severe crop yield reduction abid et al 2018 hao et al 2019 kang et al 2002 meng et al 2016 results based on these two classifications are basically consistent besides the magnitude of stress response changes induced by the same water reduction according to swc in the range of r1 r2 and r3 were different fig 7 this implied that the stress response caused by water changes becomes more intense as drought deepens leading to a gradual imbalance between growth and stress response which eventually causes irreversible damage to wheat after the swc falls below 40 fc the results of the p and i treatments indicated that the increase in the drought re watering cycle during vegetative growth facilitated the observed photosynthetic compensation and a more adequate and rapid mobilization of the stress response for winter wheat the above findings provide an empirical reference for the result that wheat is suitable for moderate water deficit during its vegetative growth as previously shown by field studies based on its physiological response ali et al 2007 du et al 2010 zhang et al 2006 according to the physiological response of winter wheat in this pot study increasing the drought re watering cycle under suitable soil water would be beneficial different drought re watering schemes could be implemented in fields by varying the irrigation frequency at the same total amount of irrigation 120 mm in the field yield and water use efficiency were higher with two irrigations 60 mm each for jointing heading or heading milking than with three irrigations 40 mm each for jointing heading filling and one irrigation 120 mm for jointing or heading or milking bian et al 2016 li et al 2010 this means that under limited total water allocation an appropriate increase in the number of irrigation is indeed conducive to increasing production and water use efficiency but not the higher the frequency is better furthermore higher yields may be obtained if wheat could produce photosynthetic compensation during the two critical periods of jointing and flowering this pot study showed that drought re watering was conducive to the photosynthetic compensation effect so it was a good choice to supplement irrigation at the jointing and flowering and moderate drought in other periods in this regard a study showed that irrigation during jointing and flowering could guarantee high yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat in the north china plain in wet dry and normal years from 1981 to 2015 zhao et al 2020 5 conclusion compared to treatment c gs and pn in p i and g drought treatments were significantly lower with gs decreasing faster than pn the aba content osmotic substances pro and ss content and sod activity were increased exponentially r 2 0 836 0 962 and peroxidase activity was increased in an s shaped r 2 0 956 manner under treatment g the drought stress indicator with the greatest variation was pro whose value at 34 fc was about 25 times higher than at 100 fc the drought re watering cycles during drought priming p and i stimulated the stress response of primed plants to changes in soil water the aba pro and ss content and pod sod activity under treatment p increased with the increase in drought duration besides the response of aba in the leaves of treatment i during the second drought before jointing was faster than other indicators overall the relationship between aba content in the leaves and roots and photosynthesis was stronger than between antioxidant enzymes and osmotic substances gro 1 2 the increase in the number of drought re watering cycles raised the maximum pn value after re watering primed plants in the jointing stage hence associated with a higher stress response in primed plants the pn in treatment i was 3 8 higher than p and 8 17 higher than treatment c after re watering in the jointing stage besides increasing the number of drought rehydration cycles enhances the relationship between soluble sugars and photosynthesis in conclusion different drought regimes affect the stress status of winter wheat to different degrees with intermittent drought facilitating a better drought priming

9224,drought priming at the vegetative growth stage has been demonstrated to be an effective water regulation strategy to enhance drought resistance in wheat therefore exploring the stress response of winter wheat to different soil water changes during this stage can improve the drought priming strategies this study examined the physiological response of winter wheat during two seasons of greenhouse pot experiments 2018 2019 2019 2020 in the following four treatments adequate water supply control c persistent drought p intermittent drought i and gradual drought g an adequate water supply 75 85 fc field capacity was always maintained for treatment c before jointing plants in treatment p were maintained in a drought state 55 65 fc while in treatment i plants underwent a change in soil water status from 55 65 fc to re watering up to 75 85 fc and back to 55 65 fc after entering the jointing stage plants in treatments p and i were re watered to 75 85 fc there was no water supplied in treatment g throughout the experiment the soil water content swc in treatment g gradually decreased with time 100 34 fc at the same time abscisic acid aba and osmotic substances accumulated exponentially with the reduction of swc the activity of antioxidant protective enzymes increased significantly and the change in the stomatal closure rate was faster than the decrease in photosynthetic rate pn drought priming before jointing in treatments p and i prompted photosynthetic compensation after re watering at the jointing stage with the highest pn in treatment i followed by treatment p and lastly treatment c the drought re watering cycle stimulated the stress response indicators in primed plants hence they were significantly higher than the stable levels in non primed plants specifically the aba level in the leaves increased faster than the other indicators under repeated drought moreover the relationship between photosynthesis and aba was stronger than with antioxidative enzymes and osmolytes besides increasing the number of drought re watering cycles enabled the primed plants to achieve a higher maximum pn after re watering and enhanced the association between soluble sugar and pn overall increasing the frequency of drought re watering enhanced the drought priming effect on the wheat stress response besides there is a time difference in the response of different drought stress indicators to soil water changes the findings in this study provide an empirical reference for better utilization of drought priming strategies to stimulate crop production keywords drought priming photosynthesis abscisic acid anti oxidation enzymes osmolyte accumulation data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction agriculture under changing climate conditions is constrained by limited resources the growing human population and adverse environmental changes which together place higher demands on the sustainable production and resilience of crops bailey serres et al 2019 climate change increases the odds of severe and widespread droughts in many regions dai 2012 for example model projections suggest that increased warming of 1 5 2 c could double drought related losses in china su et al 2018 wheat a critical staple crop is highly sensitive to drought stress however with the global population expected to reach 9 billion by 2050 a 60 increase in global wheat production from 3 3 t ha 1 to 5 t ha 1 is needed to cater to their food needs abid et al 2016a daryanto et al 2016 thus improving the productivity of wheat under adverse conditions is a meaningful scientific goal for enhancing food security gupta et al 2020 indeed as the energy and resources obtained by crops are limited maintaining a balance between their growth and stress responses under drought conditions is crucial for crops to thrive zhang et al 2020 therefore exploring the plant stress response under different soil water change regimes is helpful to elucidate this balance and provide a valuable empirical reference for increasing and maintaining wheat productivity under adverse conditions research has shown that crops have stress memory of the adversity they have suffered which affects their response to subsequent adverse conditions backhaus et al 2014 molinier et al 2006 tombesi et al 2018 drought priming involves the exposure of crops to drought in advance to promote their expression of effective drought resistance mechanisms to better cope with subsequent adverse conditions li et al 2015 drought priming in the vegetative growth stage of wheat weakens the adverse effects of drought after flowering abid et al 2017 2016a wang et al 2011 2014 in addition drought priming parents could also have beneficial effects on the resistance of offspring wang et al 2018a zhang et al 2016 the vegetative growth stage is a period of suitable water regulation with 55 65 field capacity fc being a suitable water deficit level to reduce the negative impacts of drought abid et al 2018 daryanto et al 2016 mu et al 2021 drought priming at 55 60 fc at the tillering stage maintains significantly higher yields in wheat than at the jointing stage with different response intensities among different varieties though the trend is similar abid et al 2016a moreover the impact of drought on crops is related to the period extent duration and frequency of its occurrence stallmann et al 2020 yu et al 2020 zou et al 2021 thus drought priming before jointing is an effective strategy for stabilizing wheat yields though different watering regimes may have different effects on the stress response the limitation of photosynthesis under drought plays a critical role in determining crop growth survival and yield in drought prone regions flexas et al 2004a therefore photosynthesis which is closely related to yield provides insight into crop adaptability to environmental stress aliyeva et al 2020 huseynova et al 2016 the photosynthesis rate under water deficit is limited by stomatal related factors where the degree of recovery after rehydration is dependent on the water deficit conditions and other stress responses abid et al 2016b aliyeva et al 2020 farooq et al 2009 mu et al 2022 crops respond to stress degrees by selectively activating different stress response pathways watkinson et al 2003 the stress response on wheat leaves following a short term drought priming is significant which effectively enhances the stress resistance of primed plants abid et al 2016a wang et al 2021a 2021b abscisic acid aba plays an important role in stomatal control stress signaling and grain development in drought primed plants abid et al 2017 wang et al 2021b zhang et al 1987 for example primed wheat plants control their root growth through aba regulation in different zones along the root apex wang et al 2021a in addition aba is involved in both the production of reactive oxygen species ros and stomatal closure in leaves gupta et al 2020 liu et al 2005 wang et al 2013 yan et al 2007 aba activates multiple aba responding genes via snrk2 to trigger stomatal closure and improve water balance gupta et al 2020 ros are involved in the regulation of stomatal closure and opening by aba as a signaling intermediate which is related to h2o2 generation the mehler reaction and photorespiration cruz de carvalho 2008 yan et al 2007 the relationship between aba and ros under drought stress stimulates the up regulation of the antioxidant defense system jiang and zhang 2002 zhu 2016 including superoxide dismutase sod and peroxidase pod in the leaves gechev et al 2006 huseynova et al 2014 in addition the osmotic stress caused by drought leads to the accumulation of carbon rich molecules such as soluble sugar ss and proline pro in the leaves which act as solutes in cells to protect cellular structures from damage farooq et al 2009 muller et al 2011 besides the accumulation of osmolytes in the leaves during drought priming is associated with enhanced drought tolerance in wheat wang et al 2019 owing to their sensitivity to drought the above physiological traits i e aba pro ss sod pod are often used to assess the stress state of crops under water deficit conditions in recent years the production potential of crops and more refined agronomic management have received more attention than ever bailey serres et al 2019 considerable research progress has been made in elucidating the principles and effects of drought priming however treatments are usually relatively simple mimicking and maintaining mild drought conditions for a few days during the designated growth period accordingly it is necessary to evaluate the priming effect on the stress response of winter wheat under more specific water regulation schemes and the recovery after re watering abid et al 2017 2016b since strategies to increase crop productivity by reducing sensitivity to stress responses may fail when stress is very severe zhang et al 2020 besides there is an imbalance between crop stress response and growth under water stress hence necessary to clarify the dynamic link between the stress response of winter wheat and drought intensity in this study winter wheat was subjected to gradual persistent and intermittent drought during the vegetative growth stage to 1 clarify the relationship between physiological responses and the different soil water content levels 2 explore the response and recovery of physiological indicators under different drought priming schemes 3 evaluate the difference in stress response between primed and non primed plants and its relationship with photosynthesis 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental layout pot experiments were conducted in a glass greenhouse for two seasons at northwest agriculture and forestry university yangling district xianyang shaanxi province china located in a semi humid and drought prone area with annual average sunshine of 2164 h xiaoyan 22 a winter wheat variety commonly grown in this area was used in this study the experiments were conducted from october 2018 to april 2019 during season 1 s1 and october 2019 to april 2020 in season 2 s2 plastic pots top diameter 19 cm bottom diameter 14 cm height 17 cm and pipes diameter 11 cm height 1 m were used in the experiment and the diagrams of the two containers were shown in fig 1 the two containers were arranged in the same greenhouse a strainer was placed on the bottoms of the pots to prevent soil leakage each plastic pipe was longitudinally cut into two along its central axis sealed and covered with plastic wrap bags and tape to prevent water leakage and facilitate the sampling of roots and soil the soil in each container came from the 0 20 cm soil layer of nearby farmland which had been naturally air dried and sieved each pot contained the following 3 5 kg of dry soil 15 g of base fertilizer and three seedlings each pipe contained the following 9 kg of dry soil 36 g of base fertilizer and two seedlings the fertilizer n p k 19 19 19 total nutrients 44 was mixed into the soil as the base fertilizer and there was no top dressing the soil parameters before fertilizer application were as follows nh 4 n 3 6 mg kg 1 no 3 n 47 3 mg kg 1 available p olsen 4 1 mg kg 1 exchangeable k 104 7 mg kg 1 these soil parameters were determined using the methods described in kachurina et al 2000 and page et al 1982 in addition the bulk density of soil was 1 2 g cm3 and the field water holding capacity was 30 1 volumetric water content 2 2 crop and water management two separate experiments were designed according to the research objectives of this study drought priming and gradual drought the drought priming treatments maintained fixed soil water levels for specified durations to explore the physiological responses of winter wheat to different drought re watering conditions the gradual drought treatment explored the relationship between physiological responses and varying degrees of drought when the soil water was gradually depleted as the crop grew large diameter pots that were easy to weigh were used in the drought priming experiment to facilitate frequent irrigation for the gradual drought treatment to simulate the gradual decrease of water in the top one meter soil layer a long small diameter pipe was selected as the container additionally the pipe was processed to facilitate sampling soil at different depths to measure water content the purposes of the two experiments were different and their results were not directly compared therefore the effect of container differences had no direct influence on the results the water management on all wheat seedlings was the same before transplantation into the respective treatments in the greenhouse the wheat seeds were sown into an artificial climate box and then transferred to a freezer at 4 c for vernalization 20 days after vernalization the wheat seedlings at the three leaf stage were transplanted into containers in the greenhouse in the first week the soil in the pots received a sufficient water supply 75 85 fc to enhance wheat adaptability to the environment one week later the water control schemes were initiated 2 2 1 water management schemes for drought priming the three water management schemes are described below adequate water supply c persistent drought p and intermittent drought i treatment c served as the control group and it was maintained with an adequate water supply 75 85 fc throughout the experiment treatment p was maintained with a 55 65 fc water deficit before the jointing stage and was re watered to 75 85 fc after jointing the water management scheme under treatment i included a first drought 55 65 fc a first re watering 75 85 fc a second drought 55 65 fc before jointing and a second re watering 75 85 fc after jointing the specific water management scheme is shown in table 1 potted plants were weighed daily to determine their soil water content the three treatments c p i were replicated 24 and 20 times in s1 and s2 respectively 2 2 2 water management schemes for gradual drought at the beginning of the gradual drought g treatment the soil in the pipe was irrigated to 100 fc in s1 and 85 fc in s2 there was no water supply after the beginning of the treatment the soil moisture in the pipe gradually decreased as the wheat grew the variation range of the average water content in the pipe was 100 56 1 fc in s1 and 85 34 2 fc in s2 the soil water content in each pipe was determined using the drying method this treatment was comprised of 16 replicates in both seasons 2 3 sample collection the leaves and roots of six wheat plants per treatment c p and i in the drought priming experiment were sampled five times before jointing and two times after jointing sampling across the three treatments was done on the same day and a specific sampling arrangement each time as shown in table 2 the sampling time points before the jointing stage during the two experimental seasons were the same while after jointing was conducted in the first and second weeks in s1 and s2 respectively in the gradual drought g treatment sampling was done at an interval of 7 days the leaves and roots of four wheat plants and the soil at different depths in the pipe were collected each time changes in soil water in the pipes between sampling time points are shown in fig 2 leaves and roots were sampled from plants using the destructive method first all the leaves on the plants were collected then the soil mass from the container was removed to allow root collection after the leaves were picked they were cleaned and quickly put into liquid nitrogen the roots were separated from the soil by washing and then frozen in liquid nitrogen subsequently the plant samples were transferred to a 80 c freezer for storage 2 4 measurement of physiological traits all plant samples were ground in liquid nitrogen centrifuged and the supernatant collected and used for crude enzyme extraction owing to the limitations in sample quantity the roots were preferentially used to determine hormone content the determination of antioxidant protective enzyme activity and osmoprotectant was conducted by the colorimetric method using a spectrophotometer uv 2600a unico inc shanghai china following the methods described in the classical literature and a modified version from a test guide book bates et al 1973 beauchamp and fridovich 1971 chance and maehly 1955 dubois et al 1956 hu et al 2006 wang et al 2016 2 4 1 determination of the antioxidant protective enzyme activity peroxidase pod activity was determined by the guaiacol colorimetric method chance and maehly 1955 hu et al 2006 wang et al 2016 the mixed solution contained 0 1 v v guaiacol 0 18 v v h2o2 distilled water and the crude enzyme extract the pod activity was determined by measuring the absorbance of the samples at a wavelength of 470 nm after a 25 c water bath 10 min superoxide dismutase sod activity was determined by the nitro blue tetrazolium nbt photoreduction method beauchamp and fridovich 1971 hu et al 2006 wang et al 2016 the mixed solution contained 50 mmol l phosphate buffer ph 7 8 750 Î¼mol l nbt 20 Î¼mol l riboflavin 130 mmol l methionine 100 Î¼mol l edta na2 and the crude enzyme extract the sod activity was determined by measuring the absorbance of the samples at a wavelength of 560 nm after induction of the light reaction 4000 lx for 20 min at 25 2 4 2 determination of osmolyte content the content of free proline pro was determined by the ninhydrin method bates et al 1973 hu et al 2006 wang et al 2016 the mixed solution contained ninhydrin 6 mol l h3po4 glacial acetic acid distilled water and sample liquid samples were measured at a wavelength of 520 nm after a 30 min 100 c water bath and extraction by toluene soluble sugar ss content was determined by the anthrone method dubois et al 1956 1951 hu et al 2006 the mixed solution contained anthrone 80 h2so4 distilled water and sample liquid the ss in each sample was elucidated by measuring absorbance at a wavelength of 620 nm after a 10 min water bath at 100 c 2 4 3 abscisic acid content the aba content was determined using an enzyme linked immunoassay assay elisa asch 2000 weiler 1982 specifically the aba content was determined from a 0 5 g fresh sample using abscisic acid kits china agricultural university beijing china after centrifugation extraction color reaction and other steps of the sample extraction solution the results were obtained by colorimetry 490 nm 2 4 4 photosynthesis the date of photosynthesis measurement was synchronized with the sample collection the photosynthesis measurements started at 9 00 in the morning using the photosynthesis measuring system li 6400 li cor inc lincoln ne usa to measure the photosynthetic rate pn and stomatal conductance gs since chlorophyll mainly absorbs the red and blue light for photosynthesis li 6400 was equipped with a standard leaf chamber with red and blue light sources 6400 02b led light source this light source was able to simulate natural light and maintain the specified light intensity within the leaf chamber the light intensity of the light source in the leaf chamber was set at 1500 Î¼mol m 2 s 1 and the leaf temperature around 25 c the content of carbon dioxide in the greenhouse during the measurement was around 480 Î¼mol co2 mol 1 the second fully expanded leaf at the top of each assayed plant was selected for photosynthesis measurement the measurement location was on the widest part of the leaf blade for the c p and i treatments measurements were done on five plants each time and four plants for treatment g 2 5 measurement of soil water content aluminum tins were labelled oven dried and weighed before adding soil samples next the soil samples were immediately placed in the aluminum tins their wet weight determined and subsequently placed in an oven 105 c until dry to a constant weight their final weight was determined to obtain their dry weight mass water content was calculated as grams of moisture lost per dry soil weight the volumetric water content was the mass water content multiplied by the bulk density 2 6 statistical analysis this spss23 ibm inc armonk ny usa was used to perform a one way anova of data from the c p and i treatments the difference between the means was separated using the least significant difference lsd multiple comparison test a threshold of p 0 05 indicated significant results origin 2021 originlab northampton ma usa was used to draw all pictures and conduct the model fitting and principal component analysis pca the grey correlation analysis gra was conducted using dps v9 01 zhejiang university hangzhou zhejiang china the two season data for treatment g were combined during the analysis while data on drought priming treatments c p i per season was analyzed independently except for the grey correlation analysis 3 results 3 1 photosynthetic characteristic response both pn and gs exhibited obvious responses to changes in soil water figs 3 and 4 under gradual drought conditions g pn and gs were exponentially suppressed r 2 0 75 as the swc decreased fig 3a and b the model fitting results showed that the decreasing trend of pn was relatively more stable than that of gs indicating that the response speed of gs may be faster than that of pn during gradual drought in the drought priming treatment fig 4a and b the control group c with a sufficient water supply 75 85 fc maintained higher pn and gs values both of which increased after entering the jointing stage the pn and gs values under the persistent drought treatment p 55 65 fc were significantly lower than those of the c treatment and gs significantly decreased over time the pn and gs values in the intermittent drought treatment i recovered to a level slightly higher than that of treatment c at the first re watering fr but decreased at the second drought sd in addition the gs of treatment i at the sd stage were slightly lower than treatment c and significantly higher than treatment p however there was no significant difference in the gs values of the three treatments c p and i after re watering to full water supply sr at the jointing stage while pn was highest under treatment i followed by treatment p and lastly treatment c overall the drought primed winter wheat exhibited a photosynthetic compensation effect at the jointing stage which reached a significant level during s2 p 0 05 3 2 abscisic acid response the abscisic acid content of leaves laba and roots raba increased exponentially as swc decreased r 2 0 80 with laba significantly higher than raba fig 3c and d when swc 0 243 80 fc laba and raba slightly increased the laba and raba at the lowest swc were about six and seven times at 100 fc respectively relative to raba the laba of the c p and i treatments was also significantly higher fig 4c and d the laba and raba in treatment p gradually increased with time besides there was a significant difference in laba and raba between treatment c and p treatments before jointing re watering p 0 05 the laba and raba in treatment i during the fr period were reduced to below the levels of treatment p in the sd period the laba in treatment i recovered to a value significantly higher than in c treatment p 0 05 and treatment p in s2 p 0 05 however according to their raba values the treatments were stably ranked with treatment p being the highest followed by treatment i and lastly treatment c after re watering at the jointing stage the aba content in treatments p and i decreased but was still higher than that of treatment c the laba in treatments c p and i were significantly different in the second week of re watering in s2 while the raba was significantly different in the first week of re watering in s1 3 3 anti oxidation enzyme responses 3 3 1 peroxidase the change in pod activity in the leaves following swc changes conformed to a sigmoid function r 2 0 956 which stabilized at swc 0 243 80 fc and swc 0 121 40 fc fig 5a the pod activity at swc 0 121 was about twice that at swc 0 243 in the process of water regulation the pod activity in treatment p was always significantly higher than that of treatment c p 0 05 but the gap between the two during the sr stage was significantly reduced fig 6 a the pod activity in treatment i decreased in the fr period and was significantly lower than in the p treatment p 0 05 after entering the sd period the pod activity in treatment i was enhanced and was significantly higher than that of treatment c p 0 05 but below treatment p in the sr period the pod activity in treatments p and i was higher than that of treatment c and the difference was significant in both s1 and s2 p 0 05 this indicated that the pod activity of the primed plants was still higher than that of the non primed plants in the sr stage 3 3 2 superoxide dismutase the response of sod to swc in the leaves showed an exponential relationship r 2 0 931 fig 5b the sod activity was significantly increased as swc decreased and the maximum sod activity was about three times that at 100 fc during persistent drought fd fr and sd periods the sod activity in treatment p was significantly increased with time and was consistently significantly higher than in treatment c p 0 05 fig 6b the sod activity in treatment i during the fr period was significantly lower than that of treatment p p 0 05 but slightly higher than that of treatment c owing to re watering in the sd period the sod activity of treatment i was increased compared to treatment c but was lower than in treatment p after re watering at the jointing stage sr there was no significant difference in the sod activity between treatments p and i overall the sod activity in treatment i was significantly higher than in treatment c and treatment p was significantly higher than treatment c during s1 p 0 05 thus the sod activity of primed plants did not fully return to non primed levels within two weeks of jointing re watering 3 4 osmoprotection response 3 4 1 proline response the pro content in the leaves increased exponentially as swc decreased r 2 0 909 when swc dropped to 0 103 34 fc pro accumulated about 25 times the initial content fig 5c at swc 0 243 80 fc the pro content was lower and relatively stable in addition the pro content in treatment p was significantly higher than in treatment c during the fd period p 0 05 and was slightly increased as the drought duration continued fig 6c however the re watering in the fr period significantly reduced the pro content in treatment i p 0 05 which was maintained between the pro contents in treatments c and p after the sd period the pro content in treatment i re accumulated but did not reach the level in treatment p besides in the sr stage the pro content of the primed plants p and i was significantly different p 0 05 from that of non primed plants in s1 but this difference disappeared in s2 3 4 2 soluble sugar response during the gradual drought process the response of ss in the leaves showed an exponential accumulation r 2 0 962 fig 5d however when swc dropped to 0 103 34 fc the ss content was increased to 5 28 approximately five times the initial value the ss content in treatment p was consistently significantly higher than that of treatment c p 0 05 during the drought stage fd fr and sd stages and was higher in s2 than in s1 fig 6d besides the ss content in treatment i was significantly reduced during the fr period and was increased to a level similar to treatment p during the sd period after jointing re watering sr the ss content in primed plants was significantly higher than that of the control in s1 p 0 05 but was not significantly different from the control in s2 3 5 evaluation of drought resistance physiological state under changing water conditions 3 5 1 effects of gradual drought on the stress state of wheat in the results presented in sections 3 2 to 3 4 the content and activity of different drought indicators were increased at different magnitudes with decreases in the swc therefore pca was used to evaluate the wheat stress response under different swc values under gradual drought conditions the physiological traits of winter wheat laba raba pod sod pro ss were assigned to two principal components pc pc1 and pc2 by pca these two pc comprehensively reflected 96 6 of the variation in the six indicators fig 7 according to the stress response of winter wheat swc was divided into three ranges range 1 r1 0 301 0 243 100 80 fc range 2 r2 0 210 0 136 70 45 fc and range 3 r3 0 121 0 103 40 34 fc when swc was at r1 80 fc the physiological state was relatively stable within r2 the data points were uniformly distributed but with some variation this indicated that the stress states corresponding to different swcs were similar but not completely identical when swc dropped to r3 40 fc the distribution of the data points changed substantially and the variation among the points increased this suggested that the stress state was significantly changed relative to r1 and r2 and the change in swc at this time was associated with a more intense stress response 3 5 2 effects of drought priming on the drought stress state as the responses of each stress indicator to water changes were not completely consistent pca was used to integrate the indicators into two pc the distribution of data points reflected the stress response state of wheat at different water states for the three treatments c p i pc1 and pc2 reflected 82 1 of the variation in the six measured physiological traits fig 8 there were seasonal differences in the physiological state of winter wheat in the two experimental seasons but the effect of water changes on the stress response was consistent the physiological state under treatment c was relatively stable and the drought priming treatments p and i influenced the stress states as the drought duration continued the state of treatment p gradually diverged from the control in the fr stage in treatment i re watering restored the state of the primed plants to near control levels however drought in the sd stage brought the physiological state of plants in treatment i closer to those in treatment p in the sr stage the physiological states of the primed plants p and i were still different from those of the non primed plants c this indicated that the stress response caused by pre jointing drought priming was not completely recovered within two weeks after re watering in the jointing stage 3 5 3 correlation between stress response and photosynthesis the grey relational analysis showed that the relationship between stress response and photosynthesis pn and gs differed among the water regulation schemes fig 9 treatment c and p maintained a fixed swc for a certain period and their grey relational results were relatively similar under treatments c and p the grey correlation coefficient gcc between osmolytes pro and ss and photosynthesis was less than that between aba and anti oxidation enzymes fig 9a b e f in contrast the p treatment with a lower swc level exhibited increased ss fig 9b f this increased effect was more obvious in treatment i with an increased frequency of swc changes based on the two grey relational ordinals gro ss was third with pn and first with gs respectively fig 9c g in the comprehensive analysis of the three treatments the gro results of pn and gs were consistent with the variables ranked in the following descending order laba raba ss sod pod and pro overall under changing swc 55 85 fc aba content was closely related to photosynthesis among all the assessed variables fig 9d h 4 discussion 4 1 effects of soil water change on photosynthesis in wheat the net photosynthetic rate reflects the level of photosynthesis in wheat which was influenced by both stomatal and non stomatal factors the decrease in leaf gs and the damage to the photosynthetic apparatus of photosystem ii by ros under abiotic stress decreases pn which reduces the energy supply to the crop flexas et al 2006 gururani et al 2015 medrano et al 2002 in this pot study gs and pn of wheat significantly decreased under three drought scenarios p i g treatments the reduction in gs lowers water loss and reduces the co2 content within the leaves jones 1998 in the g treatment the gs dropped rapidly to less than 0 1 mol h2o m 2s 1 swc 0 204 fig 3b however pn did not immediately drop to the lowest level due to the sudden drop in gs fig 3a this means that the decrease in pn may be affected by metabolic impairment during the drought phase swc 0 204 this is consistent with several studies that revealed that the metabolic damage of leaf photosynthesis usually occurs at lower values of gs 0 05 0 1 mol h2o m 2s 1 which is an indirect result 0 1 0 2 mol h2o m 2s 1 of the previous leaf oxidative stress response bota et al 2004 flexas et al 2006 in addition the impairment degree of specific metabolic processes under low gs ranges from 0 to 100 depending on the research protocol and crop species flexas et al 2004a 2004b accordingly this indicates that the difference in stress response under different drought conditions may lead to different degrees of metabolic damage to crops leading to differences in pn moreover in the present pot study the gs of the primed groups p and i were higher than 0 1 mol h2o m 2s 1 thus the primed plants did not suffer from metabolic damage which enhanced the recovery of pn after re watering the pn of primed plants treatments p and i recovered to the c levels within one week after re watering at the jointing stage s1 sr and pn exceeded the levels in c in the second week s2 sr after re watering this indicates that the primed plants obtained more energy than the non primed plants during the re watering stage however there was no significant difference in gs between the primed and non primed plants at this time point therefore stomatal factors may not have caused photosynthetic overcompensation for photosynthesis to be restored to the control level during the re watering stage besides the pca results showed that the stress state of the primed plants was significantly different from the control after re watering in the jointing stage pod and sod were two important factors contributing to the difference in stress response after re watering in the jointing stage while laba had relatively less influence fig 8 in addition it has been observed that drought acclimatization increases the electron transfer rate in leaves flexas et al 2006 considering the control effect of aba on the stomata and the stronger antioxidant capacity contributing to the restoration of photosynthesis in crops after re watering the stress response after re watering may be related to photosynthetic compensation aliyeva et al 2020 yan et al 2003 this is owing to the fact that drought stress causes a reduction in the photosynthetic electron transport chain resulting in the production of superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen in chloroplasts and the excessive accumulation of ros which can lead to photosynthetic organ damage shao et al 2008 sod and pod play important roles as antioxidant enzymes for the scavenging of ros in chloroplasts mitochondria and cytoplasm gechev et al 2006 a study showed that drought tolerant and drought sensitive wheat showed significant differences in their thylakoid membrane structures after drought re watering and that the drought tolerant variety showed stronger dynamic responses in photosynthetic and antioxidant capacity aliyeva et al 2020 these results suggest may imply that stronger antioxidant capacity helps maintain the dynamic balance of ros in leaf cells safeguarding the restoration and stability of the photosynthetic environment and creating favorable conditions for the production of photosynthetic compensation 4 2 stimulating effect of soil water change on crop stress responses the content of osmotic substances pro and ss and the antioxidant enzyme activity pod and sod in treatment p were higher than those in treatment i during the sd period of pre jointing drought and in the sr period after re watering in the jointing stage this implies that prolonging the duration of drought at the same drought level enhances the stress response of wheat and increases the time required to recover to the control level after re watering the increase in pro ss and antioxidant enzyme activity with the duration of drought at the same drought level has also been demonstrated in previous studies abid et al 2018 hao et al 2019 sun et al 2015 in addition previous studies have confirmed that short term water stress 10 days of 55 60 fc in the vegetative growth stage increases the content and activity of stress indicators sod pod ss and pro in wheat leaves which are restored to control levels within two weeks after re watering abid et al 2018 mu et al 2021 drought levels in this pot study were also 55 65 fc however the stress responses did not fully restore the control levels within two weeks after re watering owing to the increased drought duration 16 days during water status changes there are time differences in the stress responses between different indicators as observed in the present study 1 the laba level in treatment i at the second drought stage increased before other indicators to a higher level than in treatment p 2 the raba level and the content of osmotic substances pro and ss was restored to the control level after two weeks of re watering at the jointing stage s2 and sr but the other indicators were not restored figs 4 and 6 the response of the antioxidant protective enzyme system lagging behind laba is due to the involvement of antioxidant enzymes in the scavenging of excess ros and the synthesis of ros induced by aba gechev et al 2006 jiang and zhang 2002 yan et al 2007 zhu 2016 in addition the response of sod and cat under drought priming conditions is regulated by aba wang et al 2021b therefore the relatively rapid recovery of the two osmolytes in the sr stage indicates that other stress mechanisms are still working after the osmotic stress is relieved which might be a factor in the observed compensatory effect on photosynthesis grey relational analysis indicated that aba is the most related to photosynthesis and the increase in drought rehydration times can strengthen the correlation between ss and pn the importance of aba in crop responses to drought is well documented gupta et al 2020 liu et al 2005 rowe et al 2016 wang et al 2021b in the present study the content of aba in the leaves was significantly higher than in the roots under drought this is because the rapid synthesis of aba under stress in angiosperms only occurs in the leaves zhang et al 2018 therefore the aba content in the leaves is higher than in other tissues the increased correlation between ss and pn is due to the involvement of ss in osmoregulation and being a product of photosynthesis farooq et al 2009 muller et al 2011 4 3 reference role of stress states in winter wheat for drought degree assessment field trials in winter wheat have shown that regulated deficit irrigation rdi is beneficial for growth of wheat and improving its water use efficiency du et al 2010 wang et al 2018b zhang et al 2006 1998 accordingly many studies have been focusing on wheat s growth and yield at a field scale to explore suitable regulated deficit irrigation schemes ali et al 2007 du et al 2010 zhang et al 2006 in these field trials the advantages and limitations of regulated deficit irrigation usually have been evaluated based on its growth yield and water use efficiency however in fact the physiological response of the crop to water changes can also be informative in estimating the effect of regulated deficit irrigation this is because crops under adverse conditions would divert energy and resources from normal growth to stress responses which may reduce their productivity zhang et al 2020 in the regulated deficit irrigation scheme for winter wheat the gradual decrease of soil water over time after irrigation was coincided with the g treatment in this pot study while the wet dry wet variation in soil owing to the different frequency of irrigation was coincided with that of the p and i treatments the g treatment classified soil water content swc by stress status as r1 0 301 0 243 100 80 fc r2 0 210 0 136 70 45 fc and r3 0 121 0 103 40 34 fc in contrast swc was broadly classified in many studies according to production experience as no water deficit 70 fc mild 60 fc moderate 50 fc and severe drought 45 fc and usually severe drought leads to severe crop yield reduction abid et al 2018 hao et al 2019 kang et al 2002 meng et al 2016 results based on these two classifications are basically consistent besides the magnitude of stress response changes induced by the same water reduction according to swc in the range of r1 r2 and r3 were different fig 7 this implied that the stress response caused by water changes becomes more intense as drought deepens leading to a gradual imbalance between growth and stress response which eventually causes irreversible damage to wheat after the swc falls below 40 fc the results of the p and i treatments indicated that the increase in the drought re watering cycle during vegetative growth facilitated the observed photosynthetic compensation and a more adequate and rapid mobilization of the stress response for winter wheat the above findings provide an empirical reference for the result that wheat is suitable for moderate water deficit during its vegetative growth as previously shown by field studies based on its physiological response ali et al 2007 du et al 2010 zhang et al 2006 according to the physiological response of winter wheat in this pot study increasing the drought re watering cycle under suitable soil water would be beneficial different drought re watering schemes could be implemented in fields by varying the irrigation frequency at the same total amount of irrigation 120 mm in the field yield and water use efficiency were higher with two irrigations 60 mm each for jointing heading or heading milking than with three irrigations 40 mm each for jointing heading filling and one irrigation 120 mm for jointing or heading or milking bian et al 2016 li et al 2010 this means that under limited total water allocation an appropriate increase in the number of irrigation is indeed conducive to increasing production and water use efficiency but not the higher the frequency is better furthermore higher yields may be obtained if wheat could produce photosynthetic compensation during the two critical periods of jointing and flowering this pot study showed that drought re watering was conducive to the photosynthetic compensation effect so it was a good choice to supplement irrigation at the jointing and flowering and moderate drought in other periods in this regard a study showed that irrigation during jointing and flowering could guarantee high yield and water use efficiency of winter wheat in the north china plain in wet dry and normal years from 1981 to 2015 zhao et al 2020 5 conclusion compared to treatment c gs and pn in p i and g drought treatments were significantly lower with gs decreasing faster than pn the aba content osmotic substances pro and ss content and sod activity were increased exponentially r 2 0 836 0 962 and peroxidase activity was increased in an s shaped r 2 0 956 manner under treatment g the drought stress indicator with the greatest variation was pro whose value at 34 fc was about 25 times higher than at 100 fc the drought re watering cycles during drought priming p and i stimulated the stress response of primed plants to changes in soil water the aba pro and ss content and pod sod activity under treatment p increased with the increase in drought duration besides the response of aba in the leaves of treatment i during the second drought before jointing was faster than other indicators overall the relationship between aba content in the leaves and roots and photosynthesis was stronger than between antioxidant enzymes and osmotic substances gro 1 2 the increase in the number of drought re watering cycles raised the maximum pn value after re watering primed plants in the jointing stage hence associated with a higher stress response in primed plants the pn in treatment i was 3 8 higher than p and 8 17 higher than treatment c after re watering in the jointing stage besides increasing the number of drought rehydration cycles enhances the relationship between soluble sugars and photosynthesis in conclusion different drought regimes affect the stress status of winter wheat to different degrees with intermittent drought facilitating a better drought priming
