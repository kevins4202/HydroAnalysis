9005,water is an issue in spain where it is generally scarce and its availability is highly variable in different areas and times particularly in agriculture the main water consumer water pricing is one of the policy instruments used to control irrigation water use however specific contextual studies to provide greater details understand farmers behaviour and clarify the consequences and effectiveness of water pricing are generally unavailable here we developed and applied a simulation model based on two positive mathematical programming pmp methods which makes the model more robust to better understand and quantify the impact of the north south territorial gradient on farmers decisions concerning agricultural water pricing in the first phase of the navarra canal irrigation area in northern spain this model couples water use with rainfed and irrigated areas farmer revenue and labour the results show spatial north south variability in the 50 km of the first phase of the navarra canal in northern and middle regions when water prices are increased rainfed crops are chosen to substitute irrigated crops due to abundant rainfall and a lack of the appropriate climate and soil to grow other crops meanwhile southern regions depend mainly on irrigation and are more sensitive to water price increases these very productive southern regions also show larger gross margins and paid labour values in every canal region with an increase of 0 1 eur m3 in the water price economic losses can reach up to 400 eur ha meanwhile an increase in water prices over 0 eur m3 leads to decreased water use per hectare keywords water value water use socioeconomic aspects irrigation project positive mathematical programming navarra canal spain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction spanish water problems and conflicts are generally due to bad governance de stefano and llamas 2013 incentives to better manage this resource and reconcile the economic social and environmental demands are key particularly in the agricultural sector which is the largest water user and comprises about 70 per cent of freshwater use in spain rey et al 2011 irrigation in spain is currently based on volumetric management either at the bulk level 6188 comunidades de regantes are granted volumetric water use licences or at the individual level farmers within state managed schemes molle 2009 a total of 41 of spain s irrigated area is sprinkler or micro irrigation which enables easier volumetric control molle 2009 there are different mechanisms for improving agricultural water management including policies property rights prices and governance in many cases a combination is needed to address water pollution and ecosystem conservation while allowing agriculture to adjust to market demand for instance in australia priority differentiated water rights in combination with water markets have greatly contributed to the flexibility of water allocations and therefore improving risk exposure and economic efficiency freebairn and quiggin 2006 another example is the conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater resources which alleviates the effects of droughts on the profitability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the yaqui valley mexico schoups et al 2006 in the nile river basin establishing a legal and institutional framework is a prerequisite for effective cooperation between the riparian countries along the river wehling 2020 the modernisation of irrigation generally leads to favourable outcomes such as higher crop yields the diversification of crops and a general increase in family incomes haro monteagudo et al 2022 however in some cases such as some spanish areas it can also result in the intensification of irrigation and a reduction in return flows playán and mateos 2006 lecina et al 2010 lópez moreno et al 2020 regarding water pricing there are different experiences in different parts of the globe the countries employing water pricing include australia england france israel jordan mexico morocco india spain and the usa the european water framework directive 2000 60 ec wfd in article 9 encourages member states to use water pricing as one of the instruments to achieve efficient water use and contribute to the full cost recovery of water services and environmental objectives of the directive molle 2009 water prices can be powerful signals to trigger behavioural change berbel and expósito 2020 however in some cases due to the low elasticity of agricultural water demand and other factors pricing policies may not deliver the expected outcomes molle and berkoff 2007 rey et al 2011 for instance berbel and gomez limón 2000 report negative impacts of water pricing on farm income and labour as farmers in response to price increases may reduce water consumption through shifts in crop plans substituting high value crops with high water demand with less profitable crops different methods and simulation models based on different mathematical programming methods have been applied to simulate and quantify the expected water pricing impact on agricultural water use farm

momeni et al 2019 montilla lópez et al 2017 speelman et al 2009 and macroeconomic level parrado et al 2019 2020 this research has traditionally focused on water demand in irrigated schemes however only a few of them e g sapino et al 2020 pérez blanco et al 2021 sapino et al 2022 are based on more robust decision making using multi model ensemble frameworks encompassing several mathematical programming models moreover to successfully implement water pricing mechanisms it is important to consider the social environmental and institutional context dinar et al 2015 particularly in the case of large irrigation projects however none of the studies on water pricing has assessed the influence of the territorial and climate gradient on the water pricing simulation results the present study focuses on these three dimensions using two calibration approaches to obtain more robust results this paper aims to analyse the impact of the north south territorial gradient on water demand rainfed and irrigated areas and socio economic variables through the current system of irrigation water pricing in the ten sectors i x of the 1st phase of the navarra canal irrigation area in northern spain hitherto there has been no contextual study of the water pricing effects in this irrigation project which is one of the largest irrigation schemes in northern spain the analysis was aggregated for the first phase of the navarra canal and per region grouping northern middle and southern sectors according to the different climate conditions this study innovatively assesses and confirms how the territorial distribution closely related to climate and soil variations and the resulting crop gradient affect crop choices for a given water price and thus also has implications for water use revenues and social aspects labour in an area that combines rainfed and irrigated systems furthermore this study shows how a water price increase affects farmers decisions and the subsequent effects on gross margin labour and water use in different regions the territorial context is key for understanding the impacts of water pricing policies and should be considered in water policies and planning processes 2 material and methods 2 1 a case study in the navarra canal the first phase of the navarra canal is an irrigation and water supply channel network located in the navarra autonomous community in the north of spain which captures a wide range of climatic diversity it is part of a larger infrastructure the navarra canal which transports water from the irati river in northern navarra to the central and southern areas of navarra and has a length of about 180 km the first phase of the navarra canal is located within the ebro river basin between the itoiz reservoir and the municipality of pitillas it irrigates 22 473 ha in 2017 variable between years all irrigated with drip and localised systems intia 2018a it is divided into 16 sectors or irrigable areas benefiting 29 municipalities located in agricultural regions iii 2 326 ha v 15 895 ha and vi 7739 ha in the year 2017 see fig 1 and table a 1 in the appendix some of the leaders of the food industry in spain especially in vegetable transformation are located in the first phase of the navarra canal with national and foreign capital sabi 2022 the climate is mediterranean drier in the southern part with less oceanic influence less rainfall between 400 and 600 mm as an annual average and higher temperatures 14 ºc as an annual average fig 2 the climatic conditions together with the soil properties influence the spatial distribution of crop types and agricultural systems since different crops require different amounts of rainfall humidity warmth and sunshine as well as different types of soil cereals are the most extended crop representing 46 of the area with grain corn as the main crop followed by winter wheat rainfed barley tends to be the option chosen for unequipped plots this is followed by vegetables comprising 22 of the area mainly peas beans broccoli tomato sweet corn spinach and fava beans vineyards comprising 10 industrial crops comprising 9 fodder comprising 8 olive trees comprising 2 fruit trees comprising 1 grain legumes comprising 1 and nursery crops comprising 1 intia 2018a in terms of crop diversity 55 different crops are planted in the first phase sectors ii 2 iv 1 iv 3 iv 4 v and ix have the greatest crop diversity comprising between 30 and 29 different crops intia 2018a the area of double crops represents 16 of the utilised area sectors iv 5 and ix stand out comprising between 48 and 25 of double crops respectively the main double crops are 17 grass corn 17 peas beans 7 cereal broccoli 6 peas corn 6 cereal beans 6 peas sweet corn and 5 bean grain corn intia 2018a the crop mix for each sector and region are included in the supplementary materials the operating costs for irrigators are composed of a fixed charge per hectare per year and a variable charge depending on water consumption table 1 the average crop data can be found in the supplementary materials 2 2 price simulation model a farmer behaviour simulation model through positive mathematical programming pmp was developed and applied to the first phase of the navarra canal in 2012 2017 the pmp was formally proposed by howitt 1995 and consisted of eliciting a non linear objective function that typically includes a quadratic cost or yield function such that observed activity levels are reproduced by the optimal solution the non linear function relies on information contained in dual values of calibration constraints of a linear programming model where variables are constrained to observed activity levels by stage 1 there are several advantages of the pmp over other mathematical programming models i it perfectly reproduces the level of activities of the reference year without using artificial constraints ii it provides flexible smooth simulation behaviour avoiding questionable overspecialisation and abrupt discontinuities in the simulation solutions iii it can be developed with relatively scarce data and iv it allows calibrating complex economic technical and environmental relationships capturing adjustments in the intensive and extensive margins instead of using a single method we will use two pmp calibration methods to obtain more robust results to keep it simple we will use two methods that do not require exogenous information such as land rent or exogenous elasticities the first method is based on the standard approach of howitt 1995 using quadratic cost functions we will use the average cost approach of heckelei and britz 2000 which ensures that in the reference year the quadratic cost function reproduces the observed average cost of each activity moreover to avoid the marginal crop behaving differently from the rest by having a linear cost the non preferred crop area will not be subject to change this is possible because it will be a rainfed crop of little relevance in the study area the second pmp method is developed by dagnino and ward 2012 which relies on a quadratic yield function whose calibrating parameters are elicited from the first order conditions using only crop information skipping the first calibration stage this method like the approach of heckelei and britz 2000 also ensures that the profit of the activities in the reference year coincides with the average profit since it reproduces the average observed yield by skipping the first calibration step full information on the quadratic yield function parameters is available for every crop the variables of the models are the area devoted to each crop in every sector of the navarra canal x c s the whole irrigated and rainfed area was simulated this area includes all representative irrigated crops double cropping and rainfed crops as already mentioned the main irrigated crops are corn wheat and vineyards while the main rainfed alternative crops in terms of crop area were identified as wheat barley and vineyards intia 2018a new activities were created for each double crop wheat broccoli wheat beans wheat corn etc then the area of the first crop e g wheat was divided into different activities when a second crop succeeded it in the same agronomic year finally the areas devoted to each activity with double crops were estimated by their relative presence in 2017 as area data by sector were available for this year the most common double croppings during 2012 2017 were winter cereal corn bean corn fodder corn pea green bean winter cereal green bean and ray grass corn aguacanal 2012 2017 the most common triple cropping during the same period was spinach pea sweet corn cereal corn bean corn fodder corn pea green bean winter cereal green bean and ray grass corn aguacanal 2012 2017 however triple croppings were not included as they represent a very small part of the land and complete information is unavailable 2 2 1 calibration each sector of the navarra canal was calibrated and simulated independently with the main crops present including double crops in each irrigation sector a typical farmer was considered as one whose crop distribution was the average of his sector for this typical farmer we obtained two utility functions maximising profit one from each pmp method the profit was considered in the short term and measured through the expected gross margin gm which is the result of subtracting all the variable costs associated with the crop from the income by maximising the objective functions the positive models exactly reproduce the crop distribution in the observed year in the case of the standard approach the objective function takes the following form 1 gm s c price c yield c α c s ½ β c s x c s x c s s where gm s is the gross margin in sector s x c s is the area of crop c in sector s price c and yield c are the price and yield of each crop respectively and α c s and β c s are the linear and quadratic calibrating parameters calculated in the first stage for every crop and sector among all the variants available for determining the calibration parameters the average cost approach of heckelei and britz 2000 was followed with the following calibrating parameters 2 α c s avgcost c μ c s 3 β c s 2 μ c s x c s obs where avgcost c is the average cost of every crop and μ c s is the dual value or shadow price of the calibrating constraint of each crop in the first stage the calibrating constraints of the linear model stage 1 consist of equating the area variables x c s plus a negligible term epsilon to the observed level of each activity the objective function of the second method of dagnino and ward 2012 is as follows 4 gm s c price c b 0 c s b 1 c s x c s avgcost c x c s s where b 0 c s and b 1 c s are the linear and quadratic terms of the yield function respectively 5 b 0 c s yield c b 1 c s x c s obs 6 b 1 c s gm c obs price c x c s obs where gm c obs is the average income per unit of land after the calibration of the models a simulation of water price increases by 0 01 eur m3 steps was performed on the current tariffs during the simulation farmers could change the crop pattern but no other actions were allowed such as new investments or the possibility of deficit irrigation new investments in irrigation technology which increase the perennial crop area were not allowed since farmers responses are only considered in the short term for the same reason disinvestment in the form of a reduction in the area of perennial crops was not allowed only in the case of perennial crops with rainfed alternatives were these perennial crops allowed to be shifted to their rainfed options on the other hand including deficit irrigation requires dose response functions for each crop this requires a dose response function for each climatic zone and this information is unavailable these simulations were completed per sector and the results were aggregated for each price increase additionally in the howitt calibration method a constraint was introduced on the marginal crop the one with the lowest gross margin and no dual value in the calibration constraints the constraint prevented the marginal crop from growing excessively in the simulation therefore the area of marginal crops was limited to the observed area this point will be further analysed in the discussion 2 3 clustering of sectors to analyse the north south climatic gradient the ten sectors sectors i x of the first phase of the navarra canal were grouped according to their geographical location as follows northern region i ii 1 ii 2 and iii middle region iv 1 iv 2 iv 4 v vi vii and viii southern region iv 3 iv 5 ix and x 2 4 data sources a summary of the data and their sources is offered in table 2 the annual water cost data based on the water origin surface water for the first phase of the navarra canal area during 2012 2017 in terms of fixed costs eur ha and variable costs eur m3 were obtained from public data from the administration navarre institute of transfer and innovation in agri food sector intia the irrigation field application efficiencies per crop and sector were obtained by crosschecking two different sources 1 the crop area per irrigation system per sector intia 2019 was combined with the field application efficiency s widely used values assuming a sprinkler irrigation efficiency of 85 and a drip irrigation efficiency of 95 intia 2018b 2 water use efficiency was the ratio between the estimated crop water requirements intia 2018b and the actual irrigation applied aguacanal 2012 2017 the crop water requirements based on the reference evapotranspiration values eto crop coefficients effective rainfall and irrigation efficiency allen et al 1998 per crop and sector were obtained from intia 2018b the actual irrigation water applied m3 ha per crop and sector was obtained from aguacanal a company that manages the infrastructure of the navarra canal irrigation area 2012 2017 average crop water requirements were estimated for crops with different planting dates cycles and growing systems broccoli february 1 august 1 august 15

july 1 june 10 pea early late and olive grove standard and grown on trellises the area of irrigated crops per sector was obtained from aguacanal 2012 2017 and the crop area of rainfed and irrigated crops in each sector and agricultural region was obtained from intia 2019 the payments associated with the production of the common agricultural policy 2015 2020 were obtained from mapama 2018 and the prices paid to producers were obtained from the government of navarra 2012 2017a the crop yield per agricultural region and year was obtained from the government of navarra 2012 2017b the yield is attributed according to the agricultural region where the crop is located table a 1 in the appendix when the sectors were in more than one agricultural region the yield data were weighted by the crop area in each sector and region if the crop distribution was not available as in the case of rapeseed rye green beans potatoes grain green fava beans broccoli cauliflower and vetch in some cases an average of both regions was used the yield data of the category tree were weighted according to the different types of tree areas in each sector mainly almond and walnut trees the category pea refers to the green pea grain when irrigated and dry peas when rainfed the category beans refers to green beans the olive grove is used to produce olive oil tomato and pepper were grown for industry the yield data of the category corn were weighted according to the different types of corn areas in each sector including sweet corn corn for grain forage corn and seed corn the yield of the winter cereal category refers to the weighted average yield of common wheat barley and oat if no vineyard type was specified the yield was assumed to be the average of winemaking vineyards d o navarra vineyards and other wines if the potato type was not specified the yield was assumed to be the average of mid and late season potatoes direct costs and labour per crop were obtained from the government of navarra 2012 2017c 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of water prices aggregated results figs 3 and 4 present the aggregated water price simulation results for the first phase of the navarra canal related to the irrigated rainfed crop area amount of water used gross margin and labour using both the dagnino and ward and howitt calibration methods as can be seen the results differ from one calibration method to another using two calibration simulation methodologies has allowed us to obtain more robust results considering the zone of uncertainty between the two resulting curves we cannot claim that one model is methodologically superior to the other as both have pros and cons which are described below in section 3 3 the intermediate zone between the two calibration method results is assumed to be the level of uncertainty derived from the calibration method this intermediate zone is where the actual results are likely to be fig 3 shows the evolution of the area occupied by the main crops in relation to water price increases in general the substitution of irrigated crops can be observed mainly corn for rainfed winter cereals wheat and barley but also for irrigated winter cereals wheat and barley given their low water requirements fig 3 helps to understand the different behaviours of the two calibration methods in terms of the change from irrigated to rainfed crops water use gross margin and labour in dagnino and ward s method the substitution of corn for winter cereals occurs linearly up to a water price of 0 45 eur m3 in the case of howitt this change occurred before up to a price of only 0 30 eur m3 the total substitution of corn for winter crops at 0 45 and 0 30 eur m3 marks the changes in the slope of water use in fig 4b on the other hand the substituted crop also varies depending on the method used in the first case the substitution is towards irrigated wheat and rainfed barley following howitt s method the substitution is more prominent towards rainfed wheat and rainfed barley it can also be seen that the areas of irrigated wheat and barley while initially increasing up to the turning point of 0 30 eur m3 decrease in favour of their rainfed variants fig 4 shows the aggregated irrigated rainfed crop area amount of water used gross margin and labour in relation to water price variations fig 4a shows the change from irrigated to rainfed areas occupied by the main crops due to the effect of water prices as can be seen irrigated crops begin to be replaced by rainfed crops starting at 0 eur m3 the intermediate striped zone between the irrigated and the rainfed area represents the area of uncertainty that one calibration model considers to be irrigated and the other model does not consider to be irrigated fig 4b illustrates the water use simulation when the water price increases that is the water demand curve at each price level this figure shows an elastic phase from 00 to 0 30 0 40 eur depending on the calibrating method in this phase a small water price increase means a strong decrease in water use then there is an inelastic stretch where an increase in the price of water does not translate into a significant decrease in water use this reveals that water pricing encourages water conservation from the first cent increase in the first phase of the navarra canal as water use decreases above a water price of 0 eur m3 water pricing is therefore an effective policy instrument to encourage water saving measures in the region conversely the water demand curves estimated in previous studies based on different mathematical programming methods and regions present a totally inelastic first section berbel and gomez limón 2000 gómez limón et al 2016 gutiérrez martín and gómez gómez 2011 gutiérrez martín et al 2014 momeni et al 2019 montilla lópez et al 2017 speelman et al 2009 this means that in the very first stretch of the curve water price changes do not affect water use these differences in the first stretch of the water demand curve seem to be due to the methodology used and the context of the study a first elastic stretch is common when applying mathematical programming techniques such as in the case study shown in this paper when using pmp approaches changes in water use normally occur from the first increase in water prices nevertheless sometimes when using pmp methodologies an initial inelastic stretch can still appear as shown by montilla lópez et al 2017 this may be due to the high profitability of all crops and agronomic constraints representing crop rotations market or agricultural policy constraints sapino et al 2020 developed a multi model ensemble framework encompassing two pmp models without inelastic stretch and three multi attribute models a weighted goal programming adapted to a cobb douglas function with inelastic stretch and two slightly less inelastic pmaup positive multi attribute utility programming functions sapino et al 2022 present a very interesting pmaup based case with an inelastic section at the beginning of the water demand curve that becomes elastic when there is the possibility to shift to deficit irrigation this means that when there is only the possibility to shift the crop the farmers do not reduce water use as they do not change the crop plan however when introducing water response functions farmers can reduce the irrigation dose without changing the crop grown then the curve loses its inelastic section contradicting some of the previous papers that state that water pricing makes no sense due to the existence of the inelastic section expósito and berbel 2017 berbel and expósito 2020 however in the cases where deficit irrigation is already being applied as in many cases in the guadalquivir river basin in the south of spain this inelastic section could continue to exist montilla lópez et al 2017 furthermore depending on the area s profitability the inelastic stretch can be shorter or longer for instance the stretch is longer in rich horticultural areas where irrigated crops provide a higher return than rainfed alternatives in these areas farmers are willing to pay the water price increase montilla lópez et al 2017 report an inelastic section up to 0 30 eur m3 in the lower guadalquivir at the same time berbel and gomez limón 2000 show an inelastic section up to 0 07 eur m3 in the mid guadalquivir valley and bajo carrión in southern spain obviously a water price increase has economic effects as shown in fig 4c losses of up to 400 eur ha can be observed for water price increases of 0 10 eur m3 wages and agricultural labour are also affected by farmers cropping decisions fig 4d in this case an increase in the price of water does not translate into a significant decrease in labour although labour is not an attribute that is part of the objective function this indicator is also measured in the model 3 2 simulation of water prices results per region fig 5 shows the variation in crop acreage as the price of water increases mainly the replacement of corn with rainfed winter cereals in the three regions of the first phase of the navarra canal this is due to several factors including the water price and other variables such as the climate and market prices for instance corn production has changed in recent years depending on international market prices which fluctuate widely wheat and other cereals have a similar profitability to corn with payment of the fixed charge but the variable part is saved when corn prices fall the northern sectors opt for rainfed crops while the southern sectors opt for vegetables the lower the price of corn the greater the diversification in the south fig 6 presents stacked areas of crops as a function of water prices per region where blue represents irrigated areas and green represents rainfed areas in this figure the northern and middle regions clearly change from irrigated to rainfed crops when water prices increase southern regions show a very wide area of uncertainty in southern regions rainwater is scarcer and more irregular and vegetables and fruit trees especially irrigated crops with the highest economic productivity have a larger presence there are two different agricultural models in the first phase of the navarra canal 1 simplification no irrigation of irrigated agriculture in northern and middle areas to reduce irrigation costs these are very productive cereal areas where the main limiting factors when choosing the crop are climate and soil there are a few alternatives for crop diversification and a limited possibility of double cropping with very good cereal predictions 2 intensification of irrigation in productive southern areas with more options of double and even triple cropping in areas where the climate and soil quality allow it according to monjardino et al 2022 the agronomy including plant genetics and physiology meteorology and soil science had greater influence on financial performance than irrigation infrastructure in the irrigation region of the riverina in the murray darling basin of eastern australia in their case when analysing the trade offs of irrigation simplification intensification diversification to manage economic risk in this region intensified scenarios had the highest net value overall while crop diversification with moderate inputs was superior in mitigating economic risk due to higher returns per litre of irrigated water and more diverse sources of income fig 7 shows whether and how much a water pricing measure can generate water savings with a consequent decrease in the gross margin see fig 8 southern regions begin at a higher level of irrigation water use 4400 m3 ha compared to the middle and northern areas 3200 m3 ha due to the lack of rainfall in those areas southern regions seem to be the most elastic particularly in their first section fig 7 they also show greater uncertainty because the models give a wider range of results northern and middle regions are almost equal in terms of water use they are a bit less elastic and less affected by water price changes this might be because they can use rainwater as well as irrigation water e g rainfed vs irrigated wheat southern sectors are more sensitive to price changes because they depend on and use irrigation water more in northern and middle regions a price of water above 0 3 eur m3 has economic effects fig 8 and a slight social effect on paid labour fig 9 but no environmental consequences similar amount of water used fig 7 in the case of water prices versus gross margin fig 8 the southernmost regions seem to show higher elasticity by maximising utility we are maximising the gross margin overall this causes the curve to have smooth changes this graph is useful for understanding the extent of the economic impact if the price of water is increased fig 8 also shows differences between the northern and middle regions northern areas become negative at about 0 5 eur m3 while middle areas become negative at 0 7 eur m3 southern areas also become negative at 0 5 eur m3 this number even if uncertain seems similar to the northern region the wage of agricultural labour responds differently to the water pricing in different regions fig 9 in northern and middle regions increases in the price of water do not translate into significant decreases in labour in these regions the maximum difference in terms of labour is about 10 15 h per hectare between water prices of 0 and 1 eur m3 the crops of the northern and middle regions do not require much labour in irrigated or rainfed conditions with similar labour in irrigated and rainfed areas on the other hand the south is slightly less inelastic and shows a maximum difference of about 35 40 h per hectare between 0 and 1 eur m3 this is because in southern regions there are more horticultural crops which generate the most labour 3 3 results and limitations related to the methodology the pmp has some shortcomings mainly the underdetermination of calibration parameters and the bias of the first calibration stage the underdetermination is the fact that many sets of calibrating parameters can exactly reproduce the observed level of every activity to overcome this problem many alternatives have been proposed including the average cost approach proposed by heckelei and britz 2000 the use of exogenous supply elasticities helming et al 2001 and the generalised maximum entropy criterion paris and howitt 1998 apart from these alternatives some other problems arise from the first stage as it is not possible to calibrate non observed activities since information on land use for this crop is necessary to calibrate it due to the problems stemming from the first phase of the standard approach skipping it is proposed using exogenous data that provide the shadow prices of land and other resources júdez et al 2001 graveline and mérel 2014 with regard to the methodology there are two main findings related to the rainfed crop simulations which are explained in detail below first the existence of marginal crops in the calibration equations of howitt s standard approach could make the shift to rainfed crops occur faster at lower water prices if no preventive measures are taken second the low presence of rainfed crops hinders their expansion when the cost of water is increased under the dagnino and ward method a known problem with howitt s standard approach is that the marginal least profitable activity has no dual value in the calibration constraints this causes the beta of the cost function for this crop to have no value the entire cost is therefore linear this marginal crop coincides with some rainfed alternatives mainly peas and barley this means there can be a faster substitution of these marginal crops because an increase in their area does not increase their cost for instance if we take sector iv 1 with 2200 ha irrigated all the barley 113 ha is replaced by the marginal crop at the first 0 04 eur m3 corn 817 ha at the first 0 19 eur m3 rapeseed 118 ha at 0 25 eur m3 and wheat sunflower and pea corn 636 ha at approximately 0 30 eur m3 all these crops are replaced by the marginal crop which in this case is rainfed barley to prevent this issue which causes only the area of marginal crops to increase during the simulations the area of marginal crops was limited to the observed area the idea is that in the case of substitution by rainfed crops more profitable crops are preferable the result has been greater diversity in crop substitution and a delay in substitution timing in terms of water prices that is substitution with other crops occurs at higher prices although not as high as in dagnino and ward s method as shown in fig 4 on the other hand in areas where rainfed barley was the marginal crop the area could not expand causing the other predominant winter cereal i e rainfed wheat to grow much faster nevertheless in aggregate rainfed barley increases more with the howitt method than with the dagnino and ward method where substitution is also made with irrigated winter cereals this is undoubtedly the main difference between the two methods in addition to the greater presence of rainfed wheat the substitution of winter cereals in dagnino and ward s method deserves another methodological reflection as can be seen in fig 6 the uncertainty zone in the southern region is much larger than in the other regions this is mainly due to sectors iv 5 and ix of this region in these sectors the initial non irrigated cereal area i e rainfed wheat and barley is small 10 ha in total 0 5 in sector iv 5 and 79 ha 3 4 in sector ix this causes the b1 calibration coefficient to be relatively high for these winter cereals in relation to other irrigated crops this means that if the area of these rainfed cereals is extended their yield decreases rapidly the b1 coefficient reduces the yield and is multiplied by the square of the area consequently there is hardly any substitution for rainfed crops even when prices rise sharply because rainfed crops are not profitable this situation does not make much sense agronomically because we assume that rainfed crops would grow well on the land previously occupied by irrigated crops this problem in dagnino and ward s methodology is reflected in the uncertainty of rainfed and irrigated areas water use fig 7 and gross margin fig 8 in the southern region 4 conclusions the first phase of the navarra canal is a unique case in which along its 50 km expanse there are several territorial features and climatic zones which are key to explaining the different farmers responses to increases in water prices the northernmost regions abandon irrigation because the rainfed irrigation differential does not compensate well enough meanwhile southern regions which are warmer and drier introduce fruit trees and vegetables the findings from this study reveal that when formulating water pricing policies it is key to consider the local and regional circumstances such as the climate soil type crops grown and possible alternative crops and market conditions climate change projections could also be a variable factor to consider in this way incorporating the green water footprint component water from precipitation that is stored in the root zone of the soil and evaporated transpired or incorporated by plants in water pricing modelling might be helpful to identify appropriate policies to set water pricing in the agricultural sector moreover it is important to anticipate water pricing impacts not only on the environment but also on socio economic facets it is important and necessary to incorporate the triple dimension of sustainability

9005,water is an issue in spain where it is generally scarce and its availability is highly variable in different areas and times particularly in agriculture the main water consumer water pricing is one of the policy instruments used to control irrigation water use however specific contextual studies to provide greater details understand farmers behaviour and clarify the consequences and effectiveness of water pricing are generally unavailable here we developed and applied a simulation model based on two positive mathematical programming pmp methods which makes the model more robust to better understand and quantify the impact of the north south territorial gradient on farmers decisions concerning agricultural water pricing in the first phase of the navarra canal irrigation area in northern spain this model couples water use with rainfed and irrigated areas farmer revenue and labour the results show spatial north south variability in the 50 km of the first phase of the navarra canal in northern and middle regions when water prices are increased rainfed crops are chosen to substitute irrigated crops due to abundant rainfall and a lack of the appropriate climate and soil to grow other crops meanwhile southern regions depend mainly on irrigation and are more sensitive to water price increases these very productive southern regions also show larger gross margins and paid labour values in every canal region with an increase of 0 1 eur m3 in the water price economic losses can reach up to 400 eur ha meanwhile an increase in water prices over 0 eur m3 leads to decreased water use per hectare keywords water value water use socioeconomic aspects irrigation project positive mathematical programming navarra canal spain data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction spanish water problems and conflicts are generally due to bad governance de stefano and llamas 2013 incentives to better manage this resource and reconcile the economic social and environmental demands are key particularly in the agricultural sector which is the largest water user and comprises about 70 per cent of freshwater use in spain rey et al 2011 irrigation in spain is currently based on volumetric management either at the bulk level 6188 comunidades de regantes are granted volumetric water use licences or at the individual level farmers within state managed schemes molle 2009 a total of 41 of spain s irrigated area is sprinkler or micro irrigation which enables easier volumetric control molle 2009 there are different mechanisms for improving agricultural water management including policies property rights prices and governance in many cases a combination is needed to address water pollution and ecosystem conservation while allowing agriculture to adjust to market demand for instance in australia priority differentiated water rights in combination with water markets have greatly contributed to the flexibility of water allocations and therefore improving risk exposure and economic efficiency freebairn and quiggin 2006 another example is the conjunctive management of surface water and groundwater resources which alleviates the effects of droughts on the profitability and sustainability of irrigated agriculture in the yaqui valley mexico schoups et al 2006 in the nile river basin establishing a legal and institutional framework is a prerequisite for effective cooperation between the riparian countries along the river wehling 2020 the modernisation of irrigation generally leads to favourable outcomes such as higher crop yields the diversification of crops and a general increase in family incomes haro monteagudo et al 2022 however in some cases such as some spanish areas it can also result in the intensification of irrigation and a reduction in return flows playán and mateos 2006 lecina et al 2010 lópez moreno et al 2020 regarding water pricing there are different experiences in different parts of the globe the countries employing water pricing include australia england france israel jordan mexico morocco india spain and the usa the european water framework directive 2000 60 ec wfd in article 9 encourages member states to use water pricing as one of the instruments to achieve efficient water use and contribute to the full cost recovery of water services and environmental objectives of the directive molle 2009 water prices can be powerful signals to trigger behavioural change berbel and expósito 2020 however in some cases due to the low elasticity of agricultural water demand and other factors pricing policies may not deliver the expected outcomes molle and berkoff 2007 rey et al 2011 for instance berbel and gomez limón 2000 report negative impacts of water pricing on farm income and labour as farmers in response to price increases may reduce water consumption through shifts in crop plans substituting high value crops with high water demand with less profitable crops different methods and simulation models based on different mathematical programming methods have been applied to simulate and quantify the expected water pricing impact on agricultural water use farm

momeni et al 2019 montilla lópez et al 2017 speelman et al 2009 and macroeconomic level parrado et al 2019 2020 this research has traditionally focused on water demand in irrigated schemes however only a few of them e g sapino et al 2020 pérez blanco et al 2021 sapino et al 2022 are based on more robust decision making using multi model ensemble frameworks encompassing several mathematical programming models moreover to successfully implement water pricing mechanisms it is important to consider the social environmental and institutional context dinar et al 2015 particularly in the case of large irrigation projects however none of the studies on water pricing has assessed the influence of the territorial and climate gradient on the water pricing simulation results the present study focuses on these three dimensions using two calibration approaches to obtain more robust results this paper aims to analyse the impact of the north south territorial gradient on water demand rainfed and irrigated areas and socio economic variables through the current system of irrigation water pricing in the ten sectors i x of the 1st phase of the navarra canal irrigation area in northern spain hitherto there has been no contextual study of the water pricing effects in this irrigation project which is one of the largest irrigation schemes in northern spain the analysis was aggregated for the first phase of the navarra canal and per region grouping northern middle and southern sectors according to the different climate conditions this study innovatively assesses and confirms how the territorial distribution closely related to climate and soil variations and the resulting crop gradient affect crop choices for a given water price and thus also has implications for water use revenues and social aspects labour in an area that combines rainfed and irrigated systems furthermore this study shows how a water price increase affects farmers decisions and the subsequent effects on gross margin labour and water use in different regions the territorial context is key for understanding the impacts of water pricing policies and should be considered in water policies and planning processes 2 material and methods 2 1 a case study in the navarra canal the first phase of the navarra canal is an irrigation and water supply channel network located in the navarra autonomous community in the north of spain which captures a wide range of climatic diversity it is part of a larger infrastructure the navarra canal which transports water from the irati river in northern navarra to the central and southern areas of navarra and has a length of about 180 km the first phase of the navarra canal is located within the ebro river basin between the itoiz reservoir and the municipality of pitillas it irrigates 22 473 ha in 2017 variable between years all irrigated with drip and localised systems intia 2018a it is divided into 16 sectors or irrigable areas benefiting 29 municipalities located in agricultural regions iii 2 326 ha v 15 895 ha and vi 7739 ha in the year 2017 see fig 1 and table a 1 in the appendix some of the leaders of the food industry in spain especially in vegetable transformation are located in the first phase of the navarra canal with national and foreign capital sabi 2022 the climate is mediterranean drier in the southern part with less oceanic influence less rainfall between 400 and 600 mm as an annual average and higher temperatures 14 ºc as an annual average fig 2 the climatic conditions together with the soil properties influence the spatial distribution of crop types and agricultural systems since different crops require different amounts of rainfall humidity warmth and sunshine as well as different types of soil cereals are the most extended crop representing 46 of the area with grain corn as the main crop followed by winter wheat rainfed barley tends to be the option chosen for unequipped plots this is followed by vegetables comprising 22 of the area mainly peas beans broccoli tomato sweet corn spinach and fava beans vineyards comprising 10 industrial crops comprising 9 fodder comprising 8 olive trees comprising 2 fruit trees comprising 1 grain legumes comprising 1 and nursery crops comprising 1 intia 2018a in terms of crop diversity 55 different crops are planted in the first phase sectors ii 2 iv 1 iv 3 iv 4 v and ix have the greatest crop diversity comprising between 30 and 29 different crops intia 2018a the area of double crops represents 16 of the utilised area sectors iv 5 and ix stand out comprising between 48 and 25 of double crops respectively the main double crops are 17 grass corn 17 peas beans 7 cereal broccoli 6 peas corn 6 cereal beans 6 peas sweet corn and 5 bean grain corn intia 2018a the crop mix for each sector and region are included in the supplementary materials the operating costs for irrigators are composed of a fixed charge per hectare per year and a variable charge depending on water consumption table 1 the average crop data can be found in the supplementary materials 2 2 price simulation model a farmer behaviour simulation model through positive mathematical programming pmp was developed and applied to the first phase of the navarra canal in 2012 2017 the pmp was formally proposed by howitt 1995 and consisted of eliciting a non linear objective function that typically includes a quadratic cost or yield function such that observed activity levels are reproduced by the optimal solution the non linear function relies on information contained in dual values of calibration constraints of a linear programming model where variables are constrained to observed activity levels by stage 1 there are several advantages of the pmp over other mathematical programming models i it perfectly reproduces the level of activities of the reference year without using artificial constraints ii it provides flexible smooth simulation behaviour avoiding questionable overspecialisation and abrupt discontinuities in the simulation solutions iii it can be developed with relatively scarce data and iv it allows calibrating complex economic technical and environmental relationships capturing adjustments in the intensive and extensive margins instead of using a single method we will use two pmp calibration methods to obtain more robust results to keep it simple we will use two methods that do not require exogenous information such as land rent or exogenous elasticities the first method is based on the standard approach of howitt 1995 using quadratic cost functions we will use the average cost approach of heckelei and britz 2000 which ensures that in the reference year the quadratic cost function reproduces the observed average cost of each activity moreover to avoid the marginal crop behaving differently from the rest by having a linear cost the non preferred crop area will not be subject to change this is possible because it will be a rainfed crop of little relevance in the study area the second pmp method is developed by dagnino and ward 2012 which relies on a quadratic yield function whose calibrating parameters are elicited from the first order conditions using only crop information skipping the first calibration stage this method like the approach of heckelei and britz 2000 also ensures that the profit of the activities in the reference year coincides with the average profit since it reproduces the average observed yield by skipping the first calibration step full information on the quadratic yield function parameters is available for every crop the variables of the models are the area devoted to each crop in every sector of the navarra canal x c s the whole irrigated and rainfed area was simulated this area includes all representative irrigated crops double cropping and rainfed crops as already mentioned the main irrigated crops are corn wheat and vineyards while the main rainfed alternative crops in terms of crop area were identified as wheat barley and vineyards intia 2018a new activities were created for each double crop wheat broccoli wheat beans wheat corn etc then the area of the first crop e g wheat was divided into different activities when a second crop succeeded it in the same agronomic year finally the areas devoted to each activity with double crops were estimated by their relative presence in 2017 as area data by sector were available for this year the most common double croppings during 2012 2017 were winter cereal corn bean corn fodder corn pea green bean winter cereal green bean and ray grass corn aguacanal 2012 2017 the most common triple cropping during the same period was spinach pea sweet corn cereal corn bean corn fodder corn pea green bean winter cereal green bean and ray grass corn aguacanal 2012 2017 however triple croppings were not included as they represent a very small part of the land and complete information is unavailable 2 2 1 calibration each sector of the navarra canal was calibrated and simulated independently with the main crops present including double crops in each irrigation sector a typical farmer was considered as one whose crop distribution was the average of his sector for this typical farmer we obtained two utility functions maximising profit one from each pmp method the profit was considered in the short term and measured through the expected gross margin gm which is the result of subtracting all the variable costs associated with the crop from the income by maximising the objective functions the positive models exactly reproduce the crop distribution in the observed year in the case of the standard approach the objective function takes the following form 1 gm s c price c yield c α c s ½ β c s x c s x c s s where gm s is the gross margin in sector s x c s is the area of crop c in sector s price c and yield c are the price and yield of each crop respectively and α c s and β c s are the linear and quadratic calibrating parameters calculated in the first stage for every crop and sector among all the variants available for determining the calibration parameters the average cost approach of heckelei and britz 2000 was followed with the following calibrating parameters 2 α c s avgcost c μ c s 3 β c s 2 μ c s x c s obs where avgcost c is the average cost of every crop and μ c s is the dual value or shadow price of the calibrating constraint of each crop in the first stage the calibrating constraints of the linear model stage 1 consist of equating the area variables x c s plus a negligible term epsilon to the observed level of each activity the objective function of the second method of dagnino and ward 2012 is as follows 4 gm s c price c b 0 c s b 1 c s x c s avgcost c x c s s where b 0 c s and b 1 c s are the linear and quadratic terms of the yield function respectively 5 b 0 c s yield c b 1 c s x c s obs 6 b 1 c s gm c obs price c x c s obs where gm c obs is the average income per unit of land after the calibration of the models a simulation of water price increases by 0 01 eur m3 steps was performed on the current tariffs during the simulation farmers could change the crop pattern but no other actions were allowed such as new investments or the possibility of deficit irrigation new investments in irrigation technology which increase the perennial crop area were not allowed since farmers responses are only considered in the short term for the same reason disinvestment in the form of a reduction in the area of perennial crops was not allowed only in the case of perennial crops with rainfed alternatives were these perennial crops allowed to be shifted to their rainfed options on the other hand including deficit irrigation requires dose response functions for each crop this requires a dose response function for each climatic zone and this information is unavailable these simulations were completed per sector and the results were aggregated for each price increase additionally in the howitt calibration method a constraint was introduced on the marginal crop the one with the lowest gross margin and no dual value in the calibration constraints the constraint prevented the marginal crop from growing excessively in the simulation therefore the area of marginal crops was limited to the observed area this point will be further analysed in the discussion 2 3 clustering of sectors to analyse the north south climatic gradient the ten sectors sectors i x of the first phase of the navarra canal were grouped according to their geographical location as follows northern region i ii 1 ii 2 and iii middle region iv 1 iv 2 iv 4 v vi vii and viii southern region iv 3 iv 5 ix and x 2 4 data sources a summary of the data and their sources is offered in table 2 the annual water cost data based on the water origin surface water for the first phase of the navarra canal area during 2012 2017 in terms of fixed costs eur ha and variable costs eur m3 were obtained from public data from the administration navarre institute of transfer and innovation in agri food sector intia the irrigation field application efficiencies per crop and sector were obtained by crosschecking two different sources 1 the crop area per irrigation system per sector intia 2019 was combined with the field application efficiency s widely used values assuming a sprinkler irrigation efficiency of 85 and a drip irrigation efficiency of 95 intia 2018b 2 water use efficiency was the ratio between the estimated crop water requirements intia 2018b and the actual irrigation applied aguacanal 2012 2017 the crop water requirements based on the reference evapotranspiration values eto crop coefficients effective rainfall and irrigation efficiency allen et al 1998 per crop and sector were obtained from intia 2018b the actual irrigation water applied m3 ha per crop and sector was obtained from aguacanal a company that manages the infrastructure of the navarra canal irrigation area 2012 2017 average crop water requirements were estimated for crops with different planting dates cycles and growing systems broccoli february 1 august 1 august 15

july 1 june 10 pea early late and olive grove standard and grown on trellises the area of irrigated crops per sector was obtained from aguacanal 2012 2017 and the crop area of rainfed and irrigated crops in each sector and agricultural region was obtained from intia 2019 the payments associated with the production of the common agricultural policy 2015 2020 were obtained from mapama 2018 and the prices paid to producers were obtained from the government of navarra 2012 2017a the crop yield per agricultural region and year was obtained from the government of navarra 2012 2017b the yield is attributed according to the agricultural region where the crop is located table a 1 in the appendix when the sectors were in more than one agricultural region the yield data were weighted by the crop area in each sector and region if the crop distribution was not available as in the case of rapeseed rye green beans potatoes grain green fava beans broccoli cauliflower and vetch in some cases an average of both regions was used the yield data of the category tree were weighted according to the different types of tree areas in each sector mainly almond and walnut trees the category pea refers to the green pea grain when irrigated and dry peas when rainfed the category beans refers to green beans the olive grove is used to produce olive oil tomato and pepper were grown for industry the yield data of the category corn were weighted according to the different types of corn areas in each sector including sweet corn corn for grain forage corn and seed corn the yield of the winter cereal category refers to the weighted average yield of common wheat barley and oat if no vineyard type was specified the yield was assumed to be the average of winemaking vineyards d o navarra vineyards and other wines if the potato type was not specified the yield was assumed to be the average of mid and late season potatoes direct costs and labour per crop were obtained from the government of navarra 2012 2017c 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of water prices aggregated results figs 3 and 4 present the aggregated water price simulation results for the first phase of the navarra canal related to the irrigated rainfed crop area amount of water used gross margin and labour using both the dagnino and ward and howitt calibration methods as can be seen the results differ from one calibration method to another using two calibration simulation methodologies has allowed us to obtain more robust results considering the zone of uncertainty between the two resulting curves we cannot claim that one model is methodologically superior to the other as both have pros and cons which are described below in section 3 3 the intermediate zone between the two calibration method results is assumed to be the level of uncertainty derived from the calibration method this intermediate zone is where the actual results are likely to be fig 3 shows the evolution of the area occupied by the main crops in relation to water price increases in general the substitution of irrigated crops can be observed mainly corn for rainfed winter cereals wheat and barley but also for irrigated winter cereals wheat and barley given their low water requirements fig 3 helps to understand the different behaviours of the two calibration methods in terms of the change from irrigated to rainfed crops water use gross margin and labour in dagnino and ward s method the substitution of corn for winter cereals occurs linearly up to a water price of 0 45 eur m3 in the case of howitt this change occurred before up to a price of only 0 30 eur m3 the total substitution of corn for winter crops at 0 45 and 0 30 eur m3 marks the changes in the slope of water use in fig 4b on the other hand the substituted crop also varies depending on the method used in the first case the substitution is towards irrigated wheat and rainfed barley following howitt s method the substitution is more prominent towards rainfed wheat and rainfed barley it can also be seen that the areas of irrigated wheat and barley while initially increasing up to the turning point of 0 30 eur m3 decrease in favour of their rainfed variants fig 4 shows the aggregated irrigated rainfed crop area amount of water used gross margin and labour in relation to water price variations fig 4a shows the change from irrigated to rainfed areas occupied by the main crops due to the effect of water prices as can be seen irrigated crops begin to be replaced by rainfed crops starting at 0 eur m3 the intermediate striped zone between the irrigated and the rainfed area represents the area of uncertainty that one calibration model considers to be irrigated and the other model does not consider to be irrigated fig 4b illustrates the water use simulation when the water price increases that is the water demand curve at each price level this figure shows an elastic phase from 00 to 0 30 0 40 eur depending on the calibrating method in this phase a small water price increase means a strong decrease in water use then there is an inelastic stretch where an increase in the price of water does not translate into a significant decrease in water use this reveals that water pricing encourages water conservation from the first cent increase in the first phase of the navarra canal as water use decreases above a water price of 0 eur m3 water pricing is therefore an effective policy instrument to encourage water saving measures in the region conversely the water demand curves estimated in previous studies based on different mathematical programming methods and regions present a totally inelastic first section berbel and gomez limón 2000 gómez limón et al 2016 gutiérrez martín and gómez gómez 2011 gutiérrez martín et al 2014 momeni et al 2019 montilla lópez et al 2017 speelman et al 2009 this means that in the very first stretch of the curve water price changes do not affect water use these differences in the first stretch of the water demand curve seem to be due to the methodology used and the context of the study a first elastic stretch is common when applying mathematical programming techniques such as in the case study shown in this paper when using pmp approaches changes in water use normally occur from the first increase in water prices nevertheless sometimes when using pmp methodologies an initial inelastic stretch can still appear as shown by montilla lópez et al 2017 this may be due to the high profitability of all crops and agronomic constraints representing crop rotations market or agricultural policy constraints sapino et al 2020 developed a multi model ensemble framework encompassing two pmp models without inelastic stretch and three multi attribute models a weighted goal programming adapted to a cobb douglas function with inelastic stretch and two slightly less inelastic pmaup positive multi attribute utility programming functions sapino et al 2022 present a very interesting pmaup based case with an inelastic section at the beginning of the water demand curve that becomes elastic when there is the possibility to shift to deficit irrigation this means that when there is only the possibility to shift the crop the farmers do not reduce water use as they do not change the crop plan however when introducing water response functions farmers can reduce the irrigation dose without changing the crop grown then the curve loses its inelastic section contradicting some of the previous papers that state that water pricing makes no sense due to the existence of the inelastic section expósito and berbel 2017 berbel and expósito 2020 however in the cases where deficit irrigation is already being applied as in many cases in the guadalquivir river basin in the south of spain this inelastic section could continue to exist montilla lópez et al 2017 furthermore depending on the area s profitability the inelastic stretch can be shorter or longer for instance the stretch is longer in rich horticultural areas where irrigated crops provide a higher return than rainfed alternatives in these areas farmers are willing to pay the water price increase montilla lópez et al 2017 report an inelastic section up to 0 30 eur m3 in the lower guadalquivir at the same time berbel and gomez limón 2000 show an inelastic section up to 0 07 eur m3 in the mid guadalquivir valley and bajo carrión in southern spain obviously a water price increase has economic effects as shown in fig 4c losses of up to 400 eur ha can be observed for water price increases of 0 10 eur m3 wages and agricultural labour are also affected by farmers cropping decisions fig 4d in this case an increase in the price of water does not translate into a significant decrease in labour although labour is not an attribute that is part of the objective function this indicator is also measured in the model 3 2 simulation of water prices results per region fig 5 shows the variation in crop acreage as the price of water increases mainly the replacement of corn with rainfed winter cereals in the three regions of the first phase of the navarra canal this is due to several factors including the water price and other variables such as the climate and market prices for instance corn production has changed in recent years depending on international market prices which fluctuate widely wheat and other cereals have a similar profitability to corn with payment of the fixed charge but the variable part is saved when corn prices fall the northern sectors opt for rainfed crops while the southern sectors opt for vegetables the lower the price of corn the greater the diversification in the south fig 6 presents stacked areas of crops as a function of water prices per region where blue represents irrigated areas and green represents rainfed areas in this figure the northern and middle regions clearly change from irrigated to rainfed crops when water prices increase southern regions show a very wide area of uncertainty in southern regions rainwater is scarcer and more irregular and vegetables and fruit trees especially irrigated crops with the highest economic productivity have a larger presence there are two different agricultural models in the first phase of the navarra canal 1 simplification no irrigation of irrigated agriculture in northern and middle areas to reduce irrigation costs these are very productive cereal areas where the main limiting factors when choosing the crop are climate and soil there are a few alternatives for crop diversification and a limited possibility of double cropping with very good cereal predictions 2 intensification of irrigation in productive southern areas with more options of double and even triple cropping in areas where the climate and soil quality allow it according to monjardino et al 2022 the agronomy including plant genetics and physiology meteorology and soil science had greater influence on financial performance than irrigation infrastructure in the irrigation region of the riverina in the murray darling basin of eastern australia in their case when analysing the trade offs of irrigation simplification intensification diversification to manage economic risk in this region intensified scenarios had the highest net value overall while crop diversification with moderate inputs was superior in mitigating economic risk due to higher returns per litre of irrigated water and more diverse sources of income fig 7 shows whether and how much a water pricing measure can generate water savings with a consequent decrease in the gross margin see fig 8 southern regions begin at a higher level of irrigation water use 4400 m3 ha compared to the middle and northern areas 3200 m3 ha due to the lack of rainfall in those areas southern regions seem to be the most elastic particularly in their first section fig 7 they also show greater uncertainty because the models give a wider range of results northern and middle regions are almost equal in terms of water use they are a bit less elastic and less affected by water price changes this might be because they can use rainwater as well as irrigation water e g rainfed vs irrigated wheat southern sectors are more sensitive to price changes because they depend on and use irrigation water more in northern and middle regions a price of water above 0 3 eur m3 has economic effects fig 8 and a slight social effect on paid labour fig 9 but no environmental consequences similar amount of water used fig 7 in the case of water prices versus gross margin fig 8 the southernmost regions seem to show higher elasticity by maximising utility we are maximising the gross margin overall this causes the curve to have smooth changes this graph is useful for understanding the extent of the economic impact if the price of water is increased fig 8 also shows differences between the northern and middle regions northern areas become negative at about 0 5 eur m3 while middle areas become negative at 0 7 eur m3 southern areas also become negative at 0 5 eur m3 this number even if uncertain seems similar to the northern region the wage of agricultural labour responds differently to the water pricing in different regions fig 9 in northern and middle regions increases in the price of water do not translate into significant decreases in labour in these regions the maximum difference in terms of labour is about 10 15 h per hectare between water prices of 0 and 1 eur m3 the crops of the northern and middle regions do not require much labour in irrigated or rainfed conditions with similar labour in irrigated and rainfed areas on the other hand the south is slightly less inelastic and shows a maximum difference of about 35 40 h per hectare between 0 and 1 eur m3 this is because in southern regions there are more horticultural crops which generate the most labour 3 3 results and limitations related to the methodology the pmp has some shortcomings mainly the underdetermination of calibration parameters and the bias of the first calibration stage the underdetermination is the fact that many sets of calibrating parameters can exactly reproduce the observed level of every activity to overcome this problem many alternatives have been proposed including the average cost approach proposed by heckelei and britz 2000 the use of exogenous supply elasticities helming et al 2001 and the generalised maximum entropy criterion paris and howitt 1998 apart from these alternatives some other problems arise from the first stage as it is not possible to calibrate non observed activities since information on land use for this crop is necessary to calibrate it due to the problems stemming from the first phase of the standard approach skipping it is proposed using exogenous data that provide the shadow prices of land and other resources júdez et al 2001 graveline and mérel 2014 with regard to the methodology there are two main findings related to the rainfed crop simulations which are explained in detail below first the existence of marginal crops in the calibration equations of howitt s standard approach could make the shift to rainfed crops occur faster at lower water prices if no preventive measures are taken second the low presence of rainfed crops hinders their expansion when the cost of water is increased under the dagnino and ward method a known problem with howitt s standard approach is that the marginal least profitable activity has no dual value in the calibration constraints this causes the beta of the cost function for this crop to have no value the entire cost is therefore linear this marginal crop coincides with some rainfed alternatives mainly peas and barley this means there can be a faster substitution of these marginal crops because an increase in their area does not increase their cost for instance if we take sector iv 1 with 2200 ha irrigated all the barley 113 ha is replaced by the marginal crop at the first 0 04 eur m3 corn 817 ha at the first 0 19 eur m3 rapeseed 118 ha at 0 25 eur m3 and wheat sunflower and pea corn 636 ha at approximately 0 30 eur m3 all these crops are replaced by the marginal crop which in this case is rainfed barley to prevent this issue which causes only the area of marginal crops to increase during the simulations the area of marginal crops was limited to the observed area the idea is that in the case of substitution by rainfed crops more profitable crops are preferable the result has been greater diversity in crop substitution and a delay in substitution timing in terms of water prices that is substitution with other crops occurs at higher prices although not as high as in dagnino and ward s method as shown in fig 4 on the other hand in areas where rainfed barley was the marginal crop the area could not expand causing the other predominant winter cereal i e rainfed wheat to grow much faster nevertheless in aggregate rainfed barley increases more with the howitt method than with the dagnino and ward method where substitution is also made with irrigated winter cereals this is undoubtedly the main difference between the two methods in addition to the greater presence of rainfed wheat the substitution of winter cereals in dagnino and ward s method deserves another methodological reflection as can be seen in fig 6 the uncertainty zone in the southern region is much larger than in the other regions this is mainly due to sectors iv 5 and ix of this region in these sectors the initial non irrigated cereal area i e rainfed wheat and barley is small 10 ha in total 0 5 in sector iv 5 and 79 ha 3 4 in sector ix this causes the b1 calibration coefficient to be relatively high for these winter cereals in relation to other irrigated crops this means that if the area of these rainfed cereals is extended their yield decreases rapidly the b1 coefficient reduces the yield and is multiplied by the square of the area consequently there is hardly any substitution for rainfed crops even when prices rise sharply because rainfed crops are not profitable this situation does not make much sense agronomically because we assume that rainfed crops would grow well on the land previously occupied by irrigated crops this problem in dagnino and ward s methodology is reflected in the uncertainty of rainfed and irrigated areas water use fig 7 and gross margin fig 8 in the southern region 4 conclusions the first phase of the navarra canal is a unique case in which along its 50 km expanse there are several territorial features and climatic zones which are key to explaining the different farmers responses to increases in water prices the northernmost regions abandon irrigation because the rainfed irrigation differential does not compensate well enough meanwhile southern regions which are warmer and drier introduce fruit trees and vegetables the findings from this study reveal that when formulating water pricing policies it is key to consider the local and regional circumstances such as the climate soil type crops grown and possible alternative crops and market conditions climate change projections could also be a variable factor to consider in this way incorporating the green water footprint component water from precipitation that is stored in the root zone of the soil and evaporated transpired or incorporated by plants in water pricing modelling might be helpful to identify appropriate policies to set water pricing in the agricultural sector moreover it is important to anticipate water pricing impacts not only on the environment but also on socio economic facets it is important and necessary to incorporate the triple dimension of sustainability

equidistant over the given land area is critical for reducing inter plant competition for nutrients water and light in the land atmosphere environment for growth in the raised bed or ridges in the furrow ridge configuration of planting crops narrowing row widths has been considered a feasible way to achieve more plants per unit area of land thereby increasing crop productivity from available resources bruns et al 2012 however when higher plant densities carry a potential for enhanced crop yields in mechanized agriculture with drive through planters cultivators harvesters and other equipment neither equidistant planting nor planting of the whole land area is feasible bruns et al 2012 kurt et al 2017 liang and yoshihira 2022 in corn cropping systems practiced in the usa planting

as a profitable planting system than narrow rows with inter row spacing below 76 cm row spacing stephenson et al 2011 farmers often find the twin row system more advantageous for their net returns than switching to narrow row systems planting crops in twin rows on the same seedbed was more economical than narrow row cropping because the planter was the only piece of equipment needed to be replaced moreover the same sprayer and corn head can be used for wider rows twin rows like narrow rows have also been touted as providing improved weed control quicker soil shading and increased grain

relative humidity solar radiation wind was monitored at 2 m above the corn canopy in sr and tr plantings in both systems plants emerged from the soil on march 28 2020 the crop in both sr and tr systems reached physiological maturity stage r6 110 days after seedling emergence from the soil dae table 1 the accumulated growing degree days gdd ta 8 ta is average daily air temperatures measured over the sr and tr systems and 8 is the base temperature for corn hatfield and preuger 2005 was 1584 c day during its 110 days of active growth the crop received 361 mm of rainfall in 33 days but erratically distributed in time through the season for that reason farmers irrigated the crops often enough roughly irrigated once if rain was absent for about 10 days to assure water stress free growth fig 1a highest daily rainfall received was 39 2 mm on dae 75 fifty percent of the rain received was 10 mm per day or less and the rest was between 10 mm and 39 2 mm these low intensity rainfall amounts were highly effective for replenishing the soil water removed by the plant roots to meet et demands continuously at the beginning of the growing season up to about 26 dae air temperatures ta over the corn canopies in both sr and tr plantings were roughly the same fig 2a after about 26 dae ta measured above the canopy generally were slightly higher over the sr planted to corn than the tr planted the higher recorded ta over the sr planting can be attributed to a higher area of soil soil has much lower heat capacity compared to plant leaves as reflected in lower lai measured under this treatment exposed for absorption of direct solar radiation and heating the air canopy environment fig 3 the tr planting effectively distributed plants more evenly over the soil so that the growing plant canopy successively expanded over more area over the soil as reflected in the higher measured lai ta measured over both tr and sr plant canopies varied between about 16 c at the beginning of the season to about 28 c towards the end of the season fig 2 ta in the canopy environment affects corn plant growth and grain yield substantially hatfield and preuger 2015 the lower critical temperature below and an upper temperature above which the corn growth ceases completely were reported as 8 and 38 c respectively kiniry and bonhomme 1991 hatfield and preuger 2015 the crops in the experiments were not subjected to temperatures below or above the upper air temperature threshold measured ta varied between 16 and 28 c which might have affected their yield potential substantially better even spatial distribution of plants in the tr planting helped the crop grow and establish more lai in the available space earlier in the tr system than plants in the sr system fig 3 more lai led to more transpiration water flux et from the tr system which enhanced the air relative humidity reduced vapor pressure deficit in the air above the tr system more than over the sr system figs 1b 2b the average daily relative humidity recorded over the tr system varied between 48 and 95 but over the sr plant canopy it ranged between 44 and 87 fig 2b in response to the higher amount of water vapor as reflected in relative humidity present in the air the air above the tr planted corn was characterized with less vpd compared to the air above sr plantings fig 1b a negative correlation between vpd and et water fluxes as observed in this study discussed in sections below from landscapes was illustrated by dalton 1802 over two centuries ago daily average vpd over the tr plantings ranged between 75 and 1270 pa when it ranged between 508 and 1608 pa in the sr system a larger vpd over the sr system with higher ta can produce larger water deficit stress for corn plants as also reported by grossiord et al 2020 3 2 corn phenology lai and yield the lai measured between dae 57 and physiological maturity r6 stage ranged between 3 5 and 4 6 cm2 cm 2 under sr plantings and between 4 0 and 6 0 cm2 cm 2 in tr plantings fig 3 the leaf area available for harvesting light energy from the sun is a vital plant attribute that determines plant biomass growth and yield alimuddin et al 2019 the higher lai observed under the tr planting was due to the enhanced leaf growth in the system with less competition from neighboring plants for light water and other nutrients for growth and more open space for expansion growth duncan 1984 barbieri et al 2000 2008 pettigrew 2015 found early season leaf growth advantage in twin row planted corn in the mississippi delta region of the usa but this growth advantage diminished with time and coincided with the sr pattern by about mid season but no cotton yield advantages were reported however robles et al 2012 bruns et al 2012 and modolo et al 2015 reported an increase in lai and grain yield with twin row plantings in corn ta has been widely accepted as the critical environmental variable determining occurrences of different plant phenological growth stages progressively with time bewick et al 1988 occurrences of visual phenological growth stages of corn occurred on the same dae across tr and sr table 1 due to the slight difference in the ta measured above the corn canopy the gdd computed for the different phenological stages differed slightly in the two plantings however the differences were not large enough to be reflected in the calendar days required for reaching different growth stages table 1 corn emerged on the eighth day after planting with a gdd of 63 c day in the sr planting and 65 c day in the tr planting plants reached physiological maturity on 110 dap in both sr and tr harvested corn yield reported at 13 5 moisture level from the tr planting was higher by 19 than that harvested from sr planting 13 244 and 11 110 kg ha 1 table 2 3 3 evapotranspiration the exact balance between the energy inputs net solar radiation and the energy outputs soil heat flux latent heat flux sensible heat flux and other heat storage in the soil air canopy from the cropping system was considered a reliable measure of accuracy in the measured fluxes using the eddy covariance method liu et al 2017 leuning et al 2012 monitored inputs of solar radiation on the sr and tr planted corn canopy nearly coincided indicating that both the systems received identical amounts of light and radiation energy for growth fig 4a however the sensible heat fluxes h from the sr planted corn was consistently higher than h measured over the tr grew corn canopy fig 4b during the crop season the daily maximum measured h under sr and tr were 4211 and 3818 w m 2 and the minimum measured were 1811 and 1799 w m 2 respectively these detected differences can be attributed to the more soil soil minerals have lower heat capacity so higher temperature achieved from the heating of solar radiation exposed under the sr planted corn plants have higher heat capacity so lower temperature achieved from the heating of the same amount of solar radiation with much lower lai than tr planted corn fig 3 the slope of the linear regression between the energy inputs and energy outputs from the soil air corn canopy system expressed as a percentage was generally accepted as a measure of this energy balance closure ebc mauder and foken 2006 anapalli et al 2018 as reported in the literature in measurements under various crop soil systems this closure varied between 70 and 97 moorhead et al 2019 anapalli et al 2022 in this study after applying de roo et al 2018 technique for correcting imbalances between input and output energies from the system we obtained 97 slope of linear regression 0 97 ebc in measurements conducted under sr and 95 slope of linear regression 0 95 under tr planted corn fig 5a b the levels of ebc obtained in our measurements show that the eddy covariance data collected are accurate enough for comparing co2 and et water fluxes from corn under the sr and tr planting systems owing to the higher lai growth as discussed above the daily and seasonal et in the tr system was substantially higher than those measured under the sr system table 2 figs 3 6a under tr planted corn the monthly average daily et across april may june and july were between 4 5 mm in april to 6 7 mm in july and its seasonal average april july was 5 8 mm table 2 fig 7a d under the sr planting the average daily et varied from 3 1 mm in april to 6 7 mm in july the lower et measured in the sr system was due to less transpiration loss of water from the lower leaf area the corn plants attained under this treatment for transpiring water which means less net number of stomata available in leaf epidermal cells for transpiring water through those the maximum difference in et between the two planting systems occurred during the vegetative stages of the crop that is in april and may table 1 figs 6a 7a d the seasonal average daily et from the sr planting was 4 8 mm which was 21 less than the seasonal daily average et under tr 5 8 mm seasonal total et under the sr 426 mm was 22 less than et under the tr 518 mm table 2 fig 6a monthly average hourly values of et showed larger differences in their diurnal ranges during april through june which diminished with time in july fig 7 the lowest values of hourly et were in july which coincided with the r5 dent stage and physiological maturity r6 stages of the crop when the crop was actively senescing fig 7d table 1 et measured under tr was constantly above those measured under sr starting from crop emergence until physiological maturity fig 7a d 3 4 nee reco gpp and wuenee wuegy nee quantifies the amount of co2 absorbed from the air and fixed in biomass after accounting for maintenance and growth respiration requirements for crop growth in eddy covariance measurements this quantity by convention is shown as ve as the gas co2 is removed from the air fig 7 however nee is real and positive so we are representing this term as a positive entity in this paper in general the nee of co2 the amount of co2 removed from the atmosphere and sequestered in plant biomass was much higher in the tr planting than in the sr figs 6b 8 table 2 the higher nee observed in the tr was mainly due to higher leaf area as reflected in the measured lai which helped the crops to harvest a higher amount of solar light energy over a given land area and fix more co2 in the photosynthesis process suyker et al 2004 examined relationships between seasonal variations in gpp reco and nee with various environmental factors they reported that the green lai of the corn plants explained about 95 of the variability in seasonal gpp and nee in april the crop was in its seedling stage and getting established for active growth as such the measured nee in this month was the lowest during the season with the least diurnal amplitude in the amount of co2 fixed fig 8a in this month corn seedlings were in the initial stages of leaf expansion growth as such less leaf area was available for harvesting light energy for co2 assimilation in the photosynthesis process the maximum daily amplitude of nee in april may june and july were 0 26 1 24 1 27 and 0 24 mg co2 ha 1 respectively in tr plantings and 0 07 0 41 1 08 and 0 19 mg co2 ha 1 in sr planting fig 8a d in july the plants were between r5 and r6 stages as such fast senescing with very little co2 assimilations the total seasonal nee in the tr system 37 39 mg co2 ha 1 was 90 higher than those measured in the sr system 19 71 mg co2 ha 1 table 2 anapalli et al 2018 reported 31 33 mg co2 ha 1 of nee from a tr planted corn ecosystem in 2017 in the same climate but a clay soil higher lai attained in the tr system than in the sr system possibly helped the plants to maintain a higher amount of carbon assimilation through photosynthesis throughout the crop growth period to achieve higher nee daily averaged across the season nee in the tr planting 0 39 mg co2 ha 1 was 81 higher than that measured in sr planting 0 22 mg co2 ha 1 table 2 in the tr planting monthly averaged values of nee varied between 0 07 mg co2 ha 1 in april and 0 72 mg co2 ha 1 in may with an average of 0 39 mg co2 ha 1 across the four months of the crop season table 2 in the sr planting the lowest nee was 0 02 mg co2 ha 1 in april and the highest was 0 55 mg co2 ha 1 in june to our knowledge no reported study previously compared nee between sr and tr planting notwithstanding in the past the nee between crop fields and the atmosphere was used to quantify the carbon sequestration potentials of various cropping systems and best management practices baldocchi et al 2001 baker et al 2007 in the literature estimates of gpp and nee were used to quantify cropping systems carbon sequestration potentials in response to conservation management systems falge et al 2002 the gpp estimates in the tr and sr plantings were 61 62 and 43 85 mg co2 ha 1 respectively and reco were 24 23 and 24 14 mg co2 ha 1 table 2 fig 9a b the amount of co2 used in reco was about 39 and 55 of gpp in tr and sr plantings respectively the higher vpd ta and lower relative humidity observed over the tr favored more relative respiration higher percentage use of the gpp co2 fixed in the photosynthesis process figs 1b 2a b enhancements in plant respiration loss of gpp with air temperatures have been well established in the literature hatfield and dold 2019 a doubling of respiration with every 10 c rise in air temperatures is generally accepted in plant tissues gifford 1995 lomander et al 1998 wuene computed as seasonal nee to et ratio was 40 higher under tr planting than under sr planting wuene in tr and sr planted corn were 0 07 and 0 05 mg co2 ha 1 mm 1 respectively however wuegy computed as grain yield to et ratio in both tr and sr plantings were about 0 026 mg ha 1 mm 1 in summary tr planting enhanced grain yield by 19 compared to sr planting spending 22 more water in terms of et wuegy across tr and sr planting

equidistant over the given land area is critical for reducing inter plant competition for nutrients water and light in the land atmosphere environment for growth in the raised bed or ridges in the furrow ridge configuration of planting crops narrowing row widths has been considered a feasible way to achieve more plants per unit area of land thereby increasing crop productivity from available resources bruns et al 2012 however when higher plant densities carry a potential for enhanced crop yields in mechanized agriculture with drive through planters cultivators harvesters and other equipment neither equidistant planting nor planting of the whole land area is feasible bruns et al 2012 kurt et al 2017 liang and yoshihira 2022 in corn cropping systems practiced in the usa planting

as a profitable planting system than narrow rows with inter row spacing below 76 cm row spacing stephenson et al 2011 farmers often find the twin row system more advantageous for their net returns than switching to narrow row systems planting crops in twin rows on the same seedbed was more economical than narrow row cropping because the planter was the only piece of equipment needed to be replaced moreover the same sprayer and corn head can be used for wider rows twin rows like narrow rows have also been touted as providing improved weed control quicker soil shading and increased grain

relative humidity solar radiation wind was monitored at 2 m above the corn canopy in sr and tr plantings in both systems plants emerged from the soil on march 28 2020 the crop in both sr and tr systems reached physiological maturity stage r6 110 days after seedling emergence from the soil dae table 1 the accumulated growing degree days gdd ta 8 ta is average daily air temperatures measured over the sr and tr systems and 8 is the base temperature for corn hatfield and preuger 2005 was 1584 c day during its 110 days of active growth the crop received 361 mm of rainfall in 33 days but erratically distributed in time through the season for that reason farmers irrigated the crops often enough roughly irrigated once if rain was absent for about 10 days to assure water stress free growth fig 1a highest daily rainfall received was 39 2 mm on dae 75 fifty percent of the rain received was 10 mm per day or less and the rest was between 10 mm and 39 2 mm these low intensity rainfall amounts were highly effective for replenishing the soil water removed by the plant roots to meet et demands continuously at the beginning of the growing season up to about 26 dae air temperatures ta over the corn canopies in both sr and tr plantings were roughly the same fig 2a after about 26 dae ta measured above the canopy generally were slightly higher over the sr planted to corn than the tr planted the higher recorded ta over the sr planting can be attributed to a higher area of soil soil has much lower heat capacity compared to plant leaves as reflected in lower lai measured under this treatment exposed for absorption of direct solar radiation and heating the air canopy environment fig 3 the tr planting effectively distributed plants more evenly over the soil so that the growing plant canopy successively expanded over more area over the soil as reflected in the higher measured lai ta measured over both tr and sr plant canopies varied between about 16 c at the beginning of the season to about 28 c towards the end of the season fig 2 ta in the canopy environment affects corn plant growth and grain yield substantially hatfield and preuger 2015 the lower critical temperature below and an upper temperature above which the corn growth ceases completely were reported as 8 and 38 c respectively kiniry and bonhomme 1991 hatfield and preuger 2015 the crops in the experiments were not subjected to temperatures below or above the upper air temperature threshold measured ta varied between 16 and 28 c which might have affected their yield potential substantially better even spatial distribution of plants in the tr planting helped the crop grow and establish more lai in the available space earlier in the tr system than plants in the sr system fig 3 more lai led to more transpiration water flux et from the tr system which enhanced the air relative humidity reduced vapor pressure deficit in the air above the tr system more than over the sr system figs 1b 2b the average daily relative humidity recorded over the tr system varied between 48 and 95 but over the sr plant canopy it ranged between 44 and 87 fig 2b in response to the higher amount of water vapor as reflected in relative humidity present in the air the air above the tr planted corn was characterized with less vpd compared to the air above sr plantings fig 1b a negative correlation between vpd and et water fluxes as observed in this study discussed in sections below from landscapes was illustrated by dalton 1802 over two centuries ago daily average vpd over the tr plantings ranged between 75 and 1270 pa when it ranged between 508 and 1608 pa in the sr system a larger vpd over the sr system with higher ta can produce larger water deficit stress for corn plants as also reported by grossiord et al 2020 3 2 corn phenology lai and yield the lai measured between dae 57 and physiological maturity r6 stage ranged between 3 5 and 4 6 cm2 cm 2 under sr plantings and between 4 0 and 6 0 cm2 cm 2 in tr plantings fig 3 the leaf area available for harvesting light energy from the sun is a vital plant attribute that determines plant biomass growth and yield alimuddin et al 2019 the higher lai observed under the tr planting was due to the enhanced leaf growth in the system with less competition from neighboring plants for light water and other nutrients for growth and more open space for expansion growth duncan 1984 barbieri et al 2000 2008 pettigrew 2015 found early season leaf growth advantage in twin row planted corn in the mississippi delta region of the usa but this growth advantage diminished with time and coincided with the sr pattern by about mid season but no cotton yield advantages were reported however robles et al 2012 bruns et al 2012 and modolo et al 2015 reported an increase in lai and grain yield with twin row plantings in corn ta has been widely accepted as the critical environmental variable determining occurrences of different plant phenological growth stages progressively with time bewick et al 1988 occurrences of visual phenological growth stages of corn occurred on the same dae across tr and sr table 1 due to the slight difference in the ta measured above the corn canopy the gdd computed for the different phenological stages differed slightly in the two plantings however the differences were not large enough to be reflected in the calendar days required for reaching different growth stages table 1 corn emerged on the eighth day after planting with a gdd of 63 c day in the sr planting and 65 c day in the tr planting plants reached physiological maturity on 110 dap in both sr and tr harvested corn yield reported at 13 5 moisture level from the tr planting was higher by 19 than that harvested from sr planting 13 244 and 11 110 kg ha 1 table 2 3 3 evapotranspiration the exact balance between the energy inputs net solar radiation and the energy outputs soil heat flux latent heat flux sensible heat flux and other heat storage in the soil air canopy from the cropping system was considered a reliable measure of accuracy in the measured fluxes using the eddy covariance method liu et al 2017 leuning et al 2012 monitored inputs of solar radiation on the sr and tr planted corn canopy nearly coincided indicating that both the systems received identical amounts of light and radiation energy for growth fig 4a however the sensible heat fluxes h from the sr planted corn was consistently higher than h measured over the tr grew corn canopy fig 4b during the crop season the daily maximum measured h under sr and tr were 4211 and 3818 w m 2 and the minimum measured were 1811 and 1799 w m 2 respectively these detected differences can be attributed to the more soil soil minerals have lower heat capacity so higher temperature achieved from the heating of solar radiation exposed under the sr planted corn plants have higher heat capacity so lower temperature achieved from the heating of the same amount of solar radiation with much lower lai than tr planted corn fig 3 the slope of the linear regression between the energy inputs and energy outputs from the soil air corn canopy system expressed as a percentage was generally accepted as a measure of this energy balance closure ebc mauder and foken 2006 anapalli et al 2018 as reported in the literature in measurements under various crop soil systems this closure varied between 70 and 97 moorhead et al 2019 anapalli et al 2022 in this study after applying de roo et al 2018 technique for correcting imbalances between input and output energies from the system we obtained 97 slope of linear regression 0 97 ebc in measurements conducted under sr and 95 slope of linear regression 0 95 under tr planted corn fig 5a b the levels of ebc obtained in our measurements show that the eddy covariance data collected are accurate enough for comparing co2 and et water fluxes from corn under the sr and tr planting systems owing to the higher lai growth as discussed above the daily and seasonal et in the tr system was substantially higher than those measured under the sr system table 2 figs 3 6a under tr planted corn the monthly average daily et across april may june and july were between 4 5 mm in april to 6 7 mm in july and its seasonal average april july was 5 8 mm table 2 fig 7a d under the sr planting the average daily et varied from 3 1 mm in april to 6 7 mm in july the lower et measured in the sr system was due to less transpiration loss of water from the lower leaf area the corn plants attained under this treatment for transpiring water which means less net number of stomata available in leaf epidermal cells for transpiring water through those the maximum difference in et between the two planting systems occurred during the vegetative stages of the crop that is in april and may table 1 figs 6a 7a d the seasonal average daily et from the sr planting was 4 8 mm which was 21 less than the seasonal daily average et under tr 5 8 mm seasonal total et under the sr 426 mm was 22 less than et under the tr 518 mm table 2 fig 6a monthly average hourly values of et showed larger differences in their diurnal ranges during april through june which diminished with time in july fig 7 the lowest values of hourly et were in july which coincided with the r5 dent stage and physiological maturity r6 stages of the crop when the crop was actively senescing fig 7d table 1 et measured under tr was constantly above those measured under sr starting from crop emergence until physiological maturity fig 7a d 3 4 nee reco gpp and wuenee wuegy nee quantifies the amount of co2 absorbed from the air and fixed in biomass after accounting for maintenance and growth respiration requirements for crop growth in eddy covariance measurements this quantity by convention is shown as ve as the gas co2 is removed from the air fig 7 however nee is real and positive so we are representing this term as a positive entity in this paper in general the nee of co2 the amount of co2 removed from the atmosphere and sequestered in plant biomass was much higher in the tr planting than in the sr figs 6b 8 table 2 the higher nee observed in the tr was mainly due to higher leaf area as reflected in the measured lai which helped the crops to harvest a higher amount of solar light energy over a given land area and fix more co2 in the photosynthesis process suyker et al 2004 examined relationships between seasonal variations in gpp reco and nee with various environmental factors they reported that the green lai of the corn plants explained about 95 of the variability in seasonal gpp and nee in april the crop was in its seedling stage and getting established for active growth as such the measured nee in this month was the lowest during the season with the least diurnal amplitude in the amount of co2 fixed fig 8a in this month corn seedlings were in the initial stages of leaf expansion growth as such less leaf area was available for harvesting light energy for co2 assimilation in the photosynthesis process the maximum daily amplitude of nee in april may june and july were 0 26 1 24 1 27 and 0 24 mg co2 ha 1 respectively in tr plantings and 0 07 0 41 1 08 and 0 19 mg co2 ha 1 in sr planting fig 8a d in july the plants were between r5 and r6 stages as such fast senescing with very little co2 assimilations the total seasonal nee in the tr system 37 39 mg co2 ha 1 was 90 higher than those measured in the sr system 19 71 mg co2 ha 1 table 2 anapalli et al 2018 reported 31 33 mg co2 ha 1 of nee from a tr planted corn ecosystem in 2017 in the same climate but a clay soil higher lai attained in the tr system than in the sr system possibly helped the plants to maintain a higher amount of carbon assimilation through photosynthesis throughout the crop growth period to achieve higher nee daily averaged across the season nee in the tr planting 0 39 mg co2 ha 1 was 81 higher than that measured in sr planting 0 22 mg co2 ha 1 table 2 in the tr planting monthly averaged values of nee varied between 0 07 mg co2 ha 1 in april and 0 72 mg co2 ha 1 in may with an average of 0 39 mg co2 ha 1 across the four months of the crop season table 2 in the sr planting the lowest nee was 0 02 mg co2 ha 1 in april and the highest was 0 55 mg co2 ha 1 in june to our knowledge no reported study previously compared nee between sr and tr planting notwithstanding in the past the nee between crop fields and the atmosphere was used to quantify the carbon sequestration potentials of various cropping systems and best management practices baldocchi et al 2001 baker et al 2007 in the literature estimates of gpp and nee were used to quantify cropping systems carbon sequestration potentials in response to conservation management systems falge et al 2002 the gpp estimates in the tr and sr plantings were 61 62 and 43 85 mg co2 ha 1 respectively and reco were 24 23 and 24 14 mg co2 ha 1 table 2 fig 9a b the amount of co2 used in reco was about 39 and 55 of gpp in tr and sr plantings respectively the higher vpd ta and lower relative humidity observed over the tr favored more relative respiration higher percentage use of the gpp co2 fixed in the photosynthesis process figs 1b 2a b enhancements in plant respiration loss of gpp with air temperatures have been well established in the literature hatfield and dold 2019 a doubling of respiration with every 10 c rise in air temperatures is generally accepted in plant tissues gifford 1995 lomander et al 1998 wuene computed as seasonal nee to et ratio was 40 higher under tr planting than under sr planting wuene in tr and sr planted corn were 0 07 and 0 05 mg co2 ha 1 mm 1 respectively however wuegy computed as grain yield to et ratio in both tr and sr plantings were about 0 026 mg ha 1 mm 1 in summary tr planting enhanced grain yield by 19 compared to sr planting spending 22 more water in terms of et wuegy across tr and sr planting remained constant when there was a substantial increase in grain yield et nee and wuene in the tr panted corn production system compared to the sr system 4 conclusions the co2 and water dynamics and wue advantages of switching from conventional sr to tr planting patterns were investigated by monitoring the et neene gpp reco and grain yield in corn grown on farm scale fields using the eddy

by about 19 however with an additional et expenditure of about 22 when the tr system enhanced wuene by about 40 wue in grain production did not change the enhanced nee of co2 in the tr system renders

developed cmdi 1 integrated meteorological and hydrological drought information using the spi sri and wsdi 2 captured overall drought development more completely and frequently than traditional drought indices and 3 monitored an increasing trend of drought in the qinghai tibet plateau and north china plain in addition to a more substantial drought in northern china than in southern china

drought monitoring terrestrial water storage multivariate river basin timescales data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction meteorological changes such as precipitation evaporation monsoons and increasing human activity exacerbate the problem of uneven water distribution in regional or global domains this phenomenon has led to a severe imbalance between water supply and demand in some areas resulting in frequent droughts leblanc et al 2012 wilhite 2000 compared to other meteorological disasters drought events are often difficult to detect large in area and long in duration droughts are closely linked to several fields such as socio economic ecosystem agriculture and livestock and often lead to considerable economic losses meza et al 2020 china is a vast country with a complex landscape that often suffers from severe and extended droughts liu et al 2020 stone 2010 wu et al 2011 therefore comprehensive drought monitoring and assessment are essential for drought mitigation efforts in china drought is a chronic water shortage caused by an imbalance between the water supply and demand this unstable condition is closely related to precipitation runoff and terrestrial water storage precipitation is an essential activator of the onset and end of the drought less precipitation than normal is often a direct cause of drought events and the amount of precipitation can effectively mitigate drought levels runoff plays regulatory and hysteretic roles in a basin s water resources terrestrial water storage anomalies provide information on deepwater storage for drought recovery they interact with each other and influence the occurrence and development of droughts drought indices are tools for monitoring quantifying and providing early warning of the impact of water scarcity it quantifies one or more variables of interest as a unitless value to assess drought with the passage of time and the advancement of technology various drought indices have been developed in different fields and disciplines ding et al 2021 to monitor and assess drought conditions more accurately comprehensive drought indices that incorporate information from multiple sources are becoming increasingly popular niemeyer 2008 proposed that constructing a composite drought index based on various single drought indices could maximize the combination of information from different aspects and provide a more comprehensive picture of drought the hydrological cycle must be considered to understand the occurrence and development of drought events terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa reflect changes in surface water storage and are useful for monitoring long term regional wet and dry conditions however the effects of human factors weaken the direct link between twsa and precipitation and runoff the joint distribution was calculated using the copula of the standardized precipitation index spi standardized runoff index sri and developed water storage deficit index wsdi to integrate information on precipitation runoff and terrestrial water storage the principle and calculation formula of the three indices is elaborated by guttman 1999 shukla and wood 2008a and sinha et al 2017 the copula preserves the marginal distribution of index variables while describing the complex dependencies between them there are three reasons for choosing this option 1 both were univariate drought indices the spi is a cumulative probability function derived by fitting precipitation to a distribution and transforming it into a standard normal distribution guttman 1999 the sri proposed by shukla and wood 2008a is similar to the spi principle except that runoff was used to replace the precipitation data the wsdi reflects the difference between the monthly water storage change and the average long term water storage change for the corresponding month sinha et al 2017 2 they are familiar with drought indices in their respective fields and are widely used and proven deng et al 2021 hayes et al 2011 shukla and wood 2008b 3 spi and sri have been successfully combined with other variables hao and aghakouchak 2013 combined the joint probabilities of the spi and standardized soil moisture index to describe drought conditions in several regions of the usa shah and mishra 2020 developed a joint spi sri standardized groundwater index and other indices to incorporate more hydrometeorological information terrestrial water storage captures anomalies are caused by groundwater and human activity however few studies have been conducted on the wsdi based composite indices sinha et al 2019 proposed a combined climate deviation index ccdi that combines precipitation and the twsa to assess drought in indian watersheds satish kumar et al 2021 analyzed the correlation of multiple drought indices in four basins in india they found a high correlation between the ccdi and the drought severity index suggesting that a combination of the twsa and hydrological variables could lead to a better understanding of drought in this study three commonly used univariate drought indices were selected based on terrestrial water storage precipitation and runoff data and a composite multivariate drought index cmdi was constructed this study aims to 1 fuse multiple timescales of spi and sri 2 combine the marginal distribution characteristics of multiple univariate indices of spi sri and wsdi and 3 analyze the drought trends and characteristics of china over the past 18 years based on the cmdi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 study area the study area included mainland china 73 41 135 02 e 18 10 53 33 n excluding the south china sea in china land in the western region is at a high altitude whereas the eastern region is at a low altitude with a roughly stepped distribution china has various terrains including plateaus mountains hills and plains this topographic pattern is conducive to warm and humid air currents from the pacific ocean penetrating deep into the interior and intersecting with cold air from the pacific ocean to generate precipitation under this topography and a monsoon climate rainfall s spatial and temporal distribution shows a distribution pattern of high in the east low in the west high in summer and low in winter the spatial distribution of soil moisture and precipitation is the same with the southeast being wet and the northwest being dry due to the complex topography large population density and uneven spatial and temporal distribution of water resources the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources in china is prominent characterized by alternating droughts floods and seasonal changes the basin is a standard spatial scale for water resource analysis and drought and flood assessment basin zoning is consistent with the results of the first level water resource regionalization in china released by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china http www mwr gov cn fig 1 shows the distribution of the 10 major river basins in china including northwest basin nwb southwest basin swb yellow river

measurements of the earth s gravity field grace gravity satellites can effectively reflect gravity changes caused by surface water groundwater and anthropogenic factors and monitor global or regional anomalies in terrestrial water storage in june 2017 the grace gravity satellite stopped operating a year later grace follow on grace fo was successfully launched and the scientific observation mission of grace continued mascon solutions a new generation of grace grace fo observational data products have been developed in recent years by several institutions such as the center for space research csr jet propulsion laboratory jpl and goddard space flight center gsfc the mascon product can overcome the leakage error of spherical harmonic coefficients owing to filtering and improved estimates of the mass variation in each circle of the earth the rl06 mascon solutions have improved post processing methods such as filtering and scaling and reduce banding errors and noise by reducing the signal attenuation luthcke et al 2013 save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 they provided monthly twsa data in the form of equivalent water heights mm however different gravity field solutions increase the uncertainty of the data some researchers have proposed that the simple arithmetic means of the three products can effectively reduce the uncertainty in the data bai et al 2019 chen et al 2020 sakumura et al 2014 therefore the mean values of the three mascon products were used in the present study the grid resolution of the mascon solutions of jpl and gsfc was 0 5 0 5 although the raw resolution of the grace grace fo data was approximately 300 km the csr mascon products offer a grid resolution of 0 25 0 25 the csr mascon solution was resampled to a consistent resolution of 0 5 0 5 using twsa the distance level periods of the three mascon solutions were from january 2004 to december 2009 chen et al 2005 therefore we calculated the simple arithmetic mean of the three products directly due to its efficient universal and widespread use in handling missing data cubic spline interpolation was used to fill in the missing data for 31 months from 2003 to 2020 in summary after a series of preprocessing steps such as format conversion resampling cropping interpolation and averaging we obtained a twsa dataset of 216 months to constrain the error caused by uncertainty in precipitation data katiraie boroujerdy et al 2016 we used precipitation estimates that are averaged out from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and global land data assimilation system gldas the gpcc monthly precipitation dataset is a reanalysis product based on global land precipitation data from approximately 86 000 rain gauge stations worldwide schneider et al 2014 the far greater number of stations than that in similar datasets provides a complete time series and good quality for water resources assessment studies the present study used the latest version of the gpcc monthly product released in 2022 with a resolution of 0 5 and time coverage from 2003 to 2020 http gpcc dwd de the gldas data are reanalysis data obtained by nasa using data assimilation and land surface modeling techniques the gldas monthly data of the noah model provide land surface assimilation data such as soil moisture runoff evapotranspiration and temperature we selected runoff and precipitation data with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 provided by the gldas noah v2 1 the hydrological data extracted from the gldas were resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and the temporal resolution of the hydrological data was 1 month 2 2 development of cmdi 2 2 1 drought indices and timescales here the copula was used to construct the cmdi with joint spi sri and wsdi univariate indices however spi and sri are known to have a range of timescales the spi at different timescales varies significantly in drought monitoring and there is currently no representative window zargar et al 2011 the spi on short medium and long timescales can describe drought in meteorology agriculture and hydrology respectively adnan and ullah 2020 zargar et al 2011 therefore we propose the use of marginal distributions of the spi on various timescales to form their joint distribution for the overall judgment of drought theoretically any spi scale can be calculated jointly however this is computationally intensive therefore four timescales monthly quarterly semi annually and annually were selected to construct the joint distribution of the spi to balance more information and more efficient calculations sri is similar to the calculation principle of spi and also has a series of timescales therefore the calculation is also borrowed from spi the spi and sri for each of the four timescales were 1 month spi01 and sri01 3 months spi03 and sri03 6 months spi06 and sri06 and 12 months spi2 and sri12 the process for fusing the spi and sri multiple timescales can be found in section 3 1 3 2 2 2 copula functions for joint distribution analysis sklar 1959 defined copula as a link function that connects the cumulative distributions of multiple random variables to determine the joint distribution characteristics among the variables assuming that h is a joint cumulative distribution function cdf the marginal cdfs of random variables x and y are denoted by f x and g y respectively thus a copula function c exists which satisfies the following equation 1 c f x g y h x y the advantage of the copula function is that it can establish multivariate joint distributions regardless of the original marginal distribution in other words the copula function can connect the variables of any marginal distribution to form a joint distribution without information distortion multiple excellent copula families are used in drought monitoring such as elliptical and archimedean copulas as typical elliptical copulas both t copulas and gaussian copulas support multivariate joint distributions ma et al 2013 compared to the gaussian copula the t copula has a similar performance but is highly time consuming van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 song et al 2010 compared the goodness of fit gof of the copula family using multiple indicators they indicated that the gaussian copula was more suitable for fitting the joint probability distribution of the multivariate drought index kao and govindaraju 2010 developed a joint distribution of spi and wsdi using a gaussian copula and noted that it has a significant advantage in constructing a comprehensive drought index frank clayton and gumbel are typical archimedean copulas that are widely used in modeling joint probability distributions because of their properties such as ease of construction therefore we choose four copula functions to construct the joint distribution the clayton frank gumbel and gaussian copula table 1 presents the formulas for the four copula types liu et al 2019 2 2 3 development of cmdi and drought levels the detailed methodology of this study is illustrated in fig 2 because the present study needs to consider the timescales of spi and sri a cmdi was constructed using the nested form in this case copula model construction was performed for the four timescales of the spi to obtain the multi timescale spi mspi then the multi timescale sri msri was obtained by constructing the joint distribution of sri01 sri03 sri06 and sri12 using the copula finally the derived results were combined with the wsdi to complete the final layer of copula modeling and produce the cmdi the mspi was obtained using the copula model with input variable u spi01 spi03 spi06 spi12 the msri was obtained using the copula model with the input variable u sri01 sri03 sri06 sri12 the cmdi was obtained using the copula model with the input variable u mspi msri wsdi a detailed description of the copula model construction process is as follows step 1 the n dimensional input variables x 1 x n were fitted to obtain the marginal distribution u 1 u n the parameters of the distribution function were estimated using the maximum likelihood method step 2 the joint distribution of marginal cdfs was fitted using the frank clayton gumbel and gaussian copulas according to eq 1 if the joint distribution of n dimensional input variables is h x 1 x n there exists a copula such that the following equation holds 2 c u 1 u n h x 1 x n step 3 the gof of different copulas is assessed by conducting a comparison with the empirical copula based on three criteria root mean square error rmse akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic jordanger and tjostheim 2014 moazami et al 2014 schwarz 1978 step 4 the joint probability of marginal variables p can be considered a criterion for measuring drought p is the probability that multiple edge variables satisfy their respective conditions denoted as the joint distribution p x 1 x 1 x n x n according to eq 2 the joint distribution p of n dimensional variables can be expressed in terms of the cumulative joint probability p and the optimal function c op as follows 3 p x 1 x 1 x n x n c op u 1 u n p step 5 for joint or cross comparison with different drought indices p was transformed into a composite indicator using the inverse function of the standard normal distribution function let φ be the standard normal distribution function the formula for calculating the mspi msri and cmdi is given by eq 4 4 mspi msri cmdi φ 1 p as a dimensionless index the cmdi follows a normal distribution therefore when quantifying the degree of drought the method of svoboda et al 2002 was used which set the 30th 20th 10th 5th and 2nd percentiles of the standard normal distribution as the drought threshold drought intensity increased with decreasing percentiles drought can be classified into five levels no drought mild moderate severe and extreme according to the z quantile and standardized normal distribution table the threshold scores corresponding to the five drought grades of the cmdi were d0 0 5 to 0 8 d1 0 8 to 1 2 d2 1 2 to 1 6 d3 1 6 to 2 0 and d4 2 0 or less 2 3 evaluate the performance of the cmdi this study categorized the univariate drought indices used to construct the cmdi as the marginal group including the spi sri and wsdi as described in the previous section the gpcc and gldas precipitation averages were the data inputs to the spi the sum of the above and below ground runoff from the gldas is the only variable in the sri according to the derivation formula given by sun et al 2018 we obtained the monthly wsdi data from 2003 to 2020 in addition to the marginal indices three typical drought indices were introduced as the control group to evaluate the performance of the cmdi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 self calibrated palmer drought severity index scpdsi and ccdi these multivariate drought indices are widely used in drought studies and fields such as meteorology and hydrology the spei quantifies drought based on the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 it can reflect the amount of surface water deficit and accumulation processes while considering the water and heat balance processes the spei dataset was obtained from the higher council for scientific research https spei csic es database html the pdsi developed by palmer 1965 is widely used in meteorology agriculture and hydrological water resources wells et al 2004 proposed scpdsi to improve the sensitivity and spatial contrast of drought characterization compared with the pdsi the scpdsi sets adaptive factors based on the station history data the scpdsi dataset was obtained from the climatic research unit of the university of east anglia dunn et al 2021 available at https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought as a bivariate drought index the ccdi considers the effects of precipitation and terrestrial water storage the detailed calculation process for the ccdi can be found in satish kumar et al 2021 the calculation consists of three steps first the average precipitation and land water storage were counted separately for each calendar month then the difference between each time series value and the monthly average climate value called the deviation was calculated finally the deviation values of precipitation and terrestrial water storage were summed and normalized to obtain the ccdi we evaluate the performance of cmdi in 10 major basins of china because the spei index has the advantage of multiple time scales zhao et al 2017 we first examined the correlation between cmdi and spei at various timescales to determine which timescale of spei is more correlated with cmdi then we analyzed the reliability of cmdi drought monitoring by counting the correlations between cmdi and three fashioned drought indices scpdsi spei ccdi a high correlation of cmdi with a particular index indicates that they are highly similar and the drought monitoring results have high reliability in this study we used spearman s correlation to calculate the correlation between cmdi and other drought indices spearman s correlation is a distribution independent test that measures the strength of the association between variables the larger the spearman s correlation coefficient de winter et al 2016 the higher the correlation between the two variables finally we also compared the consistency of the time series curve of cmdi spei scpdsi and ccdi from 2003 to 2020 the consistency is shown by the fact that the time series of the two indices show the same trend or pattern within the time interval 2 4 the seasonal mann kendall and run theory the seasonal mann kendall mk test is a nonparametric statistical test method kendall 1948 mann 1945 it does not require samples to obey a particular distribution and is widely used in linear or nonlinear trend analysis in hydrology and meteorology the seasonal mk trend test is a generalization of mk and the main advantage is that it is not affected by factors such as seasonal variations and non normality hirsch et al 1982 the aim is to calculate the mk test statistic and variance for each season or month using long term data and then aggregate these statistics to obtain the final monotonic trend in the present study we investigated the monotonic trend of the cmdi in the time series of the past 18 years using the seasonal mk trend test the significance level was set at p 0 05 sen slope estimates were used in combination to assess the trend of the cmdi over multiple years sen 1968 adnan et al 2016 provided the calculation formula and details as a water shortage requires specific accumulation before it significantly impacts drought events it can only be confirmed when the indicator value drops below a certain threshold over time the drought characteristics for the 10 basins in china were counted based on run theory which is widely used for drought characterization assessment yevjevich 1967 lee et al 2017 presented a schematic of the run theory based on the historical drought frequency and empirical frequency of the drought indices moderate drought was selected as the threshold value to determine the occurrence of drought events liu et al 2020 xu et al 2022a a drought event is considered to occur when the regional cmdi value is below 1 6 for three or more consecutive months the characteristics of drought events include their intensity severity and duration the drought severity is the sum of the index values for each month during a drought event drought intensity is the monthly average index value during a drought event the number of drought events and duration of each drought from 2003 to 2020 were also calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of four copula models the joint distribution of variables was fitted using the frank clayton gumbel and gaussian copulas according to the detailed procedure for constructing the cmdi in section 3 1 the gof of the different copula functions was evaluated using the rmse aic and bic tables s1 and s2 show the evaluation results for the mspi and msri the gof evaluations of different copulas for the cmdi are shown in table 2 the optimal copula model has the lowest rmse aic and bic values the minimum values of the indicators are distinguished using bold letters it can be seen that the gaussian copula has a better fit with smaller aic bic and rmse values than the other copulas fig 3 shows the p p plots of the empirical and theoretical probabilities of the joint mspi msri wsdi distribution for each basin p p plots can visually check whether the data conform to a specified probability distribution this is a scatter plot based on the cumulative probability of the variables and the cumulative probability of the corresponding specified theoretical distribution wang et al 2020a in the present study the horizontal axis of the p p plot is the empirical cdf value and the vertical coordinates represent the cdf values of the different copula functions when the data conformed to the specified copula distribution the sample data points on the pp plot approximated a straight line the figure shows that the gaussian copula and the theoretical probabilities are closer to the diagonal this indicates that the gaussian distribution function can fit the three variables well and accurately calculate the cmdi therefore in this study the construction of the cmdi was completed using the gaussian copula to provide the best joint distribution 3 2 comparison between cmdi and other indices the correlation between spei and cmdi at different timescales was calculated fig 4 the cmdi had the strongest correlation with the drought index on a long timescale with max correlation coefficients of 0 80 spi10 0 78 spi11 0 75 spi12 and 0 70 spei24 for the 10 basins however the correlation between cmdi and spei on less than 3 months timescale performed poorly in the central and western china basins such as the nwb swb yzrb and yrb the spei correlations were higher in the basins along the eastern coast for example the lowest correlations between spei and cmdi in the prb and seb were 0 46 and 0 52 cmdi correlated less with spei on short timescales despite integrating spi and sri on multiple timescales the results in fig 4 show that the correlation strengthens with respect to the timescale the same has been identified by adnan et al 2015 the cmdi is advantageous for describing severe droughts caused by medium to long term water scarcity to simplify and visualize the comparison of the three control indices with the cmdi in the subsequent analysis of the spei we chose only the time scale with the largest correlation spei10 fig 5 shows a bar chart of the correlation between the cmdi and the control group indices the correlation between the cmdi and scpdsi had the highest correlation values in the srb r 0 81 spei10 was strongly correlated with the cmdi in seb r 0 80 the highest correlation between the ccdi and cmdi occurred in the yzrb r 0 65 the cmdi in the seb and yzrb of the 10 basins worked better with correlations 0 6 with the control group the correlation between cmdi and control group indices was 0 5 for the prb and srb similarly fig 5 demonstrates that the correlation between the cmdi and the control group indices is lower in the nwb swb and yrb they are far from the ocean and most of the areas are located in temperate continental and highland mountain climate zones with low annual precipitation and underdeveloped water systems fig 6 shows the time series of the cmdi and indices in the control group from 2003 to 2020 for the 10 basins a 10 month timescale was selected for the spei and plotted as a blue line the red green and gray lines plot the time series of the cmdi scpdsi and ccdi respectively consistent with the results of the correlation analysis it was observed that the variation in cmdi had the highest agreement with spei followed by scpdsi and the lowest agreement was with ccdi based on observations the drought indices exhibited similar time series patterns however fluctuations in the cmdi were relatively flat the scpdsi and spei mainly reflect surface water scarcity whereas the ccdi focuses on capturing water scarcity influenced by human activities as can be seen from the figure the fluctuation of the ccdi is high and the stability of drought monitoring is low compared with the ccdi cmdi is more stable and has a high agreement with scpdsi and spei10 in terms of time variation the low consistency of cmdi in the swb nwb and yrb is because the values of cmdi are smaller than those of the control group indices that is overestimating the degree of drought van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 indicated that the gaussian copula works better however there is an overestimation of extreme and exceptional droughts the joint probabilities of the variables of interest tend to be smaller than marginal probabilities xu et al 2020b this means that the cmdi is more sensitive to drought development however the factor of copula function error cannot be excluded kiafar et al 2020 the cmdi had a high correlation coefficient with spei10 and the scpdsi in the coastal basin and the temporal trends were similar according to these observations different indices showed peak differences in these basins although similar peaks and valleys were observed some variations were observed in these peaks the scpdsi has rich wave crest details as observed in the seb srb and prb the scpdsi assumes that runoff occurs after the soil is fully saturated leading to an underestimation of runoff under dry conditions the cmdi showed rich details of wave troughs as observed in the hhrb and hrb which are densely populated areas the water cycle in the basin has changed under the influence of intense human activity leading to a significant reduction in water reserves yang et al 2023 this suggests that the cmdi reflects the hydrological shortage caused by the combined effects of the water cycle and human activity 3 3 drought application using cmdi 3 3 1 identification of drought events the time series of the cmdi and details of the captured drought events for each basin are shown in fig 7 bars are filled with different colors according to the drought level in addition the time series chart numbered drought events with index values below 1 6 for three consecutive months details of each drought event are listed in table s3 frequent droughts have been observed in the hrb yrb and nwb over the last 18 years han et al 2021 according to the national climate center reports http cmdp ncc cma net monitoring cn china extreme php a meteorological drought developed and was maintained in may 2019 because of the high temperature phase occurring in the hhrb statistically the 6th drought event began in may 2019 with approximately 60 77 of the hhrb experiencing d4 drought reaching a maximum in september 2019 97 69 and drought relief in may 2020 17 69 the hrb has the highest number of drought events and is considered to be mainly influenced by anthropogenic irrigation and groundwater withdrawal wang et al 2014 the lrb has experienced seven droughts and moisture shortages have occurred frequently since 2013 chinese journalists have noticed a decrease in the amount of water coming from rivers and an increase in drinking water in urban areas in the liao river region in recent years the drought events reported by the national climate center for the lrb in august 2014 and july 2015 correspond to the 2nd drought event the nwb experienced a drought in 2015 2016 due to a super el niño event ma et al 2018 according to cmdi monitoring the 7th drought event occurred from december 2014 to june 2016 with a severity of 44 93 in august 2011 southern china experienced widespread and persistently high temperatures severely affecting areas such as guangxi yunnan and chongqing the cmdi determined that this drought event had already occurred in the prb in april 2011 with the drought peaking in september 2011 at an intensity of 3 12 the factors influencing this extremely dry weather have not yet been clarified li et al 2020 for the seb the area exposed to d4 drought reached a maximum in april 2011 94 32 from march 2010 22 73 and then decreased to less than d4 in july 2011 after the summer of 2007 drought continued to develop in the northern wheat region with significantly low rainfall table s3 shows a major drought in the srb from july 2007 to the end of december 2008 with an average intensity of 2 30 seven drought events were monitored in the swb yang et al 2012 reported that the winter drought of 2009 and spring drought of 2010 suffered from the western north pacific subtropical high liu et al 2020 noted an increasing trend in swb droughts after 2014 which can also be observed in fig 7 the cmdi captured drought events in the yrb in 2011 yuan et al 2015 runoff from the mainstem and tributaries of the yrb in 2015 was at its lowest point over 50 years starting in july 2015 the basin suffered the most severe drought which lasted for one year with an average intensity of 2 67 seven drought events have been observed in the yzrb the two most severe droughts occurred in 2006 and 2011 with drought intensities of 2 30 and 2 26 this conclusion is consistent with that of dai et al 2008 and long et al 2015 numerous comparisons show that the cmdi is sensitive and stable in monitoring major droughts across basins however there are variations in the occurrence duration and severity of drought events this was mainly due to the combination of precipitation ground cover and crop growth reflecting the complexity of drought 3 3 2 drought characterization of basins most regions in china are located in the east asian monsoon influenced area and are jointly influenced by westerly circulation and the qinghai tibet plateau monsoon therefore drought disasters are regional and complex the trends of average seasonal cmdi in china were analyzed on a grid scale fig 8 the spatial distribution pattern of the annual trends was generally consistent across the four seasons with seasonal differences in the degree of variation the causes and change patterns of drought formation in each basin remain relatively vague in general the cmdi trends in the nwb showed significant differences north of the nwb the yrb swb hrb hhrb and lrb tend to be dry south of the nwb the yzrb prb seb and lrb tend to be wet the variation was more significant in summer than in the other seasons the causes of drought are mainly related to natural factors such as meteorology human activities and local ability to tolerate drought meteorology and topography are the two most important natural factors first the meteorological conditions of precipitation deficiency for a long time are the main reasons for drought occurrence atmospheric circulation anomalies and land sea water vapor interactions are the underlying causes of low rainfall and high evaporation for example in the spring of 2011 the lower than normal subtropical high pressure in the western pacific ocean at low latitudes inhibited water vapor transport to the yzrb resulting in a drought in the basin lu et al 2014 atmospheric circulation anomalies are also a significant factor causing the dry summer in the yzrb in 2022 yiping et al 2022 climate change such as global warming su et al 2018 pollutant aerosols lüthi et al 2015 and el niño wang et al 2017 can disrupt the structure of the atmosphere causing monsoons over the ocean to fail to make landfall to form precipitation which can also lead to droughts second the topography is an important cause of drought in western china the uplift of the qinghai tibet plateau changed the form of atmospheric circulation in asia which in turn influenced the drought pattern in china liu and dong 2013 when the monsoon passes over the uplift of the tibetan plateau precipitation at low altitudes such as the tarim is significantly reduced by the enhanced rain shadow effect and the regional circulation thus causing drought in contrast high elevation regions such as the qilian mountains and palmyra plateau are subject to upward strong air movement due to topography leading to more precipitation and fewer droughts liu et al 2015 droughts are frequent in the northwest because of the long distance from the ocean and the high topography of the plateau and mountains block the moist airflow from the ocean li et al 2019 in addition humans have significantly affected regional droughts through land cover alteration and groundwater over abstraction cao et al 2022 firstly droughts are influenced by human activities increased water demand during crop sowing and growing periods exacerbate regional agricultural droughts continued population growth and rapid development of the local economy have led to increased water consumption for living and production resulting in the overexploitation of water resources in some areas exceeding the carrying capacity of local water resources the water supply and demand imbalance trigger regional droughts such as hhrb and hrb cheng et al 2021 the extreme reliance on groundwater extraction in these areas has led to a gradual decrease in groundwater reserves exacerbating droughts wang et al 2020b secondly inefficient water use for industrial and agricultural irrigation increases the risk of suffering from drought the efficiency of irrigation water use in semi arid areas of china is only about 40 huang et al 2016 a large amount of water is lost through leakage when irrigating increasing the risk of agricultural water shortages the industrial production process with rough processing and high water pollution wastes many water resources exceeding the tolerance range of water resources may also cause drought thirdly drought is also strongly related to the poor water conditions of inadequate water engineering facilities xu et al 2020a stream dams gates and terraces store rainwater or river water and improve farmland irrigation dams intercept river water to form reservoirs which can help people along the shoreline get water more easily therefore hydraulic engineering facilities such as dams and reservoirs can positively affect water supply areas during major droughts missing or incomplete hydraulic engineering facilities are not effective in mitigating drought conditions fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the drought characteristics from 2003 to 2020 according to the number of drought events fig 9a more than eight occurred with a high frequency in some areas of the hrb yrb and swb the frequency of drought was higher in northern nwb than elsewhere among the 10 major basins the srb had fewer drought events from the drought duration analysis fig 9b it was determined that the average drought periods of the seb and prb were short within six months the average periods of drought events in the yrb hrb and lrb were longer in a study by zhai et al 2017 short drought periods were observed in these regions fig 9c shows the severity of drought over 18 years and it can be seen that northern china suffered a more severe drought than southern china the drought severity was weaker in the yzrb seb and prb in southern china than in the nwb drought intensity fig 9d was also calculated to represent the average degree of drought events drought intensity was generally high in the region between 35 45 n monsoon influenced water vapor moved northward from the southeast coast and decreased with distance causing differences in precipitation from north to south mankin et al 2019 reported that vegetation at mid latitudes is less responsive to climate change than that at tropical and high latitudes making vegetation require more water for photosynthesis therefore even if precipitation increases it is difficult to hedge this effect which makes the land drier in general all regions in china experienced droughts of varying degrees from 2003 to 2020 with the largest number of drought events occurring in the middle and lower reaches of the yzrb and the nwb compared with the drought periods in the north those of southern china such as the yrb seb and prb were relatively short the distribution pattern of drought intensity was similar to that of the average duration showing that the intensity and duration were generally lower in the south than in the north which indicates the relative severity of drought in the north 3 4 uncertainties the new index combines information on terrestrial water storage precipitation and runoff to capture drought comprehensively current research indicates that the spatial and temporal resolution of cmdi observations is acceptable to assess drought at the basin scale however there are several uncertainties in using the cmdi for drought monitoring in china first the lack of high quality and extensive long term data is a major limitation of drought monitoring precipitation runoff and water storage data are inherently subject to errors this study uses the average of multiple datasets to constrain the data uncertainty as much as possible but it does not eliminate it in addition the 18 year observation length is very short for drought index construction and drought analysis errors in the missing data caused by cubic spline interpolation are also propagated to cmdi a comparison with the spei scpdsi and ccdi showed that the cmdi is highly sensitive to water shortages and can capture droughts more frequently however the cmdi overestimated drought in some basins compared with the control group indices the drought overestimation may be due to copula amplification of the tail correlation human activity and negative groundwater anomalies the effect of temperature on drought conditions was ignored considering the complexity of timescales and daily temperature differences in the present study only the edge distribution of spi sri was fitted for four timescales the choice and combination of different time scales of the spi sri may affect drought monitoring performance in addition our operational theory based determination of drought events is an empirical method that needs to be selected in the context of the study period and actual conditions in the study area xu et al 2022b finally cmdi reliably captured the major drought events occurring at the spatial scale of the basin but did not precisely compare differences in drought areas and there may be spatial inconsistencies within the basin this paper is a macroscopic assessment of large basins and therefore does not quantify the accuracy and precision of cmdi monitoring of drought at small spatial scales in the future the study will focus on improving the cmdi method and launching grid scale accuracy validation to enhance its applicability 4 conclusions we develop a composite multivariate drought index based on a copula combining three univariate drought indices spi sri and wsdi and four timescales monthly quarterly semi annually and annually the cmdi reflects the hydrological drought of the overall water storage deficit and has the ability to capture meteorological drought occurrence points as by the spi and capture drought development as the sri does cmdi based drought monitoring incorporates terrestrial water storage responses and can capture anomalies in groundwater and anthropogenic water scarcity in addition to water storage cmdi also integrates drought information from precipitation and runoff thus providing an integrated picture of meteorological and hydrological droughts cmdi achieves an understanding of the process of drought development from multiple time scales and factors over the past 18 years drought trends have increased in the hhrb and the swb the yzrb and seb tended to be wet influenced by the tibetan plateau nwb showed significant north south differences with drier north and wetter south in terms of intensity and number of drought events drought was more severe at 35 45 n than in other regions short term drought events are common in the prb yzrb and seb in southern china whereas long term drought often occurs in the nwb yrb and hrb in

9007,drought as a complex natural hazard encompassing comprehensive information on the occurrence and development of drought using a single variable alone is difficult in the present study a composite multivariate drought index cmdi was developed based on a copula combining three univariate drought indices standardized precipitation index spi standardized runoff index sri and water storage deficit index wsdi and four timescales monthly quarterly semi annually and annually the new index combines information on terrestrial water storage precipitation and runoff to capture drought comprehensively based on the cmdi drought trends and characteristics were assessed for 10 major basins in china from 2003 to 2020 using the seasonal mann kendall test and the run theory the results showed that the developed cmdi 1 integrated meteorological and hydrological drought information using the spi sri and wsdi 2 captured overall drought development more completely and frequently than traditional drought indices and 3 monitored an increasing trend of drought in the qinghai tibet plateau and north china plain in addition to a more substantial drought in northern china than in southern china

drought monitoring terrestrial water storage multivariate river basin timescales data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction meteorological changes such as precipitation evaporation monsoons and increasing human activity exacerbate the problem of uneven water distribution in regional or global domains this phenomenon has led to a severe imbalance between water supply and demand in some areas resulting in frequent droughts leblanc et al 2012 wilhite 2000 compared to other meteorological disasters drought events are often difficult to detect large in area and long in duration droughts are closely linked to several fields such as socio economic ecosystem agriculture and livestock and often lead to considerable economic losses meza et al 2020 china is a vast country with a complex landscape that often suffers from severe and extended droughts liu et al 2020 stone 2010 wu et al 2011 therefore comprehensive drought monitoring and assessment are essential for drought mitigation efforts in china drought is a chronic water shortage caused by an imbalance between the water supply and demand this unstable condition is closely related to precipitation runoff and terrestrial water storage precipitation is an essential activator of the onset and end of the drought less precipitation than normal is often a direct cause of drought events and the amount of precipitation can effectively mitigate drought levels runoff plays regulatory and hysteretic roles in a basin s water resources terrestrial water storage anomalies provide information on deepwater storage for drought recovery they interact with each other and influence the occurrence and development of droughts drought indices are tools for monitoring quantifying and providing early warning of the impact of water scarcity it quantifies one or more variables of interest as a unitless value to assess drought with the passage of time and the advancement of technology various drought indices have been developed in different fields and disciplines ding et al 2021 to monitor and assess drought conditions more accurately comprehensive drought indices that incorporate information from multiple sources are becoming increasingly popular niemeyer 2008 proposed that constructing a composite drought index based on various single drought indices could maximize the combination of information from different aspects and provide a more comprehensive picture of drought the hydrological cycle must be considered to understand the occurrence and development of drought events terrestrial water storage anomalies twsa reflect changes in surface water storage and are useful for monitoring long term regional wet and dry conditions however the effects of human factors weaken the direct link between twsa and precipitation and runoff the joint distribution was calculated using the copula of the standardized precipitation index spi standardized runoff index sri and developed water storage deficit index wsdi to integrate information on precipitation runoff and terrestrial water storage the principle and calculation formula of the three indices is elaborated by guttman 1999 shukla and wood 2008a and sinha et al 2017 the copula preserves the marginal distribution of index variables while describing the complex dependencies between them there are three reasons for choosing this option 1 both were univariate drought indices the spi is a cumulative probability function derived by fitting precipitation to a distribution and transforming it into a standard normal distribution guttman 1999 the sri proposed by shukla and wood 2008a is similar to the spi principle except that runoff was used to replace the precipitation data the wsdi reflects the difference between the monthly water storage change and the average long term water storage change for the corresponding month sinha et al 2017 2 they are familiar with drought indices in their respective fields and are widely used and proven deng et al 2021 hayes et al 2011 shukla and wood 2008b 3 spi and sri have been successfully combined with other variables hao and aghakouchak 2013 combined the joint probabilities of the spi and standardized soil moisture index to describe drought conditions in several regions of the usa shah and mishra 2020 developed a joint spi sri standardized groundwater index and other indices to incorporate more hydrometeorological information terrestrial water storage captures anomalies are caused by groundwater and human activity however few studies have been conducted on the wsdi based composite indices sinha et al 2019 proposed a combined climate deviation index ccdi that combines precipitation and the twsa to assess drought in indian watersheds satish kumar et al 2021 analyzed the correlation of multiple drought indices in four basins in india they found a high correlation between the ccdi and the drought severity index suggesting that a combination of the twsa and hydrological variables could lead to a better understanding of drought in this study three commonly used univariate drought indices were selected based on terrestrial water storage precipitation and runoff data and a composite multivariate drought index cmdi was constructed this study aims to 1 fuse multiple timescales of spi and sri 2 combine the marginal distribution characteristics of multiple univariate indices of spi sri and wsdi and 3 analyze the drought trends and characteristics of china over the past 18 years based on the cmdi 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data 2 1 1 study area the study area included mainland china 73 41 135 02 e 18 10 53 33 n excluding the south china sea in china land in the western region is at a high altitude whereas the eastern region is at a low altitude with a roughly stepped distribution china has various terrains including plateaus mountains hills and plains this topographic pattern is conducive to warm and humid air currents from the pacific ocean penetrating deep into the interior and intersecting with cold air from the pacific ocean to generate precipitation under this topography and a monsoon climate rainfall s spatial and temporal distribution shows a distribution pattern of high in the east low in the west high in summer and low in winter the spatial distribution of soil moisture and precipitation is the same with the southeast being wet and the northwest being dry due to the complex topography large population density and uneven spatial and temporal distribution of water resources the contradiction between the supply and demand of water resources in china is prominent characterized by alternating droughts floods and seasonal changes the basin is a standard spatial scale for water resource analysis and drought and flood assessment basin zoning is consistent with the results of the first level water resource regionalization in china released by the ministry of water resources of the people s republic of china http www mwr gov cn fig 1 shows the distribution of the 10 major river basins in china including northwest basin nwb southwest basin swb yellow river

measurements of the earth s gravity field grace gravity satellites can effectively reflect gravity changes caused by surface water groundwater and anthropogenic factors and monitor global or regional anomalies in terrestrial water storage in june 2017 the grace gravity satellite stopped operating a year later grace follow on grace fo was successfully launched and the scientific observation mission of grace continued mascon solutions a new generation of grace grace fo observational data products have been developed in recent years by several institutions such as the center for space research csr jet propulsion laboratory jpl and goddard space flight center gsfc the mascon product can overcome the leakage error of spherical harmonic coefficients owing to filtering and improved estimates of the mass variation in each circle of the earth the rl06 mascon solutions have improved post processing methods such as filtering and scaling and reduce banding errors and noise by reducing the signal attenuation luthcke et al 2013 save et al 2016 watkins et al 2015 they provided monthly twsa data in the form of equivalent water heights mm however different gravity field solutions increase the uncertainty of the data some researchers have proposed that the simple arithmetic means of the three products can effectively reduce the uncertainty in the data bai et al 2019 chen et al 2020 sakumura et al 2014 therefore the mean values of the three mascon products were used in the present study the grid resolution of the mascon solutions of jpl and gsfc was 0 5 0 5 although the raw resolution of the grace grace fo data was approximately 300 km the csr mascon products offer a grid resolution of 0 25 0 25 the csr mascon solution was resampled to a consistent resolution of 0 5 0 5 using twsa the distance level periods of the three mascon solutions were from january 2004 to december 2009 chen et al 2005 therefore we calculated the simple arithmetic mean of the three products directly due to its efficient universal and widespread use in handling missing data cubic spline interpolation was used to fill in the missing data for 31 months from 2003 to 2020 in summary after a series of preprocessing steps such as format conversion resampling cropping interpolation and averaging we obtained a twsa dataset of 216 months to constrain the error caused by uncertainty in precipitation data katiraie boroujerdy et al 2016 we used precipitation estimates that are averaged out from the global precipitation climatology centre gpcc and global land data assimilation system gldas the gpcc monthly precipitation dataset is a reanalysis product based on global land precipitation data from approximately 86 000 rain gauge stations worldwide schneider et al 2014 the far greater number of stations than that in similar datasets provides a complete time series and good quality for water resources assessment studies the present study used the latest version of the gpcc monthly product released in 2022 with a resolution of 0 5 and time coverage from 2003 to 2020 http gpcc dwd de the gldas data are reanalysis data obtained by nasa using data assimilation and land surface modeling techniques the gldas monthly data of the noah model provide land surface assimilation data such as soil moisture runoff evapotranspiration and temperature we selected runoff and precipitation data with a resolution of 0 25 0 25 provided by the gldas noah v2 1 the hydrological data extracted from the gldas were resampled to a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and the temporal resolution of the hydrological data was 1 month 2 2 development of cmdi 2 2 1 drought indices and timescales here the copula was used to construct the cmdi with joint spi sri and wsdi univariate indices however spi and sri are known to have a range of timescales the spi at different timescales varies significantly in drought monitoring and there is currently no representative window zargar et al 2011 the spi on short medium and long timescales can describe drought in meteorology agriculture and hydrology respectively adnan and ullah 2020 zargar et al 2011 therefore we propose the use of marginal distributions of the spi on various timescales to form their joint distribution for the overall judgment of drought theoretically any spi scale can be calculated jointly however this is computationally intensive therefore four timescales monthly quarterly semi annually and annually were selected to construct the joint distribution of the spi to balance more information and more efficient calculations sri is similar to the calculation principle of spi and also has a series of timescales therefore the calculation is also borrowed from spi the spi and sri for each of the four timescales were 1 month spi01 and sri01 3 months spi03 and sri03 6 months spi06 and sri06 and 12 months spi2 and sri12 the process for fusing the spi and sri multiple timescales can be found in section 3 1 3 2 2 2 copula functions for joint distribution analysis sklar 1959 defined copula as a link function that connects the cumulative distributions of multiple random variables to determine the joint distribution characteristics among the variables assuming that h is a joint cumulative distribution function cdf the marginal cdfs of random variables x and y are denoted by f x and g y respectively thus a copula function c exists which satisfies the following equation 1 c f x g y h x y the advantage of the copula function is that it can establish multivariate joint distributions regardless of the original marginal distribution in other words the copula function can connect the variables of any marginal distribution to form a joint distribution without information distortion multiple excellent copula families are used in drought monitoring such as elliptical and archimedean copulas as typical elliptical copulas both t copulas and gaussian copulas support multivariate joint distributions ma et al 2013 compared to the gaussian copula the t copula has a similar performance but is highly time consuming van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 song et al 2010 compared the goodness of fit gof of the copula family using multiple indicators they indicated that the gaussian copula was more suitable for fitting the joint probability distribution of the multivariate drought index kao and govindaraju 2010 developed a joint distribution of spi and wsdi using a gaussian copula and noted that it has a significant advantage in constructing a comprehensive drought index frank clayton and gumbel are typical archimedean copulas that are widely used in modeling joint probability distributions because of their properties such as ease of construction therefore we choose four copula functions to construct the joint distribution the clayton frank gumbel and gaussian copula table 1 presents the formulas for the four copula types liu et al 2019 2 2 3 development of cmdi and drought levels the detailed methodology of this study is illustrated in fig 2 because the present study needs to consider the timescales of spi and sri a cmdi was constructed using the nested form in this case copula model construction was performed for the four timescales of the spi to obtain the multi timescale spi mspi then the multi timescale sri msri was obtained by constructing the joint distribution of sri01 sri03 sri06 and sri12 using the copula finally the derived results were combined with the wsdi to complete the final layer of copula modeling and produce the cmdi the mspi was obtained using the copula model with input variable u spi01 spi03 spi06 spi12 the msri was obtained using the copula model with the input variable u sri01 sri03 sri06 sri12 the cmdi was obtained using the copula model with the input variable u mspi msri wsdi a detailed description of the copula model construction process is as follows step 1 the n dimensional input variables x 1 x n were fitted to obtain the marginal distribution u 1 u n the parameters of the distribution function were estimated using the maximum likelihood method step 2 the joint distribution of marginal cdfs was fitted using the frank clayton gumbel and gaussian copulas according to eq 1 if the joint distribution of n dimensional input variables is h x 1 x n there exists a copula such that the following equation holds 2 c u 1 u n h x 1 x n step 3 the gof of different copulas is assessed by conducting a comparison with the empirical copula based on three criteria root mean square error rmse akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic jordanger and tjostheim 2014 moazami et al 2014 schwarz 1978 step 4 the joint probability of marginal variables p can be considered a criterion for measuring drought p is the probability that multiple edge variables satisfy their respective conditions denoted as the joint distribution p x 1 x 1 x n x n according to eq 2 the joint distribution p of n dimensional variables can be expressed in terms of the cumulative joint probability p and the optimal function c op as follows 3 p x 1 x 1 x n x n c op u 1 u n p step 5 for joint or cross comparison with different drought indices p was transformed into a composite indicator using the inverse function of the standard normal distribution function let φ be the standard normal distribution function the formula for calculating the mspi msri and cmdi is given by eq 4 4 mspi msri cmdi φ 1 p as a dimensionless index the cmdi follows a normal distribution therefore when quantifying the degree of drought the method of svoboda et al 2002 was used which set the 30th 20th 10th 5th and 2nd percentiles of the standard normal distribution as the drought threshold drought intensity increased with decreasing percentiles drought can be classified into five levels no drought mild moderate severe and extreme according to the z quantile and standardized normal distribution table the threshold scores corresponding to the five drought grades of the cmdi were d0 0 5 to 0 8 d1 0 8 to 1 2 d2 1 2 to 1 6 d3 1 6 to 2 0 and d4 2 0 or less 2 3 evaluate the performance of the cmdi this study categorized the univariate drought indices used to construct the cmdi as the marginal group including the spi sri and wsdi as described in the previous section the gpcc and gldas precipitation averages were the data inputs to the spi the sum of the above and below ground runoff from the gldas is the only variable in the sri according to the derivation formula given by sun et al 2018 we obtained the monthly wsdi data from 2003 to 2020 in addition to the marginal indices three typical drought indices were introduced as the control group to evaluate the performance of the cmdi the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 self calibrated palmer drought severity index scpdsi and ccdi these multivariate drought indices are widely used in drought studies and fields such as meteorology and hydrology the spei quantifies drought based on the difference between precipitation and evapotranspiration vicente serrano et al 2010 it can reflect the amount of surface water deficit and accumulation processes while considering the water and heat balance processes the spei dataset was obtained from the higher council for scientific research https spei csic es database html the pdsi developed by palmer 1965 is widely used in meteorology agriculture and hydrological water resources wells et al 2004 proposed scpdsi to improve the sensitivity and spatial contrast of drought characterization compared with the pdsi the scpdsi sets adaptive factors based on the station history data the scpdsi dataset was obtained from the climatic research unit of the university of east anglia dunn et al 2021 available at https crudata uea ac uk cru data drought as a bivariate drought index the ccdi considers the effects of precipitation and terrestrial water storage the detailed calculation process for the ccdi can be found in satish kumar et al 2021 the calculation consists of three steps first the average precipitation and land water storage were counted separately for each calendar month then the difference between each time series value and the monthly average climate value called the deviation was calculated finally the deviation values of precipitation and terrestrial water storage were summed and normalized to obtain the ccdi we evaluate the performance of cmdi in 10 major basins of china because the spei index has the advantage of multiple time scales zhao et al 2017 we first examined the correlation between cmdi and spei at various timescales to determine which timescale of spei is more correlated with cmdi then we analyzed the reliability of cmdi drought monitoring by counting the correlations between cmdi and three fashioned drought indices scpdsi spei ccdi a high correlation of cmdi with a particular index indicates that they are highly similar and the drought monitoring results have high reliability in this study we used spearman s correlation to calculate the correlation between cmdi and other drought indices spearman s correlation is a distribution independent test that measures the strength of the association between variables the larger the spearman s correlation coefficient de winter et al 2016 the higher the correlation between the two variables finally we also compared the consistency of the time series curve of cmdi spei scpdsi and ccdi from 2003 to 2020 the consistency is shown by the fact that the time series of the two indices show the same trend or pattern within the time interval 2 4 the seasonal mann kendall and run theory the seasonal mann kendall mk test is a nonparametric statistical test method kendall 1948 mann 1945 it does not require samples to obey a particular distribution and is widely used in linear or nonlinear trend analysis in hydrology and meteorology the seasonal mk trend test is a generalization of mk and the main advantage is that it is not affected by factors such as seasonal variations and non normality hirsch et al 1982 the aim is to calculate the mk test statistic and variance for each season or month using long term data and then aggregate these statistics to obtain the final monotonic trend in the present study we investigated the monotonic trend of the cmdi in the time series of the past 18 years using the seasonal mk trend test the significance level was set at p 0 05 sen slope estimates were used in combination to assess the trend of the cmdi over multiple years sen 1968 adnan et al 2016 provided the calculation formula and details as a water shortage requires specific accumulation before it significantly impacts drought events it can only be confirmed when the indicator value drops below a certain threshold over time the drought characteristics for the 10 basins in china were counted based on run theory which is widely used for drought characterization assessment yevjevich 1967 lee et al 2017 presented a schematic of the run theory based on the historical drought frequency and empirical frequency of the drought indices moderate drought was selected as the threshold value to determine the occurrence of drought events liu et al 2020 xu et al 2022a a drought event is considered to occur when the regional cmdi value is below 1 6 for three or more consecutive months the characteristics of drought events include their intensity severity and duration the drought severity is the sum of the index values for each month during a drought event drought intensity is the monthly average index value during a drought event the number of drought events and duration of each drought from 2003 to 2020 were also calculated 3 results and discussion 3 1 performance of four copula models the joint distribution of variables was fitted using the frank clayton gumbel and gaussian copulas according to the detailed procedure for constructing the cmdi in section 3 1 the gof of the different copula functions was evaluated using the rmse aic and bic tables s1 and s2 show the evaluation results for the mspi and msri the gof evaluations of different copulas for the cmdi are shown in table 2 the optimal copula model has the lowest rmse aic and bic values the minimum values of the indicators are distinguished using bold letters it can be seen that the gaussian copula has a better fit with smaller aic bic and rmse values than the other copulas fig 3 shows the p p plots of the empirical and theoretical probabilities of the joint mspi msri wsdi distribution for each basin p p plots can visually check whether the data conform to a specified probability distribution this is a scatter plot based on the cumulative probability of the variables and the cumulative probability of the corresponding specified theoretical distribution wang et al 2020a in the present study the horizontal axis of the p p plot is the empirical cdf value and the vertical coordinates represent the cdf values of the different copula functions when the data conformed to the specified copula distribution the sample data points on the pp plot approximated a straight line the figure shows that the gaussian copula and the theoretical probabilities are closer to the diagonal this indicates that the gaussian distribution function can fit the three variables well and accurately calculate the cmdi therefore in this study the construction of the cmdi was completed using the gaussian copula to provide the best joint distribution 3 2 comparison between cmdi and other indices the correlation between spei and cmdi at different timescales was calculated fig 4 the cmdi had the strongest correlation with the drought index on a long timescale with max correlation coefficients of 0 80 spi10 0 78 spi11 0 75 spi12 and 0 70 spei24 for the 10 basins however the correlation between cmdi and spei on less than 3 months timescale performed poorly in the central and western china basins such as the nwb swb yzrb and yrb the spei correlations were higher in the basins along the eastern coast for example the lowest correlations between spei and cmdi in the prb and seb were 0 46 and 0 52 cmdi correlated less with spei on short timescales despite integrating spi and sri on multiple timescales the results in fig 4 show that the correlation strengthens with respect to the timescale the same has been identified by adnan et al 2015 the cmdi is advantageous for describing severe droughts caused by medium to long term water scarcity to simplify and visualize the comparison of the three control indices with the cmdi in the subsequent analysis of the spei we chose only the time scale with the largest correlation spei10 fig 5 shows a bar chart of the correlation between the cmdi and the control group indices the correlation between the cmdi and scpdsi had the highest correlation values in the srb r 0 81 spei10 was strongly correlated with the cmdi in seb r 0 80 the highest correlation between the ccdi and cmdi occurred in the yzrb r 0 65 the cmdi in the seb and yzrb of the 10 basins worked better with correlations 0 6 with the control group the correlation between cmdi and control group indices was 0 5 for the prb and srb similarly fig 5 demonstrates that the correlation between the cmdi and the control group indices is lower in the nwb swb and yrb they are far from the ocean and most of the areas are located in temperate continental and highland mountain climate zones with low annual precipitation and underdeveloped water systems fig 6 shows the time series of the cmdi and indices in the control group from 2003 to 2020 for the 10 basins a 10 month timescale was selected for the spei and plotted as a blue line the red green and gray lines plot the time series of the cmdi scpdsi and ccdi respectively consistent with the results of the correlation analysis it was observed that the variation in cmdi had the highest agreement with spei followed by scpdsi and the lowest agreement was with ccdi based on observations the drought indices exhibited similar time series patterns however fluctuations in the cmdi were relatively flat the scpdsi and spei mainly reflect surface water scarcity whereas the ccdi focuses on capturing water scarcity influenced by human activities as can be seen from the figure the fluctuation of the ccdi is high and the stability of drought monitoring is low compared with the ccdi cmdi is more stable and has a high agreement with scpdsi and spei10 in terms of time variation the low consistency of cmdi in the swb nwb and yrb is because the values of cmdi are smaller than those of the control group indices that is overestimating the degree of drought van de vyver and van den bergh 2018 indicated that the gaussian copula works better however there is an overestimation of extreme and exceptional droughts the joint probabilities of the variables of interest tend to be smaller than marginal probabilities xu et al 2020b this means that the cmdi is more sensitive to drought development however the factor of copula function error cannot be excluded kiafar et al 2020 the cmdi had a high correlation coefficient with spei10 and the scpdsi in the coastal basin and the temporal trends were similar according to these observations different indices showed peak differences in these basins although similar peaks and valleys were observed some variations were observed in these peaks the scpdsi has rich wave crest details as observed in the seb srb and prb the scpdsi assumes that runoff occurs after the soil is fully saturated leading to an underestimation of runoff under dry conditions the cmdi showed rich details of wave troughs as observed in the hhrb and hrb which are densely populated areas the water cycle in the basin has changed under the influence of intense human activity leading to a significant reduction in water reserves yang et al 2023 this suggests that the cmdi reflects the hydrological shortage caused by the combined effects of the water cycle and human activity 3 3 drought application using cmdi 3 3 1 identification of drought events the time series of the cmdi and details of the captured drought events for each basin are shown in fig 7 bars are filled with different colors according to the drought level in addition the time series chart numbered drought events with index values below 1 6 for three consecutive months details of each drought event are listed in table s3 frequent droughts have been observed in the hrb yrb and nwb over the last 18 years han et al 2021 according to the national climate center reports http cmdp ncc cma net monitoring cn china extreme php a meteorological drought developed and was maintained in may 2019 because of the high temperature phase occurring in the hhrb statistically the 6th drought event began in may 2019 with approximately 60 77 of the hhrb experiencing d4 drought reaching a maximum in september 2019 97 69 and drought relief in may 2020 17 69 the hrb has the highest number of drought events and is considered to be mainly influenced by anthropogenic irrigation and groundwater withdrawal wang et al 2014 the lrb has experienced seven droughts and moisture shortages have occurred frequently since 2013 chinese journalists have noticed a decrease in the amount of water coming from rivers and an increase in drinking water in urban areas in the liao river region in recent years the drought events reported by the national climate center for the lrb in august 2014 and july 2015 correspond to the 2nd drought event the nwb experienced a drought in 2015 2016 due to a super el niño event ma et al 2018 according to cmdi monitoring the 7th drought event occurred from december 2014 to june 2016 with a severity of 44 93 in august 2011 southern china experienced widespread and persistently high temperatures severely affecting areas such as guangxi yunnan and chongqing the cmdi determined that this drought event had already occurred in the prb in april 2011 with the drought peaking in september 2011 at an intensity of 3 12 the factors influencing this extremely dry weather have not yet been clarified li et al 2020 for the seb the area exposed to d4 drought reached a maximum in april 2011 94 32 from march 2010 22 73 and then decreased to less than d4 in july 2011 after the summer of 2007 drought continued to develop in the northern wheat region with significantly low rainfall table s3 shows a major drought in the srb from july 2007 to the end of december 2008 with an average intensity of 2 30 seven drought events were monitored in the swb yang et al 2012 reported that the winter drought of 2009 and spring drought of 2010 suffered from the western north pacific subtropical high liu et al 2020 noted an increasing trend in swb droughts after 2014 which can also be observed in fig 7 the cmdi captured drought events in the yrb in 2011 yuan et al 2015 runoff from the mainstem and tributaries of the yrb in 2015 was at its lowest point over 50 years starting in july 2015 the basin suffered the most severe drought which lasted for one year with an average intensity of 2 67 seven drought events have been observed in the yzrb the two most severe droughts occurred in 2006 and 2011 with drought intensities of 2 30 and 2 26 this conclusion is consistent with that of dai et al 2008 and long et al 2015 numerous comparisons show that the cmdi is sensitive and stable in monitoring major droughts across basins however there are variations in the occurrence duration and severity of drought events this was mainly due to the combination of precipitation ground cover and crop growth reflecting the complexity of drought 3 3 2 drought characterization of basins most regions in china are located in the east asian monsoon influenced area and are jointly influenced by westerly circulation and the qinghai tibet plateau monsoon therefore drought disasters are regional and complex the trends of average seasonal cmdi in china were analyzed on a grid scale fig 8 the spatial distribution pattern of the annual trends was generally consistent across the four seasons with seasonal differences in the degree of variation the causes and change patterns of drought formation in each basin remain relatively vague in general the cmdi trends in the nwb showed significant differences north of the nwb the yrb swb hrb hhrb and lrb tend to be dry south of the nwb the yzrb prb seb and lrb tend to be wet the variation was more significant in summer than in the other seasons the causes of drought are mainly related to natural factors such as meteorology human activities and local ability to tolerate drought meteorology and topography are the two most important natural factors first the meteorological conditions of precipitation deficiency for a long time are the main reasons for drought occurrence atmospheric circulation anomalies and land sea water vapor interactions are the underlying causes of low rainfall and high evaporation for example in the spring of 2011 the lower than normal subtropical high pressure in the western pacific ocean at low latitudes inhibited water vapor transport to the yzrb resulting in a drought in the basin lu et al 2014 atmospheric circulation anomalies are also a significant factor causing the dry summer in the yzrb in 2022 yiping et al 2022 climate change such as global warming su et al 2018 pollutant aerosols lüthi et al 2015 and el niño wang et al 2017 can disrupt the structure of the atmosphere causing monsoons over the ocean to fail to make landfall to form precipitation which can also lead to droughts second the topography is an important cause of drought in western china the uplift of the qinghai tibet plateau changed the form of atmospheric circulation in asia which in turn influenced the drought pattern in china liu and dong 2013 when the monsoon passes over the uplift of the tibetan plateau precipitation at low altitudes such as the tarim is significantly reduced by the enhanced rain shadow effect and the regional circulation thus causing drought in contrast high elevation regions such as the qilian mountains and palmyra plateau are subject to upward strong air movement due to topography leading to more precipitation and fewer droughts liu et al 2015 droughts are frequent in the northwest because of the long distance from the ocean and the high topography of the plateau and mountains block the moist airflow from the ocean li et al 2019 in addition humans have significantly affected regional droughts through land cover alteration and groundwater over abstraction cao et al 2022 firstly droughts are influenced by human activities increased water demand during crop sowing and growing periods exacerbate regional agricultural droughts continued population growth and rapid development of the local economy have led to increased water consumption for living and production resulting in the overexploitation of water resources in some areas exceeding the carrying capacity of local water resources the water supply and demand imbalance trigger regional droughts such as hhrb and hrb cheng et al 2021 the extreme reliance on groundwater extraction in these areas has led to a gradual decrease in groundwater reserves exacerbating droughts wang et al 2020b secondly inefficient water use for industrial and agricultural irrigation increases the risk of suffering from drought the efficiency of irrigation water use in semi arid areas of china is only about 40 huang et al 2016 a large amount of water is lost through leakage when irrigating increasing the risk of agricultural water shortages the industrial production process with rough processing and high water pollution wastes many water resources exceeding the tolerance range of water resources may also cause drought thirdly drought is also strongly related to the poor water conditions of inadequate water engineering facilities xu et al 2020a stream dams gates and terraces store rainwater or river water and improve farmland irrigation dams intercept river water to form reservoirs which can help people along the shoreline get water more easily therefore hydraulic engineering facilities such as dams and reservoirs can positively affect water supply areas during major droughts missing or incomplete hydraulic engineering facilities are not effective in mitigating drought conditions fig 9 shows the spatial distribution of the drought characteristics from 2003 to 2020 according to the number of drought events fig 9a more than eight occurred with a high frequency in some areas of the hrb yrb and swb the frequency of drought was higher in northern nwb than elsewhere among the 10 major basins the srb had fewer drought events from the drought duration analysis fig 9b it was determined that the average drought periods of the seb and prb were short within six months the average periods of drought events in the yrb hrb and lrb were longer in a study by zhai et al 2017 short drought periods were observed in these regions fig 9c shows the severity of drought over 18 years and it can be seen that northern china suffered a more severe drought than southern china the drought severity was weaker in the yzrb seb and prb in southern china than in the nwb drought intensity fig 9d was also calculated to represent the average degree of drought events drought intensity was generally high in the region between 35 45 n monsoon influenced water vapor moved northward from the southeast coast and decreased with distance causing differences in precipitation from north to south mankin et al 2019 reported that vegetation at mid latitudes is less responsive to climate change than that at tropical and high latitudes making vegetation require more water for photosynthesis therefore even if precipitation increases it is difficult to hedge this effect which makes the land drier in general all regions in china experienced droughts of varying degrees from 2003 to 2020 with the largest number of drought events occurring in the middle and lower reaches of the yzrb and the nwb compared with the drought periods in the north those of southern china such as the yrb seb and prb were relatively short the distribution pattern of drought intensity was similar to that of the average duration showing that the intensity and duration were generally lower in the south than in the north which indicates the relative severity of drought in the north 3 4 uncertainties the new index combines information on terrestrial water storage precipitation and runoff to capture drought comprehensively current research indicates that the spatial and temporal resolution of cmdi observations is acceptable to assess drought at the basin scale however there are several uncertainties in using the cmdi for drought monitoring in china first the lack of high quality and extensive long term data is a major limitation of drought monitoring precipitation runoff and water storage data are inherently subject to errors this study uses the average of multiple datasets to constrain the data uncertainty as much as possible but it does not eliminate it in addition the 18 year observation length is very short for drought index construction and drought analysis errors in the missing data caused by cubic spline interpolation are also propagated to cmdi a comparison with the spei scpdsi and ccdi showed that the cmdi is highly sensitive to water shortages and can capture droughts more frequently however the cmdi overestimated drought in some basins compared with the control group indices the drought overestimation may be due to copula amplification of the tail correlation human activity and negative groundwater anomalies the effect of temperature on drought conditions was ignored considering the complexity of timescales and daily temperature differences in the present study only the edge distribution of spi sri was fitted for four timescales the choice and combination of different time scales of the spi sri may affect drought monitoring performance in addition our operational theory based determination of drought events is an empirical method that needs to be selected in the context of the study period and actual conditions in the study area xu et al 2022b finally cmdi reliably captured the major drought events occurring at the spatial scale of the basin but did not precisely compare differences in drought areas and there may be spatial inconsistencies within the basin this paper is a macroscopic assessment of large basins and therefore does not quantify the accuracy and precision of cmdi monitoring of drought at small spatial scales in the future the study will focus on improving the cmdi method and launching grid scale accuracy validation to enhance its applicability 4 conclusions we develop a composite multivariate drought index based on a copula combining three univariate drought indices spi sri and wsdi and four timescales monthly quarterly semi annually and annually the cmdi reflects the hydrological drought of the overall water storage deficit and has the ability to capture meteorological drought occurrence points as by the spi and capture drought development as the sri does cmdi based drought monitoring incorporates terrestrial water storage responses and can capture anomalies in groundwater and anthropogenic water scarcity in addition to water storage cmdi also integrates drought information from precipitation and runoff thus providing an integrated picture of meteorological and hydrological droughts cmdi achieves an understanding of the process of drought development from multiple time scales and factors over the past 18 years drought trends have increased in the hhrb and the swb the yzrb and seb tended to be wet influenced by the tibetan plateau nwb showed significant north south differences with drier north and wetter south in terms of intensity and number of drought events drought was more severe at 35 45 n than in other regions short term drought events are common in the prb yzrb and seb in southern china whereas long term drought often occurs in the nwb yrb and hrb in northern china the cmdi provides large scale drought monitoring and offers new support for drought propagation studies declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

9008,population growth and the decreasing amount of available soil and water resources have highlighted the importance of integrated allocation of agricultural soil and water resources iasw an uncertainty based multiobjective optimization model for the simultaneous allocation of agricultural soil and water resources abbreviated as the uasweei model was developed the economic objective of the uasweei model was characterized by an economic benefits function linked with equity comprehensively reflecting economic social and ecological dimensions the environmental objective was to reduce the discharge of agricultural pollutants from carrier areas and soil with an inputoutput model the resource use objective balanced the conflicts between water savings and yield increases through an irrigation water use efficiency function iwue the uasweei model reflected the management uncertainty in iasws through intuitionistic fuzzy numbers ifns and quantified the stochastic uncertainty in the water supply through bayesian networks bns combined with climate change scenarios a fuzzy mathematical method with an optimistic pessimistic mixed view was employed to solve the model the results indicate that 1 the water use structure was adjusted compared with the status quo and the water saving effect was dramatic with the optimized groundwater volume being 49 05 smaller than the planned groundwater volume the optimal iwue is higher than that under the status quo and planning scenarios 2 the model increases the equity of iasw while balancing the economic environmental resource use efficiency as shown by the 25 decrease in the gini coefficient and the 5 decrease in the thiel index value compared with the status quo the study area transitions from a state of inequitable resource allocation to a state of relative equity this study helps promote the sustainable development of irrigation areas from the perspective of the allocation of water and soil resources keywords integrated allocation of agricultural soil and water resources economic environmental resource trade offs equity uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the integrated allocation of agricultural soil and water resources iasw can improve the utilization of agricultural soil and water resources and reduce environmental pollution thus enabling sustainability in agriculture grove 2018 iasw aims to achieve social economic and ecological objectives science technology and management tools can be used to rationally allocate the limited amount of soil and water resources for irrigation purposes in a given area during the crop irrigation season to achieve sustainability of soil and water resources wang et al 2012 iasw entails a system optimization problem with a complex structure involving a trade off between multiple parameters and objectives therefore iasw research based on multiobjective planning methods has become a research area of heightened interest wang et al 2011 li et al 2019 ogbolumani and nwulu et al 2021 in the iasw multiobjective model the economic benefits objective is usually the first to be considered xu et al 2020 he et al 2021 economic benefits are often quantified through the link between income and output jyotiba et al 2016 li et al 2022 however there is often a link between social effects and economic benefits and social effects are difficult to quantify the quantification of social effects through equity has been reported in recent years rylski 2021 the higher the equity is the more a higher level of shared satisfaction is promoted among resource owners arguably increasing the incentive to produce and the resultant economic benefits inequitable allocation of water and soil resources can impact economic benefits this occurs because extreme inequity can result in the poor becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer potentially causing a decrease in the motivation of disadvantaged parties and inefficient or ineffective economic production therefore equity coupling in resource allocation with the economic benefit objectives of the iasw model arguably generates a positive effect on increasing the economic benefits of water and soil resource allocation iasw impacts both economic benefits and environmental effects planting requires fertilizers but improper application of fertilizers can result in nonpoint source pollution qian et al 2021 water pollution can occur through rainfall erosion and groundwater transport jiang li et al 2021 y li et al 2021 s li et al 2021 li et al 2022 rational iasw requires economic benefits while effectively reducing agricultural pollutant emissions thus promoting sustainability in agriculture in water scarce areas irrigation water use efficiency is a key element of iasw and efficient water use promotion the iwue is determined as the crop yield per unit of water consumed in the area suryavanshi et al 2021 on the one hand water scarcity impacts food production and food security while on the other hand food production consumes large volumes of water and thus causes water scarcity therefore irrigation water use efficiency is important to balance food production and water consumption a trade off exists among the economic benefits environmental effects and irrigation water use efficiency in iasws i e an increase in one objective can result in a decrease in one or both of the remaining objectives determination of the best option among these three conflicting objectives has increasingly become an important factor in promoting sustainability in agriculture existing models for iasws based on multiobjective planning rarely consider economic benefits while coupling equity or accounting for both environmental effects and irrigation water use efficiency in iasws iasw involves natural and socioeconomic conditions and human activities which leads to multifactorial uncertainty in the study process in the definition of parameters environmental and policy changes result in the lack of clear values for certain parameters and if they are expressed as definite numbers data are often missing e g uncertain future crop prices and irrigation quotas intuitionistic fuzzy numbers ifns can be used in the iasw process to express the uncertainty in these data the multiobjective iasw planning problem is then transformed into a fuzzy planning problem and a fuzzy mathematical method based on membership functions transforms this multiobjective model into a single objective model li et al 2017 however the establishment of single membership functions does not necessarily capture the subjective preferences of decision makers to this end calculation of the joint effect of different membership functions debnath et al 2019 e g linear exponential and hyperbolic membership functions from an optimistic pessimistic mixed perspective garg and gulati 2016 in the ifn based optimization model for iasw is an option to provide greater flexibility in addition iasws are highly sensitive to the water supply ren et al 2021 the main source of the water supply is runoff which can be influenced by rainfall evapotranspiration temperature and other factors existing runoff prediction methods include not only traditional rainfall runoff models but also stochastic analysis li et al 2012 exponential smoothing gao and amp 2019 wavelet analysis alizadeh et al 2021 artificial neural networks lin et al 2019 chaos analysis theory lei et al 2015 and bayesian networks bns zeng et al 2020 the bn method has been applied to consider humidity hu rainfall ra evapotranspiration eto temperature te and pressure pr in the prediction of runoff ru including estimates of uncertainty inclusion of climate change scenarios in the bn reasoning process potentially allows runoff predictions to guide iasws under different scenarios therefore quantification of the uncertainty in the water supply under climate change scenarios through the bn method could guide iasw in summary this study proposes a multiobjective economic environmental irrigation water use efficiency planning model in a changing environment that coordinates iasw namely an uncertainty based multiobjective optimization model for the simultaneous allocation of agricultural soil and water resources to achieve economic environmental irrigation water use efficiency synergy abbreviated as the uasweei model the uasweei model couples an equity based economic model an inputoutput model an irrigation water use efficiency model bns for rainfall runoff modeling under climate change and an optimistic pessimistic mixed view optimization method the uasweei model accomplishes iasw under both hydrological and management uncertainties to achieve trade offs between economic benefits environmental effects and resource use efficiency in response to a changing environment 2 methodology this study developed the uasweei optimization model structure under various climate change scenarios as shown in fig 1 the model structure includes system recognition and parameter determination with the uasweei model considering conflict resolution in agricultural water and soil management through model solutions and outputs note rcp indicates the representative concentration pathway and gcm indicates the climate change scenario model 2 1 uasweei model objective function 2 1 1 equity based economic benefits objective function equity was integrated into the economic benefit function in the form of the efficiency value the efficiency value was quantified by the coordination degree considering aspects of economic social and ecological dimensions we set an evaluation system including two levels of indicators for the economic dimension the indexes included agricultural output per capita output per unit area and food production per cubic meter of water for the social dimension the indexes included irrigation water use coefficient water saving potential and completeness of supporting works and for the ecological dimension the indexes included groundwater availability effective rainfall and net water demand more details for the two level indexes system are listed in table s1 in the supplementary material sm we used an integrated weights method to evaluate the system we used the entropy weight method khodaei et al 2021 to determine the weight of the second level index because the entropy method has advantages over an objective assignment method and it has a certain degree of accuracy then we used the analytic hierarchy process ahp method to determine the weight of the first level index because the ahp method is systematic practical and simple finally we used the coordination degree to couple the weights of the two level indexes the formulas for the ahp entropy and coordination degree methods are presented in the sm the economic benefits function coupling equity is calculated as 1 max e i 1 i j 1 j r i j c i j d

sufficiently small number to ensure that the denominator is not 0 and is the existence of uncertainty in the parameters and the corresponding parameters determined by ifn calculation r i j is determined by both crop prices and yields which is defined as follows 2 r i j p i j y i j a i j where p i j is the price of crop j yuan kg y i j is the yield per area of crop j in district i kg ha and a i j is the planted area of crop j in irrigation district i ha decision variables c i j is the total cost of planting various crops in each irrigation district and w i j is the total cost of surface

functions based on the input output coefficient method environmental effects comprise the second objective function of the uasweei model which relies on a form of input output coefficient function to quantify agricultural nonpoint source pollution emissions khadam and kaluarachchi 2006 the function considers the effects of the flow production factor pf vegetation interception factor vf soil erosion factor sf and soil leaching factor lf on nonpoint source pollution to quantify pollutants more precisely the pollutant output is calculated as follows 6 min m c o n σ c o n i 1 i j 1 j e c o n

amounts of tn and tp that flow into the river with surface runoff respectively kg year m t n i and m t p i are the amounts of tn and tp that infiltrate into the soil respectively kg year as the type of m c o n varies σ c o n exhibits different values for example m t n r m t n i m t p r and m t p i correspond to four different normalization factors i e σ t n r σ t n i σ t p r and σ t p i respectively the pf vf sf and lf involved in the environmental effects function are calculated via the environmental effects impact factor as provided in the sm e c o n j in eq 6 is quantified through mass balance equations and e n j and e p j are expressed as follows 7 e n j g n l i n 1 i n 2 i n 3 j g n 1 j g n 2 g n 3 8 e p j i p 1 g p 1 j g p 2 g p 3 where i n 1 and i p 1 denote the annual

phosphorus fixed through uptake per area of soil kg ha g n 3 and g p 3 are the annual nitrogen and phosphorus amounts respectively per acre infiltrating into groundwater kg ha and e n j and e p j are the tn and tp output coefficients respectively in agricultural planting kg ha year 2 1 3 irrigation water use efficiency function the iwue reflects the relationship between water and soil resource use and crop yield iwue enhancement is important for the conservation of surface and groundwater resources and the iwue is determined as follows 9 max i w u e i 1 i j 1 j y i j a i j i 1 i j 1 j i q i j s u r i q i j g r o a i j 2 2 uasweei model constraints the objective functions described in section 2 1 require certain constraints in terms of iasw for the various crops in the different regions including surface water groundwater food security soil policy water quality and structural constraints 1 surface water supply constraints the net surface water irrigation in each area occurs within the available surface water and the surface water availability in all areas is lower than that in the total study area with the constraint expressed as 10 j 1 j i q i j s u r a i j τ i s u r s w a i 11 i 1 i s w a i q r where s w a i is the amount of surface water available in irrigation district i m3 q r is the amount of runoff in the area m3 and τ s u r denotes the benefits of surface water use in the irrigation district 2 groundwater supply constraints the net groundwater irrigation water in each area should occur within the groundwater availability and the groundwater availability in all areas should be lower than the groundwater availability in the total study area with the constraint expressed as 12 j 1 j i q i j g r o a i j τ i g r o g w s i 13 i 1 i g w s i χ t g w where g w s i is the amount of groundwater available in irrigation district i m3 τ g r o denotes the benefits of groundwater use in the irrigation district t g w is the total amount of groundwater in the study area m3 and χ is the amount of groundwater used in agricultural irrigation as a percentage of the total groundwater volume 3 food security constraint food production in each irrigation area should meet the food needs of the population with the constraint expressed as 14 j 1 j y i j a i j f i o i j p d i f d where p d i is the population of the irrigation district people f d denotes the food requirements kg person and f i o i j is the difference between the import and export of planting crop j in irrigation district i 4 soil policy constraint there are lower and upper limits to the area to be planted in each irrigation district with the constraint expressed as 15 a i j min a i j a i j max 5 water quality constraint the modeled environmental effects reflect the amount of pollutants partially flowing with surface runoff into carrier areas which should remain below the water environment capacity threshold of the river with the constraint expressed as 16 σ c o n i 1 i j 1 j e c o n j a i j m

capacity of tp m t p 6 nonnegative constraint the decision variable is positive with the constraint expressed as 17 a i j 0 18 i q i j s u r s w a i 0 19 i q i j g r o g w s i 0 2 3 determination of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers ifns parameters in the uasweei model such as p i j y i j δ i j w i s u r and w i g r o are subject to uncertainty because these parameters have multiple information sources it is difficult to identify which source is more accurate for this reason these parameters are quantified by ifn atanassov and stoeva 1986 proposed theory of intuitionistic fuzzy sets ifss based on the fuzzy set theory proposed by zadeh 1965 can effectively reflect such uncertainty moreover ifns can reflect the levels of affiliation nonaffiliation and hesitation li et al 2020 the affiliation degree indicates the probability of giving affirmation to the content in the set the nonaffiliation degree indicates the probability of objecting to the content in the set and the hesitation degree indicates the probability of being unable to judge the content in the set 2 3 1 definition of ifn r is the set of real numbers a k is the ifs in a nonempty set μ a k x x 0 1 membership and v a k x x 0 1 nonmembership are functions an a k x μ a k x v a k x x r x x is said to be an ifn if an ifs satisfies the following conditions i a k is a normal ifn in r ii μ a k x and v a k x are continuous functions in r 0 1 iii a k is a convex ifn in r the ifs algorithm calculates fuzzy numbers as presented in the sm the triangular membership function tmf is a commonly employed ifn and can be expressed as follows singh and yadav 2015 fig 2 μ a k x x 0 1 and v a k x x 0 1 are membership and nonmembership functions respectively a k x μ a k x v a k x x r xεx is considered an ifn if 0 μ a k x 1 and 0 v a k x 1 then a k a l a m a u a l a m a u is an ifn with tmf where the membership and nonmembership functions are defined as 20 μ a k x x a l a m a l a l x a m a u x a u a m a m x a u 0 o t h e r w i s e 21 v a k x a m x a m a l a l x a m x a m a u a m a m x a u 1 o t h e r w i s e moreover the tmf satisfies a l a l a m a u a u 2 3 2 accuracy functions the aim of the accuracy function af is to comprehensively quantify the fuzziness of the ifn the ifn with tmf can be transformed into deterministic parameters by af the larger the af value is the more accurate the portrayal and conversely the less accurate the portrayal the fuzzier the af is which is defined as 22 a f a k 0 α max m e a n a k α l a k α u d α 0 β max m e a n a k β l a k β u d β 2 where α max max x x μ a k x and β max max x x v a k x if a k a l a m a u a l a m a u is a tmf the af is then defined as 23 a k a l a m a u a l a m a u 8 where α max max x x μ a k x and β max max x χ ν a k x if a k a l a m a u a l a m a u is a tmf the af is then defined as 24 a k a l a m a u a l a m a u 8 2 4 model solution based on an optimistic pessimistic mixed view the uasweei model is a model containing ifns such as p i j y i j δ i j w i s u r and w i g r o and in the solution process the ifn is first converted into a deterministic model through af fuzzy mathematical methods li et al 2017 can effectively yield a compromise between the various objectives multiobjective models can be transformed into single objective models through membership functions membership functions can be linear exponential or hyperbolic functions debnath et al 2019 reflecting the optimism pessimism mixture of the decision maker mahajan et al 2020 to reveal the effect of decision maker preference subjectivity aspects on the model solution this study establishes equivalence under different methods from an optimistic pessimistic mixed perspective garg and gulati 2016 after af application through various membership functions as shown in fig 3 thus facilitating higher model flexibility here the maximum case for each type of affiliation function in the optimistic case is adopted as an example and the minimum and

on bns the surface water availability in the uasweei model is a very important limiting and sensitive variable that is stochastic in nature the water supply amount provided by river runoff is closely related to various meteorological factors including hu te ra pr and eto which vary with future climate changes jiang li et al 2021 y li et al 2021 s li et al 2021 it is therefore important to explore how iasws change under future climate change conditions the representative concentration pathway rcp model integrates assessment models simple climate models atmospheric chemistry models and global carbon cycle models this study generated 8 climate change scenarios scenario 1 bcc csm1 1 bc1 rcp4 5 scenario 2 bcc csm1 1 bc1 rcp 8 5 scenario 3 ccsm4 ccs rcp4 5 scenario 4 ccsm4 ccs rcp 8 5 scenario

and rcp 8 5 pathways were selected for this study as examples rcp 8 5 was chosen to reflect the worst emissions investigated and represents a co2 concentration that will continue to rise rapidly in contrast rcp 4 5 was selected to evaluate less extreme conditions because it is representative of a lower emission scenario tehrani et al 2021 runoff is inferred and predicted with the bn method considering the impact of future climate change on runoff as described in the sm bayesian networks has a powerful ability to handle uncertainty problems and can learn and reason under limited incomplete and uncertain information moreover it can effectively perform multi source information representation and fusion coupling bayesian networks to multi objective decision models for agricultural soil and water resources allocation can fully reflect and quantify the uncertainty of the water supply in the developed model a bn consists of a network structure g m b and various parameters where m is the set of nodes each corresponding to a stochastic variable and b is the set of directed edges the parameters include the conditional probability distribution of each node reflecting the strength of the probabilistic dependency of a given node on its parents let x m be the stochastic variable of network node m a bn flow chart is shown in fig 4 3 applications 3 1 study area the sanjiang plain has an annual output of 15 million tons of grain and the per capita cultivated land area and per capita grain output are more than four times the national average the scale of agricultural production here is large and the degree of agricultural mechanization ranks first in china this area includes the triangular confluence area of the amur river songhua river and wusuli river as well as the umken river basin muling river basin and xingkai lake plain the actual irrigated area is 2 41 106 ha the three main crops are rice corn and soybean with planting proportions of 52 06 36 36 and 11 57 respectively rice accounts for a large proportion and uses more water but water resources are in short supply the total amount of water resources in the whole region is 1 62 billion m3 including 1 16 billion m3 of surface runoff and 850 million m3 of groundwater resources thirty seven irrigation areas in the sanjiang plain are connected and water is diverted from the amur river and songhua river the main drainage and discharge areas are the amur river the water quality indexes of the main rivers and different river sections in the sanjiang plain show that some water quality indexes of rivers exceed the standard among which tn and tp often exceed the national quality standards the uncertainty of climate change brings great complexity to water distribution considering the water environment therefore the model constructed in this paper is used in a large scale agricultural irrigation area in the sanjiang plain to verify the feasibility of the model on the other hand the allocation results of water and land resources are helpful to improve the agricultural water consumption in the sanjiang plain and alleviate the serious nonpoint source pollution in the sanjiang plain as shown in fig 5 note the irrigation district names are abbreviated as provided in table s1 in the sm 3 2 model parameters and data the uasweei model involves data such as hydrometeorological data socioeconomic data irrigation data river data nonpoint source pollution data and remote sensing data the data sources include the china geospatial data cloud china earth system science data sharing network china meteorological science data sharing service network and heilongjiang province yearbook in table 1 3 2 1 determination of the parameters related to nonpoint source pollution the values for i n 1 and i p 1 in formulas 7 and 8 in section 2 1 2 are 38 5 and 46 2 respectively the dry and wet deposition nitrogen input into farmland g n 2 in formula 7 in section 2 1 2 is 14 6 kg ha year the proportion of the fixed amount of applied fertilizers g p 2 reaches 65 the g n 1 and g p 1 in formulas 7 and 8 in section 2 1 2 values for rice corn and soybeans are 23 and 34 kg ha 25 and 3 11 kg ha and 5 07 and 1 57 kg ha respectively the g n 3 in formula 7 in section 2 1 2 value is 17 49 and the g p 3 in formula 8 in section 2 1 2 value is 3 4 for the parameters and calculation methods in formula 7 and formula 8 refer to the contents of reference chen et al 2021 the results of the tn and tp output coefficients in the 37 irrigation regions are summarized in table s3 in the sm the input output coefficient model considers the four factors of pf vf sf and lf and the calculated mean values of pf vf sf and lf are 3 88 3 01 5 87 and 412 38 t ha h mj mm ha respectively the calculation was based on environmental effect impact factors in sm 3 2 2 water environment capacity the maximum river capacity m c o n r of the amur river is calculated with a one dimensional water quality model zhang and li 2019 we believe that the pollutant mixing rate is quite fast in the study area s discharge bearing rivers both horizontally and vertically and the pollutant concentration is uniform in the cross section this coincides with the calculation conditions of the one dimensional water quality model so we choose the one dimensional water quality model to calculate m c o n r the calculation of the one dimensional water quality model is in the sm as summarized in table 2 3 2 3 runoff projections in this study 47 years from 1969 to 2015 of runoff and meteorological data from the study area were used to learn the data structure of bns based on hu te ra pr and eto using the hill climbing method which is more efficient for data learning blasi et al 2021 the independence between the data are judged by the bias correlation coefficient if the partial coefficient is greater than 0 05 it is independent otherwise it is not independent after checking the independence the unreasonable learning structure is adjusted by artificially deleting unreasonable networks and adding reasonable networks to obtain the final network then the results between the variables are inferred and the function of runoff prediction is obtained as follows r 316 05 h u 181 36 t 0 91 p r 28 58 p 28 28 e 136685 80 3 2 4 irrigation data and socioeconomic parameters the irrigation data mainly include surface and groundwater irrigation quotas for the different crops in each region as detailed in table s4 in the sm the socioeconomic parameters include the price of surface water and groundwater surface and groundwater use efficiency cost of growing the different crops and food requirements as detailed in tables s5 and s6 in the sm the coordination degree d i in the 37 irrigation regions coupled with the economic benefits function is provided in table 3 the maximum efficiency value acceptable to customer α in formula 1 is 0 594 3 2 5 scenarios to better show the superiority of the model this study compares the optimization results of the model with the status quo situation and the planning situation the status quo represents the actual planting situation in the study area planning conditions represent the planning of the planting structure and development of the irrigation area in the future by the managers of the research area according to the development of the research area both data are from the sanjiang plain irrigation district feasibility report 4 results analysis 4 1 water and soil resource allocation the planting structure of the 37 irrigation regions was optimized based on the uasweei model as shown in fig 6 the optimization resulted in a 17 increase in irrigated area compared to the current irrigated area with an 18 increase in the irrigated area planted with rice an 8 decrease in the irrigated area planted with corn and a 14 decrease in the irrigated area planted with soybeans this finding agreed with the overall trend of the planned cropping structure in the three rivers plain with an increase in the paddy field planting area and a decrease in the dry field planting area compared to the planned area the optimization results show that there are spatial differences in the planting situation of rice corn and soybean and not all three crops are planted in every irrigation area for example the bqlln region does not plant corn the planned area refers to the irrigation district s own plan for the future planting area which comes from the irrigation district data the area under rice planting was reduced by 20 with the most notable adjustment in the jx region while the planting areas under corn and soybean were reduced by 70 and 83 respectively the model optimized the areas planted with rice corn and soybeans by weighing the economic environmental resource efficiency relationship notes indicates an increase in the optimized area over the planned status quo area indicates a reduction in the optimized area compared to the planned status quo area as shown in figs 7 and 8 the status quo surface water allocation volume reached 4 17 billion m3 and the groundwater allocation volume amounted to 1 28 billion m3 the planned surface water availability was 5 10 billion m3 and the groundwater allocation quantity reached 2 76 billion m3 the total irrigated area under the planned scenario was 3 2 105 ha larger than that under the status quo scenario and more irrigation water was therefore needed the optimized surface water amount was 45 19 billion m3 and the underground water amount reached 14 04 billion m3 a decrease of 11 37 and 49 05 respectively in the planned amount the optimized groundwater use volume accounted for 24 of the total water volume while the planned groundwater use volume accounted for 35 of the total water volume the model reduced groundwater use and mitigated future groundwater overexploitation in the three rivers plain maximization increased the surface water and groundwater allocation volumes by 8 3 and 10 03 respectively over the status quo levels although water consumption increased the optimized water consumption per area reached 6509 m3 ha which was 7 4 and 8 6 lower than that under the status quo and planning scenarios respectively through the optimization of the model the irrigation quota is reduced the water use efficiency was improved and the above results imposed a positive effect on water usage reduction note sgow is the optimal water allocation amount of both surface water and groundwater smo is the value of status quo water minus optimal water pmo is the value of planned water minus optimal water oms is the value of optimal water minus status quo water and omp is the value of optimal water minus planned water 4 2 environmental effect the adjustment of planting structure will affect the nonpoint source pollution emissions of crops the calculation of nonpoint source pollution emissions is inseparable from the determination of the output coefficient of each crop based on the results of the uasweei model the values of the tn and tp output coefficients for rice corn and soybeans were 19 25 and 18 71 kg ha year 33 65 and 5 39 kg ha year and 3 67 and 9 19 kg ha year respectively in each irrigation region the tn and tp output coefficient values for corn in all irrigation regions were lower than the standard values handbook of output and discharge coefficients for planting and animal husbandry in the first national pollution source census the mean values of the tn and tp output coefficients for rice were 9 1 and 1 6 times higher respectively than the standard values and the tn and tp output coefficient values for soybeans were approximately 57 1 and 1 4 times higher respectively than the standard values the reason for these findings was the highly optimized pollutant input into xh yl and other irrigation regions and unreasonable planting structure leads to excessive pollutant output the optimal tn emissions were 17 6 lower than the status quo level but the tp emissions did not differ much from the status quo level in particular the tn emissions of rice decreased by 16 75 while those originating from corn and soybeans decreased by 42 8 and 4 5 respectively a comparison of the status quo and optimization pollution emissions revealed that optimization of the crop area effectively reduced pollutant emissions and enhanced the environmental effect 4 3 objective trade offs the above optimization model considered three conflicting objectives if only the economic benefits were considered the optimal economic benefits of the system reached 11 98 billion yuan which were 65 and 17 higher than those under the status quo and planning scenarios respectively if only the environmental effects were considered the system pollutant emissions reached 9 51 106 kg which were 20 and 44 lower than those under the status quo and planning scenarios respectively if only the resource use efficiency was considered the system irrigation water use efficiency was 1 74 kg m3 an increase in the planned irrigation water use efficiency but the same as the status quo value considering the three objectives simultaneously the optimized economic benefits reached 9 17 billion yuan the pollutant emissions reached 1 36 107 kg and the iwue reached 1 76 kg m3 compared to the status quo and planning scenarios optimization resulted in 26 and 11 increases in economic benefits 14 and 20 increases in pollutant emissions and 2 and 1 increases in irrigation water use efficiency respectively overall the optimization model attained excellent performance in terms of increasing the economic benefits decreasing the environmental pollutant emissions and increasing the irrigation water use efficiency this study provides insight into the trade offs of crop pattern adjustment on the economic environmental and social effects of the system and uses harmony to express the combined effects on system sustainability the model for calculating harmony is presented in the sm the optimized harmony of the model was 0 46 an increase of 28 and 2 compared to that under the status quo and planning scenarios respectively additionally the pollutant emissions per area after optimization were 2 6 and 3 6 lower than those under the status quo and planning scenarios respectively the economic benefits produced per unit of water reached 1 55 yuan m3 an increase of 16 and 18 respectively and the income per area after optimization was 10 078 yuan ha an increase of 7 and 8 respectively the developed model promotes the optimal balance among the conflicting objectives of economy environment resource efficiency this result shows that the gradual increase in economic benefits is positively correlated with the gradual decrease in iwue and pollutant discharge increases with increasing economic benefits however when the economic benefits reach a certain limit the relative growth rate of economic benefits slows down while the increment of pollutant emissions increases with the decrease in environmental effects this shows that when the economic benefits reach a certain threshold the continuous reduction of environmental impact will not produce higher economic benefits with the increase in pollutants discharged into the environment the efficiency of irrigation water increases gradually only slightly and the efficiency of irrigation water varies from 1 7 to 1 8 kg m3 4 4 synergistic regulation of iasws in response to a changing environment factors such as hu te ra pr and eto were inferred via the bn method as shown in fig 9 the results show that hu te eto ru has the strongest influence on runoff and the highest correlation moreover hu ra ru is the second most influential path to runoff the runoff projection results obtained with the bn method are shown in fig 10 the mean value of the actual measured runoff was 5 77 billion m3 and the mean value of the predicted runoff was 5 79 billion m3 with an error smaller than 1 and a nash coefficient of 0 65 the mean value of the measured level water year runoff volume was 4 26 billion m3 and the predicted mean value was 4 55 billion m3 with a nash coefficient of 0 94 the model more accurately predicted the level water year runoff volume and the predictions were more reliable climate change impacts the water supply and demand and therefore the water allocation scenarios as shown in fig 11 compared with the current situation scenario the total water distribution under the rcp4 5 scenario slightly decreased among them the scenario with the largest water allocation is bc1 with an allocated water volume of 5 4 billion m3 the minimum water allocation scenario is the mr3 scenario with an allocated water volume of 5 14 billion m3 the total water allocation amount under the bc1 ccs ip2 and mr3 scenarios decreased by 0 89 2 96 2 20 and 5 57 respectively below the status quo level the total water allocation amount further slightly decreased under the rcp8 5 scenario among them the scenario with the largest water allocation is mr3 with an allocated water volume of 5 55 billion m3 the minimum water allocation scenario is the ccs scenario with an allocated water volume of 5 39 billion m3 the total water allocation amount under the bc1 ccs ip2 and mr3 scenarios was 2 28 0 97 and 1 17 smaller and 1 97 larger respectively than that under the status quo scenario the decrease across the various scenarios was modest with an average decrease of 2 25 the water allocation amount under current conditions can provide guidance for future water allocation schemes 4 5 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sensitivity expresses the effect of the change in a given parameter on the system state variables a parameter was adjusted to increase by 10 of its original value brought into the model and resolved to observe the changes in the remaining parameters and the results for environmental effects combined effects irrigation water use efficiency and economic benefits the variation is the sensitivity of the parameter for sensitivity 0 1 variation was considered to exert a large impact on the system and the parameter was considered a key parameter conversely a small impact was generated and the parameter was considered a relatively insensitive parameter furthermore sensitivity can be positive or negative with positive values indicating that the variable changes in the same direction as the value i e an increase or decrease in the variable leads to an increase or decrease respectively in its value in contrast negative values indicate that the variable changes in the opposite direction to that of the change in value this study analyzed the sensitivity analysis results for the change in each parameter of the objective function as summarized in fig 12 the results revealed that changes in the parameters could impose different effects on the various objective functions the economic benefits were influenced by all factors except τ s u r τ g r o q r and e c o n j a i j and e c o n j were influenced but were largely insensitive to the environmental effects a i j was the most sensitive positive correlation parameter in regard to resource use efficiency and q r was the most sensitive negative correlation parameter a i j i q i j s u r i q i j g r o and τ s u r τ g r o all yielded an effect and were sensitive negative correlation parameters in regard to the combined effect p d i was the most sensitive negative correlation parameter and p j and y i j were the most sensitive positive correlation parameters adjustment of the individual parameters provides a reference for iasw and a suitable basis for further model optimization the model is quantified by various subordinate functions from the perspective of optimism pessimism mixture as shown in table 4 φ is the combined evaluation result of the model larger values for the φ results indicate a better trade off between the three objectives and a better outcome under the linear membership function the best optimistic method results in a value that is 0 261 larger than that obtained with the worst mixed method under the exponential membership function the best optimistic method results in a value that is 0 331 larger than that obtained with the worst pessimistic method under the hyperbolic membership function the best optimistic method yields a value that is 0 05 more optimistic than that obtained with the worst pessimistic method combining the results of these four methods indicates that the optimistic method generates overall better results and the pessimistic method generates overall worse results in terms of the membership functions the linear membership function yields better results overall and the hyperbolic membership function yields the worst results overall moreover there is no notable change in the water use amount between the various methods there is no change in the irrigated area under most methods with the pessimistic and mixed exponential methods increasing the irrigated area by 18 and the optimistic linear method increasing the irrigated area by 2 over the other methods the results obtained in this study can be adopted as a reference by decision makers and this study provides decision makers with a selection direction for the method to be chosen next 5 discussion 5 1 economic benefit objective function coupling equity the economic benefit function coupling resource allocation equity is one of the highlights of this study this function is coupled with the classical economic benefit function with the equity function the key point for the determination of the equity part is based on the efficiency value which is also the connection between the economic benefit part and the equity part see formula 1 the quantification of the efficiency value is determined by an evaluation system based on two level indexes that simultaneously consider the economic social and ecological dimensions and ahp and entropy weight methods were used together to determine the weights of the two level indexes both approaches were chosen because the ahp method is a simple flexible and practical multicriteria decision making method for the quantitative analysis of qualitative problems the entropy weight method has the advantages of strong robustness good monotonicity constant data information and scaling irrelevance which comprehensively and truly reflects the information contained in the index data the combination of the two methods for determining the weights takes into account both subjective and objective views the characteristic for developing such a type of objective function i e coupling with resources allocation equity and net economic benefit is to directly reflect the trade off between economic benefit and resources allocation modes by considering associated influence factors from many dimensions under the status quo for example food production and the associated agricultural output irrigation water efficiency water saving potential natural elements such as effective rainfall and groundwater table that would directly affect groundwater availability each district has different values of these indexes immediately affecting the resource allocation mode and consequently affecting the economic benefit the developed objective function is particularly suitable for large areas with plenty of subregions in this case study we used sanjiang plain irrigation districts including 37 irrigation districts to demonstrate the developed model however decision makers can modify the evaluation indicators and weight determination methods according to actual needs to develop in depth knowledge of the performance of the developed objective function coupling equity the gini coefficient and thiel index were adopted to evaluate the equity of the redistribution of agricultural water and soil resources in different regions based on the results of the uasweei model the gini coefficient and the thiel index are two of the most widely used measures of allocation fairness the gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 with values closer to 0 indicating a higher equity of resource allocation and vice versa a threshold of 0 4 is usually adopted as a warning line a value of the gini coefficient below 0 3 indicates equity close to 0 4 indicates relative equity and above 0 4 suggests inequity a smaller thiel index value typically indicates less variation and a more equitable allocation a value of the thiel index greater than 0 reflects the differences in resource allocation between regions both the gini coefficient and thiel index were chosen to re evaluate the equity of agricultural water and soil allocation because the two indexes have certain complementarity the gini coefficient is particularly sensitive to changes in the middle resource use level while the theil index is obvious to changes in the upper resource use level in this study the gini coefficient under the status quo scenario was 0 47 which indicated a state of inequity and the optimized gini coefficient reached 0 35 improving the state into relative equity the optimized thiel index was 0 27 a 5 reduction in the value of the thiel index in the status quo situation reducing the variability in resource allocation and improving equity 5 2 model uncertainty and sustainability another major innovation in this study was the consideration of model uncertainty from three aspects the first aspect is the uncertainty of the management parameters of the model such as crop prices and irrigation quotas which was determined through ifns with the advantages of characterizing the degree of both membership nonmembership and hesitation or disagreement degrees of decision makers the second aspect is the uncertainty of hydrological parameters i e water supply in this study which is the most sensitive hydrological parameter influencing water and soil resource allocation this kind of uncertainty was quantified based on bns considering the changes in meteorological factors for the advantages of handling uncertainty problems and learning and reasoning under limited incomplete and uncertain information the water supply was reduced by 2 58 when the rainfall was increased by 10 in addition 8 scenarios of climate change were also considered when using bns to learn the changes in water supply under climate change the third uncertainty for the developed model focused on the uncertainty in the model solution process by simultaneously considering the membership function forms exponential hyperbolic linear which is used to transform multiobjective programming into a single objective programming model via the fuzzy method and different decision makers views optimistic mixed pessimistic such work facilitated higher flexibility by quantifying the subjective influence of decision makers on the model solution from an optimistic pessimistic mixed perspective under various membership functions 5 3 sustainability for the allocation of agricultural water and soil resources the developed uasweei model is advantageous for realizing the synergy and trade off between economic benefit resource allocation fairness water use efficiency and nonpoint pollution the harmony model was adopted to evaluate the sustainability degree of the uasweei model this study used a two line average indicator hu et al 2016 to gain insight into the trade off between system economic environmental and resource use efficiency by agricultural soil and water reallocation and the harmony degree was used to express their comprehensive effect on system sustainability the increase in the harmony degree after optimization 28 verified that the optimized model improved the conflicting relationships between different objectives such a result is the comprehensive outcome of the contribution of each objective to the final harmony degree value compared with the status quo although the normalized value one step for calculating the harmony degree of economic benefit decreased by 5 9 the normalized values of the environmental objective and water use efficiency objective increased by 7 46 and 25 1 respectively as compensation leading to the final increase in the harmony degree this study has maximized the reconciliation of the conflicting relationships between economic benefits environmental effects and water use efficiency promoting economic growth and water use efficiency while reducing pollutant emissions the most 6 conclusion this study developed an uncertainty based multiobjective optimization model for the simultaneous allocation of agricultural soil and water resources under multiple uncertainties the model contributes to sustainability realization in agriculture by a innovatively balancing the contradictions between economic benefits environmental effects and irrigation water use efficiency to promote the sustainable development of irrigation districts b coupling with the economic benefits objective function and the allocation process of resources was evaluated from multiple perspectives c validating the obtained results via multiple membership functions from an optimistic pessimistic mixed perspective and d employing the bn method to predict runoff under different scenarios considering multivariate climatic factors which could improve the ability of planting structures to manage climate change an example study and analysis were performed of the 37 irrigation regions in the sanjiang plain heilongjiang province and the main findings in this study include the following 1 the optimized groundwater volume is 49 05 smaller than the planned groundwater volume thus alleviating the current situation of groundwater overexploitation in the sanjiang plain 2 to reduce environmental pollution the best planting trend indicates an increase in the area planted with rice and a decrease in the area planted with corn and soybeans this adjustment in crop patterns leads to a reduction in the output of pollutants and better facilitates environmental protection 3 the gini coefficient value obtained with the economic benefits function considering equity is 0 35 and the value under the status quo scenario is 0 47 improving the water and soil resource use status of the irrigation region from an inequitable state to a relatively equitable state this paper is capable of reflecting the synergy and trade off between equity based economic benefits nonpoint pollution and water use efficiency however some components and processes were not quantified in detail for example the processes of subsurface pollutant infiltration and quantification of the allowable pollutant emissions were not considered in the determination of nonpoint source pollution which is a limitation in the detailed quantification of environmental effects and deserves future work to improve the veracity of the model moreover irrigation water comes from both surface water and groundwater and vice versa in this study we only constrained the surface water use and groundwater use by the restriction of the gross surface water availability and groundwater availability formula 11 and 13 in fact surface water and groundwater have interaction and it may affect the optimal results however we did not consider the interaction between them to simplified the model and this is one of the model s limitation and is the point of our future work decision makers can develop their own site specific applications based on the

9008,population growth and the decreasing amount of available soil and water resources have highlighted the importance of integrated allocation of agricultural soil and water resources iasw an uncertainty based multiobjective optimization model for the simultaneous allocation of agricultural soil and water resources abbreviated as the uasweei model was developed the economic objective of the uasweei model was characterized by an economic benefits function linked with equity comprehensively reflecting economic social and ecological dimensions the environmental objective was to reduce the discharge of agricultural pollutants from carrier areas and soil with an inputoutput model the resource use objective balanced the conflicts between water savings and yield increases through an irrigation water use efficiency function iwue the uasweei model reflected the management uncertainty in iasws through intuitionistic fuzzy numbers ifns and quantified the stochastic uncertainty in the water supply through bayesian networks bns combined with climate change scenarios a fuzzy mathematical method with an optimistic pessimistic mixed view was employed to solve the model the results indicate that 1 the water use structure was adjusted compared with the status quo and the water saving effect was dramatic with the optimized groundwater volume being 49 05 smaller than the planned groundwater volume the optimal iwue is higher than that under the status quo and planning scenarios 2 the model increases the equity of iasw while balancing the economic environmental resource use efficiency as shown by the 25 decrease in the gini coefficient and the 5 decrease in the thiel index value compared with the status quo the study area transitions from a state of inequitable resource allocation to a state of relative equity this study helps promote the sustainable development of irrigation areas from the perspective of the allocation of water and soil resources keywords integrated allocation of agricultural soil and water resources economic environmental resource trade offs equity uncertainty data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the integrated allocation of agricultural soil and water resources iasw can improve the utilization of agricultural soil and water resources and reduce environmental pollution thus enabling sustainability in agriculture grove 2018 iasw aims to achieve social economic and ecological objectives science technology and management tools can be used to rationally allocate the limited amount of soil and water resources for irrigation purposes in a given area during the crop irrigation season to achieve sustainability of soil and water resources wang et al 2012 iasw entails a system optimization problem with a complex structure involving a trade off between multiple parameters and objectives therefore iasw research based on multiobjective planning methods has become a research area of heightened interest wang et al 2011 li et al 2019 ogbolumani and nwulu et al 2021 in the iasw multiobjective model the economic benefits objective is usually the first to be considered xu et al 2020 he et al 2021 economic benefits are often quantified through the link between income and output jyotiba et al 2016 li et al 2022 however there is often a link between social effects and economic benefits and social effects are difficult to quantify the quantification of social effects through equity has been reported in recent years rylski 2021 the higher the equity is the more a higher level of shared satisfaction is promoted among resource owners arguably increasing the incentive to produce and the resultant economic benefits inequitable allocation of water and soil resources can impact economic benefits this occurs because extreme inequity can result in the poor becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer potentially causing a decrease in the motivation of disadvantaged parties and inefficient or ineffective economic production therefore equity coupling in resource allocation with the economic benefit objectives of the iasw model arguably generates a positive effect on increasing the economic benefits of water and soil resource allocation iasw impacts both economic benefits and environmental effects planting requires fertilizers but improper application of fertilizers can result in nonpoint source pollution qian et al 2021 water pollution can occur through rainfall erosion and groundwater transport jiang li et al 2021 y li et al 2021 s li et al 2021 li et al 2022 rational iasw requires economic benefits while effectively reducing agricultural pollutant emissions thus promoting sustainability in agriculture in water scarce areas irrigation water use efficiency is a key element of iasw and efficient water use promotion the iwue is determined as the crop yield per unit of water consumed in the area suryavanshi et al 2021 on the one hand water scarcity impacts food production and food security while on the other hand food production consumes large volumes of water and thus causes water scarcity therefore irrigation water use efficiency is important to balance food production and water consumption a trade off exists among the economic benefits environmental effects and irrigation water use efficiency in iasws i e an increase in one objective can result in a decrease in one or both of the remaining objectives determination of the best option among these three conflicting objectives has increasingly become an important factor in promoting sustainability in agriculture existing models for iasws based on multiobjective planning rarely consider economic benefits while coupling equity or accounting for both environmental effects and irrigation water use efficiency in iasws iasw involves natural and socioeconomic conditions and human activities which leads to multifactorial uncertainty in the study process in the definition of parameters environmental and policy changes result in the lack of clear values for certain parameters and if they are expressed as definite numbers data are often missing e g uncertain future crop prices and irrigation quotas intuitionistic fuzzy numbers ifns can be used in the iasw process to express the uncertainty in these data the multiobjective iasw planning problem is then transformed into a fuzzy planning problem and a fuzzy mathematical method based on membership functions transforms this multiobjective model into a single objective model li et al 2017 however the establishment of single membership functions does not necessarily capture the subjective preferences of decision makers to this end calculation of the joint effect of different membership functions debnath et al 2019 e g linear exponential and hyperbolic membership functions from an optimistic pessimistic mixed perspective garg and gulati 2016 in the ifn based optimization model for iasw is an option to provide greater flexibility in addition iasws are highly sensitive to the water supply ren et al 2021 the main source of the water supply is runoff which can be influenced by rainfall evapotranspiration temperature and other factors existing runoff prediction methods include not only traditional rainfall runoff models but also stochastic analysis li et al 2012 exponential smoothing gao and amp 2019 wavelet analysis alizadeh et al 2021 artificial neural networks lin et al 2019 chaos analysis theory lei et al 2015 and bayesian networks bns zeng et al 2020 the bn method has been applied to consider humidity hu rainfall ra evapotranspiration eto temperature te and pressure pr in the prediction of runoff ru including estimates of uncertainty inclusion of climate change scenarios in the bn reasoning process potentially allows runoff predictions to guide iasws under different scenarios therefore quantification of the uncertainty in the water supply under climate change scenarios through the bn method could guide iasw in summary this study proposes a multiobjective economic environmental irrigation water use efficiency planning model in a changing environment that coordinates iasw namely an uncertainty based multiobjective optimization model for the simultaneous allocation of agricultural soil and water resources to achieve economic environmental irrigation water use efficiency synergy abbreviated as the uasweei model the uasweei model couples an equity based economic model an inputoutput model an irrigation water use efficiency model bns for rainfall runoff modeling under climate change and an optimistic pessimistic mixed view optimization method the uasweei model accomplishes iasw under both hydrological and management uncertainties to achieve trade offs between economic benefits environmental effects and resource use efficiency in response to a changing environment 2 methodology this study developed the uasweei optimization model structure under various climate change scenarios as shown in fig 1 the model structure includes system recognition and parameter determination with the uasweei model considering conflict resolution in agricultural water and soil management through model solutions and outputs note rcp indicates the representative concentration pathway and gcm indicates the climate change scenario model 2 1 uasweei model objective function 2 1 1 equity based economic benefits objective function equity was integrated into the economic benefit function in the form of the efficiency value the efficiency value was quantified by the coordination degree considering aspects of economic social and ecological dimensions we set an evaluation system including two levels of indicators for the economic dimension the indexes included agricultural output per capita output per unit area and food production per cubic meter of water for the social dimension the indexes included irrigation water use coefficient water saving potential and completeness of supporting works and for the ecological dimension the indexes included groundwater availability effective rainfall and net water demand more details for the two level indexes system are listed in table s1 in the supplementary material sm we used an integrated weights method to evaluate the system we used the entropy weight method khodaei et al 2021 to determine the weight of the second level index because the entropy method has advantages over an objective assignment method and it has a certain degree of accuracy then we used the analytic hierarchy process ahp method to determine the weight of the first level index because the ahp method is systematic practical and simple finally we used the coordination degree to couple the weights of the two level indexes the formulas for the ahp entropy and coordination degree methods are presented in the sm the economic benefits function coupling equity is calculated as 1 max e i 1 i j 1 j r i j c i j d

sufficiently small number to ensure that the denominator is not 0 and is the existence of uncertainty in the parameters and the corresponding parameters determined by ifn calculation r i j is determined by both crop prices and yields which is defined as follows 2 r i j p i j y i j a i j where p i j is the price of crop j yuan kg y i j is the yield per area of crop j in district i kg ha and a i j is the planted area of crop j in irrigation district i ha decision variables c i j is the total cost of planting various crops in each irrigation district and w i j is the total cost of surface

functions based on the input output coefficient method environmental effects comprise the second objective function of the uasweei model which relies on a form of input output coefficient function to quantify agricultural nonpoint source pollution emissions khadam and kaluarachchi 2006 the function considers the effects of the flow production factor pf vegetation interception factor vf soil erosion factor sf and soil leaching factor lf on nonpoint source pollution to quantify pollutants more precisely the pollutant output is calculated as follows 6 min m c o n σ c o n i 1 i j 1 j e c o n

of m c o n varies σ c o n exhibits different values for example m t n r m t n i m t p r and m t p i correspond to four different normalization factors i e σ t n r σ t n i σ t p r and σ t p i respectively the pf vf sf and lf involved in the environmental effects function are calculated via the environmental effects impact factor as provided in the sm e c o n j in eq 6 is quantified through mass balance equations and e n j and e p j are expressed as follows 7 e n j g n l i n 1 i n 2 i n 3 j g n 1 j g n 2 g n 3 8 e p j i p 1 g p 1 j g p 2 g p 3 where i n 1 and i p 1 denote the annual

u r i q i j g r o a i j 2 2 uasweei model constraints the objective functions described in section 2 1 require certain constraints in terms of iasw for the various crops in the different regions including surface water groundwater food security soil policy water quality and structural constraints 1 surface water supply constraints the net surface water irrigation in each area occurs within the available surface water and the surface water availability in all areas is lower than that in the total study area with the constraint expressed as 10 j 1 j i q i j s u r a i j τ i s u r s w a i 11 i 1 i s w a i q r where s w a i is the amount of surface water available in irrigation district i m3 q r is the amount of runoff in the area m3 and τ s u r denotes the benefits of surface water use in the irrigation district 2 groundwater supply constraints the net groundwater irrigation water in each area should occur within the groundwater availability and the groundwater availability in all areas should be lower than the groundwater availability in the total study area with the constraint expressed as 12 j 1 j i q i j g r o a i j τ i g r o g w s i 13 i 1 i g w s i χ t g w where g w s i is the amount of groundwater available in irrigation district i m3 τ g r o denotes the benefits of groundwater use in the irrigation district t g w is the total amount of groundwater in the study area m3 and χ is the amount of groundwater used in agricultural irrigation as a percentage of the total groundwater volume 3 food security constraint food production in each irrigation area should meet the food needs of the population with the constraint expressed as 14 j 1 j y i j a i j f i o i j p d i f d where p d i is the population of the irrigation district people f d denotes the food requirements kg person and f i o i j is the difference between the import and export of planting crop j in irrigation district i 4 soil policy constraint there are lower and upper limits to the area to be planted in each irrigation district with the constraint expressed as 15 a i j min a i j a i j max 5 water quality constraint the modeled environmental effects reflect the amount of pollutants partially flowing with surface runoff into carrier areas which should remain below the water environment capacity threshold of the river with the constraint expressed as 16 σ c o n i 1 i j 1 j e c o n j a i j m

capacity of tp m t p 6 nonnegative constraint the decision variable is positive with the constraint expressed as 17 a i j 0 18 i q i j s u r s w a i 0 19 i q i j g r o g w s i 0 2 3 determination of intuitionistic fuzzy numbers ifns parameters in the uasweei model such as p i j y i j δ i j w i s u r and w i g r o are subject to uncertainty because these parameters have multiple information sources it is difficult to identify which source is more accurate for this reason these parameters are quantified by ifn atanassov and stoeva 1986 proposed theory of intuitionistic fuzzy sets ifss based on the fuzzy set theory proposed by zadeh 1965 can effectively reflect such uncertainty moreover ifns can reflect the levels of affiliation nonaffiliation and hesitation li et al 2020 the affiliation degree indicates the probability of giving affirmation to the content in the set the nonaffiliation degree indicates the probability of objecting to the content in the set and the hesitation degree indicates the probability of being unable to judge the content in the set 2 3 1 definition of ifn r is the set of real numbers a k is the ifs in a nonempty set μ a k x x 0 1 membership and v a k x x 0 1 nonmembership are functions an a k x μ a k x v a k x x r x x is said to be an ifn if an ifs satisfies the following conditions i a k is a normal ifn in r ii μ a k x and v a k x are continuous functions in r 0 1 iii a k is a convex ifn in r the ifs algorithm calculates fuzzy numbers as presented in the sm the triangular membership function tmf is a commonly employed ifn and can be expressed as follows singh and yadav 2015 fig 2 μ a k x x 0 1 and v a k x x 0 1 are membership and nonmembership functions respectively a k x μ a k x v a k x x r xεx is considered an ifn if 0 μ a k x 1 and 0 v a k x 1 then a k a l a m a u a l a m a u is an ifn with tmf where the membership and nonmembership functions are defined as 20 μ a k x x a l a m a l a l x a m a u x a u a m a m x a u 0 o t h e r w i s e 21 v a k x a m x a m a l a l x a m x a m a u a m a m x a u 1 o t h e r w i s e moreover the tmf satisfies a l a l a m a u a u 2 3 2 accuracy functions the aim of the accuracy function af is to comprehensively quantify the fuzziness of the ifn the ifn with tmf can be transformed into deterministic parameters by af the larger the af value is the more accurate the portrayal and conversely the less accurate the portrayal the fuzzier the af is which is defined as 22 a f a k 0 α max m e a n a k α l a k α u d α 0 β max m e a n a k β l a k β u d β 2 where α max max x x μ a k x and β max max x x v a k x if a k a l a m a u a l a m a u is a tmf the af is then defined as 23 a k a l a m a u a l a m a u 8 where α max max x x μ a k x and β max max x χ ν a k x if a k a l a m a u a l a m a u is a tmf the af is then defined as 24 a k a l a m a u a l a m a u 8 2 4 model solution based on an optimistic pessimistic mixed view the uasweei model is a model containing ifns such as p i j y i j δ i j w i s u r and w i g r o and in the solution process the ifn is first converted into a deterministic model through af fuzzy mathematical methods li et al 2017 can effectively yield a compromise between the various objectives multiobjective models can be transformed into single objective models through membership functions membership functions can be linear exponential or hyperbolic functions debnath et al 2019 reflecting the optimism pessimism mixture of the decision maker mahajan et al 2020 to reveal the effect of decision maker preference subjectivity aspects on the model solution this study establishes equivalence under different methods from an optimistic pessimistic mixed perspective garg and gulati 2016 after af application through various membership functions as shown in fig 3 thus facilitating higher model flexibility here the maximum case for each type of affiliation function in the optimistic case is adopted as an example and the minimum and maximum instances in the optimistic minimum case under pessimistic and mixed methods are subjected to the optimistic pessimistic mixed method as described in the sm 1 linear membership function with an optimistic view 25 μ z k x φ z max k z min k z min k v z k x φ z max k ε k z min k z max k φ 0 1 ε k 0 k 1 2 k a n d o t h e r c o n s t r a i n t s o n t h e m o d e l where z k x is the objective

on bns the surface water availability in the uasweei model is a very important limiting and sensitive variable that is stochastic in nature the water supply amount provided by river runoff is closely related to various meteorological factors including hu te ra pr and eto which vary with future climate changes jiang li et al 2021 y li et al 2021 s li et al 2021 it is therefore important to explore how iasws change under future climate change conditions the representative concentration pathway rcp model integrates assessment models simple climate models atmospheric chemistry models and global carbon cycle models this study generated 8 climate change scenarios scenario 1 bcc csm1 1 bc1 rcp4 5 scenario 2 bcc csm1 1 bc1 rcp 8 5 scenario 3 ccsm4 ccs rcp4 5 scenario 4 ccsm4 ccs rcp 8 5 scenario

and rcp 8 5 pathways were selected for this study as examples rcp 8 5 was chosen to reflect the worst emissions investigated and represents a co2 concentration that will continue to rise rapidly in contrast rcp 4 5 was selected to evaluate less extreme conditions because it is representative of a lower emission scenario tehrani et al 2021 runoff is inferred and predicted with the bn method considering the impact of future climate change on runoff as described in the sm bayesian networks has a powerful ability to handle uncertainty problems and can learn and reason under limited incomplete and uncertain information moreover it can effectively perform multi source information representation and fusion coupling bayesian networks to multi objective decision models for agricultural soil and water resources allocation can fully reflect and quantify the uncertainty of the water supply in the developed model a bn consists of a network structure g m b and various parameters where m is the set of nodes each corresponding to a stochastic variable and b is the set of directed edges the parameters include the conditional probability distribution of each node reflecting the strength of the probabilistic dependency of a given node on its parents let x m be the stochastic variable of network node m a bn flow chart is shown in fig 4 3 applications 3 1 study area the sanjiang plain has an annual output of 15 million tons of grain and the per capita cultivated land area and per capita grain output are more than four times the national average the scale of agricultural production here is large and the degree of agricultural mechanization ranks first in china this area includes the triangular confluence area of the amur river songhua river and wusuli river as well as the umken river basin muling river basin and xingkai lake plain the actual irrigated area is 2 41 106 ha the three main crops are rice corn and soybean with planting proportions of 52 06 36 36 and 11 57 respectively rice accounts for a large proportion and uses more water but water resources are in short supply the total amount of water resources in the whole region is 1 62 billion m3 including 1 16 billion m3 of surface runoff and 850 million m3 of groundwater resources thirty seven irrigation areas in the sanjiang plain are connected and water is diverted from the amur river and songhua river the main drainage and discharge areas are the amur river the water quality indexes of the main rivers and different river sections in the sanjiang plain show that some water quality indexes of rivers exceed the standard among which tn and tp often exceed the national quality standards the uncertainty of climate change brings great complexity to water distribution considering the water environment therefore the model constructed in this paper is used in a large scale agricultural irrigation area in the sanjiang plain to verify the feasibility of the model on the other hand the allocation results of water and land resources are helpful to improve the agricultural water consumption in the sanjiang plain and alleviate the serious nonpoint source pollution in the sanjiang plain as shown in fig 5 note the irrigation district names are abbreviated as provided in table s1 in the sm 3 2 model parameters and data the uasweei model involves data such as hydrometeorological data socioeconomic data irrigation data river data nonpoint source pollution data and remote sensing data the data sources include the china geospatial data cloud china earth system science data sharing network china meteorological science data sharing service network and heilongjiang province yearbook in table 1 3 2 1 determination of the parameters related to nonpoint source pollution the values for i n 1 and i p 1 in formulas 7 and 8 in section 2 1 2 are 38 5 and 46 2 respectively the dry and wet deposition nitrogen input into farmland g n 2 in formula 7 in section 2 1 2 is 14 6 kg ha year the proportion of the fixed amount of applied fertilizers g p 2 reaches 65 the g n 1 and g p 1 in formulas 7 and 8 in section 2 1 2 values for rice corn and soybeans are 23 and 34 kg ha 25 and 3 11 kg ha and 5 07 and 1 57 kg ha respectively the g n 3 in formula 7 in section 2 1 2 value is 17 49 and the g p 3 in formula 8 in section 2 1 2 value is 3 4 for the parameters and calculation methods in formula 7 and formula 8 refer to the contents of reference chen et al 2021 the results of the tn and tp output coefficients in the 37 irrigation regions are summarized in table s3 in the sm the input output coefficient model considers the four factors of pf vf sf and lf and the calculated mean values of pf vf sf and lf are 3 88 3 01 5 87 and 412 38 t ha h mj mm ha respectively the calculation was based on environmental effect impact factors in sm 3 2 2 water environment capacity the maximum river capacity m c o n r of the amur river is calculated with a one dimensional water quality model zhang and li 2019 we believe that the pollutant mixing rate is quite fast in the study area s discharge bearing rivers both horizontally and vertically and the pollutant concentration is uniform in the cross section this coincides with the calculation conditions of the one dimensional water quality model so we choose the one dimensional water quality model to calculate m c o n r the calculation of the one dimensional water quality model is in the sm as summarized in table 2 3 2 3 runoff projections in this study 47 years from 1969 to 2015 of runoff and meteorological data from the study area were used to learn the data structure of bns based on hu te ra pr and eto using the hill climbing method which is more efficient for data learning blasi et al 2021 the independence between the data are judged by the bias correlation coefficient if the partial coefficient is greater than 0 05 it is independent otherwise it is not independent after checking the independence the unreasonable learning structure is adjusted by artificially deleting unreasonable networks and adding reasonable networks to obtain the final network then the results between the variables are inferred and the function of runoff prediction is obtained as follows r 316 05 h u 181 36 t 0 91 p r 28 58 p 28 28 e 136685 80 3 2 4 irrigation data and socioeconomic parameters the irrigation data mainly include surface and groundwater irrigation quotas for the different crops in each region as detailed in table s4 in the sm the socioeconomic parameters include the price of surface water and groundwater surface and groundwater use efficiency cost of growing the different crops and food requirements as detailed in tables s5 and s6 in the sm the coordination degree d i in the 37 irrigation regions coupled with the economic benefits function is provided in table 3 the maximum efficiency value acceptable to customer α in formula 1 is 0 594 3 2 5 scenarios to better show the superiority of the model this study compares the optimization results of the model with the status quo situation and the planning situation the status quo represents the actual planting situation in the study area planning conditions represent the planning of the planting structure and development of the irrigation area in the future by the managers of the research area according to the development of the research area both data are from the sanjiang plain irrigation district feasibility report 4 results analysis 4 1 water and soil resource allocation the planting structure of the 37 irrigation regions was optimized based on the uasweei model as shown in fig 6 the optimization resulted in a 17 increase in irrigated area compared to the current irrigated area with an 18 increase in the irrigated area planted with rice an 8 decrease in the irrigated area planted with corn and a 14 decrease in the irrigated area planted with soybeans this finding agreed with the overall trend of the planned cropping structure in the three rivers plain with an increase in the paddy field planting area and a decrease in the dry field planting area compared to the planned area the optimization results show that there are spatial differences in the planting situation of rice corn and soybean and not all three crops are planted in every irrigation area for example the bqlln region does not plant corn the planned area refers to the irrigation district s own plan for the future planting area which comes from the irrigation district data the area under rice planting was reduced by 20 with the most notable adjustment in the jx region while the planting areas under corn and soybean were reduced by 70 and 83 respectively the model optimized the areas planted with rice corn and soybeans by weighing the economic environmental resource efficiency relationship notes indicates an increase in the optimized area over the planned status quo area indicates a reduction in the optimized area compared to the planned status quo area as shown in figs 7 and 8 the status quo surface water allocation volume reached 4 17 billion m3 and the groundwater allocation volume amounted to 1 28 billion m3 the planned surface water availability was 5 10 billion m3 and the groundwater allocation quantity reached 2 76 billion m3 the total irrigated area under the planned scenario was 3 2 105 ha larger than that under the status quo scenario and more irrigation water was therefore needed the optimized surface water amount was 45 19 billion m3 and the underground water amount reached 14 04 billion m3 a decrease of 11 37 and 49 05 respectively in the planned amount the optimized groundwater use volume accounted for 24 of the total water volume while the planned groundwater use volume accounted for 35 of the total water volume the model reduced groundwater use and mitigated future groundwater overexploitation in the three rivers plain maximization increased the surface water and groundwater allocation volumes by 8 3 and 10 03 respectively over the status quo levels although water consumption increased the optimized water consumption per area reached 6509 m3 ha which was 7 4 and 8 6 lower than that under the status quo and planning scenarios respectively through the optimization of the model the irrigation quota is reduced the water use efficiency was improved and the above results imposed a positive effect on water usage reduction note sgow is the optimal water allocation amount of both surface water and groundwater smo is the value of status quo water minus optimal water pmo is the value of planned water minus optimal water oms is the value of optimal water minus status quo water and omp is the value of optimal water minus planned water 4 2 environmental effect the adjustment of planting structure will affect the nonpoint source pollution emissions of crops the calculation of nonpoint source pollution emissions is inseparable from the determination of the output coefficient of each crop based on the results of the uasweei model the values of the tn and tp output coefficients for rice corn and soybeans were 19 25 and 18 71 kg ha year 33 65 and 5 39 kg ha year and 3 67 and 9 19 kg ha year respectively in each irrigation region the tn and tp output coefficient values for corn in all irrigation regions were lower than the standard values handbook of output and discharge coefficients for planting and animal husbandry in the first national pollution source census the mean values of the tn and tp output coefficients for rice were 9 1 and 1 6 times higher respectively than the standard values and the tn and tp output coefficient values for soybeans were approximately 57 1 and 1 4 times higher respectively than the standard values the reason for these findings was the highly optimized pollutant input into xh yl and other irrigation regions and unreasonable planting structure leads to excessive pollutant output the optimal tn emissions were 17 6 lower than the status quo level but the tp emissions did not differ much from the status quo level in particular the tn emissions of rice decreased by 16 75 while those originating from corn and soybeans decreased by 42 8 and 4 5 respectively a comparison of the status quo and optimization pollution emissions revealed that optimization of the crop area effectively reduced pollutant emissions and enhanced the environmental effect 4 3 objective trade offs the above optimization model considered three conflicting objectives if only the economic benefits were considered the optimal economic benefits of the system reached 11 98 billion yuan which were 65 and 17 higher than those under the status quo and planning scenarios respectively if only the environmental effects were considered the system pollutant emissions reached 9 51 106 kg which were 20 and 44 lower than those under the status quo and planning scenarios respectively if only the resource use efficiency was considered the system irrigation water use efficiency was 1 74 kg m3 an increase in the planned irrigation water use efficiency but the same as the status quo value considering the three objectives simultaneously the optimized economic benefits reached 9 17 billion yuan the pollutant emissions reached 1 36 107 kg and the iwue reached 1 76 kg m3 compared to the status quo and planning scenarios optimization resulted in 26 and 11 increases in economic benefits 14 and 20 increases in pollutant emissions and 2 and 1 increases in irrigation water use efficiency respectively overall the optimization model attained excellent performance in terms of increasing the economic benefits decreasing the environmental pollutant emissions and increasing the irrigation water use efficiency this study provides insight into the trade offs of crop pattern adjustment on the economic environmental and social effects of the system and uses harmony to express the combined effects on system sustainability the model for calculating harmony is presented in the sm the optimized harmony of the model was 0 46 an increase of 28 and 2 compared to that under the status quo and planning scenarios respectively additionally the pollutant emissions per area after optimization were 2 6 and 3 6 lower than those under the status quo and planning scenarios respectively the economic benefits produced per unit of water reached 1 55 yuan m3 an increase of 16 and 18 respectively and the income per area after optimization was 10 078 yuan ha an increase of 7 and 8 respectively the developed model promotes the optimal balance among the conflicting objectives of economy environment resource efficiency this result shows that the gradual increase in economic benefits is positively correlated with the gradual decrease in iwue and pollutant discharge increases with increasing economic benefits however when the economic benefits reach a certain limit the relative growth rate of economic benefits slows down while the increment of pollutant emissions increases with the decrease in environmental effects this shows that when the economic benefits reach a certain threshold the continuous reduction of environmental impact will not produce higher economic benefits with the increase in pollutants discharged into the environment the efficiency of irrigation water increases gradually only slightly and the efficiency of irrigation water varies from 1 7 to 1 8 kg m3 4 4 synergistic regulation of iasws in response to a changing environment factors such as hu te ra pr and eto were inferred via the bn method as shown in fig 9 the results show that hu te eto ru has the strongest influence on runoff and the highest correlation moreover hu ra ru is the second most influential path to runoff the runoff projection results obtained with the bn method are shown in fig 10 the mean value of the actual measured runoff was 5 77 billion m3 and the mean value of the predicted runoff was 5 79 billion m3 with an error smaller than 1 and a nash coefficient of 0 65 the mean value of the measured level water year runoff volume was 4 26 billion m3 and the predicted mean value was 4 55 billion m3 with a nash coefficient of 0 94 the model more accurately predicted the level water year runoff volume and the predictions were more reliable climate change impacts the water supply and demand and therefore the water allocation scenarios as shown in fig 11 compared with the current situation scenario the total water distribution under the rcp4 5 scenario slightly decreased among them the scenario with the largest water allocation is bc1 with an allocated water volume of 5 4 billion m3 the minimum water allocation scenario is the mr3 scenario with an allocated water volume of 5 14 billion m3 the total water allocation amount under the bc1 ccs ip2 and mr3 scenarios decreased by 0 89 2 96 2 20 and 5 57 respectively below the status quo level the total water allocation amount further slightly decreased under the rcp8 5 scenario among them the scenario with the largest water allocation is mr3 with an allocated water volume of 5 55 billion m3 the minimum water allocation scenario is the ccs scenario with an allocated water volume of 5 39 billion m3 the total water allocation amount under the bc1 ccs ip2 and mr3 scenarios was 2 28 0 97 and 1 17 smaller and 1 97 larger respectively than that under the status quo scenario the decrease across the various scenarios was modest with an average decrease of 2 25 the water allocation amount under current conditions can provide guidance for future water allocation schemes 4 5 sensitivity and uncertainty analysis sensitivity expresses the effect of the change in a given parameter on the system state variables a parameter was adjusted to increase by 10 of its original value brought into the model and resolved to observe the changes in the remaining parameters and the results for environmental effects combined effects irrigation water use efficiency and economic benefits the variation is the sensitivity of the parameter for sensitivity 0 1 variation was considered to exert a large impact on the system and the parameter was considered a key parameter conversely a small impact was generated and the parameter was considered a relatively insensitive parameter furthermore sensitivity can be positive or negative with positive values indicating that the variable changes in the same direction as the value i e an increase or decrease in the variable leads to an increase or decrease respectively in its value in contrast negative values indicate that the variable changes in the opposite direction to that of the change in value this study analyzed the sensitivity analysis results for the change in each parameter of the objective function as summarized in fig 12 the results revealed that changes in the parameters could impose different effects on the various objective functions the economic benefits were influenced by all factors except τ s u r τ g r o q r and e c o n j a i j and e c o n j were influenced but were largely insensitive to the environmental effects a i j was the most sensitive positive correlation parameter in regard to resource use efficiency and q r was the most sensitive negative correlation parameter a i j i q i j s u r i q i j g r o and τ s u r τ g r o all yielded an effect and were sensitive negative correlation parameters in regard to the combined effect p d i was the most sensitive negative correlation parameter and p j and y i j were the most sensitive positive correlation parameters adjustment of the individual parameters provides a reference for iasw and a suitable basis for further model optimization the model is quantified by various subordinate functions from the perspective of optimism pessimism mixture as shown in table 4 φ is the combined evaluation result of the model larger values for the φ results indicate a better trade off between the three objectives and a better outcome under the linear membership function the best optimistic method results in a value that is 0 261 larger than that obtained with the worst mixed method under the exponential membership function the best optimistic method results in a value that is 0 331 larger than that obtained with the worst pessimistic method under the hyperbolic membership function the best optimistic method yields a value that is 0 05 more optimistic than that obtained with the worst pessimistic method combining the results of these four methods indicates that the optimistic method generates overall better results and the pessimistic method generates overall worse results in terms of the membership functions the linear membership function yields better results overall and the hyperbolic membership function yields the worst results overall moreover there is no notable change in the water use amount between the various methods there is no change in the irrigated area under most methods with the pessimistic and mixed exponential methods increasing the irrigated area by 18 and the optimistic linear method increasing the irrigated area by 2 over the other methods the results obtained in this study can be adopted as a reference by decision makers and this study provides decision makers with a selection direction for the method to be chosen next 5 discussion 5 1 economic benefit objective function coupling equity the economic benefit function coupling resource allocation equity is one of the highlights of this study this function is coupled with the classical economic benefit function with the equity function the key point for the determination of the equity part is based on the efficiency value which is also the connection between the economic benefit part and the equity part see formula 1 the quantification of the efficiency value is determined by an evaluation system based on two level indexes that simultaneously consider the economic social and ecological dimensions and ahp and entropy weight methods were used together to determine the weights of the two level indexes both approaches were chosen because the ahp method is a simple flexible and practical multicriteria decision making method for the quantitative analysis of qualitative problems the entropy weight method has the advantages of strong robustness good monotonicity constant data information and scaling irrelevance which comprehensively and truly reflects the information contained in the index data the combination of the two methods for determining the weights takes into account both subjective and objective views the characteristic for developing such a type of objective function i e coupling with resources allocation equity and net economic benefit is to directly reflect the trade off between economic benefit and resources allocation modes by considering associated influence factors from many dimensions under the status quo for example food production and the associated agricultural output irrigation water efficiency water saving potential natural elements such as effective rainfall and groundwater table that would directly affect groundwater availability each district has different values of these indexes immediately affecting the resource allocation mode and consequently affecting the economic benefit the developed objective function is particularly suitable for large areas with plenty of subregions in this case study we used sanjiang plain irrigation districts including 37 irrigation districts to demonstrate the developed model however decision makers can modify the evaluation indicators and weight determination methods according to actual needs to develop in depth knowledge of the performance of the developed objective function coupling equity the gini coefficient and thiel index were adopted to evaluate the equity of the redistribution of agricultural water and soil resources in different regions based on the results of the uasweei model the gini coefficient and the thiel index are two of the most widely used measures of allocation fairness the gini coefficient ranges from 0 to 1 with values closer to 0 indicating a higher equity of resource allocation and vice versa a threshold of 0 4 is usually adopted as a warning line a value of the gini coefficient below 0 3 indicates equity close to 0 4 indicates relative equity and above 0 4 suggests inequity a smaller thiel index value typically indicates less variation and a more equitable allocation a value of the thiel index greater than 0 reflects the differences in resource allocation between regions both the gini coefficient and thiel index were chosen to re evaluate the equity of agricultural water and soil allocation because the two indexes have certain complementarity the gini coefficient is particularly sensitive to changes in the middle resource use level while the theil index is obvious to changes in the upper resource use level in this study the gini coefficient under the status quo scenario was 0 47 which indicated a state of inequity and the optimized gini coefficient reached 0 35 improving the state into relative equity the optimized thiel index was 0 27 a 5 reduction in the value of the thiel index in the status quo situation reducing the variability in resource allocation and improving equity 5 2 model uncertainty and sustainability another major innovation in this study was the consideration of model uncertainty from three aspects the first aspect is the uncertainty of the management parameters of the model such as crop prices and irrigation quotas which was determined through ifns with the advantages of characterizing the degree of both membership nonmembership and hesitation or disagreement degrees of decision makers the second aspect is the uncertainty of hydrological parameters i e water supply in this study which is the most sensitive hydrological parameter influencing water and soil resource allocation this kind of uncertainty was quantified based on bns considering the changes in meteorological factors for the advantages of handling uncertainty problems and learning and reasoning under limited incomplete and uncertain information the water supply was reduced by 2 58 when the rainfall was increased by 10 in addition 8 scenarios of climate change were also considered when using bns to learn the changes in water supply under climate change the third uncertainty for the developed model focused on the uncertainty in the model solution process by simultaneously considering the membership function forms exponential hyperbolic linear which is used to transform multiobjective programming into a single objective programming model via the fuzzy method and different decision makers views optimistic mixed pessimistic such work facilitated higher flexibility by quantifying the subjective influence of decision makers on the model solution from an optimistic pessimistic mixed perspective under various membership functions 5 3 sustainability for the allocation of agricultural water and soil resources the developed uasweei model is advantageous for realizing the synergy and trade off between economic benefit resource allocation fairness water use efficiency and nonpoint pollution the harmony model was adopted to evaluate the sustainability degree of the uasweei model this study used a two line average indicator hu et al 2016 to gain insight into the trade off between system economic environmental and resource use efficiency by agricultural soil and water reallocation and the harmony degree was used to express their comprehensive effect on system sustainability the increase in the harmony degree after optimization 28 verified that the optimized model improved the conflicting relationships between different objectives such a result is the comprehensive outcome of the contribution of each objective to the final harmony degree value compared with the status quo although the normalized value one step for calculating the harmony degree of economic benefit decreased by 5 9 the normalized values of the environmental objective and water use efficiency objective increased by 7 46 and 25 1 respectively as compensation leading to the final increase in the harmony degree this study has maximized the reconciliation of the conflicting relationships between economic benefits environmental effects and water use efficiency promoting economic growth and water use efficiency while reducing pollutant emissions the most 6 conclusion this study developed an uncertainty based multiobjective optimization model for the simultaneous allocation of agricultural soil and water resources under multiple uncertainties the model contributes to sustainability realization in agriculture by a innovatively balancing the contradictions between economic benefits environmental effects and irrigation water use efficiency to promote the sustainable development of irrigation districts b coupling with the economic benefits objective function and the allocation process of resources was evaluated from multiple perspectives c validating the obtained results via multiple membership functions from an optimistic pessimistic mixed perspective and d employing the bn method to predict runoff under different scenarios considering multivariate climatic factors which could improve the ability of planting structures to manage climate change an example study and analysis were performed of the 37 irrigation regions in the sanjiang plain heilongjiang province and the main findings in this study include the following 1 the optimized groundwater volume is 49 05 smaller than the planned groundwater volume thus alleviating the current situation of groundwater overexploitation in the sanjiang plain 2 to reduce environmental pollution the best planting trend indicates an increase in the area planted with rice and a decrease in the area planted with corn and soybeans this adjustment in crop patterns leads to a reduction in the output of pollutants and better facilitates environmental protection 3 the gini coefficient value obtained with the economic benefits function considering equity is 0 35 and the value under the status quo scenario is 0 47 improving the water and soil resource use status of the irrigation region from an inequitable state to a relatively equitable state this paper is capable of reflecting the synergy and trade off between equity based economic benefits nonpoint pollution and water use efficiency however some components and processes were not quantified in detail for example the processes of subsurface pollutant infiltration and quantification of the allowable pollutant emissions were not considered in the determination of nonpoint source pollution which is a limitation in the detailed quantification of environmental effects and deserves future work to improve the veracity of the model moreover irrigation water comes from both surface water and groundwater and vice versa in this study we only constrained the surface water use and groundwater use by the restriction of the gross surface water availability and groundwater availability formula 11 and 13 in fact surface water and groundwater have interaction and it may affect the optimal results however we did not consider the interaction between them to simplified the model and this is one of the model s limitation and is the point of our future work decision makers can develop their own site specific applications based on the

9009,alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd is promulgated as a practice for reducing irrigation water usage in rice production however the implications of awd on soil properties and crop growth remain unclear here we conducted a global meta analysis encompassing 3194 observations from 200 published studies to assess the systemic effects of awd on the aforementioned indices with the explicit aim of identifying approaches for yield improvement in rice the results showed that compared with continuous flooding awd increased water use efficiency by 31 but with an average yield penalty of 6 optimal awd was applied when water potential was maintained at pressures greater than 15 kpa with water depths less than 18 5 cm during rice growing season changes in total organic carbon toc ph and nitrate nitrogen no3 in soil had significant influence on yield these analyses suggested that limiting the effect sizes of toc to less than 0 0003 ph above 0 015 and no3 between 0 02 and 0 30 during awd could increase rice yield by up to 4 yield improvements of 5 7 were obtained when toc and available potassium in background soil greater than 27 83 g kg 1 and 0 18 g kg 1 respectively under water potential greater than 40 kpa mwp nitrogen application in low rates and the addition of straw or biochar under mwp further amplified the beneficial effects of soil c and n increasing yields by 2 3 overall biochemical edaphic factors were primarily responsible for driving rice yield responses to awd it can be suggested that combining management practices with awd can reduce total water input

global hydrological systems harrison 2021 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 pretty 2018 about 70 of global water use was used in agriculture among which rice farming is one of the most water intensive agricultural sectors fao 2017 rice provides 19 of human caloric intake and is a staple food for 3 5 billion human population by 2050 an estimated 50 60 increase in global rice production and a 15 increase in water withdrawals are required to feed the growing global population childs and raszap skorbiansky 2017 godfray et al 2010 the world bank 2017 specifically a major concern is how changes in water availability may conflict with projected irrigation requirements for closing yield gaps mueller et al 2012 muleke et al 2022 in the past various water saving irrigation methods have been practiced alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd was first piloted and disseminated in the 1980s jha and chandra 1981 and has been widely developed for rice production in asia liu et al 2021 lu et al 2000 surendran et al 2021 in awd system irrigation water is applied to flood the field for a few days after the disappearance of ponded water and the reflooded timing depends on the paddy water level falling to a predetermined depth or water potential xu et al 2020a yang and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2021 awd has shown potential in reducing average irrigation water use by 23 carrijo et al 2017 and minimizing environmental risk in particular reducing average methane emissions by 54 and global warming potential by 56 respectively bo et al 2022 gangopadhyay et al 2022 however the impacts of awd on yield are controversial in some cases being positive chen et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 others negligible hao et al 2022 wang et al 2020 and in other cases negative sriphirom et al 2019 certainly a comprehensive understanding of the impact of awd on soil biology and plant traits is yet unclear linquist et al 2015 wen et al 2021 yang and zhang 2010 such uncertainty can be attributed to extensive variability and complexity associated with three major factors liang 2022 qiao et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the first is the inconsistency of the awd practice attributed to the subjective nature with which awd is implemented including the water potential level and the experimental duration of the drying wetting cycle thakur et al 2018 the second involves existing background soil properties and their influence on awd sandhya and prakash 2019 the third is agricultural practices in different regions which ultimately reflect policy economy climate etc li et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 as we know awd changes the content and stability of soil nutrients i e carbon nitrogen phosphorus and potassium livsey et al 2019 regulates the above and below ground growth of rice atere et al 2017 veresoglou et al 2022 zhang et al 2010 and thereby affects the biological processes in paddy ecosystems hence novel sustainable integrated management practices are urgently needed to deliver consistent and multiple benefits without yield detriment or long term soil health problems to date several meta analyses that focused on elucidating singular effects of awd for example soil physical properties extent of soil drying and the differences between the water thresholds of continuously ﬂooded and awd have been reported table s1 bo et al 2022 carrijo et al 2017 cheng et al 2022 he et al 2020 however interactions caused by awd within the plant soil biosphere have received less attention such that many knowledge gaps remain this particularly includes effects caused by soil water potential wp awd the depth that irrigation water is allowed to drop below the soil surface or the site of water potential measurement sd awd and the experimental duration of the drying wetting cycle during the growing season ed awd although some studies have examined the effects of soil properties or agricultural practices on awd performance the quantitative changes in soil properties per se caused by awd are yet to be examined there exists a dearth of information linking the changes in soil traits with yield which calls for a systematic and quantitative approach to identify the effects of key drivers of awd practice on rice growth and emergent properties harrison et al 2012a 2012b herein we thus focus on a comprehensive synthesis and reconcile past results pertaining to optimal strategies for increasing yield and water use efficiency wue on a global scale the main objectives were to 1 evaluate the performance of awd in terms of impact on yield and wue 2 quantify awd induced changes in edaphic factors influencing yield and wue in paddy fields and 3 develop integrated strategies for reducing the penalty of yield and long term soil health or achieving the expected yield increase when implementing awd our analysis allows an examination of concurrent responses of awd to soil biological properties and agricultural practices providing quantitative information on decisions that sustainably improve yield while minimizing water use in rice production 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection a literature review was conducted through academic resource search platforms web of science http accesss webofknowledge com and china national knowledge infrastructure http www cnki net from 2000 to 2022 taking alternate wetting and drying or awd or irrigation and rice or paddy as keywords the following criteria were used to standardize the dataset 1 experiments yielded paired data of variables under continuous flooding cf and awd a mandatory requirement for the meta analysis 2 each independent study contained at least one variable 3 response variables collected for each independent study had to be derived from experiments on the same spatiotemporal scales this process was performed following prisma guidelines fig s1 moher et al 2010 data underpinning response variables extracted from the cf and awd treatments included yield wue aboveground biomass photosynthetic rate leaf area index lai tiller root biomass root oxidation activity soil total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc microbial biomass carbon mbc total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 ammonium nitrogen nh4 soil ph soil available potassium ak soil available phosphorus ap and urease sucrase phosphatase and catalase to confirm awd effects across publications the data of soil traits were measured mainly at the stages of flowering grain filling and harvesting to control for the heterogeneity of soil data across soil depths and studies only topsoil 0 20 cm data was collected wue was defined as the amount of yield per unit of total water input rainfall plus irrigation during the growing season which was extracted directly from the literature we compiled information on awd patterns background soil physical and biological properties and agricultural practices as explanatory variables awd patterns were assumed to consist of wp awd sd awd and ed awd background soil properties including ph toc tn ak ap and agricultural practice including n forms n rates p rates soil amendments and planting seasons were also collected we assumed that soil

conclusions drawn regarding the estimated effect sizes of awd were determined to be robust and reliable table s2 kenward roger s method was adopted to test whether awd treatments significantly affected lnr results were significant if the 95 cis of lnr did not overlap with zero lnr of response variables to awd among the different classifications was compared by the heterogeneity test a statistic based on a chi squared test q m is heterogeneity in effect sizes among categories of individual explanatory variables and a p value of q m smaller than 0 05 represents signiﬁcant heterogeneity based on multiple linear regression the relaimpo package was used to calculate the contribution of each independent variable in the constructed regression model to r 2 representing the weight of the independent variable to the total variance of the response variable by variance decomposition and to quantitatively analyse the relative importance of awd pattern groemping 2006 a weighted random forest analysis rf was carried out to identify the relative importance of edaphic factors on yield response to awd using randomforest package in r the rf model averages over multiple regression trees to handle highly collinear predictors by spreading the importance of a variable across all variables the importance of edaphic factors was estimated using an increase in the node purity of the variables measured by the sum of the squares of residuals and higher node purity values implied a more important variable han and zhu 2020 all statistical analyses were performed in r 4

positive changes in yield were observed as 1 95 ci 0 2 2 with n input rates of 200 250 n kg ha 1 n4 while negative changes in yield were observed as 10 95 ci 17 3 and 5 95 ci 7 2 with n input rates of 100 150 kg n ha 1 n2 and 150 200 kg n ha 1 n3 respectively fig 6a compared with the effect size of 6 95 ci 11 1 of inorganic n fertilizer awd along with n fertilizer mixed of inorganic organic and controlled release n resulted in marginally positive responses of yield by 12 95 ci 6 29 and 8 95 ci 4 21 respectively fig 6a effect sizes of p treatments were around zero fig 6a when awd was combined with soil amendments such as zeolite biochar straw and zinc yield was increased by 8 95 ci 1 15 11 95 ci 1 23 10 95 ci 4 16 and 9 95 ci 2 16 respectively fig 6a we found no significant differences in yield response to planting seasons q m 0 09 p 0 827 fig 6a the heterogeneity test showed that agricultural practices did not have significant effects on wue but significantly influenced yield responses under differing wp awd levels fig 6 under lwp lnr of yield substantially improved with alternative agricultural practices except for dry season planting which resulted in reduced yield this improved effect was impaired when wp awd was dropped to mwp and swp while marginally or significantly positive yield responses were observed only with low n application rates and amendments of straw or biochar under mwp n1 3 straw 2 biochar 2 fig 6a 4 discussion 4 1 effects of awd on water use efficiency and yield awd a water saving irrigation technology has been widely used in many rice producing countries and regions fig 1 overall this study demonstrated that implementation of awd increased wue by 31 while accompanied by a decrease of 6 in grain yield compared with cf fig 2 within the range of increase in wue 24 34 but out of the range of reduction in yield 3 5 reported by previous meta analyses table s1 based on 3194 observations the present meta analysis for the first time statistically analysed the changes in rice growth grain yield and edaphic properties to comprehensively understand how awd impacted on soil and ensuing implication for crop growth it is obviously that lower wp awd reduced water consumption however awd impacts on rice growth were closely related to changes in wp awd table s3 thakur et al 2018 under severe water deficit mwp and swp photosynthetic rate tiller number root oxidation activity and biomass accumulation of plants decreased fig s5 contrarily soil nutrients were improved and in favour of plant growth hence no loss in rice yield was observed under lwp figs 3 and 5 fig s5 table s3 yang and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2010 our results therefore suggest that to achieve the win win goal in yield and water savings with awd the most important factor wp awd influencing rice yield should be maintained at levels greater than 15 kpa fig 3 maintenance of such water potential enabled wue increased up to 24 with concurrently yield improvements of 0 6 fig 3b fig s3 besides wp awd optimizing sd awd to less than 18 5 cm under lwp improved yields and wue by 1 and 23 respectively fig s7 previous meta analyses have shown that the ratio of the number of days without standing water to the total days of growing period ufr was a key driver of water use with yield losses more likely to occur at larger ufr bo et al 2022 in contrast we reported a positive effect of awd on yield at any ed awd under lwp fig 3 further underscoring the importance of wp awd in mediating grain yield overall our findings highlight the quantitative interaction between awd elements enabling water use reduction without compromising yield 4 2 soil properties influence yield responses to awd 4 2 1 background soil properties regulating effects of awd on yield soil properties include toc and other nutrient contents such as n p and k and soil ph which substantially affect rice growth and grain yield atere et al 2017 kopittke et al 2022 and contribute to the impact of awd fig 4 we found that lnr of yield was positively correlated with toc tn ap and ak and awd reduced yield only in soil condition below the threshold values fig 4 suggesting that negative effects of awd on yield may be mitigated with suitable nutrient conditions fig 4 table s4 bo et al 2022 wu et al 2017 yang et al 2004 organic c can provide a large amount of substrate for soil microbial growth kopittke et al 2022 and alter soil structure such as by formation of aggregates audette et al 2021 together these factors increase water holding capacity at the drained upper limit increasing plant available water bo et al 2022 rawls et al 2003 in addition soil nutrients including tn ap and ak play an important role in rice growth sirisuntornlak et al 2020 xu et al 2020a soil health yang et al 2022 as well as toc sequestration table s4 kopittke et al 2022 hence toc dominated awd effect on rice yield could be explained via promotion of n mineralization and availability during aerobic periods of awd akter et al 2018 xu et al 2020c further the effects of awd on yield were influenced by the interaction of wp awd and soil properties yield responses under mwp went from a 12 reduction to a 5 7 increase when background soil toc 27 83 g kg 1 and ak 0 18 g kg 1 figs 3b and 4 consequently our results reveal an achievable path for integrating mwp in nutrient rich background soils toc 27 83 g kg 1 and ak 0 18 g kg 1 allowing synergistic irrigation water reduction while maintaining rice yield levels 4 2 2 responses of soil properties to awd frequent changes in the drying wetting regime alter the content and stability of plant available nutrients and aerobic anaerobic conditions in paddy fields which in turn have implications for plant growth mariotte et al 2018 veresoglou et al 2022 generally awd may influence grain yield in two ways from the aspect of plants awd had strongly negative consequence on lai as a result although the photosynthetic rate was slightly increased it still caused a significant reduction in aboveground biomass fig 2 fig s8 table s3 previous studies have shown that root oxidation activity during aerobic periods of awd could delay root senescence and increase nutrient uptake zhang et al 2021 2022 however enhanced root oxidation activity can t compensate for the loss of tiller number and aboveground biomass ultimately resulting in lower yield fig 2 from the aspect of soils first reduced water supply from paddies has detrimental implications for lai photosynthetic rate and aboveground biomass accumulation resulting in accelerated rice senescence and increased litter input into the soil audette et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 or promoted root deposition atere et al 2017 together these factors are known to increase toc henry et al 2022 our data showed that lnr of toc had the greatest influence on lnr of yield with increasing lnr of toc reducing lnr of yield fig 5 lnr of yield was negative when lnr of toc 0 0003 fig 5b these results indicate that large increases in soil toc can impair plant growth and optimizing awd implementation can slow the increase in soil toc and improve yield by enhancing assimilate remobilization and accelerating the grain filling rate fig 5 fig s9 table s3 yang and zhang 2010 second soil drying wetting cycles can result in fluctuating soil redox potential thus affecting various soil oxidoreductase activities brzezińska et al 1998 li et al 2018 key processes include nitrification and denitrification which are known to be important for nitrogen assimilation and or immobilization liu et al 2023 under awd tn and no3 increased however nh4 was not significantly impacted fig 5 it can be known that nh4 is the main n form assimilated by rice plants duan et al 2007 li et al 2022 and no3 is not adsorbed by soil and usually more susceptible to leaching amin et al 2021 both regression and rf analysis showed that yield could gain a desirable increase of 4 by keeping lnr of no3 between 0 02 and 0 30 fig 5 fig s9 third the slight reduction in lnr of ph positively correlated with yield mainly due to the availability of primary nutrients and trace elements ding et al 2019 malik et al 2018 fig 5 however soil acidification with decreased ph might inhibit plant growth peng et al 2011 in some cases even a minor change in ph may weaken soil enzyme activity and disturb the habitat of soil microbes affecting the functionality of plant soil ecosystems fig s10 ji et al 2022 changes in ph should thus be greater than 0 015 to increase yield by at least 3 fig 5 fig s9 alternatively holding an appropriate background ph was also beneficial to buffer soil acidification and provided a suitable environment for the growth of rice and soil microbes fig 4e table s4 to achieve the ternary effect of awd on yield wue and soil sustainability our meta analysis results point towards monitoring of the three drivers lnrs of toc no3 and ph during awd in practice once lnr of toc 0 0003 lnr of no3 0 30 and lnr of ph 0 015 the wp awd level should be increased to avoid potential yield penalties consequently diagnosing and maintaining the effect size within the threshold range is desirable and could generate satisfactory outcomes both in yields and water savings 4 3 agricultural practices positively modify yield responses to awd detrimental effects of awd on yield can be reduced when awd was implemented with agricultural practices fig 6 bo et al 2022 such as n application n form and n rate soil amendments of straw zinc biochar and zeolite fig 6 optimized water and fertilizer scenarios are beneficial to increase rhizosphere microbes and enzyme activity thus balancing the n and c cycling and creating a suitable nutrient supply for plant uptake cao et al 2021 xu et al 2020c awd implementation under lwp combined with beneficial agricultural practices could increase yield by up to 18 fig 6a when awd was implemented with more severe water saving approaches under mwp and swp fig 3b yield decreased by 12 and 18 respectively remarkably yield and wue could be increased by 2 3 and 43 52 respectively when combing n application in low rates and amendments of straw and biochar under mwp fig 6a therefore the interactive effects of water and n provide the opportunity for sustainable development of rice production with low water and n fertilizer inputs the present study highlights lnrs of toc no3 and ph as dominant indicators for real time monitoring soil changes under awd fig 5 table s5 when organic n was added to replace inorganic n lnr of toc significantly changed by 0 053 a quantum that was lower than lnr of toc threshold of 0 0003 soil amendments are an effective method for weakening the adverse impact of water stress on plants by improving soil physical properties chen et al 2021 zheng et al 2018 or water holding capacity he et al 2015 yang et al 2005 biochar amendment reduced lnrs of toc and ph by 0 047 and 0 013 respectively and straw amendment increased lnr of no3 by 0 153 in mwp table s5 trends in these driving indicators consistently improved yield fig 5 fig s9 together combining awd with agricultural practices was beneficial to soil conditions inducing considerable improvement in rice yields 1 12 and wue up to 65 fig 6 5 conclusions our extensive meta analysis revealed that awd significantly improved wue by 31 with a yield penalty of 6 moreover according to our results three managements can be recommended for sustainably reducing water use and maintaining or increasing yields 1 ensuring that wp awd is maintained at levels greater than 15 kpa and sd awd less than 18 5 cm 2 real time adjustment of wp awd through monitoring of the soils particularly for the changes in toc 0 0003 ph 0 015 and nitrate nitrogen between 0 02 and 0 30 3 for greater water saving wp awd could be reduced to 40 kpa by modulating background soil toc 27 83 g kg 1 and ak 0 18 g kg 1 or coupling with n application in low rates and addition of straw or biochar fig 7 to this end emergent practices of rice should consider not just yield and water use but other co benefits and trade offs for production farmer prosperity and the environment awd will be a vital part of advancement in water savings productivity and soil health despite limitations in the available literature regarding interactions between soil biology agricultural practices and awd we developed integrated strategies for reducing yield penalty and or improving yields via awd our findings emphasize the importance of exploring the interactive effects of multiple variables to understand changes in paddy ecosystems including rice growth interactions with soil c and n cycling future studies should focus on the long term integrated implications of awd particularly awd effects on soil biology nutrient and microbiome using multifactorial experiments to develop practical adoption pathways for achieving multiple sustainable agricultural goals

9009,alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd is promulgated as a practice for reducing irrigation water usage in rice production however the implications of awd on soil properties and crop growth remain unclear here we conducted a global meta analysis encompassing 3194 observations from 200 published studies to assess the systemic effects of awd on the aforementioned indices with the explicit aim of identifying approaches for yield improvement in rice the results showed that compared with continuous flooding awd increased water use efficiency by 31 but with an average yield penalty of 6 optimal awd was applied when water potential was maintained at pressures greater than 15 kpa with water depths less than 18 5 cm during rice growing season changes in total organic carbon toc ph and nitrate nitrogen no3 in soil had significant influence on yield these analyses suggested that limiting the effect sizes of toc to less than 0 0003 ph above 0 015 and no3 between 0 02 and 0 30 during awd could increase rice yield by up to 4 yield improvements of 5 7 were obtained when toc and available potassium in background soil greater than 27 83 g kg 1 and 0 18 g kg 1 respectively under water potential greater than 40 kpa mwp nitrogen application in low rates and the addition of straw or biochar under mwp further amplified the beneficial effects of soil c and n increasing yields by 2 3 overall biochemical edaphic factors were primarily responsible for driving rice yield responses to awd it can be suggested that combining management practices with awd can reduce total water input

global hydrological systems harrison 2021 mekonnen and hoekstra 2016 pretty 2018 about 70 of global water use was used in agriculture among which rice farming is one of the most water intensive agricultural sectors fao 2017 rice provides 19 of human caloric intake and is a staple food for 3 5 billion human population by 2050 an estimated 50 60 increase in global rice production and a 15 increase in water withdrawals are required to feed the growing global population childs and raszap skorbiansky 2017 godfray et al 2010 the world bank 2017 specifically a major concern is how changes in water availability may conflict with projected irrigation requirements for closing yield gaps mueller et al 2012 muleke et al 2022 in the past various water saving irrigation methods have been practiced alternate wetting and drying irrigation awd was first piloted and disseminated in the 1980s jha and chandra 1981 and has been widely developed for rice production in asia liu et al 2021 lu et al 2000 surendran et al 2021 in awd system irrigation water is applied to flood the field for a few days after the disappearance of ponded water and the reflooded timing depends on the paddy water level falling to a predetermined depth or water potential xu et al 2020a yang and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2021 awd has shown potential in reducing average irrigation water use by 23 carrijo et al 2017 and minimizing environmental risk in particular reducing average methane emissions by 54 and global warming potential by 56 respectively bo et al 2022 gangopadhyay et al 2022 however the impacts of awd on yield are controversial in some cases being positive chen et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 others negligible hao et al 2022 wang et al 2020 and in other cases negative sriphirom et al 2019 certainly a comprehensive understanding of the impact of awd on soil biology and plant traits is yet unclear linquist et al 2015 wen et al 2021 yang and zhang 2010 such uncertainty can be attributed to extensive variability and complexity associated with three major factors liang 2022 qiao et al 2022 zhang et al 2021 the first is the inconsistency of the awd practice attributed to the subjective nature with which awd is implemented including the water potential level and the experimental duration of the drying wetting cycle thakur et al 2018 the second involves existing background soil properties and their influence on awd sandhya and prakash 2019 the third is agricultural practices in different regions which ultimately reflect policy economy climate etc li et al 2020 zhao et al 2018 as we know awd changes the content and stability of soil nutrients i e carbon nitrogen phosphorus and potassium livsey et al 2019 regulates the above and below ground growth of rice atere et al 2017 veresoglou et al 2022 zhang et al 2010 and thereby affects the biological processes in paddy ecosystems hence novel sustainable integrated management practices are urgently needed to deliver consistent and multiple benefits without yield detriment or long term soil health problems to date several meta analyses that focused on elucidating singular effects of awd for example soil physical properties extent of soil drying and the differences between the water thresholds of continuously ﬂooded and awd have been reported table s1 bo et al 2022 carrijo et al 2017 cheng et al 2022 he et al 2020 however interactions caused by awd within the plant soil biosphere have received less attention such that many knowledge gaps remain this particularly includes effects caused by soil water potential wp awd the depth that irrigation water is allowed to drop below the soil surface or the site of water potential measurement sd awd and the experimental duration of the drying wetting cycle during the growing season ed awd although some studies have examined the effects of soil properties or agricultural practices on awd performance the quantitative changes in soil properties per se caused by awd are yet to be examined there exists a dearth of information linking the changes in soil traits with yield which calls for a systematic and quantitative approach to identify the effects of key drivers of awd practice on rice growth and emergent properties harrison et al 2012a 2012b herein we thus focus on a comprehensive synthesis and reconcile past results pertaining to optimal strategies for increasing yield and water use efficiency wue on a global scale the main objectives were to 1 evaluate the performance of awd in terms of impact on yield and wue 2 quantify awd induced changes in edaphic factors influencing yield and wue in paddy fields and 3 develop integrated strategies for reducing the penalty of yield and long term soil health or achieving the expected yield increase when implementing awd our analysis allows an examination of concurrent responses of awd to soil biological properties and agricultural practices providing quantitative information on decisions that sustainably improve yield while minimizing water use in rice production 2 materials and methods 2 1 data collection a literature review was conducted through academic resource search platforms web of science http accesss webofknowledge com and china national knowledge infrastructure http www cnki net from 2000 to 2022 taking alternate wetting and drying or awd or irrigation and rice or paddy as keywords the following criteria were used to standardize the dataset 1 experiments yielded paired data of variables under continuous flooding cf and awd a mandatory requirement for the meta analysis 2 each independent study contained at least one variable 3 response variables collected for each independent study had to be derived from experiments on the same spatiotemporal scales this process was performed following prisma guidelines fig s1 moher et al 2010 data underpinning response variables extracted from the cf and awd treatments included yield wue aboveground biomass photosynthetic rate leaf area index lai tiller root biomass root oxidation activity soil total organic carbon toc dissolved organic carbon doc microbial biomass carbon mbc total nitrogen tn nitrate nitrogen no3 ammonium nitrogen nh4 soil ph soil available potassium ak soil available phosphorus ap and urease sucrase phosphatase and catalase to confirm awd effects across publications the data of soil traits were measured mainly at the stages of flowering grain filling and harvesting to control for the heterogeneity of soil data across soil depths and studies only topsoil 0 20 cm data was collected wue was defined as the amount of yield per unit of total water input rainfall plus irrigation during the growing season which was extracted directly from the literature we compiled information on awd patterns background soil physical and biological properties and agricultural practices as explanatory variables awd patterns were assumed to consist of wp awd sd awd and ed awd background soil properties including ph toc tn ak ap and agricultural practice including n forms n rates p rates soil amendments and planting seasons were also collected we assumed that soil

digitizer 2 26 software following the above guidelines 3194 observations from 200 published studies were obtained including 149 sites with latitude ranging from 33 23 s to 54 05 n and longitude from

extreme weights were generated using variance based weighting van groenigen et al 2011 following eq 2 2 wr nt nc nt nc where wr is the weight associated with each observation nt and nc are the numbers

classification several awd explanatory variables were classified including background soil properties and agricultural practices water potential levels were classified based on the x intercept value of linear regression analysis and the irrigation treatment designs of most published studies chen and chen 2021 agricultural practices included n rates n forms p treatments planting seasons and soil

effect if the fail safe number is greater than 5 n 10 n number of observations feng and zhu 2021 according to the above analysis there was no publication bias with regard to awd effects and the conclusions drawn regarding the estimated effect sizes of awd were determined to be robust and reliable table s2 kenward roger s method was adopted to test whether awd treatments significantly affected lnr results were significant if the 95 cis of lnr did not overlap with zero lnr of response variables to awd among the different classifications was compared by the heterogeneity test a statistic based on a chi squared test q m is heterogeneity in effect sizes among categories of individual explanatory variables and a p value of q m smaller than 0 05 represents signiﬁcant heterogeneity based on multiple linear regression the relaimpo package was used to calculate the contribution of each independent variable in the constructed regression model to r 2 representing the weight of the independent variable to the total variance of the response variable by variance decomposition and to quantitatively analyse the relative importance of awd pattern groemping 2006 a weighted random forest analysis rf was carried out to identify the relative importance of edaphic factors on yield response to awd using randomforest package in r the rf model averages over multiple regression trees to handle highly collinear predictors by spreading the importance of a variable across all variables the importance of edaphic factors was estimated using an increase in the node purity of the variables measured by the sum of the squares of residuals and higher node purity values implied a more important variable han and zhu 2020 all statistical analyses were performed in r 4

effects of awd on yield depended on background soil properties including toc tn ap ak and ph across wp awd according to the regression analysis lnr of yield was significantly and positively correlated with lnrs of toc tn ap and ak in background soil fig 4a d however a negative correlation was found between lnr of yield and background soil ph fig 4e awd effects on yield shifted from negative to positive with increasing background soil toc tn ap and ak at the threshold values of toc 29 95 g kg 1 tn 2 39 g kg 1 ap 0 043 g kg 1 and ak 0 16 g kg 1 respectively fig 4a d and shifted from positive

downwards convex relationship with lnr of yield being largest when lnr of no3 was approximately 0 16 fig 5j no significant correlations between yield and soil enzymes were observed p 0 05 fig s6 according to rf lnr of toc had the greatest influence on lnr of yield which accounted for 0 19 of its variable importance followed by ph 0 16 and no3 0 08 the results suggest that these three indices could act as the driving indicators underpinning effect of awd on yield fig 5k 3 4 response of yield to awd as affected by agricultural practices across studies 718 observations were conducted on the effects of awd incorporating agricultural practices on yield such as n application zeolite biochar straw p zinc and planting season fig 6a n application rates had differential impacts on yield fig 6a positive changes in yield were observed as 1 95 ci 0 2 2 with n input rates of 200 250 n kg ha 1 n4 while negative changes in yield were observed as 10 95 ci 17 3 and 5 95 ci 7 2 with n input rates of 100 150 kg n ha 1 n2 and 150 200 kg n ha 1 n3 respectively fig 6a compared with the effect size of 6 95 ci 11 1 of inorganic n fertilizer awd along with n fertilizer mixed of inorganic organic and controlled release n resulted in marginally positive responses of yield by 12 95 ci 6 29 and 8 95 ci 4 21 respectively fig 6a effect sizes of p treatments were around zero fig 6a when awd was combined with soil amendments such as zeolite biochar straw and zinc yield was increased by 8 95 ci 1 15 11 95 ci 1 23 10 95 ci 4 16 and 9 95 ci 2 16 respectively fig 6a we found no significant differences in yield response to planting seasons q m 0 09 p 0 827 fig 6a the heterogeneity test showed that agricultural practices did not have significant effects on wue but significantly influenced yield responses under differing wp awd levels fig 6 under lwp lnr of yield substantially improved with alternative agricultural practices except for dry season planting which resulted in reduced yield this improved effect was impaired when wp awd was dropped to mwp and swp while marginally or significantly positive yield responses were observed only with low n application rates and amendments of straw or biochar under mwp n1 3 straw 2 biochar 2 fig 6a 4 discussion 4 1 effects of awd on water use efficiency and yield awd a water saving irrigation technology has been widely used in many rice producing countries and regions fig 1 overall this study demonstrated that implementation of awd increased wue by 31 while accompanied by a decrease of 6 in grain yield compared with cf fig 2 within the range of increase in wue 24 34 but out of the range of reduction in yield 3 5 reported by previous meta analyses table s1 based on 3194 observations the present meta analysis for the first time statistically analysed the changes in rice growth grain yield and edaphic properties to comprehensively understand how awd impacted on soil and ensuing implication for crop growth it is obviously that lower wp awd reduced water consumption however awd impacts on rice growth were closely related to changes in wp awd table s3 thakur et al 2018 under severe water deficit mwp and swp photosynthetic rate tiller number root oxidation activity and biomass accumulation of plants decreased fig s5 contrarily soil nutrients were improved and in favour of plant growth hence no loss in rice yield was observed under lwp figs 3 and 5 fig s5 table s3 yang and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2010 our results therefore suggest that to achieve the win win goal in yield and water savings with awd the most important factor wp awd influencing rice yield should be maintained at levels greater than 15 kpa fig 3 maintenance of such water potential enabled wue increased up to 24 with concurrently yield improvements of 0 6 fig 3b fig s3 besides wp awd optimizing sd awd to less than 18 5 cm under lwp improved yields and wue by 1 and 23 respectively fig s7 previous meta analyses have shown that the ratio of the number of days without standing water to the total days of growing period ufr was a key driver of water use with yield losses more likely to occur at larger ufr bo et al 2022 in contrast we reported a positive effect of awd on yield at any ed awd under lwp fig 3 further underscoring the importance of wp awd in mediating grain yield overall our findings highlight the quantitative interaction between awd elements enabling water use reduction without compromising yield 4 2 soil properties influence yield responses to awd 4 2 1 background soil properties regulating effects of awd on yield soil properties include toc and other nutrient contents such as n p and k and soil ph which substantially affect rice growth and grain yield atere et al 2017 kopittke et al 2022 and contribute to the impact of awd fig 4 we found that lnr of yield was positively correlated with toc tn ap and ak and awd reduced yield only in soil condition below the threshold values fig 4 suggesting that negative effects of awd on yield may be mitigated with suitable nutrient conditions fig 4 table s4 bo et al 2022 wu et al 2017 yang et al 2004 organic c can provide a large amount of substrate for soil microbial growth kopittke et al 2022 and alter soil structure such as by formation of aggregates audette et al 2021 together these factors increase water holding capacity at the drained upper limit increasing plant available water bo et al 2022 rawls et al 2003 in addition soil nutrients including tn ap and ak play an important role in rice growth sirisuntornlak et al 2020 xu et al 2020a soil health yang et al 2022 as well as toc sequestration table s4 kopittke et al 2022 hence toc dominated awd effect on rice yield could be explained via promotion of n mineralization and availability during aerobic periods of awd akter et al 2018 xu et al 2020c further the effects of awd on yield were influenced by the interaction of wp awd and soil properties yield responses under mwp went from a 12 reduction to a 5 7 increase when background soil toc 27 83 g kg 1 and ak 0 18 g kg 1 figs 3b and 4 consequently our results reveal an achievable path for integrating mwp in nutrient rich background soils toc 27 83 g kg 1 and ak 0 18 g kg 1 allowing synergistic irrigation water reduction while maintaining rice yield levels 4 2 2 responses of soil properties to awd frequent changes in the drying wetting regime alter the content and stability of plant available nutrients and aerobic anaerobic conditions in paddy fields which in turn have implications for plant growth mariotte et al 2018 veresoglou et al 2022 generally awd may influence grain yield in two ways from the aspect of plants awd had strongly negative consequence on lai as a result although the photosynthetic rate was slightly increased it still caused a significant reduction in aboveground biomass fig 2 fig s8 table s3 previous studies have shown that root oxidation activity during aerobic periods of awd could delay root senescence and increase nutrient uptake zhang et al 2021 2022 however enhanced root oxidation activity can t compensate for the loss of tiller number and aboveground biomass ultimately resulting in lower yield fig 2 from the aspect of soils first reduced water supply from paddies has detrimental implications for lai photosynthetic rate and aboveground biomass accumulation resulting in accelerated rice senescence and increased litter input into the soil audette et al 2021 zhang et al 2012 or promoted root deposition atere et al 2017 together these factors are known to increase toc henry et al 2022 our data showed that lnr of toc had the greatest influence on lnr of yield with increasing lnr of toc reducing lnr of yield fig 5 lnr of yield was negative when lnr of toc 0 0003 fig 5b these results indicate that large increases in soil toc can impair plant growth and optimizing awd implementation can slow the increase in soil toc and improve yield by enhancing assimilate remobilization and accelerating the grain filling rate fig 5 fig s9 table s3 yang and zhang 2010 second soil drying wetting cycles can result in fluctuating soil redox potential thus affecting various soil oxidoreductase activities brzezińska et al 1998 li et al 2018 key processes include nitrification and denitrification which are known to be important for nitrogen assimilation and or immobilization liu et al 2023 under awd tn and no3 increased however nh4 was not significantly impacted fig 5 it can be known that nh4 is the main n form assimilated by rice plants duan et al 2007 li et al 2022 and no3 is not adsorbed by soil and usually more susceptible to leaching amin et al 2021 both regression and rf analysis showed that yield could gain a desirable increase of 4 by keeping lnr of no3 between 0 02 and 0 30 fig 5 fig s9 third the slight reduction in lnr of ph positively correlated with yield mainly due to the availability of primary nutrients and trace elements ding et al 2019 malik et al 2018 fig 5 however soil acidification with decreased ph might inhibit plant growth peng et al 2011 in some cases even a minor change in ph may weaken soil enzyme activity and disturb the habitat of soil microbes affecting the functionality of plant soil ecosystems fig s10 ji et al 2022 changes in ph should thus be greater than 0 015 to increase yield by at least 3 fig 5 fig s9 alternatively holding an appropriate background ph was also beneficial to buffer soil acidification and provided a suitable environment for the growth of rice and soil microbes fig 4e table s4 to achieve the ternary effect of awd on yield wue and soil sustainability our meta analysis results point towards monitoring of the three drivers lnrs of toc no3 and ph during awd in practice once lnr of toc 0 0003 lnr of no3 0 30 and lnr of ph 0 015 the wp awd level should be increased to avoid potential yield penalties consequently diagnosing and maintaining the effect size within the threshold range is desirable and could generate satisfactory outcomes both in yields and water savings 4 3 agricultural practices positively modify yield responses to awd detrimental effects of awd on yield can be reduced when awd was implemented with agricultural practices fig 6 bo et al 2022 such as n application n form and n rate soil amendments of straw zinc biochar and zeolite fig 6 optimized water and fertilizer scenarios are beneficial to increase rhizosphere microbes and enzyme activity thus balancing the n and c cycling and creating a suitable nutrient supply for plant uptake cao et al 2021 xu et al 2020c awd implementation under lwp combined with beneficial agricultural practices could increase yield by up to 18 fig 6a when awd was implemented with more severe water saving approaches under mwp and swp fig 3b yield decreased by 12 and 18 respectively remarkably yield and wue could be increased by 2 3 and 43 52 respectively when combing n application in low rates and amendments of straw and biochar under mwp fig 6a therefore the interactive effects of water and n provide the opportunity for sustainable development of rice production with low water and n fertilizer inputs the present study highlights lnrs of toc no3 and ph as dominant indicators for real time monitoring soil changes under awd fig 5 table s5 when organic n was added to replace inorganic n lnr of toc significantly changed by 0 053 a quantum that was lower than lnr of toc threshold of 0 0003 soil amendments are an effective method for weakening the adverse impact of water stress on plants by improving soil physical properties chen et al 2021 zheng et al 2018 or water holding capacity he et al 2015 yang et al 2005 biochar amendment reduced lnrs of toc and ph by 0 047 and 0 013 respectively and straw amendment increased lnr of no3 by 0 153 in mwp table s5 trends in these driving indicators consistently improved yield fig 5 fig s9 together combining awd with agricultural practices was beneficial to soil conditions inducing considerable improvement in rice yields 1 12 and wue up to 65 fig 6 5 conclusions our extensive meta analysis revealed that awd significantly improved wue by 31 with a yield penalty of 6 moreover according to our results three managements can be recommended for sustainably reducing water use and maintaining or increasing yields 1 ensuring that wp awd is maintained at levels greater than 15 kpa and sd awd less than 18 5 cm 2 real time adjustment of wp awd through monitoring of the soils particularly for the changes in toc 0 0003 ph 0 015 and nitrate nitrogen between 0 02 and 0 30 3 for greater water saving wp awd could be reduced to 40 kpa by modulating background soil toc 27 83 g kg 1 and ak 0 18 g kg 1 or coupling with n application in low rates and addition of straw or biochar fig 7 to this end emergent practices of rice should consider not just yield and water use but other co benefits and trade offs for production farmer prosperity and the environment awd will be a vital part of advancement in water savings productivity and soil health despite limitations in the available literature regarding interactions between soil biology agricultural practices and awd we developed integrated strategies for reducing yield penalty and or improving yields via awd our findings emphasize the importance of exploring the interactive effects of multiple variables to understand changes in paddy ecosystems including rice growth interactions with soil c and n cycling future studies should focus on the long term integrated implications of awd particularly awd effects on soil biology nutrient and microbiome using multifactorial experiments to develop practical adoption pathways for achieving multiple sustainable agricultural goals
