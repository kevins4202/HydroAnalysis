improved artificial potential field collision prediction model 1 introduction with the continuous expansion of time and spatial scales of marine monitoring the requirements for monitoring equipment have also increased a series of unmanned vehicles such as remotely operated vehicles rovs autonomous underwater vehicles auvs and unmanned surface vessels usvs have greatly contributed to the development of ocean survey bingham et al 2012 however due to the limited energy they can carry the endurance and economical efficiency are restricted which poses some challenges for the long term marine observations wave glider wg as a new class of marine survey robot with infinite duration provides solutions to the above problems the structure of wave glider is shown in fig 1 a which consists of a surface float and a submarine glider wang et al 2020 the two bodies are connected by a flexible tether the movement mechanism is presented in fig 1 b as waves pass by the float will rise and fall with the waves which will cause the glider to undulate thereby the hinged hydrofoils rotate continuously generating a forward thrust therefore the kinetic energy required by wave glider is entirely provided by waves which means that it is theoretically capable of sailing with no limit of voyage because of this unique characteristic wave glider has a wide application prospect such as acoustic data collection communication gateway for subsurface systems military intelligence collection meteorological observation olson 2012 in order to accomplish these tasks efficiently and accurately how to develop appropriate motion control strategies for the wave glider has become the focus of researchers due to the feature of long voyage wave glider will inevitably encounter obstacles at sea which may cause collision therefore it is necessary to design an effective obstacle avoidance strategy for the wave glider several solutions have been proposed for the obstacle avoidance of underactuated marine vehicles in kawanok 2006 an off line markov decision process mdp based method for real time collision avoidance for underactuated auvs in the sea environment is proposed an ordinary differential equations ode based obstacle avoidance and trajectory planning for unmanned surface vessels was presented by soltan et al 2011 liu and bucknall 2015 presented a fast marching fm based algorithm to solve the problem of usv formation path planning in dynamic environments the algorithm has been specifically designed for operation using the novel constrained fm method zhang et al 2017 developed an improved dynamical virtual ship dvs principle to program the real time attitude guidance for the underactuated ship which is applied in the path following and obstacles avoidance missions a fusion algorithm based on extended kalman filter ekf search ball and potential field concept was developed to control an usv autonomously to avoid the obstacle and track the preset path by mousazadeh et al 2018 cheng and zhang 2017 proposed a concise deep reinforcement learning obstacle avoidance cdrloa algorithm to solve the problem of obstacle avoidance for the underactuated unmanned marine vessel compared with the analytic methods the reinforcement learning algorithm shows notable advantages in terms of utility and extensibility in abdelaal et al 2018 a combined nonlinear model predictive control nmpc method with sideslip angle compensation and environmental disturbances counteraction was presented to address the collision avoidance of underactuated vessels as a reactive method for collision avoidance the constant avoidance angle algorithm was proposed by wiig et al 2019 in the field of robot motion planning the artificial potential field method proposed by khatib 1986 is a classical algorithm many researchers have also applied it to solve the obstacle avoidance problem of usv subramanian et al 2012 presented a multi point potential field mppf method for obstacle avoidance of auvs in a 2d dynamic environment xie et al 2014 proposed an improved artificial potential field to solve the problems of local minimum and destination unreachable lyu and yin 2017 presented an autonomous trajectory planning algorithm for usv to navigate safely in dynamic environments based on the modified artificial potential field the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea is considered the above works provide references for the obstacle avoidance control of underactuated marine vessels however research objects of all of the aforementioned studies are single body vehicles and have at least two control inputs including surge force and yaw moment which means that their speed of movement can be controlled by adjusting the thrust of propeller nevertheless wave glider has only one control input which is the yaw moment provided by the rudder of the submarine glider the glider yaws under the action of rudder moment and then drag the float to steer through the tether therefore although the heading of wave glider can be controlled its heading response rate is relatively slow in addition the kinetic energy required by wave glider depends entirely on wave energy which results in a low and uncontrollable sailing speed hine et al 2009 observed the speed of wave glider in the long term as shown in table 1 the wave glider reaches an upper speed limit in sea state 3 and the mean speed over long deployments is only 0 8 m s therefore due to its unique two body structure and propulsion mode the wave glider is weakly maneuverable and strongly underactuated wang et al 2019a which makes the obstacle avoidance control special and challenging as a classical and reliable path planning algorithm the artificial potential field apf have been applied to the field of usv obstacle avoidance and satisfactory results have been achieved in some researches however there still exists some shortcomings in a part of studies 1 without the application of the ship s mathematical model the obstacle avoidance problem for the usv is simplified as the path planning problem of a robot so the interference of marine environment is ignored 2 in terms of the dynamic obstacle avoidance the influence of different obstacle states on the performance of the developed algorithm is not considered therefore the robustness of the algorithm remains to be verified considering the above disadvantages and the particularity of the research object in this study an innovative obstacle strategy for the wave glider in marine environment is proposed the local minimum problem of the traditional apf is settled and an improved artificial potential field iapf is established an eight degree of freedom 8 dof mathematical model of the float and glider is presented and the model in series with iapf is verified under static obstacle environment for the dynamic obstacle avoidance a fusion algorithm based on collision prediction model cpm and iapf is proposed cpm iapf to adapt to the weak maneuverability of the wave glider finally in order to verify the robustness of the proposed algorithm the obstacle avoidance performances of wave glider under various environments are investigated the sensitivity analyses to some key parameters of the proposed cpm iapf algorithm are also conducted the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the obstacle avoidance strategies are established in section 2 the simulation results are analyzed and discussed in section 3 the main conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology overview for the obstacle avoidance it should be noted that all obstacles in this paper are approximated as circles for which the center x o y o and radius r are calculated by 1 x o x min r y o y min r r x max x min 2 2 y max y min 2 2 where x max x min and y max y min are the maximum and minimum values of obstacles on the x and y axes of the inertial coordinate system respectively as the heading range of the wave glider is π π the azimuth function is introduced to calculate the direction the function can be expressed as 2 ψ y x a r c tan y x x 0 π a r c tan y x y 0 x 0 π a r c tan y x y 0 x 0 π 2 y 0 x 0 π 2 y 0 x 0 2 1 the improved artificial potential field iapf the artificial potential field apf was first proposed by khatib 1986 for the obstacle avoidance of mobile robots it is a classical and reliable method the basic idea of the approach is to set a virtual force field for the motion space of robot the goal generates attractive force to the robot while obstacles generate repulsive forces then the motion of robot is controlled by the resultant force the principle of the method is shown in fig 2 the traditional functions of attractive potential u att and repulsive potential u rep proposed by khatib 1986 are expressed as 3 u a t t x y 1 2 k p ρ g o a l 2 4 u r e p x y 1 2 η 1 ρ o b s 1 ρ 0 2 ρ o b s ρ 0 0 ρ o b s ρ 0 where x y is the position of the robot k p is the attractive potential gain ρ g o a l denotes the distance between the robot and goal η is the repulsive potential gain ρ o b s denotes the distance between the robot and the obstacle ρ 0 represents the influence distance of the obstacle which means that only when the robot is within the influence distance can it be subjected to u rep the total potential can be calculated as 5 u x y u a t t x y u r e p x y the resultant force on the robot is 6 f f a t t f r e p with 7 f a t t g r a d u a t t 8 f r e p g r a d u r e p then the robot will look for the path along the direction of resultant force f local minimum is an inherent disadvantage of the traditional apf when the robot is in the same line with the goal and obstacle u att and u rep are both in the line too then the repulsive force will be the same as the attractive force in the opposite direction at a certain point on the line so that the resultant force equals to zero in this situation the robot is located at the local minimum point which means the failure of obstacle avoidance task in order to overcome this weakness u rep is modified by adding an extra component in this study make a tangent to the obstacle from the position of robot and the new input is along the tangent direction as shown in fig 3 in fig 3 u r e p 1 x y represents the traditional repulsive potential it can be expressed as 9 u r e p 1 x y η 1 x o x 2 y o y 2 r the angle between the robot and the center of obstacle can be calculated as 10 ϕ r e p 1 ψ y o y x o x according to relevant knowledge of geometric mathematics two tangent lines can be made from the point x y outside one circle to the circle whose center is x o y o and radius is r the slope of the two tangent lines can be calculated as 11 k 1 2 x o y o x y x y o x o y r x 2 y 2 x o 2 y o 2 2 x o x 2 y o y r 2 r 2 x o 2 2 x o x x 2 in this paper one of the two tangent lines is selected whose slope is 12 k x o y o x y x y o x o y r x 2 y 2 x o 2 y o 2 2 x o x 2 y o y r 2 r 2 x o 2 2 x o x x 2 the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the tangent point are respectively 13 x 1 k y x o k 2 x k y o 1 k 2 y 1 k x o y k 2 y o k x 1 k 2 then u r e p 2 x y can be expressed as 14 u r e p 2 x y η 1 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 the angle between the robot and the tangent point can be calculated as 15 ϕ r e p 2 ψ y 1 y x 1 x finally the modified u rep is obtained 16 u r e p x x y u r e p y x y u r e p 1 x y cos ϕ r e p 1 u r e p 1 x y sin ϕ r e p 1 u r e p 2 x y cos ϕ r e p 2 u r e p 2 x y sin ϕ r e p 2 2 2 dynamic model of the wave glider an accurate mathematical model is necessary to verify the feasibility of the proposed obstacle avoidance algorithm by the means of simulation some studies regarding the modeling of the wave glider have been conducted kraus and bingham 2011 kraus 2012 qi et al 2013 in this paper a 8 dof degree of freedom dynamic model of the wave glider proposed by wang et al 2019b is used table 2 provides several main particulars of the wave glider considered in this study three right handed coordinate systems are established in this model consisting of one inertial reference frame o n x n y n z n and two body fixed frames o b 1 x b 1 y b 1 z b 1 and o b 2 x b 2 y b 2 z b 2 as shown in fig 4 the two body fixed frames respectively describe the motion characteristics of the float and glider it is worth noting that the x axis of the inertial reference frame o n x n y n z n points to the north and the subsequent figures in this paper all follow this principle based on the three defined frames the 4 dof kinematic model of the surface float with respect to surge sway heave yaw can be expressed as 17 η 1 j θ η 1 υ 1 where η 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 ψ 1 t is the vector of position and orientation of the float in the reference frame o n x n y n z n and υ 1 u 1 v 1 w 1 r 1 t is the linear and angular velocity vector of the float in the reference frame o b 1 x b 1 y b 1 z b 1 j θ η 1 is the transformation matrix from o b 1 x b 1 y b 1 z b 1 to o n x n y n z n and is expressed as 18 j θ η 1 c o s ψ 1 s i n ψ 1 0 0 sin ψ 1 cos ψ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 the kinetic equations of the float are written as 19 m r b 1 a 1 0 υ 1 c r b 1 υ 1 υ 1 c a 1 υ 1 r υ 1 r d 1 υ 1 r υ 1 r g η τ 1 t e t h e r τ w f τ w d where υ 1 r is the relative velocity of the float in the case of ocean current m r b 1 is the rigid body inertia matrix a 1 0 is the added mass matrix calculated at zero frequency d 1 υ 1 r is the damping matrix c r b 1 υ 1 c a 1 υ 1 r is the coriolis and centripetal matrix g η is the gravitational and buoyancy forces τ w f is the first order wave induced forces and τ w d is the second order wave drift forces τ 1 t e t h e r is the tether forces exerted on the float the jonswap spectrum is used to describe the irregular waves to predict the motion responses of the wave glider fig 5 shows the relationship between the wave induced forces and sea state similar to the model of the float the 4 dof kinematic and kinetic equations of the glider can be presented as 20 η 2 j θ η 2 υ 2 m r b 2 a 2 0 υ 2 c r b 2 υ 2 υ 2 c a 2 υ 2 r υ 2 r d 2 υ 2 r υ 2 r g η 2 τ 2 t e t h e r τ δ τ h y d r o f o i l where υ 2 r is the relative velocity of the glider in the case of ocean current τ 2 t e t h e r is the tether forces exerted on the glider τ h y d r o f o i l is the hydrofoil forces and τ δ is the rudder induce forces for the glider a more detailed introduction of this model could be found in wang et al 2019b it has been confirmed that it is a robust model which can be applied to study the control of wave glider in open seas to incorporate the model of wave glider with iapf a combination approach is proposed according to the principle of iapf and relevant equations the total potential u has the property of keeping the robot close to goal while being away from obstacles considering only the heading of the wave glider can be controlled its desired course φ d during the obstacle avoidance task is set to point to the direction of u the components of the attractive potential u att in the x and y directions of the wave glider are expressed as 21 u a t t x x y u a t t y x y u a t t x y cos ϕ a t t u a t t x y sin ϕ a t t where ϕ a t t is the angle between the wave glider and goal the components of the repulsive potential u rep in the x and y directions are presented as eq 16 then φ d can be calculated as 22 φ d ψ u y u x ψ u a t t y u r e p y u a t t x u r e p x the heading control algorithm is used to realize the obstacle avoidance task in this study obstacle avoidance for the wave glider is implemented in series with a pid heading controller wang et al 2019b and the process is shown in fig 6 φ t δ denote the real time course and rudder angle of wave glider respectively x g y g is the real time position of the wave glider 2 3 a fusion algorithm for dynamic obstacle avoidance wave glider may encounter dynamic obstacles during the voyage due to its weak maneuverability the dynamic obstacle avoidance problem is more complex in this paper a collision prediction model cpm and iapf based hybrid algorithm cpm iapf is developed considering that the motion states of the wave glider and dynamic obstacle change frequently in the sea it is necessary to judge whether the collision risk exists between them therefore a collision prediction model cpm under maritime environment containing dynamic obstacles is established according to the relative positions and velocities of dynamic obstacle and wave glider two encounter situations are defined meeting situation and overtaking situation which is shown in fig 7 meeting situation refers to the encounter situation when the wave glider faces dynamic obstacle in the opposite direction of velocity and the relative orientation is between π 2 and π 2 which is shown as the following equation 23 ψ y o y g x o x g φ t π 2 φ t π 2 υ g υ o 0 where x o y o is the real time position of obstacle center υ g υ o represent the velocity vectors of wave glider and obstacle respectively overtaking situation refers to the encounter situation when the wave glider faces dynamic obstacle in the same velocity direction and the range of the relative orientation is π 2 π and π π 2 which is expressed as 24 ψ y o y g x o x g φ t π 2 φ t π φ t π φ t π 2 υ g υ o 0 when one of these two encounter situations occurs the wave glider and dynamic obstacle will constantly approach the encounter time t can be estimated as 25 t x o x g r u o u g where u g u o represent the x direction component of the real time velocities of the wave glider and obstacle respectively r is the radius of obstacle at time t the distance between the wave glider and obstacle is minimized based on their real time motion states the positions of the wave glider and obstacle center at time t are predicted 26 x o t x o u o t y o t y o v o t 27 x g t x g u g t y g t y g v g t where v g v o represent the y direction component of the real time velocities of the wave glider and obstacle respectively the distance between the wave glider and obstacle center at time t is 28 d t x o t x g t 2 y o t y g t 2 then compare the d t to α r α is a constant greater than 1 if d t is greater than α r there is no collision risk otherwise the risk of collision exists in this paper to ensure the safety of obstacle avoidance task α 1 5 in the repulsive potential u rep of iapf the influence distance ρ 0 is a key parameter which determines when the wave glider is influenced by u rep and performs collision avoidance task therefore the value of ρ 0 is of significance to the obstacle avoidance performance of the wave glider however considering its weak maneuverability and low sailing speed a single value of ρ 0 cannot adapt to various conditions in order to solve the above problem a fusion algorithm is developed by combining the cpm and iapf cpm iapf the prediction result of cpm is taken as the influence factor of whether the wave glider is subjected to u rep to replace the role of ρ 0 in iapf if there is no collision risk judged by cpm the wave glider will sail towards the goal under the action of attractive potential u att merely otherwise the wave glider will be influenced by both u att and u rep and carry out the mission of obstacle avoidance in order to ensure that the wave glider always sails toward the goal during the voyage thereby avoiding unnecessary energy consumption the desired course φ d is performed the saturation process 29 φ d ϕ a t t π 2 ψ u y u x ϕ a t t π 2 ψ u y u x ϕ a t t π 2 ψ u y u x ϕ a t t π 2 ϕ a t t π 2 ψ u y u x ϕ a t t π 2 the process of the dynamic obstacle avoidance strategy is shown in fig 8 the first step of the guidance algorithm is to acquire the state information such as the positions and velocities of the wave glider and dynamic obstacle and then transmit it to cpm then cpm predicts whether there exists the collision risk and the total potential u is calculated accordingly if there is no collision risk u is equal to u att and the wave glider will sail towards the goal otherwise the wave glider will be influenced by both u att and u rep and carry out the mission of collision avoidance at last the direction of φ d of the wave glider is obtained the final calculated φ d will be input to the pid controller of rudder angle which guide the wave glider to complete the obstacle avoidance task 3 simulation and discussion 3 1 feasibility verification of the proposed iapf in order to verify the feasibility of iapf the motions of the wave glider in the maritime environment containing one or more static obstacles are simulated based on the mathematical model introduced in section 2 the simulation conditions including the information of obstacles are shown in table 3 the initial position of the wave glider is 0 0 and the goal is 500 500 where the coordinate form is y x and the unit is m the same below the simulations are performed at a third sea state code with the significant wave height of 1 25 m and the direction of the irregular waves is zero i e they point to the north the simulation results under conditions 1 4 are shown in fig 9 fig 9 a indicates that the wave glider sails towards the goal under the guidance of attractive potential in the environment without obstacle as shown in fig 9 b when the traditional apf is applied the wave glider constantly oscillates around the local minimum point and fails to avoid the obstacle this trouble is resolved by applying the algorithm of iapf as can be seen in fig 9 c the comparison demonstrates the validity of iapf in addressing the disadvantage of the local minimum of apf it shows that for the marine environment containing single or several obstacles the wave glider successfully avoids the obstacles and reaches the goal which confirms the feasibility of the proposed iapf fig 10 shows the comparison of the wave glider s desired course φ d under conditions 1 and 3 to present the controlling input required to bypass the obstacle 3 2 feasibility and robustness verification of the proposed cpm iapf algorithm conditions 5 7 are designed to validate the proposed cpm iapf algorithm for the dynamic obstacle avoidance of the wave glider as shown in table 4 the goals are 0 50 while the initial positions of the wave glider and dynamic obstacles are 0 0 and 0 400 respectively fig 11 presents the relative positions of the wave glider and dynamic obstacles at several typical time instants under conditions 5 7 the blue dots in fig 11 represent the real time positions of the wave glider comparing fig 11 a and 11 b it can be seen that when the iapf with the same value of ρ 0 is applied although the wave glider can successfully avoid the obstacle under condition 5 the same effect is not achieved in the face of a larger obstacle under condition 6 which reflects the limitation of iapf under dynamic environment as shown in fig 11 c this weakness is addressed by applying the developed cpm iapf approach which verifies the feasibility of the method to assess the robustness of cpm iapf simulations of the motions of the wave glider under different marine environments and obstacle conditions are conducted as shown in table 5 considering that the hydrodynamic parameters of the float are calculated based on the potential flow theory the simulations are performed only for several low typical conditions with sea state of no higher than 3 figs 12 and 13 show the sailing paths of the wave glider when the dynamic obstacles meet the wave glider i e they move in opposite directions in conditions 8 and 9 the goals of the wave glider are 0 100 and 0 300 respectively the initial positions of the obstacles are 0 800 and 0 2000 respectively the sea conditions of the two conditions are also different under condition 8 the sea state code of the area where the wave glider is located is 2 with the significant wave height of 0 5 m and no current exists under condition 9 the sea state code of the area is 3 with the significant wave height of 1 25 m and the wave glider sails along the current in order to reflect the process of collision avoidance more intuitively the relative positions of the wave glider and the dynamic obstacle at four typical time instants are shown as can be seen from figs 12 and 13 the wave glider successfully completes the obstacle avoidance task when meeting different obstacles under different marine environments fig 14 a shows the time series of wave glider s desired course φ d and real time course φ t during the obstacle avoidance task under condition 8 it can be seen that in the course of navigation φ d changes continuously according to the prediction result of cpm so as to achieve the purpose of bypassing the obstacle and moving to the goal fig 14 b displays the amount of rudder angle required to adjust the heading of wave glider to the direction of φ d figs 15 and 16 show the sailing paths of the wave glider when the dynamic obstacles overtake the wave glider i e they move in the same direction in conditions 10 and 11 the goals of the wave glider are 0 100 and 0 300 respectively and the initial positions of the obstacles are 0 800 and 0 1500 respectively under the two conditions the wave glider is sailing against and along the ocean current respectively similarly the wave glider successfully avoids the obstacle under the overtaking situation fig 17 shows the distance d between the wave glider and obstacle under conditions 8 11 d is calculated as 30 d x o x g 2 y o y g 2 r table 6 presents the minimum distance d min between the two during the voyage it is shown that during the voyage the wave glider always maintains a sufficient distance away the obstacles the collision avoidance performances are satisfactory the environment in the condition 12 is more complex which has two obstacles with different sizes speeds and speed directions and the wave glider sails against the current fig 18 a presents the sailing path of the wave glider under condition 12 fig 18 b shows the relative distances between the wave glider and two obstacles during the voyage the minimum distances between the wave glider and obstacle 1 and 2 are 13 32m and 3 80m respectively the relative positions of the wave glider and obstacles at 4 typical time instants are shown in fig 19 the obstacle avoidance performance of the wave glider withstands the test based on the proposed guidance algorithm in the complicated environment containing more than one dynamic obstacle 3 3 sensitivity analyses to key parameters of the cpm iapf the proposed cpm iapf takes into consideration the scale and speed of dynamic obstacle and the speed of wave glider it is valuable to investigate how these key parameters influence the obstacle avoidance performances of wave glider considering the speed of wave glider is low and its range of variation is small sensitivity analyses to the scale and speed of obstacle under different conditions are conducted as shown in table 7 in these conditions the initial positions of obstacles are 0 2000 and the goals of the wave glider are 0 300 the velocity directions of obstacles point to south i e the encountering situations are meeting the significant wave heights are all 0 5m and no current exists the minimum distance d min between the wave glider and dynamic obstacle and energy consumption factor e under different conditions are introduced to assess the obstacle avoidance performances e quantitatively evaluates the energy consumption of wave glider during the voyage it is defined as the average amount of rudder angle turning per second during the mission of obstacle avoidance 31 e t 1 n 1 δ t 1 δ t n where δ is the rudder angle n is the number of total time steps the variance of desired course s 2 φ d is also calculated to characterize the dispersion degree of desired course φ d during the process of obstacle avoidance it can be expressed as 32 s 2 φ d t 1 n φ d t μ 2 n where μ is the average value of φ d fig 20 shows the comparisons of wave glider obstacle avoidance performances under conditions 13 17 it can be seen that with the increase of the scale and speed of obstacle so does the variance of the desired course s 2 φ d the fact indicates that when the navigation environment of the wave glider is more dangerous the change of desired course φ d will be more severe which means that more frequent steering and larger rudder angle are required therefore the energy consumption of control system under this situation increases accordingly as shown in fig 20 on the other hand d min is also influenced by the states of obstacle as shown in fig 20 a d min increases with the increase of obstacle radius r which can be explained by the characteristic of cpm that the larger r is the larger the scope of collision risk predicted by cpm is fig 20 b shows that when r remains constant there is no significant relation between d min and the speed of obstacle in general the variation is not significant and the wave glider still keeps sufficient distances from the obstacles in conclusion d min is mainly influenced by obstacle radius while the energy consumption increases with the increase of the scale and speed of obstacle 4 conclusions in this paper the obstacle avoidance strategies for the wave glider are investigated an improved artificial potential field iapf is proposed to avoid the wave glider falling into the local minimum point an 8 dof dynamic model in series with a pid controller is adopted to simulate the motion of the wave glider in marine environment the iapf are verified through the collision avoidance of the wave glider under static obstacle environment aiming at dynamic obstacle avoidance for the wave glider a collision prediction model cpm and iapf based fusion algorithm cpm iapf is developed to overcome the failure of collision avoidance caused by the weak maneuverability of it based on the developed algorithm the collision avoidance performances of the wave glider under different conditions are investigated the simulation results show that the wave glider can successfully performed the obstacle avoidance task in the face of various dynamic obstacles under different marine environments which confirms that the proposed obstacle avoidance algorithm for the wave glider is feasible and robust the sensitivity analyses to some key parameters of the proposed cpm iapf algorithm have also been conducted it can be concluded that the minimum distance between the wave glider and dynamic obstacle is mainly influenced by the radius of obstacle while the energy consumption increases with the increase of the scale and speed of obstacle declaration of competing interestcoi the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

algorithm based on extended kalman filter ekf search ball and potential field concept was developed to control an usv autonomously to avoid the obstacle and track the preset path by mousazadeh et al 2018 cheng and zhang 2017 proposed a concise deep reinforcement learning obstacle avoidance cdrloa algorithm to solve the problem of obstacle avoidance for the underactuated unmanned marine vessel compared with the analytic methods the reinforcement learning algorithm shows notable advantages in terms of utility and extensibility in abdelaal et al 2018 a combined nonlinear model predictive control nmpc method with sideslip angle compensation and environmental disturbances counteraction was presented to address the collision avoidance of underactuated vessels as a reactive method for collision avoidance the constant avoidance angle algorithm was proposed by wiig et al 2019 in the field of robot motion planning the artificial potential field method proposed by khatib 1986 is a classical algorithm many researchers have also applied it to solve the obstacle avoidance problem of usv subramanian et al 2012 presented a multi point potential field mppf method for obstacle avoidance of auvs in a 2d dynamic environment xie et al 2014 proposed an improved artificial potential field to solve the problems of local minimum and destination unreachable lyu and yin 2017 presented an autonomous trajectory planning algorithm for usv to navigate safely in dynamic environments based on the modified artificial potential field the international regulations for preventing collisions at sea is considered the above works provide references for the obstacle avoidance control of underactuated marine vessels however research objects of all of the aforementioned studies are single body vehicles and have at least two control inputs including surge force and yaw moment which means that their speed of movement can be controlled by adjusting the thrust of propeller nevertheless wave glider has only one control input which is the yaw moment provided by the rudder of the submarine glider the glider yaws under the action of rudder moment and then drag the float to steer through the tether therefore although the heading of wave glider can be controlled its heading response rate is relatively slow in addition the kinetic energy required by wave glider depends entirely on wave energy which results in a low and uncontrollable sailing speed hine et al 2009 observed the speed of wave glider in the long term as shown in table 1 the wave glider reaches an upper speed limit in sea state 3 and the mean speed over long deployments is only 0 8 m s therefore due to its unique two body structure and propulsion mode the wave glider is weakly maneuverable and strongly underactuated wang et al 2019a which makes the obstacle avoidance control special and challenging as a classical and reliable path planning algorithm the artificial potential field apf have been applied to the field of usv obstacle avoidance and satisfactory results have been achieved in some researches however there still exists some shortcomings in a part of studies 1 without the application of the ship s mathematical model the obstacle avoidance problem for the usv is simplified as the path planning problem of a robot so the interference of marine environment is ignored 2 in terms of the dynamic obstacle avoidance the influence of different obstacle states on the performance of the developed algorithm is not considered therefore the robustness of the algorithm remains to be verified considering the above disadvantages and the particularity of the research object in this study an innovative obstacle strategy for the wave glider in marine environment is proposed the local minimum problem of the traditional apf is settled and an improved artificial potential field iapf is established an eight degree of freedom 8 dof mathematical model of the float and glider is presented and the model in series with iapf is verified under static obstacle environment for the dynamic obstacle avoidance a fusion algorithm based on collision prediction model cpm and iapf is proposed cpm iapf to adapt to the weak maneuverability of the wave glider finally in order to verify the robustness of the proposed algorithm the obstacle avoidance performances of wave glider under various environments are investigated the sensitivity analyses to some key parameters of the proposed cpm iapf algorithm are also conducted the remainder of this paper is organized as follows the obstacle avoidance strategies are established in section 2 the simulation results are analyzed and discussed in section 3 the main conclusions are drawn in section 4 2 methodology overview for the obstacle avoidance it should be noted that all obstacles in this paper are approximated as circles for which the center x o y o and radius r are calculated by 1 x o x min r y o y min r r x max x min 2 2 y max y min 2 2 where x max x min and y max y min are the maximum and minimum values of obstacles on the x and y axes of the inertial coordinate system respectively as the heading range of the wave glider is π π the azimuth function is introduced to calculate the direction the function can be expressed as 2 ψ y x a r c tan y x x 0 π a r c tan y x y 0 x 0 π a r c tan y x y 0 x 0 π 2 y 0 x 0 π 2 y 0 x 0 2 1 the improved artificial potential field iapf the artificial potential field apf was first proposed by khatib 1986 for the obstacle avoidance of mobile robots it is a classical and reliable method the basic idea of the approach is to set a virtual force field for the motion space of robot the goal generates attractive force to the robot while obstacles generate repulsive forces then the motion of robot is controlled by the resultant force the principle of the method is shown in fig 2 the traditional functions of attractive potential u att and repulsive potential u rep proposed by khatib 1986 are expressed as 3 u a t t x y 1 2 k p ρ g o a l 2 4 u r e p x y 1 2 η 1 ρ o b s 1 ρ 0 2 ρ o b s ρ 0 0 ρ o b s ρ 0 where x y is the position of the robot k p is the attractive potential gain ρ g o a l denotes the distance between the robot and goal η is the repulsive potential gain ρ o b s denotes the distance between the robot and the obstacle ρ 0 represents the influence distance of the obstacle which means that only when the robot is within the influence distance can it be subjected to u rep the total potential can be calculated as 5 u x y u a t t x y u r e p x y the resultant force on the robot is 6 f f a t t f r e p with 7 f a t t g r a d u a t t 8 f r e p g r a d u r e p then the robot will look for the path along the direction of resultant force f local minimum is an inherent disadvantage of the traditional apf when the robot is in the same line with the goal and obstacle u att and u rep are both in the line too then the repulsive force will be the same as the attractive force in the opposite direction at a certain point on the line so that the resultant force equals to zero in this situation the robot is located at the local minimum point which means the failure of obstacle avoidance task in order to overcome this weakness u rep is modified by adding an extra component in this study make a tangent to the obstacle from the position of robot and the new input is along the tangent direction as shown in fig 3 in fig 3 u r e p 1 x y represents the traditional repulsive potential it can be expressed as 9 u r e p 1 x y η 1 x o x 2 y o y 2 r the angle between the robot and the center of obstacle can be calculated as 10 ϕ r e p 1 ψ y o y x o x according to relevant knowledge of geometric mathematics two tangent lines can be made from the point x y outside one circle to the circle whose center is x o y o and radius is r the slope of the two tangent lines can be calculated as 11 k 1 2 x o y o x y x y o x o y r x 2 y 2 x o 2 y o 2 2 x o x 2 y o y r 2 r 2 x o 2 2 x o x x 2 in this paper one of the two tangent lines is selected whose slope is 12 k x o y o x y x y o x o y r x 2 y 2 x o 2 y o 2 2 x o x 2 y o y r 2 r 2 x o 2 2 x o x x 2 the horizontal and vertical coordinates of the tangent point are respectively 13 x 1 k y x o k 2 x k y o 1 k 2 y 1 k x o y k 2 y o k x 1 k 2 then u r e p 2 x y can be expressed as 14 u r e p 2 x y η 1 x 1 x 2 y 1 y 2 the angle between the robot and the tangent point can be calculated as 15 ϕ r e p 2 ψ y 1 y x 1 x finally the modified u rep is obtained 16 u r e p x x y u r e p y x y u r e p 1 x y cos ϕ r e p 1 u r e p 1 x y sin ϕ r e p 1 u r e p 2 x y cos ϕ r e p 2 u r e p 2 x y sin ϕ r e p 2 2 2 dynamic model of the wave glider an accurate mathematical model is necessary to verify the feasibility of the proposed obstacle avoidance algorithm by the means of simulation some studies regarding the modeling of the wave glider have been conducted kraus and bingham 2011 kraus 2012 qi et al 2013 in this paper a 8 dof degree of freedom dynamic model of the wave glider proposed by wang et al 2019b is used table 2 provides several main particulars of the wave glider considered in this study three right handed coordinate systems are established in this model consisting of one inertial reference frame o n x n y n z n and two body fixed frames o b 1 x b 1 y b 1 z b 1 and o b 2 x b 2 y b 2 z b 2 as shown in fig 4 the two body fixed frames respectively describe the motion characteristics of the float and glider it is worth noting that the x axis of the inertial reference frame o n x n y n z n points to the north and the subsequent figures in this paper all follow this principle based on the three defined frames the 4 dof kinematic model of the surface float with respect to surge sway heave yaw can be expressed as 17 η 1 j θ η 1 υ 1 where η 1 x 1 y 1 z 1 ψ 1 t is the vector of position and orientation of the float in the reference frame o n x n y n z n and υ 1 u 1 v 1 w 1 r 1 t is the linear and angular velocity vector of the float in the reference frame o b 1 x b 1 y b 1 z b 1 j θ η 1 is the transformation matrix from o b 1 x b 1 y b 1 z b 1 to o n x n y n z n and is expressed as 18 j θ η 1 c o s ψ 1 s i n ψ 1 0 0 sin ψ 1 cos ψ 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 the kinetic equations of the float are written as 19 m r b 1 a 1 0 υ 1 c r b 1 υ 1 υ 1 c a 1 υ 1 r υ 1 r d 1 υ 1 r υ 1 r g η τ 1 t e t h e r τ w f τ w d where υ 1 r is the relative velocity of the float in the case of ocean current m r b 1 is the rigid body inertia matrix a 1 0 is the added mass matrix calculated at zero frequency d 1 υ 1 r is the damping matrix c r b 1 υ 1 c a 1 υ 1 r is the coriolis and centripetal matrix g η is the gravitational and buoyancy forces τ w f is the first order wave induced forces and τ w d is the second order wave drift forces τ 1 t e t h e r is the tether forces exerted on the float the jonswap spectrum is used to describe the irregular waves to predict the motion responses of the wave glider fig 5 shows the relationship between the wave induced forces and sea state similar to the model of the float the 4 dof kinematic and kinetic equations of the glider can be presented as 20 η 2 j θ η 2 υ 2 m r b 2 a 2 0 υ 2 c r b 2 υ 2 υ 2 c a 2 υ 2 r υ 2 r d 2 υ 2 r υ 2 r g η 2 τ 2 t e t h e r τ δ τ h y d r o f o i l where υ 2 r is the relative velocity of the glider in the case of ocean current τ 2 t e t h e r is the tether forces exerted on the glider τ h y d r o f o i l is the hydrofoil forces and τ δ is the rudder induce forces for the glider a more detailed introduction of this model could be found in wang et al 2019b it has been confirmed that it is a robust model which can be applied to study the control of wave glider in open seas to incorporate the model of wave glider with iapf a combination approach is proposed according to the principle of iapf and relevant equations the total potential u has the property of keeping the robot close to goal while being away from obstacles considering only the heading of the wave glider can be controlled its desired course φ d during the obstacle avoidance task is set to point to the direction of u the components of the attractive potential u att in the x and y directions of the wave glider are expressed as 21 u a t t x x y u a t t y x y u a t t x y cos ϕ a t t u a t t x y sin ϕ a t t where ϕ a t t is the angle between the wave glider and goal the components of the repulsive potential u rep in the x and y directions are presented as eq 16 then φ d can be calculated as 22 φ d ψ u y u x ψ u a t t y u r e p y u a t t x u r e p x the heading control algorithm is used to realize the obstacle avoidance task in this study obstacle avoidance for the wave glider is implemented in series with a pid heading controller wang et al 2019b and the process is shown in fig 6 φ t δ denote the real time course and rudder angle of wave glider respectively x g y g is the real time position of the wave glider 2 3 a fusion algorithm for dynamic obstacle avoidance wave glider may encounter dynamic obstacles during the voyage due to its weak maneuverability the dynamic obstacle avoidance problem is more complex in this paper a collision prediction model cpm and iapf based hybrid algorithm cpm iapf is developed considering that the motion states of the wave glider and dynamic obstacle change frequently in the sea it is necessary to judge whether the collision risk exists between them therefore a collision prediction model cpm under maritime environment containing dynamic obstacles is established according to the relative positions and velocities of dynamic obstacle and wave glider two encounter situations are defined meeting situation and overtaking situation which is shown in fig 7 meeting situation refers to the encounter situation when the wave glider faces dynamic obstacle in the opposite direction of velocity and the relative orientation is between π 2 and π 2 which is shown as the following equation 23 ψ y o y g x o x g φ t π 2 φ t π 2 υ g υ o 0 where x o y o is the real time position of obstacle center υ g υ o represent the velocity vectors of wave glider and obstacle respectively overtaking situation refers to the encounter situation when the wave glider faces dynamic obstacle in the same velocity direction and the range of the relative orientation is π 2 π and π π 2 which is expressed as 24 ψ y o y g x o x g φ t π 2 φ t π φ t π φ t π 2 υ g υ o 0 when one of these two encounter situations occurs the wave glider and dynamic obstacle will constantly approach the encounter time t can be estimated as 25 t x o x g r u o u g where u g u o represent the x direction component of the real time velocities of the wave glider and obstacle respectively r is the radius of obstacle at time t the distance between the wave glider and obstacle is minimized based on their real time motion states the positions of the wave glider and obstacle center at time t are predicted 26 x o t x o u o t y o t y o v o t 27 x g t x g u g t y g t y g v g t where v g v o represent the y direction component of the real time velocities of the wave glider and obstacle respectively the distance between the wave glider and obstacle center at time t is 28 d t x o t x g t 2 y o t y g t 2 then compare the d t to α r α is a constant greater than 1 if d t is greater than α r there is no collision risk otherwise the risk of collision exists in this paper to ensure the safety of obstacle avoidance task α 1 5 in the repulsive potential u rep of iapf the influence distance ρ 0 is a key parameter which determines when the wave glider is influenced by u rep and performs collision avoidance task therefore the value of ρ 0 is of significance to the obstacle avoidance performance of the wave glider however considering its weak maneuverability and low sailing speed a single value of ρ 0 cannot adapt to various conditions in order to solve the above problem a fusion algorithm is developed by combining the cpm and iapf cpm iapf the prediction result of cpm is taken as the influence factor of whether the wave glider is subjected to u rep to replace the role of ρ 0 in iapf if there is no collision risk judged by cpm the wave glider will sail towards the goal under the action of attractive potential u att merely otherwise the wave glider will be influenced by both u att and u rep and carry out the mission of obstacle avoidance in order to ensure that the wave glider always sails toward the goal during the voyage thereby avoiding unnecessary energy consumption the desired course φ d is performed the saturation process 29 φ d ϕ a t t π 2 ψ u y u x ϕ a t t π 2 ψ u y u x ϕ a t t π 2 ψ u y u x ϕ a t t π 2 ϕ a t t π 2 ψ u y u x ϕ a t t π 2 the process of the dynamic obstacle avoidance strategy is shown in fig 8 the first step of the guidance algorithm is to acquire the state information such as the positions and velocities of the wave glider and dynamic obstacle and then transmit it to cpm then cpm predicts whether there exists the collision risk and the total potential u is calculated accordingly if there is no collision risk u is equal to u att and the wave glider will sail towards the goal otherwise the wave glider will be influenced by both u att and u rep and carry out the mission of collision avoidance at last the direction of φ d of the wave glider is obtained the final calculated φ d will be input to the pid controller of rudder angle which guide the wave glider to complete the obstacle avoidance task 3 simulation and discussion 3 1 feasibility verification of the proposed iapf in order to verify the feasibility of iapf the motions of the wave glider in the maritime environment containing one or more static obstacles are simulated based on the mathematical model introduced in section 2 the simulation conditions including the information of obstacles are shown in table 3 the initial position of the wave glider is 0 0 and the goal is 500 500 where the coordinate form is y x and the unit is m the same below the simulations are performed at a third sea state code with the significant wave height of 1 25 m and the direction of the irregular waves is zero i e they point to the north the simulation results under conditions 1 4 are shown in fig 9 fig 9 a indicates that the wave glider sails towards the goal under the guidance of attractive potential in the environment without obstacle as shown in fig 9 b when the traditional apf is applied the wave glider constantly oscillates around the local minimum point and fails to avoid the obstacle this trouble is resolved by applying the algorithm of iapf as can be seen in fig 9 c the comparison demonstrates the validity of iapf in addressing the disadvantage of the local minimum of apf it shows that for the marine environment containing single or several obstacles the wave glider successfully avoids the obstacles and reaches the goal which confirms the feasibility of the proposed iapf fig 10 shows the comparison of the wave glider s desired course φ d under conditions 1 and 3 to present the controlling input required to bypass the obstacle 3 2 feasibility and robustness verification of the proposed cpm iapf algorithm conditions 5 7 are designed to validate the proposed cpm iapf algorithm for the dynamic obstacle avoidance of the wave glider as shown in table 4 the goals are 0 50 while the initial positions of the wave glider and dynamic obstacles are 0 0 and 0 400 respectively fig 11 presents the relative positions of the wave glider and dynamic obstacles at several typical time instants under conditions 5 7 the blue dots in fig 11 represent the real time positions of the wave glider comparing fig 11 a and 11 b it can be seen that when the iapf with the same value of ρ 0 is applied although the wave glider can successfully avoid the obstacle under condition 5 the same effect is not achieved in the face of a larger obstacle under condition 6 which reflects the limitation of iapf under dynamic environment as shown in fig 11 c this weakness is addressed by applying the developed cpm iapf approach which verifies the feasibility of the method to assess the robustness of cpm iapf simulations of the motions of the wave glider under different marine environments and obstacle conditions are conducted as shown in table 5 considering that the hydrodynamic parameters of the float are calculated based on the potential flow theory the simulations are performed only for several low typical conditions with sea state of no higher than 3 figs 12 and 13 show the sailing paths of the wave glider when the dynamic obstacles meet the wave glider i e they move in opposite directions in conditions 8 and 9 the goals of the wave glider are 0 100 and 0 300 respectively the initial positions of the obstacles are 0 800 and 0 2000 respectively the sea conditions of the two conditions are also different under condition 8 the sea state code of the area where the wave glider is located is 2 with the significant wave height of 0 5 m and no current exists under condition 9 the sea state code of the area is 3 with the significant wave height of 1 25 m and the wave glider sails along the current in order to reflect the process of collision avoidance more intuitively the relative positions of the wave glider and the dynamic obstacle at four typical time instants are shown as can be seen from figs 12 and 13 the wave glider successfully completes the obstacle avoidance task when meeting different obstacles under different marine environments fig 14 a shows the time series of wave glider s desired course φ d and real time course φ t during the obstacle avoidance task under condition 8 it can be seen that in the course of navigation φ d changes continuously according to the prediction result of cpm so as to achieve the purpose of bypassing the obstacle and moving to the goal fig 14 b displays the amount of rudder angle required to adjust the heading of wave glider to the direction of φ d figs 15 and 16 show the sailing paths of the wave glider when the dynamic obstacles overtake the wave glider i e they move in the same direction in conditions 10 and 11 the goals of the wave glider are 0 100 and 0 300 respectively and the initial positions of the obstacles are 0 800 and 0 1500 respectively under the two conditions the wave glider is sailing against and along the ocean current respectively similarly the wave glider successfully avoids the obstacle under the overtaking situation fig 17 shows the distance d between the wave glider and obstacle under conditions 8 11 d is calculated as 30 d x o x g 2 y o y g 2 r table 6 presents the minimum distance d min between the two during the voyage it is shown that during the voyage the wave glider always maintains a sufficient distance away the obstacles the collision avoidance performances are satisfactory the environment in the condition 12 is more complex which has two obstacles with different sizes speeds and speed directions and the wave glider sails against the current fig 18 a presents the sailing path of the wave glider under condition 12 fig 18 b shows the relative distances between the wave glider and two obstacles during the voyage the minimum distances between the wave glider and obstacle 1 and 2 are 13 32m and 3 80m respectively the relative positions of the wave glider and obstacles at 4 typical time instants are shown in fig 19 the obstacle avoidance performance of the wave glider withstands the test based on the proposed guidance algorithm in the complicated environment containing more than one dynamic obstacle 3 3 sensitivity analyses to key parameters of the cpm iapf the proposed cpm iapf takes into consideration the scale and speed of dynamic obstacle and the speed of wave glider it is valuable to investigate how these key parameters influence the obstacle avoidance performances of wave glider considering the speed of wave glider is low and its range of variation is small sensitivity analyses to the scale and speed of obstacle under different conditions are conducted as shown in table 7 in these conditions the initial positions of obstacles are 0 2000 and the goals of the wave glider are 0 300 the velocity directions of obstacles point to south i e the encountering situations are meeting the significant wave heights are all 0 5m and no current exists the minimum distance d min between the wave glider and dynamic obstacle and energy consumption factor e under different conditions are introduced to assess the obstacle avoidance performances e quantitatively evaluates the energy consumption of wave glider during the voyage it is defined as the average amount of rudder angle turning per second during the mission of obstacle avoidance 31 e t 1 n 1 δ t 1 δ t n where δ is the rudder angle n is the number of total time steps the variance of desired course s 2 φ d is also calculated to characterize the dispersion degree of desired course φ d during the process of obstacle avoidance it can be expressed as 32 s 2 φ d t 1 n φ d t μ 2 n where μ is the average value of φ d fig 20 shows the comparisons of wave glider obstacle avoidance performances under conditions 13 17 it can be seen that with the increase of the scale and speed of obstacle so does the variance of the desired course s 2 φ d the fact indicates that when the navigation environment of the wave glider is more dangerous the change of desired course φ d will be more severe which means that more frequent steering and larger rudder angle are required therefore the energy consumption of control system under this situation increases accordingly as shown in fig 20 on the other hand d min is also influenced by the states of obstacle as shown in fig 20 a d min increases with the increase of obstacle radius r which can be explained by the characteristic of cpm that the larger r is the larger the scope of collision risk predicted by cpm is fig 20 b shows that when r remains constant there is no significant relation between d min and the speed of obstacle in general the variation is not significant and the wave glider still keeps sufficient distances from the obstacles in conclusion d min is mainly influenced by obstacle radius while the energy consumption increases with the increase of the scale and speed of obstacle 4 conclusions in this paper the obstacle avoidance strategies for the wave glider are investigated an improved artificial potential field iapf is proposed to avoid the wave glider falling into the local minimum point an 8 dof dynamic model in series with a pid controller is adopted to simulate the motion of the wave glider in marine environment the iapf are verified through the collision avoidance of the wave glider under static obstacle environment aiming at dynamic obstacle avoidance for the wave glider a collision prediction model cpm and iapf based fusion algorithm cpm iapf is developed to overcome the failure of collision avoidance caused by the weak maneuverability of it based on the developed algorithm the collision avoidance performances of the wave glider under different conditions are investigated the simulation results show that the wave glider can successfully performed the obstacle avoidance task in the face of various dynamic obstacles under different marine environments which confirms that the proposed obstacle avoidance algorithm for the wave glider is feasible and robust the sensitivity analyses to some key parameters of the proposed cpm iapf algorithm have also been conducted it can be concluded that the minimum distance between the wave glider and dynamic obstacle is mainly influenced by the radius of obstacle while the energy consumption increases with the increase of the scale and speed of obstacle declaration of competing interestcoi the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

21876,the paper discusses the application of reinforcement learning to the control of an onshore wave energy converter wec the proposed wec features a simple and low cost architecture it is characterized by an oscillating floating rocker arm which moves a four bar linkage in the vertical plane a mechanical rectifier based on two one way clutches and a multiplier gearbox transforms the low speed oscillating motion of the four bar into a higher speed unidirectional rotation of the electrical generator the dynamic model of the wec based on multibody approach and linear wave theory is presented then a reinforcement learning rl algorithm a q learning method is applied to dynamically adjust the generator speed torque ratio as a function of the sea state simulation results show the effectiveness of this model free adaptive control in tuning the system in order to maximize the generated power starting from a simple monochromatic model of the sea the presented approach is verified according to sea conditions of increasing complexity and finally to long term time series obtained from measurements of real sea states in the considered geographical region the tuning of the hyper parameters of rl algorithm with respect to the speed of convergence and optimality of generated power is also discussed keywords wec oscillating arm linear wave theory reinforcement learning q learning 1 introduction although examples of sea wave energy harnessing date back to the thirteenth century cruz 2008 this enormous source of renewable energy is still poorly exploited in comparison with its potential in general as pointed out in several analyses and reports magagna et al 2016 pecher and kofoed 2017 mwasilu and jung 2019 wave energy converters wecs are mostly at an early stage when compared to other renewable energy plants there are few examples of systems having reached operative technology readiness level trl and the attainable levelized cost of energy lcoe is very far from more developed renewable sources as a matter of fact recent reports on renewable energies do not even consider sea energy in the cost analysis irena 2019 on one side the present state of wecs demonstrates that a long and difficult walk has yet to be done before achieving sufficient trl and economic competitiveness on the other side the awareness of the huge amount of available clean energy from this source greatly stimulates scientific and engineering research also to attain the ambitious generation targets stated for the next decades melikoglu 2018 towards this end the paper discusses an efficient model free robust approach based on reinforcement learning sutton and barto 2018 to dynamically tune the control parameter of the electric generator of a wec in order to optimize electric power generation in operation condition as a function of the sea state the work takes significant contributions from the works of anderlini et al 2016 and anderlini et al 2018 that already adopted rl for a similar task but it extends its application to a more complex nonlinear mechanical architecture introduced in albert et al 2017 moreover the tuning of rl hyper parameters is discussed in detail and the application of the approach is verified by studying its dynamic behaviour with respect to a large numbers of real sea states obtained from measurements over a long period of time bozzi et al 2018 de santis et al 2015 in the last years a wide variety of wecs has been proposed they can be classified on the basis of their location onshore nearshore offshore of their size and orientation with respect to the incoming wave of their working principle and of their power take off system air turbines hydraulic systems linear generators uihlein and magagna 2016 falnes 2007 falcao 2010 lópez et al 2013 drew et al 2009 folley and whittaker 2009 têtu 2017 considering the state of the art of wecs the tendency is to develop above all point absorber wecs for their lower complexity and cost lópez et al 2013 as regards power take off systems electrical linear generators polinder et al 2003 polinder et al 2004 transform directly the harvested mechanical power into electrical power with high conversion efficiency and relatively simple mechanical layout the main drawbacks are the high cost of linear generators in particular in case of big size and the critical protection from saltwater damages in general due to the extremely hard and unpredictable operative conditions of the marine environment reliability and easiness of installation maintenance are aspects of primary importance in wec design thies et al 2009 as a consequence some researchers have recently proposed onshore wecs based on oscillating arms hinged to shore and carrying floating buoys with heave motion examples are the wavestar by the danish wavestar energy wavestar 2019 frigaard et al 2016 marquis et al 2012 the wecs of the israeli eco wave power eco wave power 2019 the power plant realized at the port of pecem by the coppe institute of the federal university of rio de janeiro estefen et al 2010 the power take off systems of these oscillating arm wecs are placed onshore with great benefits for installation and maintenance in albert et al 2017 an innovative oscillating arm wec has been proposed characterized by a low cost mechanical architecture based on a four bar linkage the lower link is a floating rocker arm moved by the wave forces whereas the upper rocker arm is connected to a rotating electric generator via a transmission composed of a mechanical rectifier morales and benitez 2019 liang et al 2017 based on a pair of one way clutches and a speed multiplier gearbox the main difference between the proposed design and other oscillating arm wecs is the adoption of a rotating mechanical transmission with mechanical rectifier while for example the pto systems of wavestar eco wave power and coppe institute are based on the interposition of pneumatic or hydraulic transmission lines on the other hand the wec proposed in liang et al 2017 is equipped with a mechanical rectifier with two one way clutches but within a different architecture an offshore floating buoy containing the electrical machine is in relative translational motion with respect to a vertical shaft moored to the seabed the main benefits of the proposed solution are the following wave energy is transformed into electrical energy by means of a mechanical transmission and a rotating electric generator therefore conversion efficiency and reliability are high all the kinematic joints are revolute and gear pairs which are preferable over prismatic joints needed for rectilinear motion in terms of mechanical efficiency cost and durability the construction of the four bar linkage is simple without particular technological and fabrication requirements electrical linear generators are avoided and the transmission elements one way clutches speed multiplier gearbox electrical generator are off the shelf consequently costs are lower in coiro et al 2016 a similar wec concept has been proposed based on a floating rocker arm and an electromechanical generator but the power take off is via a ball screw system and consequently the electric generator executes an oscillatory motion on the contrary in the proposed wec the generator motion is unidirectional with relatively constant rotational speed also thanks to the adoption of a flywheel to store kinetic energy and regularize generator motion and power production one of the main issues in wec design is the choice of the control scheme for the pto that may significantly affect power generation efficiency ringwood et al 2014 several control strategies rely on dynamic models of the wecs mostly derived under the assumption of non causal linear systems coe et al 2017 ringwood et al 2014 unfortunately the dynamic interaction between wecs and sea waves is rather complex and modelling imprecisions may affect the performances of model based control schemes monarcha fernandes and fonseca 2013 ti et al 2018 accordingly some researchers have recently proposed model free adaptive algorithms based on reinforcement learning rl techniques sutton and barto 2018 capable of tuning the control parameters as a function of the sea state and system functioning conditions anderlini et al 2016 2018 in general beyond such contributions there is an increasing interest to apply machine learning techniques to the sea wave power generation topics for example in li et al 2019 an artificial neural network is adopted to optimize the latching control of a heaving buoy whereas cuadra et al 2016 provides an overview of computational intelligence applications to wave energy in the present paper a particular rl approach the q learning sutton and barto 2018 is applied to optimize the control parameter of the proposed oscillating arm wec as a function of the sea state after setting up the rl algorithm a large number of simulations have been performed to tune and validate it with increasing levels of complexity in the sea models polychromatic sea with constant mean wave period t 0 and of the significant wave height h s polychromatic sea with t 0 and h s varying continuously with sinusoidal law random polychromatic sea varying according to the parameters of an experimentally recorded wave history simulation results show that the proposed q learning algorithm is capable of obtaining a good and robust nearly optimal tuning of the controller with stable and sufficiently fast convergence in all the considered scenarios in order to verify the correct tuning of the proposed solution the influence of the rl hyper parameters on system performance and response time is finally analysed cardenoso fernandez and caarls 2018 the remaining of the paper is organized as follows section 2 defines the mechanical architecture of the wec section 3 discusses the dynamic model of the wec and its model based tuning section 4 describes the application of q learning to the wec control problem section 5 reports simulation results and discussion section 6 analyses the influence of the rl hyper parameters section 7 is the conclusion section 2 design of the proposed oscillating arm wec with mechanical rectifier the proposed wec is based on a planar four bar linkage abco moving in a vertical plane fig 1 the mechanism is an evolution of the one proposed in albert et al 2017 instead of a flap type buoy a floating buoy d with hemisphere cylinder shape is rigidly connected to the rocker arm c moreover the four bar linkage dimensions have been modified in order to ensure better force transmission higher transmission angle and to allow the four bar recovery on the vertical wall of the breakwater in case of extreme weather conditions the rocker arm c is connected to the breakwater by a revolute joint point o a shorter rocker arm a is connected to the top of the breakwater by a further revolute joint a and as discussed below it transmits mechanical power to the rectifying and speed amplification stages the buoy motion caused by the waves is transferred to the rocker arm a by the rod b the low speed oscillating motion of rocker link a is transformed into a unidirectional rotational motion by a mechanical rectifier mr and then a gear speed multiplier mg is adopted to attain a higher rotation speed more suited as input for rotary electrical generators the mechanical rectifier fig 2 is equipped with two one way clutches owc and owc respectively located inside the gear wheels r and r which transfer torque in opposite directions when the buoy d moves down owc connects link a to the gear wheel r which actuates the input shaft of the gear speed multiplier mg by coupling with the gear wheel o when the buoy d moves up owc connects link a to the gear wheel r which actuates the gear wheel o and consequently mg through the interposition of the idle wheel id by this arrangement while the floating rocker arm c d oscillates the two one way clutches rectify the alternate input torque of the rocker arm a into a unidirectional input torque applied to the multiplier gearbox mg due to the very high input torques generated by the four bar mechanism the multiplier gearbox with speed ratio τ mg is introduced to allow for an electrical generator working at higher speed and consequently lower torque and size a flywheel fw is added to the output shaft of mg fast shaft to regularize the generator angular speed in order to have in the rectifying stage the same transmission ratio τ mr in both directions the following condition on gear tooth numbers must be satisfied 1 z r z o z r z o τ m r in fig 2 the gear train is characterized by z r z o and z r z o that is τ mr 1 table 1 collects the main geometrical functional and inertial features of the design considered in the following of the paper the functional design of the four bar has been attained taking into account the following requirements a sufficient operative range of heave motion 4 75 m of vertical motion of the centre of the buoy d corresponding to an inclination of 25 of the rocker arm c fig 3 ii and 3 iii the possibility of recovering the wec in vertical position leaning against breakwater wall in case of extreme waves fig 3 iv a good quality of the force transmission characteristics of the four bar linkage as regards this issue the lower part of fig 3 i ii iii shows the triangles of the forces acting on the rigid body c d in which r o is the reaction force in o r c is the reaction force in c exerted by con rod b f d is the sum of the external forces sea gravity acting on the buoy d assumed vertical the limited variations in the shapes of such triangles and the values the transmission angle close to 90 between con rod b and arm a in the three positions central extreme upper and lower demonstrate the good quality of force transmission of the four bar mechanism along all its operative range regarding other parameters they have been selected according to the results presented in albert et al 2017 an estimate of link masses and specifically for body c d mass by balancing gravity forces and static buoyancy force at reference position 3 dynamic model of the wec 3 1 overview of the wec dynamic model the dynamic behaviour of the presented wec is quite complex as the system comprises two non linear subsystems the four bar linkage and the mechanical rectifier as a consequence in particular due to the mechanical rectifier morales and benitez 2019 the most common modelling and control approaches usually adopted to study the wecs dynamics based on the linear system theory cannot be adopted for the system accordingly the system has been modelled using a numerical multibody approach in the simulink simmechanics environment russel et al 2016 as discussed in albert et al 2017 since the buoy is rigidly connected to the rocker arm c which is hinged to the breakwater its motion is a planar rotation around the point o fig 3 ii and 3 iii represent the extreme upper and lower working positions corresponding to a maximum heave motion range of 4 75 m but most frequent operative conditions are characterized by a much lower wave heights see section 3 2 therefore in the following for the calculation of the sea buoy interaction forces only the heaving motion of the buoy is considered which is a minor approximation for motions close to the central position of fig 3 i on the contrary the dynamic model of the pto takes into full account the 4 bar and one way clutches non linearities the motion of the buoy is caused by the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions with the waves here modelled according to the linear wave theory lwt implemented in time domain through the cummins approach folley 2016 the restoring force f res is proportional to the vertical displacement heaving motion of the floating rocker arm centre of pressure h fra considered coincident with the buoy centre 2 f r e s k b h f r a the hydrodynamic force f hd is the sum of two terms the exciting wave force f ext and the radiated wave force f rad hansen 2013 hansen et al 2013 folley 2016 the first force f ext is exerted on the buoy by the incoming wave including diffracted wave effects this non causal force can be found by the convolution 3 f e x t t i r f e x t t τ h s e a τ d τ where irf ext t is the impulse response function of the buoy in the vertical direction the second force f rad is exerted on the buoy by the radiated wave 4 f r a d m a d d h f r a 0 t i r f r a d t τ h f r a τ d τ f r a d a d d f r a d c o n v where m add is the buoy added mass at infinite frequency and irf rad t is the radiation force impulse response function of the buoy in the vertical direction the impulse response functions irf ext t and irf rad t and the added mass m add of the buoy have been numerically computed by means of the boundary element method bem using the software ansys aqwa in combination with the bemio module of the wave energy converter simulation tool wec sim wec sim 2019 folley 2016 for their determination a the reference geometric configuration of fig 3 i is adopted b only the forces between buoy d and water are considered while due to the design of the four bar the possible forces exerted by the water on arm c are not included b the breakwater is included in the aqwa model according to the selected reference geometry regarding the pto model the four bar linkage constitutes the first subsystem with 1 d o f for which assuming the rotation ϑ a of the rocker arm a as free coordinate the following constraint equations hold 5 h f r a f ϑ a h f r a f ϑ a ϑ a ϑ a τ f r a ϑ a ϑ a h f r a τ f r a ϑ a ϑ a ϑ 2 τ f r a ϑ a ϑ a in which τ f r a ϑ a is the variable velocity ratio between the angle ϑ a and the buoy vertical displacement h fra the dynamic model of this subsystem can be expressed by the following equation 6 j a ϑ a ϑ a 1 2 j a ϑ a ϑ a ϑ a 2 m a f r e s f e x t f r a d c o n v m d g τ f r a ϑ a m b g τ b ϑ a in which m a is the torque on the shaft of body a τ i ϑ a is the variable velocity ratio between the angle ϑ a and the vertical velocity of the centre of mass of the i th body j a is the total inertia of the four bar reduced to the free coordinate ϑ a fanghella et al 2003 calculated by taking into account the most relevant inertias and the floating buoy added mass m a d d 7 j a ϑ a j a m a d d m d τ f r a 2 ϑ a j c τ c 2 ϑ a m b τ b 2 ϑ a moments of inertia of rotating bodies are estimated assuming uniform mass distribution next the mechanical rectifier subsystem mr comprising a multiplication gear and the two owc transmits the torque m mg to the speed multiplier input shaft and the torque m a to link a its behaviour is represented by a torque balance equation dependent on input output angular speeds and accelerations the multiplication ratio τ mr and the efficiency η mr 8 m m g m a f ϑ m g ϑ a ϑ m g ϑ a τ m r η m r where ϑ m g is the rotation of the input shaft of the speed multiplier finally the last subsystem with a further d o f comprising the speed multiplier with ratio τ mg and efficiency η mg the flywheel j fw and the electrical generator is modelled by the following dynamic equation 9 j g e n ϑ g e n η m g m m g τ m g c p t o ϑ g e n in which ϑ g e n ω g e n is the rotation speed of the electric machine and j g e n j g e n j f w j m g is the total inertia of the subsystem reduced to the electric generator rotation according to previous discussion the dynamic model of the complete system can be organized into five main blocks as shown in fig 4 in which wec interactions with the rl controller discussed in section 4 are evidenced the sea level and exciting force block which transforms sea spectra into time histories as discussed in next subsection and computes the convolution integral of eq 3 by a fir filter dealing with non causal effects by a time shift register the block modelling restoring force f res and the radiation force f rad conv due to convolution computed by a fir filter the added mass component f rad add is included in the four bar mechanism block again computing convolution the four bar mechanism block comprising the added mass inertia forces f rad add the mechanical rectifier block dealing with the variable constraint topology caused by the two owc the block of multiplier gearbox flywheel and electric generator the generator control scheme whose optimization through reinforcement learning will be discussed in the next sections is chosen according to the widely used resistive model in which the pto applies to the system a torque force proportional to its speed shadman et al 2018 zang et al 2018 anderlini et al 2016 other possibilities have been presented and discussed in scientific literature see for example coe et al 2017 têtu 2017 some of them comprising reactive power flowing inversely from the electric generator to the floating body in the present case inverting the power flow in a controlled way is not feasible due to the presence of the mechanical rectifier that is purposely built to transmit power from the buoy to the electrical generator accordingly for the present study the resistive control strategy is adopted m g e n c p t o ϑ g e n fig 4 with the c pto parameter incessantly updated by the rl controller as discussed in section 4 finally fig 4 shows the interfaces of the wec dynamic model with the rl controller whose input signals are the sea state h sea t and generated power p out t whereas the output command is the value of the speed torque ratio c pto that eventually optimizes the system performance generated power before introducing rl the wec dynamic model was used to select optimal model based c pto values and the flywheel inertia according to the sea model discussed in section 3 2 the flywheel inertia cannot be dynamically tuned as a function of the sea state unless complex hydraulic or mechanical systems are introduced dang et al 2019 in the present work a fixed inertia flywheel is used to reduce the mechanical complexity and improve the system reliability in the real application due to the statistical distribution of the sea states and to the occasional occurrences of storms it is not profitable to design a wec capable of resisting in any possible condition therefore a monitoring system can be adopted measuring other physical quantities besides the ones represented in the block scheme of fig 4 for example the transmitted torques and the body a rotation in order to adapt the speed torque ratio c pto when the four bar mechanism and the transmission chain are too close to their structural limits moreover if the wave height furtherly increases in case of storm the wec can be set in the recovery position represented in fig 3 iv to avoid structural damages this policy for the structural protection of the wec can be implemented by means of an extension of the control scheme of fig 4 in order to use the system whenever possible and reducing energy harvesting or placing the wec in recovery mode only when it is necessary this extension of the control policy for the safeguard of the system is not discussed in the present paper 3 2 sea model as regards the sea model polychromatic irregular waves have been considered in this study based on the historical time series from 1979 to 2017 de santis et al 2015 for a site possibly selected for future prototype testing latitude 44 400 longitude 8 871 the sea state scatter diagram as a function of the mean wave period t 0 and of the significant wave height h s i e the mean wave height of the one third highest waves is given in fig 5 expressed in number of occurrences hours per year for each pair of values of the sea state parameters t 0 and h s a polychromatic random time history of the sea level can generated adopting the jonswap spectrum nath and ramsey 1976 and then generating the corresponding time series for h sea variable 3 3 model based tuning of the speed torque ratio figs 6 8 show simulation results in the time domain in case of a polychromatic wave with t 0 4 5 s h 1 6 m in this simulation the generator uses a pto speed torque ratio c pto 16 nms rad this value of c pto has been selected by means of the previously discussed multibody model in order to maximize to average generated power for this particular sea state therefore the system is working in near resonance conditions even if the concept of resonance can t be rigorously defined for a non linear system fig 6 shows the buoy centre heave h fra and the sea level h sea over a time window of 150 s while fig 8 represents the generator speed ω gen and power p gen over the same time window fig 7 shows in more details h fra and h sea i the sea force ii and the floating buoy heave speed h f r a iii for the last 50 s of the time window of figs 6 and 8 a comparison of the plots of 7 ii and 7 iii confirms that the system is near resonance conditions since velocity and force peaks occur almost contemporarily with a small time delay about 10 of the dominant period the fluctuation of the power fig 8 is quadratically related to the fluctuation of the speed of the generator due to the adopted control law of the generator m g e n c p t o ω g e n therefore p g e n c p t o ω g e n 2 in order to reduce these fluctuations a higher inertia for the flywheel can be used however the flywheel inertia influences also the total amount of generated energy since it reduced the readiness of the system therefore the value of the flywheel inertia has been tuned to maximize generated energy considering the sea model discussed in section 3 2 as stated in section 3 1 the magnitude of the power fluctuations is a consequence of this design choice in general if the sea state parameters h s and t 0 are measured the coefficient c pto can be tuned as a function of the sea state the response surfaces of fig 9 represent the generated power as a function of the sea state h s and t 0 jonswap spectrum for c pto ranging from 4 to 36 nms rad these surfaces intersect therefore it is profitable to select the value c pto opt which maximizes the power generation for each sea state the optimal values of c pto opt as a function of the sea state are represented by the response surface of fig 10 therefore once the relation c pto opt h s t 0 is precomputed off line by a model based approach such relation could in principle be used in the actual implementation of the wec control by selecting with a certain cadence the optimum value of the speed torque ratio c pto as a function of the current sea state in order to do this the recent past values of the sea level h sea t are measured over a sufficient time horizon to calculate the actual values of h s and t 0 holthuijsen 2007 such a model based control approach although very simple and computationally efficient has some relevant disadvantages the main drawback is that its effectiveness depends on the accuracy of the wec model in the evaluating of the function c pto opt h s t 0 while the multibody subsystem of the wec model can be considered rather accurate the assessment of the interaction forces between the floating buoy and the sea is more critical the lwt provides very accurate predictions for small motions of a single floating body but it does not consider relevant hydrodynamic effects such as viscous losses and becomes less accurate in case of large motion amplitude onshore location and many interacting floating buoys moreover the impulse response functions irf ext t and irf rad t and the added mass m add are computed by the bem on the basis of the sea bed configuration which is difficult to measure and can change over time in general model based control approaches although being theoretically very effective are affected in real applications by model uncertainties approximations and by the variations of system and environment characteristics over time to overcome these limitations a model free approach has been considered and in particular a reinforcement learning rl technique sutton and barto 2018 as discussed in the following sections this method allows to dynamically select the speed torque ratio c pto during wec operation without any model based potentially imprecise mapping c pto opt h s t 0 4 application of q learning to wec control 4 1 overview reinforcement learning is based on an agent characterized by a state s n which interacts with the external environment performing an action a n n is the discrete time index consequently after a time step the state of the agent changes to s n 1 and the outcome of the action determines a reward r n 1 the action is selected by a markov decision process mdp using a value function to estimate the future reward along the process the agent tries to learn a policy that is a behaviour which maximizes the total reward in the long period during the learning process it is necessary to balance two conflicting activities exploration and exploitation if the action selection was based only on the maximization of the reward function starting from the previous experience exploitation the agent would never visit new states which may provide higher rewards exploration therefore sometimes it is advantageous to perform exploration renouncing to exploitation especially until the agent has reached a consolidated knowledge of the relation state action reward there are three main classes of rl methods dynamic programming dp methods monte carlo mc methods and temporal difference td methods sutton and barto 2018 in the following the q learning method belonging to the td class will be considered since it is particularly suited to control continuous time mechanical systems khan et al 2012 the q learning method is based on the following discrete time equation value iteration update which updates the action value function q s a 10 q n 1 s n a n q n s n a n α n r n 1 γ max a a q n s n 1 a q n s n a n in eq 10 two main hyper parameters are present the discount factor γ which shifts preference towards immediate or future rewards the learning rate α n which determines how newly acquired knowledge overrides previous knowledge in the considered application q learning is used to tune the generator speed torque ratio c pto considering as a reward the mean generated power p avg over a period of time t h which coincides with the discrete time step of the algorithm nevertheless since the mean generated power is highly influenced by the variations of the significant wave height it is preferable to use p avg h s 2 as reward function moreover it has been demonstrated that the convergence of the learning process can be speeded up by raising this normalized value to a power anderlini et al 2016 therefore the following reward function is adopted 11 r p a v g h s 2 2 when considering real world polychromatic waves with t 0 to obtain a good estimate of the average generated power the instantaneous power must be averaged over a time window of at least 30t 0 anderlini et al 2016 so such time window is assumed as the basis to select the time step t h of the q learning algorithm and accordingly the interval t i t i 1 t t h t which is used to calculate h s t i 1 and t 0 t i 1 from the time history of the sea level h sea t holthuijsen 2007 4 2 state space and action space according to the model of section 3 the state variables are h s t 0 and c pto therefore the adopted rl state space is 12 s s s j k l h s j t 0 k c p t o l j 1 j k 1 k l 1 l the choice of the discretization of the state variables needs to be a compromise a large number of states sn j k l slows down the convergence whereas a small number of states decreases the accuracy of the algorithm policy wei et al 2015 in the following on the basis of the available history of sea states for the considered wec location see section 3 2 the following ranges have been considered h s 0 2 m 2 2 m in steps of 0 2 m t 0 2 5 s 8 5 s in steps of 0 5 s as regards the discretization of c pto based on the simulation results discussed in section 3 the following values are considered c pto 4 nms rad 36 nms rad in steps of δc pto 2 nms rad therefore j 11 k 13 l 17 sn 2431 the action space is 13 a a δ c p t o 0 δ c p t o since the states have in general three possible actions increasing c pto of δc pto keeping constant c pto decreasing c pto of δc pto except the states with minimum or maximum c pto which have only two possible actions not to exceed the limits consequently the size of the matrix q is sn an 2431 3 4 3 exploration and exploitation strategy the q learning agent follows an ε greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation sutton and barto 2018 at each step the action is 14 a n argmax a a q n s n a with probability 1 ε n e x p l o i t a t i o n random action with probability ε n e x p l o r a t i o n in eq 14 ε n is the exploration rate as already discussed in section 4 1 it is profitable to adopt a more frequent exploration choice in the initial stages when the agent knowledge is not consolidated and less frequent in the long term in order to increase the exploitation of the acquired knowledge therefore the exploration rate can be computed by taking into account the number of past visits to each state action collected in the matrix n s a according to the following relation 15 ε n ε 0 if n 0 ε 0 n if n 1 with a threshold on n 16 n i 1 a n n n s n a i n min ε the hyper parameter n min ε represents the number of visits of a state action combination after which the exploration rate starts to decrease the matrix n s a is also used to change the learning rate during the process 17 α n α 0 if n n s n a n n min α α 0 n n s n a n n min α if n n s n a n n min α this update algorithm differs from the one proposed in anderlini et al 2016 as it has been modified to obtain a smoother decrease of the learning rate when the number of visits of a state action combination reaches the value n min α 4 4 overall simulation scheme the overall scheme of the rl discrete time simulation implemented in matlab is composed of three main blocks updated at each time step with length t h for the simulation duration t sim fig 11 the wave model block provides the values of h s and t 0 these values can be based on a measured time history of real sea or on synthetic time histories used in the tuning phase of the rl algorithm the wec model block is derived from the wec dynamic model of fig 4 and provides the average generated power p avg as a function of the current sea state and of the current generator speed torque ratio a random variation with normal probability distribution is added in order to consider the stochastic nature of the process the q learning algorithm block is based on the discrete time implementation of eqs 10 11 14 17 considering the requirements recalled in section 4 1 and the occurrences matrix of fig 5 a discrete time step t h 150 s has been selected while the wave model block and the q learning algorithm block are directly implemented in matlab in discrete time the wec model block is based on the results of the continuous time wec dynamic model discussed in section 3 1 without directly incorporating it this model has been used to evaluate the average generated power p avg for any state related to the discretization discussed in section 4 2 using the wec parameters summarized in table 1 therefore sn 2431 continuous time simulations with duration of 2500s were run variable step solver ode23tb with maximum time step 5 10 2 s and minimum time step 1 10 6 s then the generated power has been averaged over the last 2000 s to exclude the initial transient state the results of these precomputed simulations have been collected in a three dimensional matrix p gen of dimension j k l in the rl simulation for each discrete time step of duration t h the average generated power p gen det n is first determined in the wec model block by interpolation from elements of the matrix p gen to reduce the effects of the discretization of the variables h s t 0 and c pto a random variation with relative standard deviation σ rel gen 2 5 is then applied to the deterministic value p gen det n to finally obtain the average generated power p avg n this simulation method allows to keep the simulation time acceptable while maintaining the possibility of investigating the effects of stochastic variations of the generated power on the rl algorithm effectiveness 5 simulation results and discussion in this section the following rl hyper parameters have been used ε 0 0 7 n min ε 25 α 0 0 7 n min α 25 γ 0 5 such values have been obtained starting from the ones suggested in anderlini et al 2016 and then applying variations in order to improve the stability of the rl convergence some parameter variations were necessary since the updated algorithm of the learning rate eq 17 has been modified with respect to anderlini et al 2016 in order to obtain a smoother transition when n n s n a n exceeds n min α the influence of the rl hyper parameters on efficiency and speed of convergence of the rl algorithm is discussed in section 6 5 1 polychromatic sea with constant hs and t0 constant polychromatic sea the first considered case study named constant polychromatic sea cps is related to a stochastic polychromatic wave with constant parameters h s 1 6 m and t 0 4 5 s fig 12 shows the convergence of the rl algorithm in tuning the speed torque ratio c pto according to the mapping c pto opt h s t 0 obtained by the matrix of simulations p gen the optimal value is c pto opt 1 6 m 4 5 s 16 nms rad it is possible to see that starting from c pto 0 nms rad the q learning algorithm converges to this value after about 7 h of simulated time afterwards there are some further exploration phases in which the system acquires experience by trying c pto variations although it always returns to the optimum value and the exploration frequency decreases with time fig 13 shows the comparison between the average generated power p avg and the generated power p opt extractable by constantly keeping c pto c pto opt model based approach the value of p avg can be occasionally higher than p opt due to the stochastic fluctuation of p avg with relative standard deviation σ rel gen however the steady state value of p avg fluctuates around p opt with local decreases corresponding to exploration phases figs 14 and 15 show the time histories of the exploration rate ε n and of the learning rate α n it is possible to see that when the algorithm converges to c pto 16 nms rad the element of the matrix n s n a n which corresponds to h s 1 6 m t 0 4 5 s c pto 16 nms rad δc pto 0 nms rad starts to increase constantly giving rise to the decreasing envelopes of ε n and α n whereas higher values spikes correspond to random exploration steps 5 2 polychromatic sea with sinusoidal laws of hs and t0 sinusoidal polychromatic sea in this case study named sinusoidal polychromatic sea sps a continuous variation of h s and t 0 is considered with the following laws 18 h s t 1 0 6 sin 2 π 24 3600 t 19 t 0 t 3 5 0 7 sin 2 π 24 3600 t corresponding to a sinusoidal cycle with 1 day period for the two parameters of the stochastic polychromatic wave in case of continuously varying sea parameters the learning process is obviously slower figs 16 18 show the time histories of c pto ε n and α n over 20 days of simulation time with reference to fig 16 it is possible to note that the speed torque ratio c pto starts to follow a pseudo sinusoidal discretized cycle after about 10 days with decreasing exploration phases fig 19 shows the comparison between the generated power p avg and maximum extractable power p opt with model based tuning whereas fig 20 shows their ratio η gen p avg p opt also in this case η gen converges but to a mean value slightly lower than the unit due to the discretization of the speed torque ratio 5 3 polychromatic sea with experimentally recorded hs and t0 historical polychromatic sea in the last case study named historical polychromatic sea hps the polychromatic waves are generated by jonswap spectrum with time varying parameter h s and t 0 based on the recorded historical time series of sea state for the considered site corresponding to the occurrence matrix of fig 5 over two years the time histories of h s and t 0 are shown in figs 21 and 22 figs 23 and 24 compare p avg and p opt respectively over the whole 2 years period and over 10 days whereas fig 25 shows the time history of their ratio η gen in blue and its moving average over 25 days in red for this type of sea it is possible to see that the convergence of the rl algorithm is slower as it takes about 4 months to reach a relatively steady state condition of η gen which oscillates around a mean value of 0 954 slightly lower than the steady state value of the second case study also in this case this lower performance with respect to a model based approach with continuous tuning of the generator speed torque ratio is probably due to the discretization of the values of the c pto speed torque ratio adopted for rl implementation 6 influence of the rl hyper parameters on system performance the simulations reported in the previous section are subject to random variations due to the pseudo random generation of the sea time histories of the polychromatic waves obtained by the jonswap spectrum to the ε greedy decision process of the agent discussed in section 4 3 and to the gaussian noise added to the generated power therefore in order to properly analyse the influence of the rl hyper parameters it is necessary to perform several simulations for each set of parameters to obtain an estimate of the performance indexes accordingly a numeric optimization of the 5 rl hyper parameters ε 0 α 0 n min α n min ε γ also taking into account of the variability and randomness of sea states may require hundreds of thousand simulations thus rapidly becoming computationally intractable in the historical polychromatic sea case study to face this problem the sensitivity of the system to the rl hyper parameters has been preliminarily investigated considering the sinusoidal polychromatic sea case study presented in section 5 2 starting from the initial values used for the simulations of section 5 ε 0 0 7 n min ε 25 α 0 0 7 n min α 25 γ 0 5 the influence of the exploration parameters ε 0 n min ε on the steady state value of η gen and on the learning speed of the rl algorithm has been first considered in particular the steady state value η gen ss is averaged over the last third of the simulation time 20 days for the sps simulation and then over 20 simulations with the same set of parameters the learning speed of the rl is quantified similarly to the definition of settling time in control theory by determining the convergence time t c in which η gen exceeds 0 9 again averaged over 20 simulations with the same set of parameters likewise also the influence of the learning hyper parameters α 0 n min ε on the steady state value of η gen and to the learning velocity of the rl algorithm has been studied in terms of η gen ss and t c the results are shown in figs 26 and 27 from the results shown above it is possible to summarize that values of n min ε and n min α higher than 20 are necessary to obtain satisfying values of η gen ss moreover for low values of n min ε and n min α the convergence time t c is higher than 20 days the surfaces of fig 26 ii and fig 27 ii are truncated due to lack of convergence of rl algorithm in the range of acceptable values of n min ε and n min α the sensitivities of both η gen ss and t c w r t α 0 and ε 0 are rather low and values close to 0 5 are acceptable for both parameters as regards the discount factor γ its influence on the rl algorithm performance has been studied directly on the hps case study averaging over 10 simulations for each value of γ fig 28 shows the values of η gen ss and t c as a function of the discount factor it is possible to note that for γ 0 4 both η gen ss and t c assume almost optimal values and are rather insensitive to further γ increase at the same time it is worth noting that even in optimal conditions the factor η gen ss does not reach the unit value this undesired effect is mainly due to the discretization of the speed torque ratio c pto values adopted for the rl algorithm as already discussed in section 5 a finer discretization could be considered but it can cause negative effects on convergence speed and stability after trials with different values a discretization of 2 nms rad has been selected as a good compromise between steady state efficiency convergence speed and convergence stability finally the presented algorithm has been tested also in the hps case confirming that the ranges of rl hyper parameters selected through the sps analysis are also valid in such a more general case and that the system response is relatively invariant and robust for values in the following ranges ε 0 0 5 0 7 n min ε 25 30 α 0 0 5 0 7 n min α 25 30 γ 0 5 0 7 7 conclusions the paper discusses the application of a q learning algorithm to the tuning of the pto parameter of an oscillating arm wec with mechanical rectifier the dynamics of the system is non linear in particular for the presence of the mechanical rectifier a linear speed torque ratio is imposed to the electric generator with a coefficient which is tuned by the q learning algorithm simulation results have shown that this approach with the proposed laws for continuous updating of the exploration rate and learning rate can effectively tune the speed torque ratio of the electrical generator of the proposed wec both for specific and real world sea states the main drawbacks of the method as compared to a model based one may be listed as follows i only a sub optimal tuning can be provided since discrete values of the speed torque ratio are imposed ii for time varying real world sea states at the beginning of the wec working life a learning period of non negligible length is required on the other side there are evident benefits in the proposed rl approach mainly due to being completely model free thereby avoiding any modelling approximation and at the same time being capable of tuning the system performance fairly close to theoretical optimal behaviour although in general the convenience of a model based control with respect to the proposed model free scheme depends on the accuracy of the available wec model it is worth noting that the complexity e g cfd or unavoidable limitations e g linear wave theory of the most used modelling methods make scientifically and technologically relevant the exploration and exploitation of robust model free approaches such as the one presented in the paper in the following of the research a reduced scale prototype of the wec will be realized first to validate the estimate of the power generation capability obtained by the dynamic models and then to investigate the implementation issues of rl on a real system a parallel research direction will be the adoption of more advanced rl techniques with continuous action space such as deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg and soft actor critic sac methods suitable for a continuous tuning of the electric generator static characteristic funding this research did not receive any

21876,the paper discusses the application of reinforcement learning to the control of an onshore wave energy converter wec the proposed wec features a simple and low cost architecture it is characterized by an oscillating floating rocker arm which moves a four bar linkage in the vertical plane a mechanical rectifier based on two one way clutches and a multiplier gearbox transforms the low speed oscillating motion of the four bar into a higher speed unidirectional rotation of the electrical generator the dynamic model of the wec based on multibody approach and linear wave theory is presented then a reinforcement learning rl algorithm a q learning method is applied to dynamically adjust the generator speed torque ratio as a function of the sea state simulation results show the effectiveness of this model free adaptive control in tuning the system in order to maximize the generated power starting from a simple monochromatic model of the sea the presented approach is verified according to sea conditions of increasing complexity and finally to long term time series obtained from measurements of real sea states in the considered geographical region the tuning of the hyper parameters of rl algorithm with respect to the speed of convergence and optimality of generated power is also discussed keywords wec oscillating arm linear wave theory reinforcement learning q learning 1 introduction although examples of sea wave energy harnessing date back to the thirteenth century cruz 2008 this enormous source of renewable energy is still poorly exploited in comparison with its potential in general as pointed out in several analyses and reports magagna et al 2016 pecher and kofoed 2017 mwasilu and jung 2019 wave energy converters wecs are mostly at an early stage when compared to other renewable energy plants there are few examples of systems having reached operative technology readiness level trl and the attainable levelized cost of energy lcoe is very far from more developed renewable sources as a matter of fact recent reports on renewable energies do not even consider sea energy in the cost analysis irena 2019 on one side the present state of wecs demonstrates that a long and difficult walk has yet to be done before achieving sufficient trl and economic competitiveness on the other side the awareness of the huge amount of available clean energy from this source greatly stimulates scientific and engineering research also to attain the ambitious generation targets stated for the next decades melikoglu 2018 towards this end the paper discusses an efficient model free robust approach based on reinforcement learning sutton and barto 2018 to dynamically tune the control parameter of the electric generator of a wec in order to optimize electric power generation in operation condition as a function of the sea state the work takes significant contributions from the works of anderlini et al 2016 and anderlini et al 2018 that already adopted rl for a similar task but it extends its application to a more complex nonlinear mechanical architecture introduced in albert et al 2017 moreover the tuning of rl hyper parameters is discussed in detail and the application of the approach is verified by studying its dynamic behaviour with respect to a large numbers of real sea states obtained from measurements over a long period of time bozzi et al 2018 de santis et al 2015 in the last years a wide variety of wecs has been proposed they can be classified on the basis of their location onshore nearshore offshore of their size and orientation with respect to the incoming wave of their working principle and of their power take off system air turbines hydraulic systems linear generators uihlein and magagna 2016 falnes 2007 falcao 2010 lópez et al 2013 drew et al 2009 folley and whittaker 2009 têtu 2017 considering the state of the art of wecs the tendency is to develop above all point absorber wecs for their lower complexity and cost lópez et al 2013 as regards power take off systems electrical linear generators polinder et al 2003 polinder et al 2004 transform directly the harvested mechanical power into electrical power with high conversion efficiency and relatively simple mechanical layout the main drawbacks are the high cost of linear generators in particular in case of big size and the critical protection from saltwater damages in general due to the extremely hard and unpredictable operative conditions of the marine environment reliability and easiness of installation maintenance are aspects of primary importance in wec design thies et al 2009 as a consequence some researchers have recently proposed onshore wecs based on oscillating arms hinged to shore and carrying floating buoys with heave motion examples are the wavestar by the danish wavestar energy wavestar 2019 frigaard et al 2016 marquis et al 2012 the wecs of the israeli eco wave power eco wave power 2019 the power plant realized at the port of pecem by the coppe institute of the federal university of rio de janeiro estefen et al 2010 the power take off systems of these oscillating arm wecs are placed onshore with great benefits for installation and maintenance in albert et al 2017 an innovative oscillating arm wec has been proposed characterized by a low cost mechanical architecture based on a four bar linkage the lower link is a floating rocker arm moved by the wave forces whereas the upper rocker arm is connected to a rotating electric generator via a transmission composed of a mechanical rectifier morales and benitez 2019 liang et al 2017 based on a pair of one way clutches and a speed multiplier gearbox the main difference between the proposed design and other oscillating arm wecs is the adoption of a rotating mechanical transmission with mechanical rectifier while for example the pto systems of wavestar eco wave power and coppe institute are based on the interposition of pneumatic or hydraulic transmission lines on the other hand the wec proposed in liang et al 2017 is equipped with a mechanical rectifier with two one way clutches but within a different architecture an offshore floating buoy containing the electrical machine is in relative translational motion with respect to a vertical shaft moored to the seabed the main benefits of the proposed solution are the following wave energy is transformed into electrical energy by means of a mechanical transmission and a rotating electric generator therefore conversion efficiency and reliability are high all the kinematic joints are revolute and gear pairs which are preferable over prismatic joints needed for rectilinear motion in terms of mechanical efficiency cost and durability the construction of the four bar linkage is simple without particular technological and fabrication requirements electrical linear generators are avoided and the transmission elements one way clutches speed multiplier gearbox electrical generator are off the shelf consequently costs are lower in coiro et al 2016 a similar wec concept has been proposed based on a floating rocker arm and an electromechanical generator but the power take off is via a ball screw system and consequently the electric generator executes an oscillatory motion on the contrary in the proposed wec the generator motion is unidirectional with relatively constant rotational speed also thanks to the adoption of a flywheel to store kinetic energy and regularize generator motion and power production one of the main issues in wec design is the choice of the control scheme for the pto that may significantly affect power generation efficiency ringwood et al 2014 several control strategies rely on dynamic models of the wecs mostly derived under the assumption of non causal linear systems coe et al 2017 ringwood et al 2014 unfortunately the dynamic interaction between wecs and sea waves is rather complex and modelling imprecisions may affect the performances of model based control schemes monarcha fernandes and fonseca 2013 ti et al 2018 accordingly some researchers have recently proposed model free adaptive algorithms based on reinforcement learning rl techniques sutton and barto 2018 capable of tuning the control parameters as a function of the sea state and system functioning conditions anderlini et al 2016 2018 in general beyond such contributions there is an increasing interest to apply machine learning techniques to the sea wave power generation topics for example in li et al 2019 an artificial neural network is adopted to optimize the latching control of a heaving buoy whereas cuadra et al 2016 provides an overview of computational intelligence applications to wave energy in the present paper a particular rl approach the q learning sutton and barto 2018 is applied to optimize the control parameter of the proposed oscillating arm wec as a function of the sea state after setting up the rl algorithm a large number of simulations have been performed to tune and validate it with increasing levels of complexity in the sea models polychromatic sea with constant mean wave period t 0 and of the significant wave height h s polychromatic sea with t 0 and h s varying continuously with sinusoidal law random polychromatic sea varying according to the parameters of an experimentally recorded wave history simulation results show that the proposed q learning algorithm is capable of obtaining a good and robust nearly optimal tuning of the controller with stable and sufficiently fast convergence in all the considered scenarios in order to verify the correct tuning of the proposed solution the influence of the rl hyper parameters on system performance and response time is finally analysed cardenoso fernandez and caarls 2018 the remaining of the paper is organized as follows section 2 defines the mechanical architecture of the wec section 3 discusses the dynamic model of the wec and its model based tuning section 4 describes the application of q learning to the wec control problem section 5 reports simulation results and discussion section 6 analyses the influence of the rl hyper parameters section 7 is the conclusion section 2 design of the proposed oscillating arm wec with mechanical rectifier the proposed wec is based on a planar four bar linkage abco moving in a vertical plane fig 1 the mechanism is an evolution of the one proposed in albert et al 2017 instead of a flap type buoy a floating buoy d with hemisphere cylinder shape is rigidly connected to the rocker arm c moreover the four bar linkage dimensions have been modified in order to ensure better force transmission higher transmission angle and to allow the four bar recovery on the vertical wall of the breakwater in case of extreme weather conditions the rocker arm c is connected to the breakwater by a revolute joint point o a shorter rocker arm a is connected to the top of the breakwater by a further revolute joint a and as discussed below it transmits mechanical power to the rectifying and speed amplification stages the buoy motion caused by the waves is transferred to the rocker arm a by the rod b the low speed oscillating motion of rocker link a is transformed into a unidirectional rotational motion by a mechanical rectifier mr and then a gear speed multiplier mg is adopted to attain a higher rotation speed more suited as input for rotary electrical generators the mechanical rectifier fig 2 is equipped with two one way clutches owc and owc respectively located inside the gear wheels r and r which transfer torque in opposite directions when the buoy d moves down owc connects link a to the gear wheel r which actuates the input shaft of the gear speed multiplier mg by coupling with the gear wheel o when the buoy d moves up owc connects link a to the gear wheel r which actuates the gear wheel o and consequently mg through the interposition of the idle wheel id by this arrangement while the floating rocker arm c d oscillates the two one way clutches rectify the alternate input torque of the rocker arm a into a unidirectional input torque applied to the multiplier gearbox mg due to the very high input torques generated by the four bar mechanism the multiplier gearbox with speed ratio τ mg is introduced to allow for an electrical generator working at higher speed and consequently lower torque and size a flywheel fw is added to the output shaft of mg fast shaft to regularize the generator angular speed in order to have in the rectifying stage the same transmission ratio τ mr in both directions the following condition on gear tooth numbers must be satisfied 1 z r z o z r z o τ m r in fig 2 the gear train is characterized by z r z o and z r z o that is τ mr 1 table 1 collects the main geometrical functional and inertial features of the design considered in the following of the paper the functional design of the four bar has been attained taking into account the following requirements a sufficient operative range of heave motion 4 75 m of vertical motion of the centre of the buoy d corresponding to an inclination of 25 of the rocker arm c fig 3 ii and 3 iii the possibility of recovering the wec in vertical position leaning against breakwater wall in case of extreme waves fig 3 iv a good quality of the force transmission characteristics of the four bar linkage as regards this issue the lower part of fig 3 i ii iii shows the triangles of the forces acting on the rigid body c d in which r o is the reaction force in o r c is the reaction force in c exerted by con rod b f d is the sum of the external forces sea gravity acting on the buoy d assumed vertical the limited variations in the shapes of such triangles and the values the transmission angle close to 90 between con rod b and arm a in the three positions central extreme upper and lower demonstrate the good quality of force transmission of the four bar mechanism along all its operative range regarding other parameters they have been selected according to the results presented in albert et al 2017 an estimate of link masses and specifically for body c d mass by balancing gravity forces and static buoyancy force at reference position 3 dynamic model of the wec 3 1 overview of the wec dynamic model the dynamic behaviour of the presented wec is quite complex as the system comprises two non linear subsystems the four bar linkage and the mechanical rectifier as a consequence in particular due to the mechanical rectifier morales and benitez 2019 the most common modelling and control approaches usually adopted to study the wecs dynamics based on the linear system theory cannot be adopted for the system accordingly the system has been modelled using a numerical multibody approach in the simulink simmechanics environment russel et al 2016 as discussed in albert et al 2017 since the buoy is rigidly connected to the rocker arm c which is hinged to the breakwater its motion is a planar rotation around the point o fig 3 ii and 3 iii represent the extreme upper and lower working positions corresponding to a maximum heave motion range of 4 75 m but most frequent operative conditions are characterized by a much lower wave heights see section 3 2 therefore in the following for the calculation of the sea buoy interaction forces only the heaving motion of the buoy is considered which is a minor approximation for motions close to the central position of fig 3 i on the contrary the dynamic model of the pto takes into full account the 4 bar and one way clutches non linearities the motion of the buoy is caused by the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic interactions with the waves here modelled according to the linear wave theory lwt implemented in time domain through the cummins approach folley 2016 the restoring force f res is proportional to the vertical displacement heaving motion of the floating rocker arm centre of pressure h fra considered coincident with the buoy centre 2 f r e s k b h f r a the hydrodynamic force f hd is the sum of two terms the exciting wave force f ext and the radiated wave force f rad hansen 2013 hansen et al 2013 folley 2016 the first force f ext is exerted on the buoy by the incoming wave including diffracted wave effects this non causal force can be found by the convolution 3 f e x t t i r f e x t t τ h s e a τ d τ where irf ext t is the impulse response function of the buoy in the vertical direction the second force f rad is exerted on the buoy by the radiated wave 4 f r a d m a d d h f r a 0 t i r f r a d t τ h f r a τ d τ f r a d a d d f r a d c o n v where m add is the buoy added mass at infinite frequency and irf rad t is the radiation force impulse response function of the buoy in the vertical direction the impulse response functions irf ext t and irf rad t and the added mass m add of the buoy have been numerically computed by means of the boundary element method bem using the software ansys aqwa in combination with the bemio module of the wave energy converter simulation tool wec sim wec sim 2019 folley 2016 for their determination a the reference geometric configuration of fig 3 i is adopted b only the forces between buoy d and water are considered while due to the design of the four bar the possible forces exerted by the water on arm c are not included b the breakwater is included in the aqwa model according to the selected reference geometry regarding the pto model the four bar linkage constitutes the first subsystem with 1 d o f for which assuming the rotation ϑ a of the rocker arm a as free coordinate the following constraint equations hold 5 h f r a f ϑ a h f r a f ϑ a ϑ a ϑ a τ f r a ϑ a ϑ a h f r a τ f r a ϑ a ϑ a ϑ 2 τ f r a ϑ a ϑ a in which τ f r a ϑ a is the variable velocity ratio between the angle ϑ a and the buoy vertical displacement h fra the dynamic model of this subsystem can be expressed by the following equation 6 j a ϑ a ϑ a 1 2 j a ϑ a ϑ a ϑ a 2 m a f r e s f e x t f r a d c o n v m d g τ f r a ϑ a m b g τ b ϑ a in which m a is the torque on the shaft of body a τ i ϑ a is the variable velocity ratio between the angle ϑ a and the vertical velocity of the centre of mass of the i th body j a is the total inertia of the four bar reduced to the free coordinate ϑ a fanghella et al 2003 calculated by taking into account the most relevant inertias and the floating buoy added mass m a d d 7 j a ϑ a j a m a d d m d τ f r a 2 ϑ a j c τ c 2 ϑ a m b τ b 2 ϑ a moments of inertia of rotating bodies are estimated assuming uniform mass distribution next the mechanical rectifier subsystem mr comprising a multiplication gear and the two owc transmits the torque m mg to the speed multiplier input shaft and the torque m a to link a its behaviour is represented by a torque balance equation dependent on input output angular speeds and accelerations the multiplication ratio τ mr and the efficiency η mr 8 m m g m a f ϑ m g ϑ a ϑ m g ϑ a τ m r η m r where ϑ m g is the rotation of the input shaft of the speed multiplier finally the last subsystem with a further d o f comprising the speed multiplier with ratio τ mg and efficiency η mg the flywheel j fw and the electrical generator is modelled by the following dynamic equation 9 j g e n ϑ g e n η m g m m g τ m g c p t o ϑ g e n in which ϑ g e n ω g e n is the rotation speed of the electric machine and j g e n j g e n j f w j m g is the total inertia of the subsystem reduced to the electric generator rotation according to previous discussion the dynamic model of the complete system can be organized into five main blocks as shown in fig 4 in which wec interactions with the rl controller discussed in section 4 are evidenced the sea level and exciting force block which transforms sea spectra into time histories as discussed in next subsection and computes the convolution integral of eq 3 by a fir filter dealing with non causal effects by a time shift register the block modelling restoring force f res and the radiation force f rad conv due to convolution computed by a fir filter the added mass component f rad add is included in the four bar mechanism block again computing convolution the four bar mechanism block comprising the added mass inertia forces f rad add the mechanical rectifier block dealing with the variable constraint topology caused by the two owc the block of multiplier gearbox flywheel and electric generator the generator control scheme whose optimization through reinforcement learning will be discussed in the next sections is chosen according to the widely used resistive model in which the pto applies to the system a torque force proportional to its speed shadman et al 2018 zang et al 2018 anderlini et al 2016 other possibilities have been presented and discussed in scientific literature see for example coe et al 2017 têtu 2017 some of them comprising reactive power flowing inversely from the electric generator to the floating body in the present case inverting the power flow in a controlled way is not feasible due to the presence of the mechanical rectifier that is purposely built to transmit power from the buoy to the electrical generator accordingly for the present study the resistive control strategy is adopted m g e n c p t o ϑ g e n fig 4 with the c pto parameter incessantly updated by the rl controller as discussed in section 4 finally fig 4 shows the interfaces of the wec dynamic model with the rl controller whose input signals are the sea state h sea t and generated power p out t whereas the output command is the value of the speed torque ratio c pto that eventually optimizes the system performance generated power before introducing rl the wec dynamic model was used to select optimal model based c pto values and the flywheel inertia according to the sea model discussed in section 3 2 the flywheel inertia cannot be dynamically tuned as a function of the sea state unless complex hydraulic or mechanical systems are introduced dang et al 2019 in the present work a fixed inertia flywheel is used to reduce the mechanical complexity and improve the system reliability in the real application due to the statistical distribution of the sea states and to the occasional occurrences of storms it is not profitable to design a wec capable of resisting in any possible condition therefore a monitoring system can be adopted measuring other physical quantities besides the ones represented in the block scheme of fig 4 for example the transmitted torques and the body a rotation in order to adapt the speed torque ratio c pto when the four bar mechanism and the transmission chain are too close to their structural limits moreover if the wave height furtherly increases in case of storm the wec can be set in the recovery position represented in fig 3 iv to avoid structural damages this policy for the structural protection of the wec can be implemented by means of an extension of the control scheme of fig 4 in order to use the system whenever possible and reducing energy harvesting or placing the wec in recovery mode only when it is necessary this extension of the control policy for the safeguard of the system is not discussed in the present paper 3 2 sea model as regards the sea model polychromatic irregular waves have been considered in this study based on the historical time series from 1979 to 2017 de santis et al 2015 for a site possibly selected for future prototype testing latitude 44 400 longitude 8 871 the sea state scatter diagram as a function of the mean wave period t 0 and of the significant wave height h s i e the mean wave height of the one third highest waves is given in fig 5 expressed in number of occurrences hours per year for each pair of values of the sea state parameters t 0 and h s a polychromatic random time history of the sea level can generated adopting the jonswap spectrum nath and ramsey 1976 and then generating the corresponding time series for h sea variable 3 3 model based tuning of the speed torque ratio figs 6 8 show simulation results in the time domain in case of a polychromatic wave with t 0 4 5 s h 1 6 m in this simulation the generator uses a pto speed torque ratio c pto 16 nms rad this value of c pto has been selected by means of the previously discussed multibody model in order to maximize to average generated power for this particular sea state therefore the system is working in near resonance conditions even if the concept of resonance can t be rigorously defined for a non linear system fig 6 shows the buoy centre heave h fra and the sea level h sea over a time window of 150 s while fig 8 represents the generator speed ω gen and power p gen over the same time window fig 7 shows in more details h fra and h sea i the sea force ii and the floating buoy heave speed h f r a iii for the last 50 s of the time window of figs 6 and 8 a comparison of the plots of 7 ii and 7 iii confirms that the system is near resonance conditions since velocity and force peaks occur almost contemporarily with a small time delay about 10 of the dominant period the fluctuation of the power fig 8 is quadratically related to the fluctuation of the speed of the generator due to the adopted control law of the generator m g e n c p t o ω g e n therefore p g e n c p t o ω g e n 2 in order to reduce these fluctuations a higher inertia for the flywheel can be used however the flywheel inertia influences also the total amount of generated energy since it reduced the readiness of the system therefore the value of the flywheel inertia has been tuned to maximize generated energy considering the sea model discussed in section 3 2 as stated in section 3 1 the magnitude of the power fluctuations is a consequence of this design choice in general if the sea state parameters h s and t 0 are measured the coefficient c pto can be tuned as a function of the sea state the response surfaces of fig 9 represent the generated power as a function of the sea state h s and t 0 jonswap spectrum for c pto ranging from 4 to 36 nms rad these surfaces intersect therefore it is profitable to select the value c pto opt which maximizes the power generation for each sea state the optimal values of c pto opt as a function of the sea state are represented by the response surface of fig 10 therefore once the relation c pto opt h s t 0 is precomputed off line by a model based approach such relation could in principle be used in the actual implementation of the wec control by selecting with a certain cadence the optimum value of the speed torque ratio c pto as a function of the current sea state in order to do this the recent past values of the sea level h sea t are measured over a sufficient time horizon to calculate the actual values of h s and t 0 holthuijsen 2007 such a model based control approach although very simple and computationally efficient has some relevant disadvantages the main drawback is that its effectiveness depends on the accuracy of the wec model in the evaluating of the function c pto opt h s t 0 while the multibody subsystem of the wec model can be considered rather accurate the assessment of the interaction forces between the floating buoy and the sea is more critical the lwt provides very accurate predictions for small motions of a single floating body but it does not consider relevant hydrodynamic effects such as viscous losses and becomes less accurate in case of large motion amplitude onshore location and many interacting floating buoys moreover the impulse response functions irf ext t and irf rad t and the added mass m add are computed by the bem on the basis of the sea bed configuration which is difficult to measure and can change over time in general model based control approaches although being theoretically very effective are affected in real applications by model uncertainties approximations and by the variations of system and environment characteristics over time to overcome these limitations a model free approach has been considered and in particular a reinforcement learning rl technique sutton and barto 2018 as discussed in the following sections this method allows to dynamically select the speed torque ratio c pto during wec operation without any model based potentially imprecise mapping c pto opt h s t 0 4 application of q learning to wec control 4 1 overview reinforcement learning is based on an agent characterized by a state s n which interacts with the external environment performing an action a n n is the discrete time index consequently after a time step the state of the agent changes to s n 1 and the outcome of the action determines a reward r n 1 the action is selected by a markov decision process mdp using a value function to estimate the future reward along the process the agent tries to learn a policy that is a behaviour which maximizes the total reward in the long period during the learning process it is necessary to balance two conflicting activities exploration and exploitation if the action selection was based only on the maximization of the reward function starting from the previous experience exploitation the agent would never visit new states which may provide higher rewards exploration therefore sometimes it is advantageous to perform exploration renouncing to exploitation especially until the agent has reached a consolidated knowledge of the relation state action reward there are three main classes of rl methods dynamic programming dp methods monte carlo mc methods and temporal difference td methods sutton and barto 2018 in the following the q learning method belonging to the td class will be considered since it is particularly suited to control continuous time mechanical systems khan et al 2012 the q learning method is based on the following discrete time equation value iteration update which updates the action value function q s a 10 q n 1 s n a n q n s n a n α n r n 1 γ max a a q n s n 1 a q n s n a n in eq 10 two main hyper parameters are present the discount factor γ which shifts preference towards immediate or future rewards the learning rate α n which determines how newly acquired knowledge overrides previous knowledge in the considered application q learning is used to tune the generator speed torque ratio c pto considering as a reward the mean generated power p avg over a period of time t h which coincides with the discrete time step of the algorithm nevertheless since the mean generated power is highly influenced by the variations of the significant wave height it is preferable to use p avg h s 2 as reward function moreover it has been demonstrated that the convergence of the learning process can be speeded up by raising this normalized value to a power anderlini et al 2016 therefore the following reward function is adopted 11 r p a v g h s 2 2 when considering real world polychromatic waves with t 0 to obtain a good estimate of the average generated power the instantaneous power must be averaged over a time window of at least 30t 0 anderlini et al 2016 so such time window is assumed as the basis to select the time step t h of the q learning algorithm and accordingly the interval t i t i 1 t t h t which is used to calculate h s t i 1 and t 0 t i 1 from the time history of the sea level h sea t holthuijsen 2007 4 2 state space and action space according to the model of section 3 the state variables are h s t 0 and c pto therefore the adopted rl state space is 12 s s s j k l h s j t 0 k c p t o l j 1 j k 1 k l 1 l the choice of the discretization of the state variables needs to be a compromise a large number of states sn j k l slows down the convergence whereas a small number of states decreases the accuracy of the algorithm policy wei et al 2015 in the following on the basis of the available history of sea states for the considered wec location see section 3 2 the following ranges have been considered h s 0 2 m 2 2 m in steps of 0 2 m t 0 2 5 s 8 5 s in steps of 0 5 s as regards the discretization of c pto based on the simulation results discussed in section 3 the following values are considered c pto 4 nms rad 36 nms rad in steps of δc pto 2 nms rad therefore j 11 k 13 l 17 sn 2431 the action space is 13 a a δ c p t o 0 δ c p t o since the states have in general three possible actions increasing c pto of δc pto keeping constant c pto decreasing c pto of δc pto except the states with minimum or maximum c pto which have only two possible actions not to exceed the limits consequently the size of the matrix q is sn an 2431 3 4 3 exploration and exploitation strategy the q learning agent follows an ε greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation sutton and barto 2018 at each step the action is 14 a n argmax a a q n s n a with probability 1 ε n e x p l o i t a t i o n random action with probability ε n e x p l o r a t i o n in eq 14 ε n is the exploration rate as already discussed in section 4 1 it is profitable to adopt a more frequent exploration choice in the initial stages when the agent knowledge is not consolidated and less frequent in the long term in order to increase the exploitation of the acquired knowledge therefore the exploration rate can be computed by taking into account the number of past visits to each state action collected in the matrix n s a according to the following relation 15 ε n ε 0 if n 0 ε 0 n if n 1 with a threshold on n 16 n i 1 a n n n s n a i n min ε the hyper parameter n min ε represents the number of visits of a state action combination after which the exploration rate starts to decrease the matrix n s a is also used to change the learning rate during the process 17 α n α 0 if n n s n a n n min α α 0 n n s n a n n min α if n n s n a n n min α this update algorithm differs from the one proposed in anderlini et al 2016 as it has been modified to obtain a smoother decrease of the learning rate when the number of visits of a state action combination reaches the value n min α 4 4 overall simulation scheme the overall scheme of the rl discrete time simulation implemented in matlab is composed of three main blocks updated at each time step with length t h for the simulation duration t sim fig 11 the wave model block provides the values of h s and t 0 these values can be based on a measured time history of real sea or on synthetic time histories used in the tuning phase of the rl algorithm the wec model block is derived from the wec dynamic model of fig 4 and provides the average generated power p avg as a function of the current sea state and of the current generator speed torque ratio a random variation with normal probability distribution is added in order to consider the stochastic nature of the process the q learning algorithm block is based on the discrete time implementation of eqs 10 11 14 17 considering the requirements recalled in section 4 1 and the occurrences matrix of fig 5 a discrete time step t h 150 s has been selected while the wave model block and the q learning algorithm block are directly implemented in matlab in discrete time the wec model block is based on the results of the continuous time wec dynamic model discussed in section 3 1 without directly incorporating it this model has been used to evaluate the average generated power p avg for any state related to the discretization discussed in section 4 2 using the wec parameters summarized in table 1 therefore sn 2431 continuous time simulations with duration of 2500s were run variable step solver ode23tb with maximum time step 5 10 2 s and minimum time step 1 10 6 s then the generated power has been averaged over the last 2000 s to exclude the initial transient state the results of these precomputed simulations have been collected in a three dimensional matrix p gen of dimension j k l in the rl simulation for each discrete time step of duration t h the average generated power p gen det n is first determined in the wec model block by interpolation from elements of the matrix p gen to reduce the effects of the discretization of the variables h s t 0 and c pto a random variation with relative standard deviation σ rel gen 2 5 is then applied to the deterministic value p gen det n to finally obtain the average generated power p avg n this simulation method allows to keep the simulation time acceptable while maintaining the possibility of investigating the effects of stochastic variations of the generated power on the rl algorithm effectiveness 5 simulation results and discussion in this section the following rl hyper parameters have been used ε 0 0 7 n min ε 25 α 0 0 7 n min α 25 γ 0 5 such values have been obtained starting from the ones suggested in anderlini et al 2016 and then applying variations in order to improve the stability of the rl convergence some parameter variations were necessary since the updated algorithm of the learning rate eq 17 has been modified with respect to anderlini et al 2016 in order to obtain a smoother transition when n n s n a n exceeds n min α the influence of the rl hyper parameters on efficiency and speed of convergence of the rl algorithm is discussed in section 6 5 1 polychromatic sea with constant hs and t0 constant polychromatic sea the first considered case study named constant polychromatic sea cps is related to a stochastic polychromatic wave with constant parameters h s 1 6 m and t 0 4 5 s fig 12 shows the convergence of the rl algorithm in tuning the speed torque ratio c pto according to the mapping c pto opt h s t 0 obtained by the matrix of simulations p gen the optimal value is c pto opt 1 6 m 4 5 s 16 nms rad it is possible to see that starting from c pto 0 nms rad the q learning algorithm converges to this value after about 7 h of simulated time afterwards there are some further exploration phases in which the system acquires experience by trying c pto variations although it always returns to the optimum value and the exploration frequency decreases with time fig 13 shows the comparison between the average generated power p avg and the generated power p opt extractable by constantly keeping c pto c pto opt model based approach the value of p avg can be occasionally higher than p opt due to the stochastic fluctuation of p avg with relative standard deviation σ rel gen however the steady state value of p avg fluctuates around p opt with local decreases corresponding to exploration phases figs 14 and 15 show the time histories of the exploration rate ε n and of the learning rate α n it is possible to see that when the algorithm converges to c pto 16 nms rad the element of the matrix n s n a n which corresponds to h s 1 6 m t 0 4 5 s c pto 16 nms rad δc pto 0 nms rad starts to increase constantly giving rise to the decreasing envelopes of ε n and α n whereas higher values spikes correspond to random exploration steps 5 2 polychromatic sea with sinusoidal laws of hs and t0 sinusoidal polychromatic sea in this case study named sinusoidal polychromatic sea sps a continuous variation of h s and t 0 is considered with the following laws 18 h s t 1 0 6 sin 2 π 24 3600 t 19 t 0 t 3 5 0 7 sin 2 π 24 3600 t corresponding to a sinusoidal cycle with 1 day period for the two parameters of the stochastic polychromatic wave in case of continuously varying sea parameters the learning process is obviously slower figs 16 18 show the time histories of c pto ε n and α n over 20 days of simulation time with reference to fig 16 it is possible to note that the speed torque ratio c pto starts to follow a pseudo sinusoidal discretized cycle after about 10 days with decreasing exploration phases fig 19 shows the comparison between the generated power p avg and maximum extractable power p opt with model based tuning whereas fig 20 shows their ratio η gen p avg p opt also in this case η gen converges but to a mean value slightly lower than the unit due to the discretization of the speed torque ratio 5 3 polychromatic sea with experimentally recorded hs and t0 historical polychromatic sea in the last case study named historical polychromatic sea hps the polychromatic waves are generated by jonswap spectrum with time varying parameter h s and t 0 based on the recorded historical time series of sea state for the considered site corresponding to the occurrence matrix of fig 5 over two years the time histories of h s and t 0 are shown in figs 21 and 22 figs 23 and 24 compare p avg and p opt respectively over the whole 2 years period and over 10 days whereas fig 25 shows the time history of their ratio η gen in blue and its moving average over 25 days in red for this type of sea it is possible to see that the convergence of the rl algorithm is slower as it takes about 4 months to reach a relatively steady state condition of η gen which oscillates around a mean value of 0 954 slightly lower than the steady state value of the second case study also in this case this lower performance with respect to a model based approach with continuous tuning of the generator speed torque ratio is probably due to the discretization of the values of the c pto speed torque ratio adopted for rl implementation 6 influence of the rl hyper parameters on system performance the simulations reported in the previous section are subject to random variations due to the pseudo random generation of the sea time histories of the polychromatic waves obtained by the jonswap spectrum to the ε greedy decision process of the agent discussed in section 4 3 and to the gaussian noise added to the generated power therefore in order to properly analyse the influence of the rl hyper parameters it is necessary to perform several simulations for each set of parameters to obtain an estimate of the performance indexes accordingly a numeric optimization of the 5 rl hyper parameters ε 0 α 0 n min α n min ε γ also taking into account of the variability and randomness of sea states may require hundreds of thousand simulations thus rapidly becoming computationally intractable in the historical polychromatic sea case study to face this problem the sensitivity of the system to the rl hyper parameters has been preliminarily investigated considering the sinusoidal polychromatic sea case study presented in section 5 2 starting from the initial values used for the simulations of section 5 ε 0 0 7 n min ε 25 α 0 0 7 n min α 25 γ 0 5 the influence of the exploration parameters ε 0 n min ε on the steady state value of η gen and on the learning speed of the rl algorithm has been first considered in particular the steady state value η gen ss is averaged over the last third of the simulation time 20 days for the sps simulation and then over 20 simulations with the same set of parameters the learning speed of the rl is quantified similarly to the definition of settling time in control theory by determining the convergence time t c in which η gen exceeds 0 9 again averaged over 20 simulations with the same set of parameters likewise also the influence of the learning hyper parameters α 0 n min ε on the steady state value of η gen and to the learning velocity of the rl algorithm has been studied in terms of η gen ss and t c the results are shown in figs 26 and 27 from the results shown above it is possible to summarize that values of n min ε and n min α higher than 20 are necessary to obtain satisfying values of η gen ss moreover for low values of n min ε and n min α the convergence time t c is higher than 20 days the surfaces of fig 26 ii and fig 27 ii are truncated due to lack of convergence of rl algorithm in the range of acceptable values of n min ε and n min α the sensitivities of both η gen ss and t c w r t α 0 and ε 0 are rather low and values close to 0 5 are acceptable for both parameters as regards the discount factor γ its influence on the rl algorithm performance has been studied directly on the hps case study averaging over 10 simulations for each value of γ fig 28 shows the values of η gen ss and t c as a function of the discount factor it is possible to note that for γ 0 4 both η gen ss and t c assume almost optimal values and are rather insensitive to further γ increase at the same time it is worth noting that even in optimal conditions the factor η gen ss does not reach the unit value this undesired effect is mainly due to the discretization of the speed torque ratio c pto values adopted for the rl algorithm as already discussed in section 5 a finer discretization could be considered but it can cause negative effects on convergence speed and stability after trials with different values a discretization of 2 nms rad has been selected as a good compromise between steady state efficiency convergence speed and convergence stability finally the presented algorithm has been tested also in the hps case confirming that the ranges of rl hyper parameters selected through the sps analysis are also valid in such a more general case and that the system response is relatively invariant and robust for values in the following ranges ε 0 0 5 0 7 n min ε 25 30 α 0 0 5 0 7 n min α 25 30 γ 0 5 0 7 7 conclusions the paper discusses the application of a q learning algorithm to the tuning of the pto parameter of an oscillating arm wec with mechanical rectifier the dynamics of the system is non linear in particular for the presence of the mechanical rectifier a linear speed torque ratio is imposed to the electric generator with a coefficient which is tuned by the q learning algorithm simulation results have shown that this approach with the proposed laws for continuous updating of the exploration rate and learning rate can effectively tune the speed torque ratio of the electrical generator of the proposed wec both for specific and real world sea states the main drawbacks of the method as compared to a model based one may be listed as follows i only a sub optimal tuning can be provided since discrete values of the speed torque ratio are imposed ii for time varying real world sea states at the beginning of the wec working life a learning period of non negligible length is required on the other side there are evident benefits in the proposed rl approach mainly due to being completely model free thereby avoiding any modelling approximation and at the same time being capable of tuning the system performance fairly close to theoretical optimal behaviour although in general the convenience of a model based control with respect to the proposed model free scheme depends on the accuracy of the available wec model it is worth noting that the complexity e g cfd or unavoidable limitations e g linear wave theory of the most used modelling methods make scientifically and technologically relevant the exploration and exploitation of robust model free approaches such as the one presented in the paper in the following of the research a reduced scale prototype of the wec will be realized first to validate the estimate of the power generation capability obtained by the dynamic models and then to investigate the implementation issues of rl on a real system a parallel research direction will be the adoption of more advanced rl techniques with continuous action space such as deep deterministic policy gradient ddpg and soft actor critic sac methods suitable for a continuous tuning of the electric generator static characteristic funding this research did not receive any

21877,the forces and moments on slender axisymetric bodies are studied using a hydrodynamic impulse formulation for viscous flow in non inertial body frames of reference the problems of steady translation and steady turning are specifically addressed a computational fluid dynamics data base is used to evaluate the hydrodynamic impulse for 3 submarine shaped bodies with slenderness ratios of 7 35 8 38 and 8 75 it was found that the forces and moments calculated using the hydrodynamic impulse formulation give equivalent forces and moment to the traditional method of integrating pressure and shear stress on the body in addition it is shown that the lateral force distribution can be calculated directly from the lamb vector distribution over cross sectional planes linearized forms of the hydrodynamic impulse equations are derived for both translation and steady rotation keywords submarine hydrodynamic impulse viscous flow 1 introduction the concept of hydrodynamic impulse has a long history in theoretical hydrodynamics having been described by lamb in 1895 lamb 1932 the advantage of the theory of hydrodynamic impulse is that it describes the physical origin of hydrodynamic forces and moments in terms of the vorticity generated at the body surface and its subsequent position in the fluid volume in particular the hydrodynamic impulse method provides the opportunity for geometric reasoning to be applied to the vortex formation and transport lamb 1932 shows that for irrotational flow around a moving body the rate of change of hydrodynamic impulse is equal to the force of the fluid acting on the body in an analogous manner the fluid torque on the body can be equated to the rate of change of hydrodynamic angular impulse in potential flow the vorticity is confined to the body surface and a relationship between the hydrodynamic impulse and the state of body motion depends only on the body geometry lamb 1932 newman 1977 karamcheti 1980 milne thompson 1996 and howe 2002 2012 provide a modern formulation of hydrodynamic impulse and applications for irrotational flow milne thompson 1996 and karamcheti 1980 provide the force and moment impulse equations expressed in terms of non inertial body fixed coordinates lamb 1932 also considered the case of isolated vortex filaments within the fluid where there is no external force or torque on the fluid and showed that the linear and angular impulse are invariants of the fluid motion the application of the hydrodynamic impulse method to flow around a moving body with vortex filaments extending into the fluid was presented by lighthill 1986 and saffman 1992 who show that the hydrodynamic impulse can be computed from the moment of the vorticity field of the fluid domain by subtracting the momentum of the body motion this method was applied by lighthill 1986 saffman 1992 and milne thompson 1973 to compute the lift and drag on an airplane wing due to an extending trailing vortex in steady translation the presence of the hypothetical vorticity in the fluid domain used to calculate the impulse is due to the viscous diffusion of vorticity from the body surface and its subsequent convection but viscous effects are not explicitly considered in their analysis the formulation of the hydrodynamic impulse for viscous flow was addressed by wu 1980 and wu and sankar 1980 they show that the explicit contribution of viscous forces to the overall force and moment on the immersed body are limited to the viscous stress on the outer boundary of the fluid domain in the case where the flow is irrotational at the outer boundary the direct effect of viscosity is zero while for high reynolds number flows the viscous stress on the outer boundary is negligible alternative developments of the impulse formulation provided by noca 1997 show that the impulse formulation provided by lighthill 1986 and saffman 1992 for bodies immersed in invisicd flow forms an excellent approximation for high reynolds number viscous flows a recent review of this work is provided in wu et al 2018 the application of the hydrodynamic impulse to practical viscous flows requires knowledge of the vorticity field that can only be obtained from experimental or computational methods this requires that the condition of an infinite fluid domain be relaxed because both experimental and computational methods provide data that is limited to finite domains hydrodynamic impulse formulations for finite domains were advanced by noca 1997 noca et al 1997 1999 yang et al 2007 and wu et al 2007 a key feature of this work is the role of vorticity flux across the boundary of the finite domain in determination of the hydrodynamic force and moment on the body experimental data is generally gathered in the inertial laboratory frame while computational results are generally determined for the body fixed frame of reference which can be non inertial all of the formulations cited above are presented for inertial frames of reference recently the extension of hydrodynamic impulse methods to non inertial body fixed frames of reference has been described by ostieri et al 2017 the method uses a mixed inertial noninertial definition of the lamb vector which the authors develop and apply for two dimensional viscous unsteady flows in the present paper this approach is developed for three dimensional unsteady viscous flow and applied to the problem of steady turning the finite domain impulse formulation has been applied to determine the forces and moments on a body in unsteady flow around moving bodies using instantaneous experimental particle image velocimetry piv data by noca et al 1997 1999 devoria et al 2014 and graham et al 2017 the flow geometry in these applications is two dimensional because instantaneous piv data is generally limited to flow planes the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd solution data in the impulse formulation is described by wu et al 2006 and liu et al 2014 it has also been shown by lighthillrosenhead 1963 that the forces and moments on the body can be related to the flux of vorticity across the solid body surface this approach was further developed by wu and wu 1993 wu and wu 1998 wu et al 2006 and liu et al 2014 for incompressible and compressible flow the idea of improving aerodynamic performance through flow diagnosis is a theme of these articles which examines the local vortical flow structures emanating from the body surface in viscous flow along slender bodies a key feature is the flow separation that forms on the tail at low incidence and migrates noseward as incidence is increased even at moderate incidence strong separated sheets of vorticity roll up into a pair of concentrated vorticies the result is a three dimensional wake on the leeside of the body that consists of two symmetric vortices of opposite circulation it is critical for the development of force and moment estimation methods in viscous flow that these wake vorticies be accurately described for finite computational fluid dynamics cfd flow domains wake vorticity must flow across the downstream domain boundary as the flow develops in the case of steady translation and rotation this outflow of vorticity has the benefit of making the velocity and vorticity fields within the body fixed computational domain time independent for the viscous impulse formulation presented in this article the flux of vorticity across the outflow boundary has a central role a method of approximating the force distribution along a slender body of arbitrary profile using the hydrodynamic impulse of potential flow in cross sectional planes was introduced by munk 1924 for airships and further developed by jones 1946 for low aspect ratio wings see katz and plotkin 1991 for a review of the method the method of jones 1946 was extended to viscous flow along slender bodies of revolution in translation by jeans et al 2009 using vorticity fields obtained from cfd simulations they found that the force distribution overall lateral force and moment could be accurately determined from a two dimensional approximation of the viscous hydrodynamic impulse using only the longitudinal vorticity distribution this approach has strong similarities to the treftz plane method for viscous flow as formulated by drela 2009 the study of jeans et al 2009 is especially relevant to slender body approximations of viscous flow described in the present study the present article explores the role of fluid vorticity in determination of the hydrodynamic forces and moments that act on slender axi symmetric bodies in steady translation and rotation through viscous fluids this is the first comprehensive study of this important class of flows using a theory of hydrodynamic impulse formulation for a non inertial body frame of reference that can be applied to general maneuvers the concept of hydrodynamic impulse was chosen because it offers distinct advantages in model development over the pressure field which is non local and includes contributions from both body acceleration and surrounding vorticity fields arising from the flow history a linearized formulation of the hydrodynamic impulse formulation such as will be developed in this article is especially valuable because it allows superposition of the vortex elements originating along the length of the body to calculate the total force and moments specific attention is directed to the lateral force component normal to the body axis and the yawing moment in steady translation and steady rotation because these are essential for control of underwater vehicle motion 2 axisymmetric body forms the axisymmetric hull shapes studied were the unappended defence research and development canada drdc static test rig str hull watt et al 1991 the darpa suboff hull roddy 1990 and the united states navy series 58 model 4621 submarine hull profiles of both bodies are shown in fig 1 the drdc str profile has three distinct regions the first 20 of the drdc str hull is the nose and has a riegels type d2 profile the next 45 is the cylindrical mid body and the final 36 is the tail section which has a parabolic profile the darpa suboff hull form has a similar nose and midbody to the drdc str but with a concave profile near the tip of the tail the series 58 model 4621 profile is described by a continuous sixth order polynomial randwijck and feldman 2000 and differs significantly from the drdc and suboff profiles largely due to its spheroid nose and absence of a constant radius mid body the drdc str suboff and series 58 model 4621 profiles have length to maximum diameter ratios of 8 75 8 57 and 7 34 respectively other geometric parameters are summarized in table 1 where the body length is denoted ℓ the maximum body radius a m the planform area of the hull a p and the body volume b 3 impulse formulation for viscous flow 3 1 inertial frame of reference the impulse analysis is based on the fluid volume shown in fig 2 where s is the rigid external surface of the arbitrary volume and n ˆ is the outward surface normal the volume f b where b is the body volume and f is the fluid volume in the position vector x o x o y o z o the fluid velocity u o u o v o w o and vorticity ω o ξ o η o ζ o are measured relative to the inertial frame of reference the position vector x x y z the fluid velocity u u v w and vorticity ω ξ η ζ are measured relative to the body frame of reference the fluid domain attached to the body is denoted by c f d the quantities u o and ω o are the disturbances created by the body as it moves through the otherwise quiescent fluid the position of the centre of buoyancy of the body is denoted by r the velocity of the centre of buoyancy as u and the body rotation rate as ω the position velocity and vorticity in the body frame are related to those in the inertial frame according to 1 x o r x 2 u o u u and 3 ω o ω ω the components of the body motion u u v w ω p q r are chosen parallel to the body axes the hydrodynamic impulse per unit mass in the inertial frame i o is defined lighthill 1986 saffman 1992 4 i o 1 2 x o ω o d p o where p o is the momentum of the fluid per unit mass displaced by the presence of the body the components of the linear hydrodynamic impulse per unit mass in the inertial frame are 5 i x o 1 2 y o ζ o z o η o d p x o 6 i y o 1 2 z o ξ o x o ζ o d p y o and 7 i z o 1 2 x o η o y o ξ o d p z o the dynamic equation relating the linear hydrodynamic impulse in a finite domain to the fluid force acting on a rigid body moving through viscous fluid is given by noca et al 1999 8 f ρ d i o d t ρ l o d 1 2 ρ s x o n ˆ l o d s 1 2 s n ˆ x o t i x o t t d s where i is the identity matrix the lamb vector l o w o u o is responsible for the vortex force and the viscous stress tensor is t μ u o u o t the explicit role of viscosity in equation 8 is limited to the viscous stresses acting on the outer boundary surface s such stresses are exactly zero in the case of an irrotational flow at the boundary of the fluid domain and are generally considered to be negligible in high reynolds number viscous flows even where vorticity crosses the domain boundary see e g noca et al 1997 wu et al 2006 the moment acting on the body moving in viscous fluid neglecting the moment of the viscous stresses on the outer fluid boundary is presented by wu et al 2006 9 m o ρ d j o d t ρ x o l o d 1 2 ρ s x o 2 n ˆ l o d s where the hydrodynamic angular impulse per unit mass is defined as 10 j o 1 2 x o 2 ω o d q o where x o 2 x o 2 y o 2 z o 2 and q o is the angular moment per unit mass of the fluid displaced by the body if the volume includes the entire vorticity field with no flux of vorticity across its outer boundary see fig 2 then the surface integrals of equations 8 and 9 are exactly zero furthermore it has also been shown that lighthill 1986 wu et al 2006 11 l o d 0 and 12 r l o d 0 as the outer surface boundary s becomes large equations 8 and 9 then reduce to the classic results 13 f ρ d i o d t and 14 m ρ d j o d t equations 13 and 14 are valid for viscous and inviscid flow around a body and demonstrate that the force and moment on the body arise entirely due to the unsteadiness of the hydrodynamic impulse measured relative to an inertial frame milne thompson 1996 has expressed the hydrodynamic impulse of the flow disturbance relative to the inertial frame of reference in terms of the body fixed coordinates with the origin translating at velocity u and rotating at rate ω fig 2 transforming equations 13 and 14 to the form 15 f ρ d i o d t ρ ω i o and 16 m ρ d j o d t ρ u i o ρ ω j o which again is valid for inviscid or viscous flow subject to the above limitation of negligible vorticity at the outer edges of the fluid domain for plane motion of a body with velocity u u v 0 and angular velocity ω 0 0 r see fig 3 the non zero components of equations 15 and 16 are 17 x ρ d i x o d t ρ r i y o 18 y ρ d i y o d t ρ r i x o and 19 n ρ d j z o d t ρ u i y o v i x o equations 17 19 applied to potential flow around the moving body has the vorticity confined to the surface the hydrodynamic impulse per unit mass relative to the inertial frame can be calculated from the velocity potential φ of the disturbance in body coordinates see karamcheti 1980 saffman 1992 20 i o s b φ n ˆ d s and 21 j o s b φ x n ˆ d s where s b is the surface of the body it follows that equations 20 and 21 for flow around an axisymmetric body in plane motion can be expressed in terms of the state of the vehicle motion see fig 1 22 i x o u k 1 b 23 i y o v k 2 b and 24 j z o r k γ b where k 1 k 2 and k are the added mass coefficients for longitudinal and lateral body motion and rotation respectively the polar moment of inertia of the fluid displaced by the body is represented by γ b substituting equations 22 to 24 into 17 to 19 gives the force and moment on the body in terms of the vehicle state of motion see fig 1 page 186 25 x ρ

are widely used in naval hydrodynamics to model force and moment due to unsteadiness of a maneuver newman 1977 for steady rotation equations 25 27 reduce to 28 x ρ r v k 2 b 29 y ρ r u k 1 b and 30 n ρ u v k 2 k 1 b this is the famous result that munk 1924 developed for prediction of airship stability in steady translation where r 0 the force on the body is zero but the moment is still given by equation 30 we will return to this result in the sections describing slender body approximations 3 2 accelerating frames of reference the analysis of the hydrodynamic impulse in an accelerating frame of reference will use body fixed coordinates the derivation of the hydrodynamic impulse equations for the force acting on the body is based on the kinematic relationship presented by saffman 1992 for a finite fluid domain 31 d d t 1 2 x ω d 1 2 x ω t d following noca 1997 the volume b is assumed filled with a fictitious fluid subject to an external body force f e which holds the fictitious fluid within the body in rigid motion along the prescribed path under consideration in order to derive the hydrodynamic force equation we substitute the dynamic equation for vorticity in a rotating frame greenspan 1968 with the addition of the external force field f e limited to the body volume 32 ω t l 2 ω ρ 1 f e ν ω where ν is the kinematic viscosity and ω ω o 2 ω is the fluid vorticity in the body frame the lamb vector l ω o u is defined in terms of the body frame velocity u and the inertial vorticity ω o this definition for the lamb vector is an important feature of the vorticity equation in inertial and non inertial frames of reference it has been applied to impulse methods for calculating the force on a body in two dimensional unsteady viscous flow by ostieri et al 2017 we now extend the method applied by noca 1997 for inertial frames to accelerating frames of reference by substitution of equation 32 into equation 31 to give 33 b f e d ρ d g d t 2 ρ x ω d ρ l d 1 2 ρ s x n ˆ l d s μ s n ω 1 2 x n ˆ ω d s the moment of vorticity for the non inertial frame of reference is defined as 34 g 1 2 x ω d the integral of the external force on the left hand side of equation 33 is related to the force on the body and the rate of change of the fluid momentum within the body noca 1997 saffman 1992 35 b f e d f ρ d p o d t which on substitution into equation 33 gives 36 f ρ d p o d t ρ d g d t 2 ρ x ω d ρ l d 1 2 ρ s x n ˆ l d s where similar to the analysis in the inertial frame the last term of equation 33 which represents the viscous force on the outer surface s is neglected as insignificant in high reynolds number flow the rate of change of the momentum of the fluid filled body is calculated as 37 d p o d t ρ b u derivation of the moment equation for a non inertial frame of reference is based on a kinematic identity similar to equation 31 provided by saffman 1992 38 d d t 1 2 x 2 ω d 1 2 x 2 ω t d substitution of equation 32 into equation 38 gives the result neglecting viscous effects on the outer boundary 39 b x f e d ρ d h d t ρ x ω d ρ x l d 1 2 ρ s x 2 n ˆ l d s where 40 h 1 2 x 2 ω d the integral of the moment of the external force on the left hand side of equation 33 is related to the moment on the fluid filled body according to saffman 1992 41 b x f e d m ρ d q o d t which on substitution into equation 39 gives 42 m ρ d q o d t ρ d h d t 2 ρ x 2 ω d ρ x l d 1 2 ρ s x 2 n ˆ l d s the angular momentum per unit mass of the rigid fluid filled body is calculated as 43 d q o d t d d t b x u d ρ b r u where r is the position of the centre of buoyancy of the body relative to the inertial frame of reference the moments of vorticity g and h and the momentum per unit mass of the fluid displaced p o and q o can be combined to form the hydrodynamic impulse as was done in the inertial frame however here we choose to keep them separate since for steady turning the rate of change of g and h are zero whereas the rate of change of p o forms a body force that has an important role in the determination of the hydrodynamic force 4 translation 4 1 computational database the cfd database consists of predictions from verified and validated reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations on the drdc str series 58 model 4621 and darpa suboff geometries using ansys cfx a commercially available solver based on the rans equations discretized using a finite volume finite element approach schneider and raw 1987 simulations were performed at model scale with reynolds number ranging from r e u ℓ ν 11 7 23 10 6 at incidence angles up to 30 o and the conditions simulated for each geometry as shown in table 2 the cfd methodology and validation process are detailed in jeans et al 2009 and only a brief overview is given here full second order spatial discretization was employed to minimize numerical diffusion double precision was used throughout to minimize round off error an important consideration in the near wall region which contains hexahedra elements with aspect ratios as large as 1 9 million because of the high reynolds number the governing equations were converged in all simulations until the rms residuals for mass and momentum within the domain were below 1 10 5 the cfd domain mesh topology and boundary conditions are shown in fig 4 to take advantage of the symmetry only half the streamline body was modeled in the final simulations the validity of a symmetric wake is justified for the present range of slenderness and incidence angles less than 30 o ericsson and reding 1080 the body is approximately centered in the domain and orientated at the desired incidence relative to the outer boundaries so that the inlet and outlet are normal to the freestream and the opening boundaries are parallel to the freestream the turbulence intensity at the inlet was set to 1 to match experimental conditions at the outlet the average static pressure was set to zero the no slip wall condition was employed on the hull surface and the free slip wall condition was used along the symmetry plane on the final three outer boundaries fluid was permitted to enter and leave the domain as required to match the freestream pressure condition hybrid meshes consisting of both structured and unstructured blocks were generated using a script that was optimized specifically for axisymmetric slender bodies at incidence watt et al 2006 significant effort was made to develop a scripting algorithm that accurately discretizes the leeside vortex and shear layers the first node height was chosen to keep the maximum y to the first node height below 0 3 ensuring adequate discretization of the boundary layer the mesh parameters chosen resulted in grids ranging from 3 to 8 million nodes depending on incidence and reynolds number in general the number of nodes increased as incidence or reynolds number increased the primary means of validation was comparison of overall forces and moments with experiment watt et al 1993b vanrandwijck and feldman 2000 nguyen et al 1995 roddy 1990 the reynolds stress model bsl rsm lauder et al 1975 α 15 o was used for all simulations the bsl rsm turbulence model consistently underpredicted the experimental data by 10 but were within experimental uncertainty for the drdc str data for α 25 o jeans et al 2009 showed that for these rans calculations the discretization errors in the total force were less than 5 at α 30 o and smaller at lower incidence angles 4 2 exact impulse equations to analyze steady translation through viscous flow we choose the body frame of reference the body frame in this case is also an inertial frame where ω ω o and l l o in order to emphasize the importance of inertial vorticity in steady translation and rotation we will use l u ω o throughout since the unsteady portion of the wake is outside of the computational domain it is not included in the analysis we therefore use the steady flow form of equations 8 and 9 wu et al 2007 44 f ρ l d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ l d s and 45 m ρ x l d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ l d s where w is the portion of the outer surface of the cfd domain across which there is vorticity flow i e the wake the domain used to evaluate the terms of equations 44 and 45 must enclose the entire body but need not enclose the entire vorticity of the wake provided the flux of vorticity across the boundary is accounted for the surface integral of the tangential component of the lamb vector l t n ˆ l over the wake plane has a non zero contribution to the longitudinal force component but zero contribution to the lateral and normal force components the non zero components of the force and moments deduced from equations 44 and 45 are 46 x ρ x t x n f x x d x 1 2 ρ w y l y z l z d y d z 47 y ρ x t x n f y x d x and 48 n ρ x t x n x f y x d x ρ x t x n s x y l x d y d z d x 1 2 ρ w y 2 z 2 l y d y d z where s x is the cross sectional surface of the fluid domain normal to the body axis and f x f y are the longitudinal and lateral load distribution functions defined as 49 f x x s x l x d y d z and 50 f y x s x l y d y d z the components of the lamb vector are 51 l x x v ζ o w η o 52 l y x w ξ o u ζ o and 53 l z x u η o v ξ o it may be surprising that the longitudinal load distribution has an effect on the yawing moment as shown in equation 48 this arises from the tilting of the vortex lines at finite angles of drift it could also be explained by the stagnation point being moved to the windward side of the body in drift for slender bodies the contribution is small it was found to be most instructive to integrate the lamb vector in equations 46 48 over planes normal to the body axis and then sum these planar integrals from the tail plane to a position just forward of the nose of the body the lamb vector components on cross sectional planes normal to the body axis are shown in fig 5 the force and moment calculated from equations 46 48 are shown in fig 6 where they are compared to the forces and moments obtained by the traditional method of integrating the pressure and shear stress over the body surface the difference between the results obtained with the two methods based on the same cfd solution fields is small for the longitudinal force and completely negligible for the lateral force and yawing moment the reader is reminded that these equations neglect the viscous stresses around the outer boundary of the domain this includes the wake plane the longitudinal force normalized by body length shows a significant dependence on body profile whereas the lateral force scaled by planform area and re and the yawing moment scaled by body volume show no dependence on the body shape in the following the forces and moment calculated from equations 46 48 will be referred to as exact the lateral force distribution along the body can be obtained by differentiating equation 47 with respect to longitudinal position along the body to give 54 y x ρ f y x this lateral distribution for steady translation is shown in fig 7 where it is compared to the normal force distribution obtained from integration of pressure and shear stress and potential flow results note that λ λ c b x is the distance along the body axis measured from the nose the difference in the lateral force distribution calculated by the two methods is insignificant 4 3 slender body approximations a linearization of equation 44 for slender bodies in steady translation can be formed by transforming the velocity field to the ground frame according to wu et al 2006 55 u u o u substitution of equation 55 into the lamb vector and expanding 56 l ω o u o u ω o the first term is quadratic in the disturbance field and will be neglected as a higher order contribution substitution of the remaining approximate form of the lamb vector into equations 44 and 45 gives 57 f ρ u ω o d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ u ω o d s and 58 m ρ x u ω o d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ u ω o d s the first integral of equation 57 can then be expressed exactly as a surface integral over the wake using the vorticity moment theorem see 8 59 ω o d w ω o n ˆ x d s substitution of equation 59 into equation 57 gives the linearized formula for the force 60 f ρ u w ω o n ˆ x d s 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ u ω o d s the linear approximation for the components of force in steady translation are 61 x ρ v i y o x w 1 2 ρ v i y o x w ρ u i x o x w and 62 y ρ u i y o x w where we have defined the longitudinal and lateral impulse per unit length and unit mass as 63 i x o x s x y ζ o d s u a b x and 64 i y o x s x z ξ o d s v a b x the integration is taken over cross sectional planes normal to the body axis and the area a b x is the cross sectional area of the body at position x equation 62 has also been derived by drela 2009 in defining the longitudinal impulse per unit length it was assumed that 65 s x y ζ o d s s x z η o d s this is exactly true for closed vortex loops lighthill 1986 and was found to be a very good approximation for planes normal to the body axis as shown in fig 5 since all the terms of equations 61 and 62 depend only on wake integrals one would expect that the linear estimates would be improved by moving the position of the wake plane x w well aft of the body where the local velocity approximates that of the free stream this is indeed the case as shown in fig 8 on the other hand if the wake plane is placed further forward than the tail of the body it will include only the accumulated force from the nose to outflow plane the first term of equation 61 denoted by x l x is an approximation of the longitudinal load distribution integral of equation 46 and the last two terms form an approximation of the wake integral of equation 46 denoted by x w these linear approximations are compared to the exact results in table 3 at zero incidence x l x 0 and the wake term is entirely responsible for the longitudinal force which is equal to the drag on the body in drift x l x makes a significant contribution although of opposite sign to the wake integral the linear approximation of x is only good at the lowest drift angle where x w is dominant the single term of equation 62 for y is an approximation of the lateral load distribution integral of equation 47 and is denoted by y l y as shown in table 3 the linear approximation is within 4 up to drift angles of 20 o the linearized form of the equation for the moment is 66 m ρ x u ω o d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ u ω o d s with the yawing component taking the form 67 n ρ u x t x n x ζ o dsd x ρ v x t x t s x y ζ o d s d x 1 2 ρ u w y 2 z 2 ζ o d y d z using equation 59 in the following way 68 x t x n x ζ o dsd x x t x n x x s x z ξ o d s d x substituting into equation 67 and integrating by parts gives 69 n ρ u x t x n i y o x d x ρ u x t i y o x t ρ v x t x n i x o x d x 1 2 ρ u w y 2 z 2 ζ o d y d z the first two terms of equation 69 represent the approximation of the moment of the lateral force distribution of equation 48 the third term is an approximation of the moment of the longitudinal load distribution and the last term is the wake integral these are denoted as n l y n l x and n w respectively and are compared to the exact results in table 3 the first term n l y gives an estimate of the yawing moment to within 5 up to β 20 o the terms n l x and n w are small and nearly cancel in the exact representation but are poorly estimated by the linear approximation n l y represents the integral of the moment of the linearized lateral force distribution 70 y x ρ u x i y o x 5 steady rotation 5 1 cfd database the methodology for the computational database for steady rotation is similar to the translation database utilizing ansys cfx rans simulations and the rsm turbulence model the methodology and validation are detailed in zhang et al 2013 and a brief overview is given here simulations were completed for a range of turning radii where 1 0 r l 10 and three model reynolds numbers a summary of all the cases included in the present study is provided in table 4 cfd meshes were made using a modified version of the meshing script previously discussed an example of the cfd domain showing the mesh topology for the drdc str hull for r ℓ 2 86 is shown in fig 9 an enlarged image of the structured grid around the body and through the wake is also shown the computational domain is in a rotating frame of reference attached to the body axes the boundary conditions are transformed from the inertial frame where the hull is translating and rotating through a stationary fluid systematic grid refinement showed mesh independence for half body simulations for meshes with 3 8 9 3 million nodes partial validation of these simulations for steady turning conditions was made by comparison of overall forces and moments with experiments on darpa suboff etebari et al 2008 the rans simulations were found to be within experimental uncertainty for r ℓ 2 74 r e 6 5 million and a drift angle of β c b 16 5 o another source of validation from the suboff experiments was a comparison of wake vorticity fields at specific axial locations the agreement is excellent with close correspondence of shear layer separation point and wake vorticity distribution 5 2 exact impulse equations to analyze the steady rotation of an axisymmetric body moving through viscous fluid we will use the finite computational domain in fig 9 which is attached to the body frame of reference the velocity and vorticity fields obtained from the simulations are steady and equations 36 and 42 reduce to 71 f ρ b u ρ l d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ l d s and 72 m ρ b r u ρ x l d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ l d s where w is the portion of the outer surface of the fluid domain across which there is vorticity flow i e the wake the terms which distinguish equation 71 from equation 44 for steady translation is the acceleration of the centre of buoyancy of the fluid filled body this acceleration can be calculated for steady rotation as 73 u ω ω r ω u the body force is very significant to equation 71 but it has no contribution to the moment equation 72 since according to equation 73 the body force is parallel to the position vector of the centre of buoyancy r substituting equation 73 into equation 71 gives the lateral and axial components of force and the yawing moment deduced from equations 71 and 72 74 x ρ r v b ρ x n x t f x x d x 1 2 ρ w y l y z l z d y d z 75 y ρ r u b ρ x t x n f y x d x and 76 n ρ x t x n x f y x d x ρ x w x t s x y l x d y d z d x 1 2 ρ w y 2 z 2 l y d y d z where f x and f y are given by equations 49 and 50 note that equations 74 and 75 have a similar form to those in steady translation equations 46 and 47 with the exception of the body force arising from rotation the moment equation 76 is identical to equation 48 the forces x and y and moment n calculated from equations 74 76 are compared to those calculated from pressure and skin friction in fig 10 the differences between the two methods are negligible for y and n for all but the highest rates of turning note that the scale of the yawing moment for the range of turning considered is 10 times smaller than in fig 10 for steady translation this explains the apparent profile dependence of the scaled moments at high rates of turning which in fact are comparable but larger in a relative sense to what occurs in translation the scaling of y with the planform area a p eliminates most of the dependence on the body profile as was the case in translation the lateral force distribution along the body can be obtained exactly by differentiating equation 75 with respect to longitudinal distance along the body to give 77 y x ρ r u a b x ρ f y x the lateral force distribution is shown in fig 11 for a steady turn with r ℓ 1 67 rotation has a dramatic affect on the lateral force distribution which is directed outward from the centre of rotation this explains the near zero yawing moment at high rates of turning shown in fig 10 the distribution of the lateral body force term has zero moment about the centre of buoyancy 5 3 slender body approximations linearization of equations 71 and 72 for steady rotation of a slender body can be formed by transforming the velocity field to the ground frame of reference according to 78 u u o u ω x and expanding the lamb vector as 79 l ω o u o u ω o ω x ω o as was done in steady translation we form a linear approximation of equation 79 by neglecting the product of the inertial vorticity and velocity disturbance substitution of the approximate lamb vector into equation 71 gives 80 f ρ b ω u ρ u ω o d ρ ω x ω o d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ u ω x ω o d s the components of force on the body in linearized form are 81 x ρ r v b ρ v r x w i y o x w ρ r x w x n s x z ξ o d s d x 1 2 ρ v r x w i y o x w ρ u i x o x w 1 2 ρ r w y 2 ζ o d s 1 2 ρ r w y z η o d s 82 y ρ r u b ρ u i y o x w ρ r x w x n s x y ζ o d s d x where it should be noted that in turning 83 i y o x s x z ξ o v r x a b x d s comparing equations 81 61 for longitudinal force component in translation we see that there are several additional terms due to rotation the first term is the body force x b which can be calculated exactly the following two terms form the linear estimate of the longitudinal load distribution integral x l x and the last 4 terms form the wake integral x w both x l x and x w contain rotation terms with those proportional to the lateral dimensions of the body y 2 and y z being very small comparing equation 82 for the lateral force to 62 for translation shows there are two additional terms arising from rotation a body force term y b which is calculated exactly and a term which arises from the linear estimate of the lateral load distribution integral y l x the distribution of accumulated lateral force along the drdc str body in steady rotation according to equation 82 is shown in fig 12 substitution of the approximate lamb vector into equation 72 gives 84 m ρ b x u ω o d ρ x ω x ω o d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ u ω x ω o d s and the linearized yawing moment equation is 85 n ρ u x w x n i y o x d x ρ u x w i y o x t ρ v x w x n i x o x d x 1 2 ρ w y 2 z 2 u r y ζ o d y d z the only explicit appearance of rotation in equation 85 arises from the wake term and this is proportional to y 3 making it negligible for a slender body as in translation the remaining terms are denoted n l y n l x and n w a term by term comparison of the linear estimates for x y and n are provided for steady rotation of the drdc str body in table 5 the longitudinal and lateral forces are accurately represented by the linear estimates this is consistent with the accuracy of the linear estimates for translation if one considers that even at the highest rate of turning considered for the linear analysis r ℓ 2 86 the local angle of incidence along the body is nowhere greater 10 o the linear estimate of the yawing moment in steady turning shows a significant relative error on the order of 30 but it must be remembered that the moments in the case of steady turning are very small when compared to translation where a similar absolute error constituted a relative error of only 5 similar to translation the best linear estimate of the yawing moment is made by neglecting all contributions except n l y which is due to the integral of the moment of the lateral load distribution the lateral load distribution can be formed by differentiating equation 82 with respect to distance x resulting in 86 y x ρ u x i y o x ρ r i x o x in steady turning this linear estimate of the lateral load distribution contains a rotation term which is not present in the yawing moment estimate since it cancels with the rotation term in the moment of the longitudinal load distribution 6 discussion 6 1 role of the lamb vector in steady viscous flow relative to the body frame of reference it is the lamb vector field l ω o u which determines the force and moment on a body the lamb vector is non zero wherever the vorticity vector measured relative to an inertial frame and the fluid velocity are not aligned or zero in the external flows under consideration the vorticity is generated at the surface of the body and displaced by the flow around the body the resulting contributions to the force and moment of the individual terms of equations 46 48 are shown in fig 13 the axial force is calculated from a volume integral of the longitudinal component of the lamb vector l x v ζ o w η o and a wake term which is a surface integral of the moment of the tangential component of the lamb vector x l t y l y z l z 0 0 these are illustrated in fig 14 the lamb vector includes the effect of lateral flow v across the spanwise vortex elements ζ o and the spanwise flow w across the transverse η o vortex elements these terms represent the rate of stretching over the nose and compression over the tail of the vortex rings around the body and individually are very large due to the strong vortex sheet generated by the longitudinal flow as shown in fig 15 however they have opposite sign and the difference of the two terms is small at small angles of drift the wake integral has a non zero axial component with the integrand y u ζ o w ξ o z v ξ o u η o at low angles of drift the two dominant terms are y u ζ o z u η o which represents the downstream rate of transport of the vortex rings shed from the body surface at large drift angles the two contributions have nearly equal magnitudes but opposite signs making the total axial force practically zero this differencing of large terms in the calculation of x is responsible for the noticeable inaccuracy of the impulse method for the longitudinal force the lateral force is entirely determined by the volume integral of lateral component of the lamb vector l y w ξ o u ζ o there is no wake contribution to the lateral force this also applies to non axisymmetric bodies in steady flow the two contributions of the lamb vector integral illustrated in fig 16 are the spanwise flow w across the longitudinal vortex elements ξ o and the longitudinal flow u across the spanwise vortex elements ζ o as shown in fig 13 the first term w ξ o increases approximately linearly with drift angle whereas the integral of u ζ o has a strong non linearity and dominates at large drift angles these terms form a rational basis for the generally accepted empirical form of lateral force on a slender axisymmetric body y a β b β β mackay 2006 although it should be noted that this approximation does not have continuous derivatives zero drift angle the yawing moment has 3 contributions the moment of the lateral force distribution x f y x the moment of the longitudinal force distribution y f x x and a wake integral of y 2 z 2 l y these are shown in fig 13 the last two terms are small and have opposite signs which makes their net effect practically negligible consequently the moment of the lateral force distribution is responsible for the yawing moment the volume integral terms and the wake terms of equations 74 76 for steady turning are shown in fig 17 each of the above contributions described for translation apply equally to steady turning however in steady turning there are additional body force terms which must be included in the longitudinal and lateral forces due to non inertial body frame these body force terms are large and have the opposite sign to the volume integral of the lamb vector in both cases there is no body force contribution to the yawing moment in steady turning and it is determined to good approximation in a similar manner to translation by the moment of the lateral load distribution 6 2 linear equations for steady turning it is possible to draw a connection between the linearized equations 81 85 which apply to a finite domain with vorticity flux across the boundary and equations 17 19 for steady rotation in an infinite domain containing all the flow vorticity this can be done by reformulating equations 81 85 in terms of the hydrodynamic impulse 87 i ˆ x o x x t x n i x o x d x and 88 i ˆ y o x x t x n i y o x d x so that the body force terms no longer appear explicitly here we have limited the integration to the body length by placing the wake plane at the tail even though this excludes a relatively small impulse assigned to the wake by the linearization substituting equations 87 and 88 into equations 81 85 and neglecting the small contributions of x l x and n w gives 89 x ρ u i x o x t ρ r i ˆ y o 90 y ρ u i y o x t ρ r i ˆ x o and 91 n ρ u i ˆ y o v i ˆ x o ρ u x t i y o x t for translation r 0 equations 90 and 91 reduce to the result presented by jeans et al 2009 for the hydrodynamic force and moment in steady translation jeans et al 2009 further neglected the term v i ˆ x o from equation 91 and the present study provides support for that approximation comparing equations 89 91 to equations 17 19 shows that 92 ρ d i x o d t ρ u i x o x t 93 ρ d i y o d t ρ u i y o x t and 94 ρ d j z o d t ρ u x t i y o x t therefore one can conclude that within the linear approximation the unsteady terms of equations 17 19 are approximated by the release of longitudinal and lateral hydrodynamic impulse per unit length at a rate proportional to the longitudinal component of body velocity the rate of change of the angular momentum is the rate of lateral momentum release at the tail multiplied by the tail position relative to the centre of buoyancy 7 summary and conclusions the vorticity based method of calculating the forces and moments acting on a body in an external viscous flow as described by noca 1997 has been applied to slender bodies of revolution in steady translation the vorticity fields used for this calculation were derived from cfd rans simulations made in the body frame of reference for a finite domain it was shown that the hydrodynamic force and moment determined by the vorticity based calculation were practically identical to those determined using the traditional method of integrating the shear stress and pressure over the surface of the body this was also true for the lateral load distribution along the body both calculation methods were based on the same cfd solution fields demonstrating that the vorticity based methods do not require higher resolution to achieve an equal degree of accuracy the vorticity methods do rely on a volume integration over the vorticity containing region surrounding the body however this volume integration is limited to the viscous affected region between the nose and tail of the body with the wake integral evaluated in the tail plane the vorticity method of noca 1997 was extended to non inertial body frames of reference and applied to viscous flow along slender bodies of revolution undergoing steady turning the results of the vorticity based method were found to be practically identical to those derived from surface pressure and shear stress distributions on the body it was shown that the formulation for non inertial body frames of reference differs from the case of steady translation having an inertial body frame of reference in 2 respects 1 the lamb vector l ω o u must be calculated using the inertial frame vorticity and the body frame velocity field and 2 the body force due to the frame acceleration of the fluid displaced by the body must be included in the case of steady turning the body force is substantial but it has no effect on the yawing moment as it acts through the centre of rotation a linearization of the vorticity method based on the approach of wu et al 2007 was shown to provide a good approximation of the lateral force and yawing moment on slender axisymetric bodies up to and including drift angles of 20 o and rotation rates of r ℓ u 0 18 in both cases the lateral force can be approximated by the flux of lateral impulse across the wake plane and the yawing moment about the tail can be approximated by total lateral impulse created by the body an important finding of the present study of steady translation and rotation was that the lateral hydrodynamic impulse and angular impulse of slender axisymmetric hull shapes can be accurately scaled by the geometric planform area and body volume this allows the present results to be generalized to other slender axi symmetric shapes in steady flow without further cfd studies furthermore the non inertial formulation of the hydrodynamic impulse presented can be applied to unsteady motions including sway and pitch that are present in practical maneuvers of undersea vehicles such an extension of the present work will require cfd simulations of unsteady body motion to evaluate the rate of change of the hydrodynamic impulse and angular impulse if these unsteady terms were found to scale with body volume as would be expected from added mass considerations it would significantly enhance the utility of the hydrodynamic impulse formulation the hydrodynamic impulse formulation provides a natural framework in which to develop models of the hydrodynamic forces and moments that relate to the body geometry and kinematics this type of modelling would eliminate the need for cfd simulations of each body profile or maneuver the linearized slender body formulation is particularly amenable to modelling because it allows the use of superposition of vorticity elements arising from non axisymmetric features to obtain the overall forces and moments an example of a hydrodynamic impulse based model has been presented by jeans et al 2010 for steady translation author contribution holloway and jeans contributed equally in all aspects of the manuscript declaration of competing interest none acknowledgement this research was funded in part by the nserc canada discovery grant of holloway the figures were made by dr rob doyle 
21877,the forces and moments on slender axisymetric bodies are studied using a hydrodynamic impulse formulation for viscous flow in non inertial body frames of reference the problems of steady translation and steady turning are specifically addressed a computational fluid dynamics data base is used to evaluate the hydrodynamic impulse for 3 submarine shaped bodies with slenderness ratios of 7 35 8 38 and 8 75 it was found that the forces and moments calculated using the hydrodynamic impulse formulation give equivalent forces and moment to the traditional method of integrating pressure and shear stress on the body in addition it is shown that the lateral force distribution can be calculated directly from the lamb vector distribution over cross sectional planes linearized forms of the hydrodynamic impulse equations are derived for both translation and steady rotation keywords submarine hydrodynamic impulse viscous flow 1 introduction the concept of hydrodynamic impulse has a long history in theoretical hydrodynamics having been described by lamb in 1895 lamb 1932 the advantage of the theory of hydrodynamic impulse is that it describes the physical origin of hydrodynamic forces and moments in terms of the vorticity generated at the body surface and its subsequent position in the fluid volume in particular the hydrodynamic impulse method provides the opportunity for geometric reasoning to be applied to the vortex formation and transport lamb 1932 shows that for irrotational flow around a moving body the rate of change of hydrodynamic impulse is equal to the force of the fluid acting on the body in an analogous manner the fluid torque on the body can be equated to the rate of change of hydrodynamic angular impulse in potential flow the vorticity is confined to the body surface and a relationship between the hydrodynamic impulse and the state of body motion depends only on the body geometry lamb 1932 newman 1977 karamcheti 1980 milne thompson 1996 and howe 2002 2012 provide a modern formulation of hydrodynamic impulse and applications for irrotational flow milne thompson 1996 and karamcheti 1980 provide the force and moment impulse equations expressed in terms of non inertial body fixed coordinates lamb 1932 also considered the case of isolated vortex filaments within the fluid where there is no external force or torque on the fluid and showed that the linear and angular impulse are invariants of the fluid motion the application of the hydrodynamic impulse method to flow around a moving body with vortex filaments extending into the fluid was presented by lighthill 1986 and saffman 1992 who show that the hydrodynamic impulse can be computed from the moment of the vorticity field of the fluid domain by subtracting the momentum of the body motion this method was applied by lighthill 1986 saffman 1992 and milne thompson 1973 to compute the lift and drag on an airplane wing due to an extending trailing vortex in steady translation the presence of the hypothetical vorticity in the fluid domain used to calculate the impulse is due to the viscous diffusion of vorticity from the body surface and its subsequent convection but viscous effects are not explicitly considered in their analysis the formulation of the hydrodynamic impulse for viscous flow was addressed by wu 1980 and wu and sankar 1980 they show that the explicit contribution of viscous forces to the overall force and moment on the immersed body are limited to the viscous stress on the outer boundary of the fluid domain in the case where the flow is irrotational at the outer boundary the direct effect of viscosity is zero while for high reynolds number flows the viscous stress on the outer boundary is negligible alternative developments of the impulse formulation provided by noca 1997 show that the impulse formulation provided by lighthill 1986 and saffman 1992 for bodies immersed in invisicd flow forms an excellent approximation for high reynolds number viscous flows a recent review of this work is provided in wu et al 2018 the application of the hydrodynamic impulse to practical viscous flows requires knowledge of the vorticity field that can only be obtained from experimental or computational methods this requires that the condition of an infinite fluid domain be relaxed because both experimental and computational methods provide data that is limited to finite domains hydrodynamic impulse formulations for finite domains were advanced by noca 1997 noca et al 1997 1999 yang et al 2007 and wu et al 2007 a key feature of this work is the role of vorticity flux across the boundary of the finite domain in determination of the hydrodynamic force and moment on the body experimental data is generally gathered in the inertial laboratory frame while computational results are generally determined for the body fixed frame of reference which can be non inertial all of the formulations cited above are presented for inertial frames of reference recently the extension of hydrodynamic impulse methods to non inertial body fixed frames of reference has been described by ostieri et al 2017 the method uses a mixed inertial noninertial definition of the lamb vector which the authors develop and apply for two dimensional viscous unsteady flows in the present paper this approach is developed for three dimensional unsteady viscous flow and applied to the problem of steady turning the finite domain impulse formulation has been applied to determine the forces and moments on a body in unsteady flow around moving bodies using instantaneous experimental particle image velocimetry piv data by noca et al 1997 1999 devoria et al 2014 and graham et al 2017 the flow geometry in these applications is two dimensional because instantaneous piv data is generally limited to flow planes the use of computational fluid dynamics cfd solution data in the impulse formulation is described by wu et al 2006 and liu et al 2014 it has also been shown by lighthillrosenhead 1963 that the forces and moments on the body can be related to the flux of vorticity across the solid body surface this approach was further developed by wu and wu 1993 wu and wu 1998 wu et al 2006 and liu et al 2014 for incompressible and compressible flow the idea of improving aerodynamic performance through flow diagnosis is a theme of these articles which examines the local vortical flow structures emanating from the body surface in viscous flow along slender bodies a key feature is the flow separation that forms on the tail at low incidence and migrates noseward as incidence is increased even at moderate incidence strong separated sheets of vorticity roll up into a pair of concentrated vorticies the result is a three dimensional wake on the leeside of the body that consists of two symmetric vortices of opposite circulation it is critical for the development of force and moment estimation methods in viscous flow that these wake vorticies be accurately described for finite computational fluid dynamics cfd flow domains wake vorticity must flow across the downstream domain boundary as the flow develops in the case of steady translation and rotation this outflow of vorticity has the benefit of making the velocity and vorticity fields within the body fixed computational domain time independent for the viscous impulse formulation presented in this article the flux of vorticity across the outflow boundary has a central role a method of approximating the force distribution along a slender body of arbitrary profile using the hydrodynamic impulse of potential flow in cross sectional planes was introduced by munk 1924 for airships and further developed by jones 1946 for low aspect ratio wings see katz and plotkin 1991 for a review of the method the method of jones 1946 was extended to viscous flow along slender bodies of revolution in translation by jeans et al 2009 using vorticity fields obtained from cfd simulations they found that the force distribution overall lateral force and moment could be accurately determined from a two dimensional approximation of the viscous hydrodynamic impulse using only the longitudinal vorticity distribution this approach has strong similarities to the treftz plane method for viscous flow as formulated by drela 2009 the study of jeans et al 2009 is especially relevant to slender body approximations of viscous flow described in the present study the present article explores the role of fluid vorticity in determination of the hydrodynamic forces and moments that act on slender axi symmetric bodies in steady translation and rotation through viscous fluids this is the first comprehensive study of this important class of flows using a theory of hydrodynamic impulse formulation for a non inertial body frame of reference that can be applied to general maneuvers the concept of hydrodynamic impulse was chosen because it offers distinct advantages in model development over the pressure field which is non local and includes contributions from both body acceleration and surrounding vorticity fields arising from the flow history a linearized formulation of the hydrodynamic impulse formulation such as will be developed in this article is especially valuable because it allows superposition of the vortex elements originating along the length of the body to calculate the total force and moments specific attention is directed to the lateral force component normal to the body axis and the yawing moment in steady translation and steady rotation because these are essential for control of underwater vehicle motion 2 axisymmetric body forms the axisymmetric hull shapes studied were the unappended defence research and development canada drdc static test rig str hull watt et al 1991 the darpa suboff hull roddy 1990 and the united states navy series 58 model 4621 submarine hull profiles of both bodies are shown in fig 1 the drdc str profile has three distinct regions the first 20 of the drdc str hull is the nose and has a riegels type d2 profile the next 45 is the cylindrical mid body and the final 36 is the tail section which has a parabolic profile the darpa suboff hull form has a similar nose and midbody to the drdc str but with a concave profile near the tip of the tail the series 58 model 4621 profile is described by a continuous sixth order polynomial randwijck and feldman 2000 and differs significantly from the drdc and suboff profiles largely due to its spheroid nose and absence of a constant radius mid body the drdc str suboff and series 58 model 4621 profiles have length to maximum diameter ratios of 8 75 8 57 and 7 34 respectively other geometric parameters are summarized in table 1 where the body length is denoted ℓ the maximum body radius a m the planform area of the hull a p and the body volume b 3 impulse formulation for viscous flow 3 1 inertial frame of reference the impulse analysis is based on the fluid volume shown in fig 2 where s is the rigid external surface of the arbitrary volume and n ˆ is the outward surface normal the volume f b where b is the body volume and f is the fluid volume in the position vector x o x o y o z o the fluid velocity u o u o v o w o and vorticity ω o ξ o η o ζ o are measured relative to the inertial frame of reference the position vector x x y z the fluid velocity u u v w and vorticity ω ξ η ζ are measured relative to the body frame of reference the fluid domain attached to the body is denoted by c f d the quantities u o and ω o are the disturbances created by the body as it moves through the otherwise quiescent fluid the position of the centre of buoyancy of the body is denoted by r the velocity of the centre of buoyancy as u and the body rotation rate as ω the position velocity and vorticity in the body frame are related to those in the inertial frame according to 1 x o r x 2 u o u u and 3 ω o ω ω the components of the body motion u u v w ω p q r are chosen parallel to the body axes the hydrodynamic impulse per unit mass in the inertial frame i o is defined lighthill 1986 saffman 1992 4 i o 1 2 x o ω o d p o where p o is the momentum of the fluid per unit mass displaced by the presence of the body the components of the linear hydrodynamic impulse per unit mass in the inertial frame are 5 i x o 1 2 y o ζ o z o η o d p x o 6 i y o 1 2 z o ξ o x o ζ o d p y o and 7 i z o 1 2 x o η o y o ξ o d p z o the dynamic equation relating the linear hydrodynamic impulse in a finite domain to the fluid force acting on a rigid body moving through viscous fluid is given by noca et al 1999 8 f ρ d i o d t ρ l o d 1 2 ρ s x o n ˆ l o d s 1 2 s n ˆ x o t i x o t t d s where i is the identity matrix the lamb vector l o w o u o is responsible for the vortex force and the viscous stress tensor is t μ u o u o t the explicit role of viscosity in equation 8 is limited to the viscous stresses acting on the outer boundary surface s such stresses are exactly zero in the case of an irrotational flow at the boundary of the fluid domain and are generally considered to be negligible in high reynolds number viscous flows even where vorticity crosses the domain boundary see e g noca et al 1997 wu et al 2006 the moment acting on the body moving in viscous fluid neglecting the moment of the viscous stresses on the outer fluid boundary is presented by wu et al 2006 9 m o ρ d j o d t ρ x o l o d 1 2 ρ s x o 2 n ˆ l o d s where the hydrodynamic angular impulse per unit mass is defined as 10 j o 1 2 x o 2 ω o d q o where x o 2 x o 2 y o 2 z o 2 and q o is the angular moment per unit mass of the fluid displaced by the body if the volume includes the entire vorticity field with no flux of vorticity across its outer boundary see fig 2 then the surface integrals of equations 8 and 9 are exactly zero furthermore it has also been shown that lighthill 1986 wu et al 2006 11 l o d 0 and 12 r l o d 0 as the outer surface boundary s becomes large equations 8 and 9 then reduce to the classic results 13 f ρ d i o d t and 14 m ρ d j o d t equations 13 and 14 are valid for viscous and inviscid flow around a body and demonstrate that the force and moment on the body arise entirely due to the unsteadiness of the hydrodynamic impulse measured relative to an inertial frame milne thompson 1996 has expressed the hydrodynamic impulse of the flow disturbance relative to the inertial frame of reference in terms of the body fixed coordinates with the origin translating at velocity u and rotating at rate ω fig 2 transforming equations 13 and 14 to the form 15 f ρ d i o d t ρ ω i o and 16 m ρ d j o d t ρ u i o ρ ω j o which again is valid for inviscid or viscous flow subject to the above limitation of negligible vorticity at the outer edges of the fluid domain for plane motion of a body with velocity u u v 0 and angular velocity ω 0 0 r see fig 3 the non zero components of equations 15 and 16 are 17 x ρ d i x o d t ρ r i y o 18 y ρ d i y o d t ρ r i x o and 19 n ρ d j z o d t ρ u i y o v i x o equations 17 19 applied to potential flow around the moving body has the vorticity confined to the surface the hydrodynamic impulse per unit mass relative to the inertial frame can be calculated from the velocity potential φ of the disturbance in body coordinates see karamcheti 1980 saffman 1992 20 i o s b φ n ˆ d s and 21 j o s b φ x n ˆ d s where s b is the surface of the body it follows that equations 20 and 21 for flow around an axisymmetric body in plane motion can be expressed in terms of the state of the vehicle motion see fig 1 22 i x o u k 1 b 23 i y o v k 2 b and 24 j z o r k γ b where k 1 k 2 and k are the added mass coefficients for longitudinal and lateral body motion and rotation respectively the polar moment of inertia of the fluid displaced by the body is represented by γ b substituting equations 22 to 24 into 17 to 19 gives the force and moment on the body in terms of the vehicle state of motion see fig 1 page 186 25 x ρ

are widely used in naval hydrodynamics to model force and moment due to unsteadiness of a maneuver newman 1977 for steady rotation equations 25 27 reduce to 28 x ρ r v k 2 b 29 y ρ r u k 1 b and 30 n ρ u v k 2 k 1 b this is the famous result that munk 1924 developed for prediction of airship stability in steady translation where r 0 the force on the body is zero but the moment is still given by equation 30 we will return to this result in the sections describing slender body approximations 3 2 accelerating frames of reference the analysis of the hydrodynamic impulse in an accelerating frame of reference will use body fixed coordinates the derivation of the hydrodynamic impulse equations for the force acting on the body is based on the kinematic relationship presented by saffman 1992 for a finite fluid domain 31 d d t 1 2 x ω d 1 2 x ω t d following noca 1997 the volume b is assumed filled with a fictitious fluid subject to an external body force f e which holds the fictitious fluid within the body in rigid motion along the prescribed path under consideration in order to derive the hydrodynamic force equation we substitute the dynamic equation for vorticity in a rotating frame greenspan 1968 with the addition of the external force field f e limited to the body volume 32 ω t l 2 ω ρ 1 f e ν ω where ν is the kinematic viscosity and ω ω o 2 ω is the fluid vorticity in the body frame the lamb vector l ω o u is defined in terms of the body frame velocity u and the inertial vorticity ω o this definition for the lamb vector is an important feature of the vorticity equation in inertial and non inertial frames of reference it has been applied to impulse methods for calculating the force on a body in two dimensional unsteady viscous flow by ostieri et al 2017 we now extend the method applied by noca 1997 for inertial frames to accelerating frames of reference by substitution of equation 32 into equation 31 to give 33 b f e d ρ d g d t 2 ρ x ω d ρ l d 1 2 ρ s x n ˆ l d s μ s n ω 1 2 x n ˆ ω d s the moment of vorticity for the non inertial frame of reference is defined as 34 g 1 2 x ω d the integral of the external force on the left hand side of equation 33 is related to the force on the body and the rate of change of the fluid momentum within the body noca 1997 saffman 1992 35 b f e d f ρ d p o d t which on substitution into equation 33 gives 36 f ρ d p o d t ρ d g d t 2 ρ x ω d ρ l d 1 2 ρ s x n ˆ l d s where similar to the analysis in the inertial frame the last term of equation 33 which represents the viscous force on the outer surface s is neglected as insignificant in high reynolds number flow the rate of change of the momentum of the fluid filled body is calculated as 37 d p o d t ρ b u derivation of the moment equation for a non inertial frame of reference is based on a kinematic identity similar to equation 31 provided by saffman 1992 38 d d t 1 2 x 2 ω d 1 2 x 2 ω t d substitution of equation 32 into equation 38 gives the result neglecting viscous effects on the outer boundary 39 b x f e d ρ d h d t ρ x ω d ρ x l d 1 2 ρ s x 2 n ˆ l d s where 40 h 1 2 x 2 ω d the integral of the moment of the external force on the left hand side of equation 33 is related to the moment on the fluid filled body according to saffman 1992 41 b x f e d m ρ d q o d t which on substitution into equation 39 gives 42 m ρ d q o d t ρ d h d t 2 ρ x 2 ω d ρ x l d 1 2 ρ s x 2 n ˆ l d s the angular momentum per unit mass of the rigid fluid filled body is calculated as 43 d q o d t d d t b x u d ρ b r u where r is the position of the centre of buoyancy of the body relative to the inertial frame of reference the moments of vorticity g and h and the momentum per unit mass of the fluid displaced p o and q o can be combined to form the hydrodynamic impulse as was done in the inertial frame however here we choose to keep them separate since for steady turning the rate of change of g and h are zero whereas the rate of change of p o forms a body force that has an important role in the determination of the hydrodynamic force 4 translation 4 1 computational database the cfd database consists of predictions from verified and validated reynolds averaged navier stokes rans simulations on the drdc str series 58 model 4621 and darpa suboff geometries using ansys cfx a commercially available solver based on the rans equations discretized using a finite volume finite element approach schneider and raw 1987 simulations were performed at model scale with reynolds number ranging from r e u ℓ ν 11 7 23 10 6 at incidence angles up to 30 o and the conditions simulated for each geometry as shown in table 2 the cfd methodology and validation process are detailed in jeans et al 2009 and only a brief overview is given here full second order spatial discretization was employed to minimize numerical diffusion double precision was used throughout to minimize round off error an important consideration in the near wall region which contains hexahedra elements with aspect ratios as large as 1 9 million because of the high reynolds number the governing equations were converged in all simulations until the rms residuals for mass and momentum within the domain were below 1 10 5 the cfd domain mesh topology and boundary conditions are shown in fig 4 to take advantage of the symmetry only half the streamline body was modeled in the final simulations the validity of a symmetric wake is justified for the present range of slenderness and incidence angles less than 30 o ericsson and reding 1080 the body is approximately centered in the domain and orientated at the desired incidence relative to the outer boundaries so that the inlet and outlet are normal to the freestream and the opening boundaries are parallel to the freestream the turbulence intensity at the inlet was set to 1 to match experimental conditions at the outlet the average static pressure was set to zero the no slip wall condition was employed on the hull surface and the free slip wall condition was used along the symmetry plane on the final three outer boundaries fluid was permitted to enter and leave the domain as required to match the freestream pressure condition hybrid meshes consisting of both structured and unstructured blocks were generated using a script that was optimized specifically for axisymmetric slender bodies at incidence watt et al 2006 significant effort was made to develop a scripting algorithm that accurately discretizes the leeside vortex and shear layers the first node height was chosen to keep the maximum y to the first node height below 0 3 ensuring adequate discretization of the boundary layer the mesh parameters chosen resulted in grids ranging from 3 to 8 million nodes depending on incidence and reynolds number in general the number of nodes increased as incidence or reynolds number increased the primary means of validation was comparison of overall forces and moments with experiment watt et al 1993b vanrandwijck and feldman 2000 nguyen et al 1995 roddy 1990 the reynolds stress model bsl rsm lauder et al 1975 α 15 o was used for all simulations the bsl rsm turbulence model consistently underpredicted the experimental data by 10 but were within experimental uncertainty for the drdc str data for α 25 o jeans et al 2009 showed that for these rans calculations the discretization errors in the total force were less than 5 at α 30 o and smaller at lower incidence angles 4 2 exact impulse equations to analyze steady translation through viscous flow we choose the body frame of reference the body frame in this case is also an inertial frame where ω ω o and l l o in order to emphasize the importance of inertial vorticity in steady translation and rotation we will use l u ω o throughout since the unsteady portion of the wake is outside of the computational domain it is not included in the analysis we therefore use the steady flow form of equations 8 and 9 wu et al 2007 44 f ρ l d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ l d s and 45 m ρ x l d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ l d s where w is the portion of the outer surface of the cfd domain across which there is vorticity flow i e the wake the domain used to evaluate the terms of equations 44 and 45 must enclose the entire body but need not enclose the entire vorticity of the wake provided the flux of vorticity across the boundary is accounted for the surface integral of the tangential component of the lamb vector l t n ˆ l over the wake plane has a non zero contribution to the longitudinal force component but zero contribution to the lateral and normal force components the non zero components of the force and moments deduced from equations 44 and 45 are 46 x ρ x t x n f x x d x 1 2 ρ w y l y z l z d y d z 47 y ρ x t x n f y x d x and 48 n ρ x t x n x f y x d x ρ x t x n s x y l x d y d z d x 1 2 ρ w y 2 z 2 l y d y d z where s x is the cross sectional surface of the fluid domain normal to the body axis and f x f y are the longitudinal and lateral load distribution functions defined as 49 f x x s x l x d y d z and 50 f y x s x l y d y d z the components of the lamb vector are 51 l x x v ζ o w η o 52 l y x w ξ o u ζ o and 53 l z x u η o v ξ o it may be surprising that the longitudinal load distribution has an effect on the yawing moment as shown in equation 48 this arises from the tilting of the vortex lines at finite angles of drift it could also be explained by the stagnation point being moved to the windward side of the body in drift for slender bodies the contribution is small it was found to be most instructive to integrate the lamb vector in equations 46 48 over planes normal to the body axis and then sum these planar integrals from the tail plane to a position just forward of the nose of the body the lamb vector components on cross sectional planes normal to the body axis are shown in fig 5 the force and moment calculated from equations 46 48 are shown in fig 6 where they are compared to the forces and moments obtained by the traditional method of integrating the pressure and shear stress over the body surface the difference between the results obtained with the two methods based on the same cfd solution fields is small for the longitudinal force and completely negligible for the lateral force and yawing moment the reader is reminded that these equations neglect the viscous stresses around the outer boundary of the domain this includes the wake plane the longitudinal force normalized by body length shows a significant dependence on body profile whereas the lateral force scaled by planform area and re and the yawing moment scaled by body volume show no dependence on the body shape in the following the forces and moment calculated from equations 46 48 will be referred to as exact the lateral force distribution along the body can be obtained by differentiating equation 47 with respect to longitudinal position along the body to give 54 y x ρ f y x this lateral distribution for steady translation is shown in fig 7 where it is compared to the normal force distribution obtained from integration of pressure and shear stress and potential flow results note that λ λ c b x is the distance along the body axis measured from the nose the difference in the lateral force distribution calculated by the two methods is insignificant 4 3 slender body approximations a linearization of equation 44 for slender bodies in steady translation can be formed by transforming the velocity field to the ground frame according to wu et al 2006 55 u u o u substitution of equation 55 into the lamb vector and expanding 56 l ω o u o u ω o the first term is quadratic in the disturbance field and will be neglected as a higher order contribution substitution of the remaining approximate form of the lamb vector into equations 44 and 45 gives 57 f ρ u ω o d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ u ω o d s and 58 m ρ x u ω o d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ u ω o d s the first integral of equation 57 can then be expressed exactly as a surface integral over the wake using the vorticity moment theorem see 8 59 ω o d w ω o n ˆ x d s substitution of equation 59 into equation 57 gives the linearized formula for the force 60 f ρ u w ω o n ˆ x d s 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ u ω o d s the linear approximation for the components of force in steady translation are 61 x ρ v i y o x w 1 2 ρ v i y o x w ρ u i x o x w and 62 y ρ u i y o x w where we have defined the longitudinal and lateral impulse per unit length and unit mass as 63 i x o x s x y ζ o d s u a b x and 64 i y o x s x z ξ o d s v a b x the integration is taken over cross sectional planes normal to the body axis and the area a b x is the cross sectional area of the body at position x equation 62 has also been derived by drela 2009 in defining the longitudinal impulse per unit length it was assumed that 65 s x y ζ o d s s x z η o d s this is exactly true for closed vortex loops lighthill 1986 and was found to be a very good approximation for planes normal to the body axis as shown in fig 5 since all the terms of equations 61 and 62 depend only on wake integrals one would expect that the linear estimates would be improved by moving the position of the wake plane x w well aft of the body where the local velocity approximates that of the free stream this is indeed the case as shown in fig 8 on the other hand if the wake plane is placed further forward than the tail of the body it will include only the accumulated force from the nose to outflow plane the first term of equation 61 denoted by x l x is an approximation of the longitudinal load distribution integral of equation 46 and the last two terms form an approximation of the wake integral of equation 46 denoted by x w these linear approximations are compared to the exact results in table 3 at zero incidence x l x 0 and the wake term is entirely responsible for the longitudinal force which is equal to the drag on the body in drift x l x makes a significant contribution although of opposite sign to the wake integral the linear approximation of x is only good at the lowest drift angle where x w is dominant the single term of equation 62 for y is an approximation of the lateral load distribution integral of equation 47 and is denoted by y l y as shown in table 3 the linear approximation is within 4 up to drift angles of 20 o the linearized form of the equation for the moment is 66 m ρ x u ω o d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ u ω o d s with the yawing component taking the form 67 n ρ u x t x n x ζ o dsd x ρ v x t x t s x y ζ o d s d x 1 2 ρ u w y 2 z 2 ζ o d y d z using equation 59 in the following way 68 x t x n x ζ o dsd x x t x n x x s x z ξ o d s d x substituting into equation 67 and integrating by parts gives 69 n ρ u x t x n i y o x d x ρ u x t i y o x t ρ v x t x n i x o x d x 1 2 ρ u w y 2 z 2 ζ o d y d z the first two terms of equation 69 represent the approximation of the moment of the lateral force distribution of equation 48 the third term is an approximation of the moment of the longitudinal load distribution and the last term is the wake integral these are denoted as n l y n l x and n w respectively and are compared to the exact results in table 3 the first term n l y gives an estimate of the yawing moment to within 5 up to β 20 o the terms n l x and n w are small and nearly cancel in the exact representation but are poorly estimated by the linear approximation n l y represents the integral of the moment of the linearized lateral force distribution 70 y x ρ u x i y o x 5 steady rotation 5 1 cfd database the methodology for the computational database for steady rotation is similar to the translation database utilizing ansys cfx rans simulations and the rsm turbulence model the methodology and validation are detailed in zhang et al 2013 and a brief overview is given here simulations were completed for a range of turning radii where 1 0 r l 10 and three model reynolds numbers a summary of all the cases included in the present study is provided in table 4 cfd meshes were made using a modified version of the meshing script previously discussed an example of the cfd domain showing the mesh topology for the drdc str hull for r ℓ 2 86 is shown in fig 9 an enlarged image of the structured grid around the body and through the wake is also shown the computational domain is in a rotating frame of reference attached to the body axes the boundary conditions are transformed from the inertial frame where the hull is translating and rotating through a stationary fluid systematic grid refinement showed mesh independence for half body simulations for meshes with 3 8 9 3 million nodes partial validation of these simulations for steady turning conditions was made by comparison of overall forces and moments with experiments on darpa suboff etebari et al 2008 the rans simulations were found to be within experimental uncertainty for r ℓ 2 74 r e 6 5 million and a drift angle of β c b 16 5 o another source of validation from the suboff experiments was a comparison of wake vorticity fields at specific axial locations the agreement is excellent with close correspondence of shear layer separation point and wake vorticity distribution 5 2 exact impulse equations to analyze the steady rotation of an axisymmetric body moving through viscous fluid we will use the finite computational domain in fig 9 which is attached to the body frame of reference the velocity and vorticity fields obtained from the simulations are steady and equations 36 and 42 reduce to 71 f ρ b u ρ l d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ l d s and 72 m ρ b r u ρ x l d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ l d s where w is the portion of the outer surface of the fluid domain across which there is vorticity flow i e the wake the terms which distinguish equation 71 from equation 44 for steady translation is the acceleration of the centre of buoyancy of the fluid filled body this acceleration can be calculated for steady rotation as 73 u ω ω r ω u the body force is very significant to equation 71 but it has no contribution to the moment equation 72 since according to equation 73 the body force is parallel to the position vector of the centre of buoyancy r substituting equation 73 into equation 71 gives the lateral and axial components of force and the yawing moment deduced from equations 71 and 72 74 x ρ r v b ρ x n x t f x x d x 1 2 ρ w y l y z l z d y d z 75 y ρ r u b ρ x t x n f y x d x and 76 n ρ x t x n x f y x d x ρ x w x t s x y l x d y d z d x 1 2 ρ w y 2 z 2 l y d y d z where f x and f y are given by equations 49 and 50 note that equations 74 and 75 have a similar form to those in steady translation equations 46 and 47 with the exception of the body force arising from rotation the moment equation 76 is identical to equation 48 the forces x and y and moment n calculated from equations 74 76 are compared to those calculated from pressure and skin friction in fig 10 the differences between the two methods are negligible for y and n for all but the highest rates of turning note that the scale of the yawing moment for the range of turning considered is 10 times smaller than in fig 10 for steady translation this explains the apparent profile dependence of the scaled moments at high rates of turning which in fact are comparable but larger in a relative sense to what occurs in translation the scaling of y with the planform area a p eliminates most of the dependence on the body profile as was the case in translation the lateral force distribution along the body can be obtained exactly by differentiating equation 75 with respect to longitudinal distance along the body to give 77 y x ρ r u a b x ρ f y x the lateral force distribution is shown in fig 11 for a steady turn with r ℓ 1 67 rotation has a dramatic affect on the lateral force distribution which is directed outward from the centre of rotation this explains the near zero yawing moment at high rates of turning shown in fig 10 the distribution of the lateral body force term has zero moment about the centre of buoyancy 5 3 slender body approximations linearization of equations 71 and 72 for steady rotation of a slender body can be formed by transforming the velocity field to the ground frame of reference according to 78 u u o u ω x and expanding the lamb vector as 79 l ω o u o u ω o ω x ω o as was done in steady translation we form a linear approximation of equation 79 by neglecting the product of the inertial vorticity and velocity disturbance substitution of the approximate lamb vector into equation 71 gives 80 f ρ b ω u ρ u ω o d ρ ω x ω o d 1 2 ρ w x n ˆ u ω x ω o d s the components of force on the body in linearized form are 81 x ρ r v b ρ v r x w i y o x w ρ r x w x n s x z ξ o d s d x 1 2 ρ v r x w i y o x w ρ u i x o x w 1 2 ρ r w y 2 ζ o d s 1 2 ρ r w y z η o d s 82 y ρ r u b ρ u i y o x w ρ r x w x n s x y ζ o d s d x where it should be noted that in turning 83 i y o x s x z ξ o v r x a b x d s comparing equations 81 61 for longitudinal force component in translation we see that there are several additional terms due to rotation the first term is the body force x b which can be calculated exactly the following two terms form the linear estimate of the longitudinal load distribution integral x l x and the last 4 terms form the wake integral x w both x l x and x w contain rotation terms with those proportional to the lateral dimensions of the body y 2 and y z being very small comparing equation 82 for the lateral force to 62 for translation shows there are two additional terms arising from rotation a body force term y b which is calculated exactly and a term which arises from the linear estimate of the lateral load distribution integral y l x the distribution of accumulated lateral force along the drdc str body in steady rotation according to equation 82 is shown in fig 12 substitution of the approximate lamb vector into equation 72 gives 84 m ρ b x u ω o d ρ x ω x ω o d 1 2 ρ w x 2 n ˆ u ω x ω o d s and the linearized yawing moment equation is 85 n ρ u x w x n i y o x d x ρ u x w i y o x t ρ v x w x n i x o x d x 1 2 ρ w y 2 z 2 u r y ζ o d y d z the only explicit appearance of rotation in equation 85 arises from the wake term and this is proportional to y 3 making it negligible for a slender body as in translation the remaining terms are denoted n l y n l x and n w a term by term comparison of the linear estimates for x y and n are provided for steady rotation of the drdc str body in table 5 the longitudinal and lateral forces are accurately represented by the linear estimates this is consistent with the accuracy of the linear estimates for translation if one considers that even at the highest rate of turning considered for the linear analysis r ℓ 2 86 the local angle of incidence along the body is nowhere greater 10 o the linear estimate of the yawing moment in steady turning shows a significant relative error on the order of 30 but it must be remembered that the moments in the case of steady turning are very small when compared to translation where a similar absolute error constituted a relative error of only 5 similar to translation the best linear estimate of the yawing moment is made by neglecting all contributions except n l y which is due to the integral of the moment of the lateral load distribution the lateral load distribution can be formed by differentiating equation 82 with respect to distance x resulting in 86 y x ρ u x i y o x ρ r i x o x in steady turning this linear estimate of the lateral load distribution contains a rotation term which is not present in the yawing moment estimate since it cancels with the rotation term in the moment of the longitudinal load distribution 6 discussion 6 1 role of the lamb vector in steady viscous flow relative to the body frame of reference it is the lamb vector field l ω o u which determines the force and moment on a body the lamb vector is non zero wherever the vorticity vector measured relative to an inertial frame and the fluid velocity are not aligned or zero in the external flows under consideration the vorticity is generated at the surface of the body and displaced by the flow around the body the resulting contributions to the force and moment of the individual terms of equations 46 48 are shown in fig 13 the axial force is calculated from a volume integral of the longitudinal component of the lamb vector l x v ζ o w η o and a wake term which is a surface integral of the moment of the tangential component of the lamb vector x l t y l y z l z 0 0 these are illustrated in fig 14 the lamb vector includes the effect of lateral flow v across the spanwise vortex elements ζ o and the spanwise flow w across the transverse η o vortex elements these terms represent the rate of stretching over the nose and compression over the tail of the vortex rings around the body and individually are very large due to the strong vortex sheet generated by the longitudinal flow as shown in fig 15 however they have opposite sign and the difference of the two terms is small at small angles of drift the wake integral has a non zero axial component with the integrand y u ζ o w ξ o z v ξ o u η o at low angles of drift the two dominant terms are y u ζ o z u η o which represents the downstream rate of transport of the vortex rings shed from the body surface at large drift angles the two contributions have nearly equal magnitudes but opposite signs making the total axial force practically zero this differencing of large terms in the calculation of x is responsible for the noticeable inaccuracy of the impulse method for the longitudinal force the lateral force is entirely determined by the volume integral of lateral component of the lamb vector l y w ξ o u ζ o there is no wake contribution to the lateral force this also applies to non axisymmetric bodies in steady flow the two contributions of the lamb vector integral illustrated in fig 16 are the spanwise flow w across the longitudinal vortex elements ξ o and the longitudinal flow u across the spanwise vortex elements ζ o as shown in fig 13 the first term w ξ o increases approximately linearly with drift angle whereas the integral of u ζ o has a strong non linearity and dominates at large drift angles these terms form a rational basis for the generally accepted empirical form of lateral force on a slender axisymmetric body y a β b β β mackay 2006 although it should be noted that this approximation does not have continuous derivatives zero drift angle the yawing moment has 3 contributions the moment of the lateral force distribution x f y x the moment of the longitudinal force distribution y f x x and a wake integral of y 2 z 2 l y these are shown in fig 13 the last two terms are small and have opposite signs which makes their net effect practically negligible consequently the moment of the lateral force distribution is responsible for the yawing moment the volume integral terms and the wake terms of equations 74 76 for steady turning are shown in fig 17 each of the above contributions described for translation apply equally to steady turning however in steady turning there are additional body force terms which must be included in the longitudinal and lateral forces due to non inertial body frame these body force terms are large and have the opposite sign to the volume integral of the lamb vector in both cases there is no body force contribution to the yawing moment in steady turning and it is determined to good approximation in a similar manner to translation by the moment of the lateral load distribution 6 2 linear equations for steady turning it is possible to draw a connection between the linearized equations 81 85 which apply to a finite domain with vorticity flux across the boundary and equations 17 19 for steady rotation in an infinite domain containing all the flow vorticity this can be done by reformulating equations 81 85 in terms of the hydrodynamic impulse 87 i ˆ x o x x t x n i x o x d x and 88 i ˆ y o x x t x n i y o x d x so that the body force terms no longer appear explicitly here we have limited the integration to the body length by placing the wake plane at the tail even though this excludes a relatively small impulse assigned to the wake by the linearization substituting equations 87 and 88 into equations 81 85 and neglecting the small contributions of x l x and n w gives 89 x ρ u i x o x t ρ r i ˆ y o 90 y ρ u i y o x t ρ r i ˆ x o and 91 n ρ u i ˆ y o v i ˆ x o ρ u x t i y o x t for translation r 0 equations 90 and 91 reduce to the result presented by jeans et al 2009 for the hydrodynamic force and moment in steady translation jeans et al 2009 further neglected the term v i ˆ x o from equation 91 and the present study provides support for that approximation comparing equations 89 91 to equations 17 19 shows that 92 ρ d i x o d t ρ u i x o x t 93 ρ d i y o d t ρ u i y o x t and 94 ρ d j z o d t ρ u x t i y o x t therefore one can conclude that within the linear approximation the unsteady terms of equations 17 19 are approximated by the release of longitudinal and lateral hydrodynamic impulse per unit length at a rate proportional to the longitudinal component of body velocity the rate of change of the angular momentum is the rate of lateral momentum release at the tail multiplied by the tail position relative to the centre of buoyancy 7 summary and conclusions the vorticity based method of calculating the forces and moments acting on a body in an external viscous flow as described by noca 1997 has been applied to slender bodies of revolution in steady translation the vorticity fields used for this calculation were derived from cfd rans simulations made in the body frame of reference for a finite domain it was shown that the hydrodynamic force and moment determined by the vorticity based calculation were practically identical to those determined using the traditional method of integrating the shear stress and pressure over the surface of the body this was also true for the lateral load distribution along the body both calculation methods were based on the same cfd solution fields demonstrating that the vorticity based methods do not require higher resolution to achieve an equal degree of accuracy the vorticity methods do rely on a volume integration over the vorticity containing region surrounding the body however this volume integration is limited to the viscous affected region between the nose and tail of the body with the wake integral evaluated in the tail plane the vorticity method of noca 1997 was extended to non inertial body frames of reference and applied to viscous flow along slender bodies of revolution undergoing steady turning the results of the vorticity based method were found to be practically identical to those derived from surface pressure and shear stress distributions on the body it was shown that the formulation for non inertial body frames of reference differs from the case of steady translation having an inertial body frame of reference in 2 respects 1 the lamb vector l ω o u must be calculated using the inertial frame vorticity and the body frame velocity field and 2 the body force due to the frame acceleration of the fluid displaced by the body must be included in the case of steady turning the body force is substantial but it has no effect on the yawing moment as it acts through the centre of rotation a linearization of the vorticity method based on the approach of wu et al 2007 was shown to provide a good approximation of the lateral force and yawing moment on slender axisymetric bodies up to and including drift angles of 20 o and rotation rates of r ℓ u 0 18 in both cases the lateral force can be approximated by the flux of lateral impulse across the wake plane and the yawing moment about the tail can be approximated by total lateral impulse created by the body an important finding of the present study of steady translation and rotation was that the lateral hydrodynamic impulse and angular impulse of slender axisymmetric hull shapes can be accurately scaled by the geometric planform area and body volume this allows the present results to be generalized to other slender axi symmetric shapes in steady flow without further cfd studies furthermore the non inertial formulation of the hydrodynamic impulse presented can be applied to unsteady motions including sway and pitch that are present in practical maneuvers of undersea vehicles such an extension of the present work will require cfd simulations of unsteady body motion to evaluate the rate of change of the hydrodynamic impulse and angular impulse if these unsteady terms were found to scale with body volume as would be expected from added mass considerations it would significantly enhance the utility of the hydrodynamic impulse formulation the hydrodynamic impulse formulation provides a natural framework in which to develop models of the hydrodynamic forces and moments that relate to the body geometry and kinematics this type of modelling would eliminate the need for cfd simulations of each body profile or maneuver the linearized slender body formulation is particularly amenable to modelling because it allows the use of superposition of vorticity elements arising from non axisymmetric features to obtain the overall forces and moments an example of a hydrodynamic impulse based model has been presented by jeans et al 2010 for steady translation author contribution holloway and jeans contributed equally in all aspects of the manuscript declaration of competing

21878,a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid is a non conservative system and loses its stability for a sufficiently high flow velocity when a fluid conveying pipe is involved as a structural element in a mechanical system e g in oil and gas industry it is often preferred to maximize the critical flow velocity in the pipe this study focuses on the possibility of increasing the critical flow velocity of horizontal and vertical pipes conveying fluid by considering one or more additional masses and or springs at various locations along the pipe galerkin method is used to solve the equation of motion of the problem derived based on the linear theory of elasticity and a plug flow model assumption the results of the present study are compared with those available in literature the results show a possibility of increasing the critical fluid velocity for horizontal and vertical cantilevered pipes it is observed that the critical flow velocity can be significantly increased by adding a spring and a point mass at specific positions depending on the mass ratio β of the system keywords stability anlysis dynamic analysis pipes conveying fluid vibration fluid structure interaction 1 introduction during the past decades the stability and dynamic analysis of slender structures conveying fluids have been studied by many researchers engineers and designers heshmati et al 2019 some engineering applications include oil and hydraulic pipelines heat exchangers liquid fuel piping systems air conditioning ducts and offshore piping bahaadini et al 2018a 2018b dehrouyeh semnani et al 2019 ibrahim 2010 minas et al 2017 among different types of slender structures special attention has been paid to the stability of pipes conveying fluid with different boundary conditions as an interesting engineering application of pipes conveying fluid a long cantilever pipe in the form of a tubing string is normally used in the underground gas storage systems ge et al 2019 the cantilever pipe is used as the flow channel for water injection and or brine production and the instability of the pipe system is required to prevent tubing failure merey 2019 several analytical and numerical methods and experimental investigations have been developed for a wide range of engineering applications moditis et al 2016 zare et al 2018 2017 the main reasons for special attention to pipes conveying fluid are their i simplicity and ii significant role in understanding the physics of more complicated systems paidoussis 2013 it is well known that a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid is a non conservative system and loses its stability for a sufficiently high flow velocity when a fluid conveying pipe is used as a structural element in a mechanical system e g in oil and gas industry and from a practical point of view it is usually preferred to design the pipe such that the critical flow velocity becomes as high as possible it is worth noting that the critical flow velocity of a cantilever pipe conveying fluid changes under the influence of additional masses and springs in practical applications although the dynamics and stability of pipes conveying fluid have been extensively investigated in the literature less attention has been paid to the influences of additional mass and or spring on the critical flow velocity this study focuses on the possibility of increasing the critical flow velocity of horizontal and vertical pipes conveying fluid by considering additional masses and or springs at various locations on the pipe chen 1971 used a theoretical model and investigated the stability of a cantilever pipe it is found that the spring may have a destabilizing effect on the tube for certain ranges of pipe parameters sugiyama et al 1985 used theoretical and experimental methods and studied the effect of intermediate lateral spring support on the stability of a cantilever tubular pipe conveying fluid they showed that a cantilever pipe with spring support does not necessarily lead to stabilization and indeed is likely to have a destabilizing effect moreover having spring support at the free end of the cantilever pipe may produce a destabilizing effect sugiyama et al 1987 extended their work and considered the combined effects of a spring support and an additional point mass in the same location on the stability of a cantilever pipe further studies on this problem can be found in hill and swanson 1970 jendrzejczyk and chen 1985 the influences of combined rotational and translational elastic supports on the dynamics of pipes conveying steady and pulsatile flows have been investigated by noah and hopkins 1980 based on the results reported by these authors the pipes with a steady flow may lose their stability by either divergence or flutter based on the relative magnitude of the rotational and translational spring constants for the cantilever pipes conveying fluid resting on an elastic winkler foundation it has been shown that the single translational or rotary foundation along the entire length of the pipe can increase the critical flow velocity elishakoff and impollonia 2000 the effects of uniform and non uniform elastic winkler foundation on the stability of cantilever pipes conveying fluid have also been investigated by marzani et al 2012 they used a finite element formulation with a state state transformation and showed that increasing the uniform elastic foundation leads to an increase in the critical flow velocity whereas for a non uniform elastic foundation the system may achieve higher or lower critical flow velocity depending on the pipe fluid mass ratio these results must be viewed with caution because the s type behavior of the instability curves was not predicted accurately kheiri et al 2014 studied dynamics and stability of a pipe flexibly supported at its ends it is shown that for a pinned free pipe additionally constrained at the pinned end by a rotational spring an increase in the rotational spring stiffness makes the pipe less stable however they ended up with this conclusion that the dynamics of a pipe conveying fluid supported only by a translational and a rotational spring at the upstream are very complex and in many cases unpredictable one interesting behavior in stability analysis of cantilever pipes conveying fluid is the negative slope portions of the stability curves as reported by gregory and paidoussis 1966 paidoussis 2013 such portions are referred to as s shaped curves and correspond to the threshold of re stabilization of the system the origin of the existence of this behavior is not fully understood yet however the behavior of the pipe in the vicinity of these s shaped segments of the stability curve is associated with a large number of linear and nonlinear characteristics paidoussis 2013 it is worth noting that this behavior is missing in some of the published works and so the results reported in such references must be viewed with specific caution e g zhang et al 2016 such references have been omitted in this literature review the present study aims to stabilize a fluid conveying cantilevered pipe using conventional added elements both horizontal and vertical cantilever pipes with additional elements i e springs and masses are considered in this study galerkin method is used to solve the equation of motion of the problem derived based on the linear theory of elasticity and a plug flow model assumption the effect of adding each element is initially studied for both aforementioned orientations i e the effect of the position stiffness and magnitude of added spring and mass respectively 2 problem statement consider a uniform pipe of length l with mass per unit length m and flexural rigidity e i as shown in fig

is the distance between the fixed end and the additional point mass location similarly l 2 represents the distance between the fixed end and the spring while k represents the stiffness of the spring

researchers have studied the effects of several parameters on eq 1 including the effects of fluid viscosity nonuniform flow profile and viscoelastic material for the pipe the influences of different loadings such as pressurization tensioning and gravity have also been studied in the literature paidoussis 2013 paidoussis et al 2008 paidoussis and issid 1974 all these effects have been investigated for various types of boundary conditions for example simply supported clamped clamped and cantilevered systems many researchers have also focused on dynamic stability of pipes and investigated the effects of additional masses and springs chen 1971 lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 sugiyama et al 1987 1985 in this paper a more complete investigation of the effects of additional masses and

general enough to be used for pipes with all boundary conditions as an example all coefficients b s r c s r d s r b r r c r r and d r r can easily be calculated for a cantilever pipe conveying fluid

additional mass spring in this section the galerkin method is discussed further and the details for adding springs and point masses to the cantilever pipe are described two approaches based on the literature are discussed for the spring addition and one approach for adding the point mass 3 2 1 pipe with additional spring two different solution approaches can be used to include the effects of additional springs the first possible approach is to include the additional springs in the equation of motion of the problem the second approach is to consider the springs as part of the boundary conditions of the problem these two approaches are called equation of motion approach and boundary condition approach and are briefly described in the following sections 3 2 1 1 approach 1 equation of motion approach this method was used by sugiyama et al 1987 1985 to add a spring to any position on the cantilevered pipe the spring was taken into consideration by adding a new term to the non dimensionalized governing equation eq 3 without changing the boundary conditions the new term representing the additional spring is 12 k δ ξ ξ 1 η where k k l 3 e i and ξ 1 l 1 l l 1 is the distance between the fixed end and the spring and k is the stiffness of the spring substituting eq 4 into 12 multiplying the results by φ s ξ and then integrating it over the domain 0 1 the additional term 12 becomes 13 1 n k φ r ξ 1 φ s ξ 1 q the final form of the added term i e 13 which represents the additional spring can be added to eq 7 to obtain the new governing differential equation for a cantilevered pipe with an added spring 3 2 1 2 approach 2 boundary condition approach this approach was used by lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 to introduce a spring at the free end of a cantilevered pipe the additional spring is integrated into the boundary condition which can be seen below 14 3 η ξ 3 k η 0 where k k l 3 e i inserting eq 4 into eq 14 yields 15 φ k φ using this approach the cantilevered pipe with an additional spring at the free end is modeled as a cantilevered beam with an additional spring at the free end in the galerkin scheme the eigenfunctions of a cantilevered beam with and without a spring at its free end are the same paidoussis 2013 nevertheless the eigenvalues used in the comparison functions should be calculated using the below equation paidoussis 2013 16 k λ j 3 tan λ j tanh λ j 1 cos λ j cosh λ j 1 0 table 7 shows the first 8 eigen values of a cantilever beam with an additional spring at its end 3 2 2 pipe with an additional point mass the procedure used in this section is very similar to the one used in the first approach of adding a spring this method was used by hill and swanson 1970 where the additional mass is considered by adding a new term to the non dimensional equation of motion eq 3 the additional term representing the additional mass is 17 μ δ ξ ξ 1 2 η τ 2 where μ m a m m l ξ 1 l 1 l μ is the magnitude of the added mass m a is the concentrated mass and l 1 is the distance between the fixed end and the additional point mass location substituting eq 4 into 17 multiplying the results by φ s ξ and then integrating it over the domain 0 1 the additional term 17 becomes 18 1 n μ φ r ξ 1 φ s ξ 1 q the final form 18 which represents the additional mass can be added to eq 7 to obtain the new governing differential equation of a cantilevered pipe with an additional point mass 3 3 eigenvalues determination eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors are used to determine the frequencies of a free vibration system the general equation of motion of the system can be written as eq 8 where m e and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the system respectively these matrices are all of the same order as the number of degrees of freedom n it should be noted that the mass and stiffness matrices are symmetric if the generalized coordinates are defined from the undeformed equilibrium configuration with zero potential energy and the problem constraints are all scleronomic i e do not contain the time as an explicit variable the damping matrix is also symmetric if derived from a dissipation function bishop and johnson 1961 to calculate the eigenvalues of the problem eq 8 needs to be reduced to a first order form due to the presence of damping the eigenvalues of the problem are no longer real the equation of motion can then be transferred into the following first order form 19 l z p z 0 where the portioned matrices l p and vector z of dimension 2 n are defined as 20 l 0 m m e p m 0 0 k z q q assuming a solution of the form z j e λ t eq 19 is transformed into the following eigenvalue problem 21 λ i y j 0 where y l 1 p 4 results this section is divided into two main parts showing the results of the galerkin method in the first part of this section a horizontal cantilevered pipe is considered and the effects of i adding various masses in different positions along the length and ii adding an additional spring at the free end of the pipe are studied in addition a vertical cantilevered pipe is considered and the effects of additional masses and springs are studied when the effect of gravity is also included in the analysis furthermore the effects of having multiple additional springs along the length of horizontal and vertical cantilevered pipes are presented to see how gravity affects the value of critical flow velocity the relation between the dimensionless critical flow velocity u c r and the dimensionless parameter β is shown in fig 2 different values of β represent different systems as an example table 8 is prepared to show how each value may represent one or even several industrial systems in oil and gas industry many examples can be found ranging from the drilling systems to the storage and transportation of hydrocarbons drilling rigs usually use carbon steel pipes which convey drilling mud this system can be represented by its β value β 0 275 similarly carbon steel pipes are used as well for crude oil and natural gas transportation fig 3 these systems can be correspondingly characterized by their β the crude oil pipeline with β 0 0001 and the natural gas pipeline with β 0 165 other materials such as stainless steel and composite material are also being used for example kilometer long pipe is currently used in many countries for underground oil and gas storage systems as a replacement of the aboveground storage tanks underground caverns compared to regular storage tanks have a lower cost lower environmental risks as well as greater perceived level of security another example of an engineering application of pipe systems can be found in power generation plants where different types of straight and curved pipes are used to convey steam to turbines any pipe conveying fluid system can be represented by its β value as it can be seen in the examples given in table 8 4 1 effect of additional point masses in order to validate the model proposed in this research three systems are taken into consideration which resembles the one studied by hill and swanson 1970 fig 4 represents the results of the model developed in this study the first system represented by the blue curve is the original cantilevered pipe without any additional masses the second system represented by the orange curve x has one additional mass positioned at the mid pipe i e x 0 5 with a dimensionless magnitude μ 0 2 the third system represented by the yellow curve o has two additional masses the first one is positioned at the middle of the pipe and the second is at the free end i e x 1 0 5 and x 2 1 both masses have equal dimensionless magnitude i e μ 1 μ 2 0 2 the fourth system represented by the violet curve has one additional positioned at the free end of the pipe i e x 1 with a dimensionless magnitude μ 0 2 the effects of adding lumped masses depend on their positions and magnitudes considering the first system with one additional mass x 0 5 μ 0 2 adding a point mass at the middle of the pipe had two effects 1 the system stabilizes for β 0 26 the critical flow velocity increases by a maximum of 4 8 at β 0 1 and 2 it destabilizes for β 0 26 for the system having two additional masses x 1 0 5 x 2 1 μ 1 μ 2 0 2 the critical flow velocity reduces for all values of β comparing two systems having one additional mass at the middle and two additional masses at the middle and at the end it can be concluded that for β 0 26 the addition of a mass at the free end canceled the stabilizing effect caused by the addition of a mass at the middle it is to be noted that the original cantilevered pipe re stabilizes in four ranges of β these ranges can be noticed where for the same value of β corresponds three critical flow velocity values nevertheless the addition of one or two masses cancels all re stabilization effects encountered at the original cantilevered pipe i e for each value of β there is only one value of u c r this becomes clearer by comparing the argand diagrams of a cantilevered pipe with β 0 67 having no additional mass or spring with a cantilevered pipe having one additional mass x 0 5 μ 0 2 as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively in fig 5 the re stabilization onset of the pipe is marked while no re stabilization point can be seen in fig 6 4 2 effect of additional spring at the free end to study the effect of an additional spring at the free end of a cantilevered pipe three systems are considered using two approaches that were previously used in the literature e g in lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 sugiyama et al 1987 1985 as discussed in section 3 the first approach used the spring force in the equation of motion the second approach considered the spring force as part of the boundary conditions the first system illustrated by the blue curve in figs 7 and 6 is the original system with no spring at the free end the second system illustrated by the orange curve o has a spring at the free end with a stiffness equal to 10 i e x 1 and k 10 the third system illustrated by the yellow line x in figs 7 and 8 has a spring at the free end with a dimensionless stiffness of 50 i e x 1 and k 50 fig 8 shows the results obtained by using the equation of motion s approach it is seen that the spring effect depends on the spring stiffness and β considering the system with a low stiffness additional spring k 10 the spring has a stabilizing effect for β 0 3 and a destabilizing effect for a larger value of β for the system having a higher stiffness spring k 50 it is seen that increasing the stiffness increases the stability of the system for β 0 3 moreover it can be seen from fig 7 that increasing the stiffness of the spring decreases the values of critical flow velocities and has a destabilizing effect for β 0 3 as another validation of the results obtained in this study it should be noted that the results shown in fig 7 are in good agreement with those provided in chen 1971 the results given in fig 7 are also validated by comparison with those reported in sugiyama et al 1985 as it can be seen from table 9 the differences between the results are in acceptable ranges between 0 13 and 4 95 fig 8 illustrates the results of the boundary condition s approach it is seen that the spring effect depends on the spring stiffness and β considering the system with a small stiffness additional spring k 10 this spring stabilizes the system for all values of β increasing the stiffness from 10 to 50 has two effects 1 for β 0 57 the stiffer spring destabilizes the system and 2 for higher values of β the system is stabilized on closer examination on the destabilized area for 0 3 β 0 49 the critical flow velocity is even lower than the original system with no additional spring this approach is validated using the results obtained in lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 as shown in table 10 the maximum difference between the results of the current study with the results given in lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 is 6 9 this discrepancy in the results is due to the fact that they introduced some damping to the equation of motion to help their solution method converge unfortunately no physical interpretation and or numerical values for damping was provided by authors and we were not able to reproduce their calculations for a more accurate comparison the equation of motion approach is often used when only a translational spring is added to a cantilevered pipe paidoussis 2013 and it is verified experimentally by sugiyama et al 1985 however the boundary condition approach is used to combine the effect of a translational and a rotational spring without doing any experimental verification lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 therefore the equation of motion approach is used in the remaining part of this study 4 3 effect of gravity to study the effect of gravity three systems are considered and compared to the original system where gravity is neglected i e γ 0 the first system has γ 10 meaning that gravity is in the direction opposite to the flow velocity the pipe is under gravity induced compression in this case i e oriented upward the second and third systems have γ 0 with a value of 10 and 100 respectively meaning that gravity is in the same direction as the flow velocity in this case the pipe is oriented downward and is under gravity induced tension the results of this part of the present study are compared with those given in paidoussis 1970 fig 9 represents the results of the present study comparing the results of the current study fig 9 and paidoussis 1970 it can be seen that they are almost identical it is noticed from fig 9 that the systems having γ 0 have the same trend of γ 0 considering the first system γ 10 it is seen that the system destabilizes this destabilization is expected because that it is an up standing system for γ 0 looking at fig 9 the restoring force due to gravity stabilizes the system 4 4 effect of additional masses combined with gravity the combined effect of additional masses and gravity is studied by reconsidering the same examples examined in the additional masses section in summary five systems are considered and their results are presented in fig 10 the top s shaped curve is illustrating the original horizontal cantilevered pipe without any mass the other horizontal and vertical curves are coupled together and have similar trends the coupled curves have different orientations but the same additional mass es and position s the top two coupled curves have one additional mass positioned in the middle of the pipe i e x 0 5 and μ 0 2 on the other hand the lower two coupled curves have two additional masses one located at the middle whereas the second is positioned at the free end i e x 1 0 5 x 2 1 μ 1 μ 2 0 2 moreover the upper curve in both couples corresponds to a vertically oriented pipe γ 10 whilst the other is horizontal considering the system having one additional mass with a downward orientation as seen in fig 10 the mass stabilizes the system for β 0 25 whilst it destabilizes it for higher values of β it is interesting to note that the hanging orientation stabilizes the system for all the values of β furthermore the addition of a second mass at the free end destabilizes the system considerably the hanging orientation when having two additional masses stabilizes the system as well for all the values of β for β 0 5 the curves of the horizontal and vertical cantilevered pipe with two additional masses are almost identical i e the gravity effect is negligible in this case 4 5 effect of additional intermediate springs the effect of an additional spring at an intermediate position is studied by considering four cases shown in table 11 each case is composed of three systems having one additional spring of stiffness k at position x the results of the first second third and fourth cases are represented by figs 11 14 respectively commencing by the first case x 1 0 25 x 2 0 5 x 3 0 75 k 1 k 2 k 3 20 the effect of adding a spring with low stiffness is generally stabilizing in all positions as shown in fig 11 the stabilization effect is especially stronger when the spring is at three quarter of the pipe length x 0 75 for 0 15 β 0 29 increasing the stiffness led to higher stability when the spring is positioned at mid pipe x 0 5 as indicated in fig 12 furthermore moving the spring to the three quarter of the pipe length had both stabilizing and destabilizing effects for 0 1 β 0 85 the spring stabilizes the system and it destabilizes it for the other values of β on the other hand by considering the third case x 1 x 2 x 3 0 25 k 1 20 k 2 50 k 3 75 it can be concluded that a spring positioned beside the clamped end had a minimal stabilizing effect regardless of its stiffness fig 13 moreover moving the spring towards the end i e x 0 75 the system stabilizes considerably for 0 1 β 0 3 and minimally for higher β it is worth mentioning that when the spring is closer to the free end the system destabilizes marginally for β 0 1 as shown in fig 14 to summarize the effect of varying the position of the additional spring or mass separately 6 systems with different additional mass or spring are considered with β 0 5 as given in table 12 recalling the critical flow velocity 9 33 for the original pipe with no additional mass or spring from fig 2 it is clear from fig 15 that adding a point mass at any position for a cantilevered pipe will destabilize the pipe regardless of the magnitude of the added mass for the systems with additional spring and when the springs are positioned at any position x 0 85 the systems with stiffer spring are more stable however an additional spring destabilizes the cantilever pipe for x 0 85 4 6 effect of additional spring combined with gravity the gravity effect on a cantilevered pipe having a spring at any position is studied using four cases the cases have the same parameters as those considered in the previous section where gravity was neglected see table 11 the pipes in this section for all cases are vertical downward oriented i e γ 10 the results of these cases are presented in figs 16 19 respectively it is worth mentioning that the results of all four vertically oriented pipes are very similar to those of the horizontally oriented pipes for the first case x 1 0 25 x 2 0 5 x 3 0 75 k 1 k 2 k 3 20 adding a low stiffness spring in the vertical orientation had a minimal effect on the system as indicated in fig 16 for 0 15 β 0 25 the spring positioned at the three quarter span had a good stabilizing effect for other values of β and spring positions the stabilization is marginal increasing the spring stiffness leads to the highest stability when the spring is positioned in the middle x 0 5 for β 0 55 as seen in fig 17 furthermore the spring positioned at the three quarter span stabilizes the system the most for 0 1 β 0 25 it is to be noted that adding any spring to a system having β 0 1 had a destabilizing effect in the third case x 1 x 2 x 3 0 25 k 1 20 k 2 50 k 3 75 it can be observed from fig 18 that the spring have a minimal stabilizing effect regardless of its stiffness the stabilization is marginal for different spring stiffnesses and for all the values of β moreover moving the spring towards the end i e x 0 75 the system stabilizes considerably for 0 1 β 0 25 and minimally for higher β in addition when the spring is closer to the free end the system destabilizes marginally for β 0 1 as shown in fig 19 5 conclusion dynamical behavior of horizontal and vertical cantilevered pipes conveying fluid with additional mass and spring elements were investigated in this paper galerkin method was utilized to solve the equation of motion for the problem in hand which was derived based on the linear theory of elasticity and a plug flow model assumption the influences of the addition of mass and spring elements were studied separately including the location of the added elements the stiffness of the added springs and the magnitude of the added masses the results of the present study were also compared with those available in the literature the following conclusions can be summarized from the results of the present study adding a point mass at the middle of the pipe x 0 5 μ 0 2 has stabilizing effects for β 0 26 and destabilizing effect for β 0 26 however the critical flow velocity reduces for all values of β for a system having two additional masses in the middle and at the end x 1 0 5 x 2 1 μ 1 μ 2 0 2 fig 4 the spring effect depends on the spring stiffness and β fig 11 generally speaking adding a spring to a cantilevered pipe in any orientation has both stabilizing and destabilizing effects the stabilizing effect of a spring addition can increase the critical flow velocity by up to 60 fig 12 regardless of its stiffness a spring added at a position near the clamped end does not influence dynamical behavior of the system significantly credit authorship contribution statement j elnajjar writing original draft f daneshmand supervision

21878,a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid is a non conservative system and loses its stability for a sufficiently high flow velocity when a fluid conveying pipe is involved as a structural element in a mechanical system e g in oil and gas industry it is often preferred to maximize the critical flow velocity in the pipe this study focuses on the possibility of increasing the critical flow velocity of horizontal and vertical pipes conveying fluid by considering one or more additional masses and or springs at various locations along the pipe galerkin method is used to solve the equation of motion of the problem derived based on the linear theory of elasticity and a plug flow model assumption the results of the present study are compared with those available in literature the results show a possibility of increasing the critical fluid velocity for horizontal and vertical cantilevered pipes it is observed that the critical flow velocity can be significantly increased by adding a spring and a point mass at specific positions depending on the mass ratio β of the system keywords stability anlysis dynamic analysis pipes conveying fluid vibration fluid structure interaction 1 introduction during the past decades the stability and dynamic analysis of slender structures conveying fluids have been studied by many researchers engineers and designers heshmati et al 2019 some engineering applications include oil and hydraulic pipelines heat exchangers liquid fuel piping systems air conditioning ducts and offshore piping bahaadini et al 2018a 2018b dehrouyeh semnani et al 2019 ibrahim 2010 minas et al 2017 among different types of slender structures special attention has been paid to the stability of pipes conveying fluid with different boundary conditions as an interesting engineering application of pipes conveying fluid a long cantilever pipe in the form of a tubing string is normally used in the underground gas storage systems ge et al 2019 the cantilever pipe is used as the flow channel for water injection and or brine production and the instability of the pipe system is required to prevent tubing failure merey 2019 several analytical and numerical methods and experimental investigations have been developed for a wide range of engineering applications moditis et al 2016 zare et al 2018 2017 the main reasons for special attention to pipes conveying fluid are their i simplicity and ii significant role in understanding the physics of more complicated systems paidoussis 2013 it is well known that a cantilevered pipe conveying fluid is a non conservative system and loses its stability for a sufficiently high flow velocity when a fluid conveying pipe is used as a structural element in a mechanical system e g in oil and gas industry and from a practical point of view it is usually preferred to design the pipe such that the critical flow velocity becomes as high as possible it is worth noting that the critical flow velocity of a cantilever pipe conveying fluid changes under the influence of additional masses and springs in practical applications although the dynamics and stability of pipes conveying fluid have been extensively investigated in the literature less attention has been paid to the influences of additional mass and or spring on the critical flow velocity this study focuses on the possibility of increasing the critical flow velocity of horizontal and vertical pipes conveying fluid by considering additional masses and or springs at various locations on the pipe chen 1971 used a theoretical model and investigated the stability of a cantilever pipe it is found that the spring may have a destabilizing effect on the tube for certain ranges of pipe parameters sugiyama et al 1985 used theoretical and experimental methods and studied the effect of intermediate lateral spring support on the stability of a cantilever tubular pipe conveying fluid they showed that a cantilever pipe with spring support does not necessarily lead to stabilization and indeed is likely to have a destabilizing effect moreover having spring support at the free end of the cantilever pipe may produce a destabilizing effect sugiyama et al 1987 extended their work and considered the combined effects of a spring support and an additional point mass in the same location on the stability of a cantilever pipe further studies on this problem can be found in hill and swanson 1970 jendrzejczyk and chen 1985 the influences of combined rotational and translational elastic supports on the dynamics of pipes conveying steady and pulsatile flows have been investigated by noah and hopkins 1980 based on the results reported by these authors the pipes with a steady flow may lose their stability by either divergence or flutter based on the relative magnitude of the rotational and translational spring constants for the cantilever pipes conveying fluid resting on an elastic winkler foundation it has been shown that the single translational or rotary foundation along the entire length of the pipe can increase the critical flow velocity elishakoff and impollonia 2000 the effects of uniform and non uniform elastic winkler foundation on the stability of cantilever pipes conveying fluid have also been investigated by marzani et al 2012 they used a finite element formulation with a state state transformation and showed that increasing the uniform elastic foundation leads to an increase in the critical flow velocity whereas for a non uniform elastic foundation the system may achieve higher or lower critical flow velocity depending on the pipe fluid mass ratio these results must be viewed with caution because the s type behavior of the instability curves was not predicted accurately kheiri et al 2014 studied dynamics and stability of a pipe flexibly supported at its ends it is shown that for a pinned free pipe additionally constrained at the pinned end by a rotational spring an increase in the rotational spring stiffness makes the pipe less stable however they ended up with this conclusion that the dynamics of a pipe conveying fluid supported only by a translational and a rotational spring at the upstream are very complex and in many cases unpredictable one interesting behavior in stability analysis of cantilever pipes conveying fluid is the negative slope portions of the stability curves as reported by gregory and paidoussis 1966 paidoussis 2013 such portions are referred to as s shaped curves and correspond to the threshold of re stabilization of the system the origin of the existence of this behavior is not fully understood yet however the behavior of the pipe in the vicinity of these s shaped segments of the stability curve is associated with a large number of linear and nonlinear characteristics paidoussis 2013 it is worth noting that this behavior is missing in some of the published works and so the results reported in such references must be viewed with specific caution e g zhang et al 2016 such references have been omitted in this literature review the present study aims to stabilize a fluid conveying cantilevered pipe using conventional added elements both horizontal and vertical cantilever pipes with additional elements i e springs and masses are considered in this study galerkin method is used to solve the equation of motion of the problem derived based on the linear theory of elasticity and a plug flow model assumption the effect of adding each element is initially studied for both aforementioned orientations i e the effect of the position stiffness and magnitude of added spring and mass respectively 2 problem statement consider a uniform pipe of length l with mass per unit length m and flexural rigidity e i as shown in fig 1 the pipe is conveying a fluid of mass per unit length m with a mean axial flow velocity u that is assumed to be uniform across the pipe cross section m a characterizes the concentrated mass and l 1 is the distance between the fixed end and the additional point mass location similarly l 2 represents the distance between the fixed end and the spring while k represents the stiffness of the spring by neglecting internal damping dissipation external tension and internal pressurization the equation of motion for the pipe shown in fig 1a is obtained as paidoussis 2013 1 e i 4 w x 4 m u 2 m m g l x

this equation can be derived by using either newtonian derivation by applying newton s second law and taking into consideration the small deflection approximation or hamilton s principle both methods can be found in the literature including their detailed derivations eq 1 can be split into several terms the significant ones are e i 4 w x 4 flexural restoring force m u 2 2 w x 2 centrifugal force due to fluid velocity in the curved portion of the deformed pipe 2 m u 2 w x t coriolis term where 2 w x t is the local angular velocity of the fluid m m 2 w t 2 inertia of the fluid filled pipe many researchers have studied the effects of several parameters on eq 1 including the effects of fluid viscosity nonuniform flow profile and viscoelastic material for the pipe the influences of different loadings such as pressurization tensioning and gravity have also been studied in the literature paidoussis 2013 paidoussis et al 2008 paidoussis and issid 1974 all these effects have been investigated for various types of boundary conditions for example simply supported clamped clamped and cantilevered systems many researchers have also focused on dynamic stability of pipes and investigated the effects of additional masses and springs chen 1971 lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 sugiyama et al 1987 1985 in this paper a more complete investigation of the effects of additional masses and springs is presented with the goal of understanding its relationship with the critical flow velocity u c r of the system using the parameters 2 x ξ l and w η l the non dimensional form of eq 1 can be

additional mass spring in this section the galerkin method is discussed further and the details for adding springs and point masses to the cantilever pipe are described two approaches based on the literature are discussed for the spring addition and one approach for adding the point mass 3 2 1 pipe with additional spring two different solution approaches can be used to include the effects of additional springs the first possible approach is to include the additional springs in the equation of motion of the problem the second approach is to consider the springs as part of the boundary conditions of the problem these two approaches are called equation of motion approach and boundary condition approach and are briefly described in the following sections 3 2 1 1 approach 1 equation of motion approach this method was used by sugiyama et al 1987 1985 to add a spring to any position on the cantilevered pipe the spring was taken into consideration by adding a new term to the non dimensionalized governing equation eq 3 without changing the boundary conditions the new term representing the additional spring is 12 k δ ξ ξ 1 η where k k l 3 e i and ξ 1 l 1 l l 1 is the distance between the fixed end and the spring and k is the stiffness of the spring substituting eq 4 into 12 multiplying the results by φ s ξ and then integrating it over the domain 0 1 the additional term 12 becomes 13 1 n k φ r ξ 1 φ s ξ 1 q the final form of the added term i e 13 which represents the additional spring can be added to eq 7 to obtain the new governing differential equation for a cantilevered pipe with an added spring 3 2 1 2 approach 2 boundary condition approach this approach was used by lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 to introduce a spring at the free end of a cantilevered pipe the additional spring is integrated into the boundary condition which can be seen below 14 3 η ξ 3 k η 0 where k k l 3 e i inserting eq 4 into eq 14 yields 15 φ k φ using this approach the cantilevered pipe with an additional spring at the free end is modeled as a cantilevered beam with an additional spring at the free end in the galerkin scheme the eigenfunctions of a cantilevered beam with and without a spring at its free end are the same paidoussis 2013 nevertheless the eigenvalues used in the comparison functions should be calculated using the below equation paidoussis 2013 16 k λ j 3 tan λ j tanh λ j 1 cos λ j cosh λ j 1 0 table 7 shows the first 8 eigen values of a cantilever beam with an additional spring at its end 3 2 2 pipe with an additional point mass the procedure used in this section is very similar to the one used in the first approach of adding a spring this method was used by hill and swanson 1970 where the additional mass is considered by adding a new term to the non dimensional equation of motion eq 3 the additional term representing the additional mass is 17 μ δ ξ ξ 1 2 η τ 2 where μ m a m m l ξ 1 l 1 l μ is the magnitude of the added mass m a is the concentrated mass and l 1 is the distance between the fixed end and the additional point mass location substituting eq 4 into 17 multiplying the results by φ s ξ and then integrating it over the domain 0 1 the additional term 17 becomes 18 1 n μ φ r ξ 1 φ s ξ 1 q the final form 18 which represents the additional mass can be added to eq 7 to obtain the new governing differential equation of a cantilevered pipe with an additional point mass 3 3 eigenvalues determination eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors are used to determine the frequencies of a free vibration system the general equation of motion of the system can be written as eq 8 where m e and k are the mass damping and stiffness matrices of the system respectively these matrices are all of the same order as the number of degrees of freedom n it should be noted that the mass and stiffness matrices are symmetric if the generalized coordinates are defined from the undeformed equilibrium configuration with zero potential energy and the problem constraints are all scleronomic i e do not contain the time as an explicit variable the damping matrix is also symmetric if derived from a dissipation function bishop and johnson 1961 to calculate the eigenvalues of the problem eq 8 needs to be reduced to a first order form due to the presence of damping the eigenvalues of the problem are no longer real the equation of motion can then be transferred into the following first order form 19 l z p z 0 where the portioned matrices l p and vector z of dimension 2 n are defined as 20 l 0 m m e p m 0 0 k z q q assuming a solution of the form z j e λ t eq 19 is transformed into the following eigenvalue problem 21 λ i y j 0 where y l 1 p 4 results this section is divided into two main parts showing the results of the galerkin method in the first part of this section a horizontal cantilevered pipe is considered and the effects of i adding various masses in different positions along the length and ii adding an additional spring at the free end of the pipe are studied in addition a vertical cantilevered pipe is considered and the effects of additional masses and springs are studied when the effect of gravity is also included in the analysis furthermore the effects of having multiple additional springs along the length of horizontal and vertical cantilevered pipes are presented to see how gravity affects the value of critical flow velocity the relation between the dimensionless critical flow velocity u c r and the dimensionless parameter β is shown in fig 2 different values of β represent different systems as an example table 8 is prepared to show how each value may represent one or even several industrial systems in oil and gas industry many examples can be found ranging from the drilling systems to the storage and transportation of hydrocarbons drilling rigs usually use carbon steel pipes which convey drilling mud this system can be represented by its β value β 0 275 similarly carbon steel pipes are used as well for crude oil and natural gas transportation fig 3 these systems can be correspondingly characterized by their β the crude oil pipeline with β 0 0001 and the natural gas pipeline with β 0 165 other materials such as stainless steel and composite material are also being used for example kilometer long pipe is currently used in many countries for underground oil and gas storage systems as a replacement of the aboveground storage tanks underground caverns compared to regular storage tanks have a lower cost lower environmental risks as well as greater perceived level of security another example of an engineering application of pipe systems can be found in power generation plants where different types of straight and curved pipes are used to convey steam to turbines any pipe conveying fluid system can be represented by its β value as it can be seen in the examples given in table 8 4 1 effect of additional point masses in order to validate the model proposed in this research three systems are taken into consideration which resembles the one studied by hill and swanson 1970 fig 4 represents the results of the model developed in this study the first system represented by the blue curve is the original cantilevered pipe without any additional masses the second system represented by the orange curve x has one additional mass positioned at the mid pipe i e x 0 5 with a dimensionless magnitude μ 0 2 the third system represented by the yellow curve o has two additional masses the first one is positioned at the middle of the pipe and the second is at the free end i e x 1 0 5 and x 2 1 both masses have equal dimensionless magnitude i e μ 1 μ 2 0 2 the fourth system represented by the violet curve has one additional positioned at the free end of the pipe i e x 1 with a dimensionless magnitude μ 0 2 the effects of adding lumped masses depend on their positions and magnitudes considering the first system with one additional mass x 0 5 μ 0 2 adding a point mass at the middle of the pipe had two effects 1 the system stabilizes for β 0 26 the critical flow velocity increases by a maximum of 4 8 at β 0 1 and 2 it destabilizes for β 0 26 for the system having two additional masses x 1 0 5 x 2 1 μ 1 μ 2 0 2 the critical flow velocity reduces for all values of β comparing two systems having one additional mass at the middle and two additional masses at the middle and at the end it can be concluded that for β 0 26 the addition of a mass at the free end canceled the stabilizing effect caused by the addition of a mass at the middle it is to be noted that the original cantilevered pipe re stabilizes in four ranges of β these ranges can be noticed where for the same value of β corresponds three critical flow velocity values nevertheless the addition of one or two masses cancels all re stabilization effects encountered at the original cantilevered pipe i e for each value of β there is only one value of u c r this becomes clearer by comparing the argand diagrams of a cantilevered pipe with β 0 67 having no additional mass or spring with a cantilevered pipe having one additional mass x 0 5 μ 0 2 as shown in figs 5 and 6 respectively in fig 5 the re stabilization onset of the pipe is marked while no re stabilization point can be seen in fig 6 4 2 effect of additional spring at the free end to study the effect of an additional spring at the free end of a cantilevered pipe three systems are considered using two approaches that were previously used in the literature e g in lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 sugiyama et al 1987 1985 as discussed in section 3 the first approach used the spring force in the equation of motion the second approach considered the spring force as part of the boundary conditions the first system illustrated by the blue curve in figs 7 and 6 is the original system with no spring at the free end the second system illustrated by the orange curve o has a spring at the free end with a stiffness equal to 10 i e x 1 and k 10 the third system illustrated by the yellow line x in figs 7 and 8 has a spring at the free end with a dimensionless stiffness of 50 i e x 1 and k 50 fig 8 shows the results obtained by using the equation of motion s approach it is seen that the spring effect depends on the spring stiffness and β considering the system with a low stiffness additional spring k 10 the spring has a stabilizing effect for β 0 3 and a destabilizing effect for a larger value of β for the system having a higher stiffness spring k 50 it is seen that increasing the stiffness increases the stability of the system for β 0 3 moreover it can be seen from fig 7 that increasing the stiffness of the spring decreases the values of critical flow velocities and has a destabilizing effect for β 0 3 as another validation of the results obtained in this study it should be noted that the results shown in fig 7 are in good agreement with those provided in chen 1971 the results given in fig 7 are also validated by comparison with those reported in sugiyama et al 1985 as it can be seen from table 9 the differences between the results are in acceptable ranges between 0 13 and 4 95 fig 8 illustrates the results of the boundary condition s approach it is seen that the spring effect depends on the spring stiffness and β considering the system with a small stiffness additional spring k 10 this spring stabilizes the system for all values of β increasing the stiffness from 10 to 50 has two effects 1 for β 0 57 the stiffer spring destabilizes the system and 2 for higher values of β the system is stabilized on closer examination on the destabilized area for 0 3 β 0 49 the critical flow velocity is even lower than the original system with no additional spring this approach is validated using the results obtained in lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 as shown in table 10 the maximum difference between the results of the current study with the results given in lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 is 6 9 this discrepancy in the results is due to the fact that they introduced some damping to the equation of motion to help their solution method converge unfortunately no physical interpretation and or numerical values for damping was provided by authors and we were not able to reproduce their calculations for a more accurate comparison the equation of motion approach is often used when only a translational spring is added to a cantilevered pipe paidoussis 2013 and it is verified experimentally by sugiyama et al 1985 however the boundary condition approach is used to combine the effect of a translational and a rotational spring without doing any experimental verification lin and chen 1976 noah and hopkins 1980 therefore the equation of motion approach is used in the remaining part of this study 4 3 effect of gravity to study the effect of gravity three systems are considered and compared to the original system where gravity is neglected i e γ 0 the first system has γ 10 meaning that gravity is in the direction opposite to the flow velocity the pipe is under gravity induced compression in this case i e oriented upward the second and third systems have γ 0 with a value of 10 and 100 respectively meaning that gravity is in the same direction as the flow velocity in this case the pipe is oriented downward and is under gravity induced tension the results of this part of the present study are compared with those given in paidoussis 1970 fig 9 represents the results of the present study comparing the results of the current study fig 9 and paidoussis 1970 it can be seen that they are almost identical it is noticed from fig 9 that the systems having γ 0 have the same trend of γ 0 considering the first system γ 10 it is seen that the system destabilizes this destabilization is expected because that it is an up standing system for γ 0 looking at fig 9 the restoring force due to gravity stabilizes the system 4 4 effect of additional masses combined with gravity the combined effect of additional masses and gravity is studied by reconsidering the same examples examined in the additional masses section in summary five systems are considered and their results are presented in fig 10 the top s shaped curve is illustrating the original horizontal cantilevered pipe without any mass the other horizontal and vertical curves are coupled together and have similar trends the coupled curves have different orientations but the same additional mass es and position s the top two coupled curves have one additional mass positioned in the middle of the pipe i e x 0 5 and μ 0 2 on the other hand the lower two coupled curves have two additional masses one located at the middle whereas the second is positioned at the free end i e x 1 0 5 x 2 1 μ 1 μ 2 0 2 moreover the upper curve in both couples corresponds to a vertically oriented pipe γ 10 whilst the other is horizontal considering the system having one additional mass with a downward orientation as seen in fig 10 the mass stabilizes the system for β 0 25 whilst it destabilizes it for higher values of β it is interesting to note that the hanging orientation stabilizes the system for all the values of β furthermore the addition of a second mass at the free end destabilizes the system considerably the hanging orientation when having two additional masses stabilizes the system as well for all the values of β for β 0 5 the curves of the horizontal and vertical cantilevered pipe with two additional masses are almost identical i e the gravity effect is negligible in this case 4 5 effect of additional intermediate springs the effect of an additional spring at an intermediate position is studied by considering four cases shown in table 11 each case is composed of three systems having one additional spring of stiffness k at position x the results of the first second third and fourth cases are represented by figs 11 14 respectively commencing by the first case x 1 0 25 x 2 0 5 x 3 0 75 k 1 k 2 k 3 20 the effect of adding a spring with low stiffness is generally stabilizing in all positions as shown in fig 11 the stabilization effect is especially stronger when the spring is at three quarter of the pipe length x 0 75 for 0 15 β 0 29 increasing the stiffness led to higher stability when the spring is positioned at mid pipe x 0 5 as indicated in fig 12 furthermore moving the spring to the three quarter of the pipe length had both stabilizing and destabilizing effects for 0 1 β 0 85 the spring stabilizes the system and it destabilizes it for the other values of β on the other hand by considering the third case x 1 x 2 x 3 0 25 k 1 20 k 2 50 k 3 75 it can be concluded that a spring positioned beside the clamped end had a minimal stabilizing effect regardless of its stiffness fig 13 moreover moving the spring towards the end i e x 0 75 the system stabilizes considerably for 0 1 β 0 3 and minimally for higher β it is worth mentioning that when the spring is closer to the free end the system destabilizes marginally for β 0 1 as shown in fig 14 to summarize the effect of varying the position of the additional spring or mass separately 6 systems with different additional mass or spring are considered with β 0 5 as given in table 12 recalling the critical flow velocity 9 33 for the original pipe with no additional mass or spring from fig 2 it is clear from fig 15 that adding a point mass at any position for a cantilevered pipe will destabilize the pipe regardless of the magnitude of the added mass for the systems with additional spring and when the springs are positioned at any position x 0 85 the systems with stiffer spring are more stable however an additional spring destabilizes the cantilever pipe for x 0 85 4 6 effect of additional spring combined with gravity the gravity effect on a cantilevered pipe having a spring at any position is studied using four cases the cases have the same parameters as those considered in the previous section where gravity was neglected see table 11 the pipes in this section for all cases are vertical downward oriented i e γ 10 the results of these cases are presented in figs 16 19 respectively it is worth mentioning that the results of all four vertically oriented pipes are very similar to those of the horizontally oriented pipes for the first case x 1 0 25 x 2 0 5 x 3 0 75 k 1 k 2 k 3 20 adding a low stiffness spring in the vertical orientation had a minimal effect on the system as indicated in fig 16 for 0 15 β 0 25 the spring positioned at the three quarter span had a good stabilizing effect for other values of β and spring positions the stabilization is marginal increasing the spring stiffness leads to the highest stability when the spring is positioned in the middle x 0 5 for β 0 55 as seen in fig 17 furthermore the spring positioned at the three quarter span stabilizes the system the most for 0 1 β 0 25 it is to be noted that adding any spring to a system having β 0 1 had a destabilizing effect in the third case x 1 x 2 x 3 0 25 k 1 20 k 2 50 k 3 75 it can be observed from fig 18 that the spring have a minimal stabilizing effect regardless of its stiffness the stabilization is marginal for different spring stiffnesses and for all the values of β moreover moving the spring towards the end i e x 0 75 the system stabilizes considerably for 0 1 β 0 25 and minimally for higher β in addition when the spring is closer to the free end the system destabilizes marginally for β 0 1 as shown in fig 19 5 conclusion dynamical behavior of horizontal and vertical cantilevered pipes conveying fluid with additional mass and spring elements were investigated in this paper galerkin method was utilized to solve the equation of motion for the problem in hand which was derived based on the linear theory of elasticity and a plug flow model assumption the influences of the addition of mass and spring elements were studied separately including the location of the added elements the stiffness of the added springs and the magnitude of the added masses the results of the present study were also compared with those available in the literature the following conclusions can be summarized from the results of the present study adding a point mass at the middle of the pipe x 0 5 μ 0 2 has stabilizing effects for β 0 26 and destabilizing effect for β 0 26 however the critical flow velocity reduces for all values of β for a system having two additional masses in the middle and at the end x 1 0 5 x 2 1 μ 1 μ 2 0 2 fig 4 the spring effect depends on the spring stiffness and β fig 11 generally speaking adding a spring to a cantilevered pipe in any orientation has both stabilizing and destabilizing effects the stabilizing effect of a spring addition can increase the critical flow velocity by up to 60 fig 12 regardless of its stiffness a spring added at a position near the clamped end does not influence dynamical behavior of the system significantly credit authorship contribution statement j elnajjar writing original draft f daneshmand supervision

21879,in this study the impact of gravity wave on a circular elastic floating permeable membrane is investigated using linear water wave theory in both homogeneous and two layer fluids the matched eigenfunction expansion technique is employed to obtain an analytic solution of the boundary value problem further the plane wave integral representation of bessel and hankel functions are applied to study the influence of porous structure in damping the far field wave energy in order to examine the effect of various physical parameters heave force exerted on the membrane deflection of the membrane reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes flow distribution around the structure and far field energy dissipation are computed and analyzed for three different edge conditions such as i free edge ii moored edge and iii clamped edge the study reveals that the surface wave amplitude on the lee side of the structure decreases significantly in the presence of floating porous elastic membrane moreover the membrane having clamped edge dissipates more wave energy as compared to that for moored and free edge conditions keywords floating flexible membrane circular porous structures eigenfunction expansion method membrane deflection flow distribution energy dissipation 1 introduction in the last two decades an increasing number of porous structures have been proposed as breakwaters and constructed in offshore areas to protect the coastline from wave action or to extract wave energy from oceans the main benefit of these porous structures is that it significantly decrease the disturbances in marine environment apart from vertical porous structure there is a significant interest in submerged horizontal porous structure as these structures are less dependent on water depth and sea bed condition many theoretical and experimental studies have been developed regarding the diffraction of water waves by submerged horizontal structures the role of porosity on scattered wave height and excitation force on a submerged porous disk was studied by chwang and wu 1994 the effect of a submerged and essentially horizontal plate for offshore wave control was reviewed by yu 2002 by employing eigenfunction expansion method hu and wang 2005 analyzed the model consists of vertical permeable wall and a submerged horizontal plate they observed that a large amount of wave energy can be reduced by the system liu et al 2007 modeled a breakwater which consists a submerged horizontal porous plate placed between the permeable front and rigid back wall further they found that the porosity damps wave force on both horizontal plate and rigid back wall liu et al 2008 developed another model by considering the submerged horizontal plates between the upper porous and lower rigid plate in general for solving the physical problem of wave forcing on the submerged permeable structures the solution of complex dispersion relation is required however the new method developed by liu and li 2011 help to avoid complex dispersion relation in the case of wave action on horizontal submerged permeable plate later using the method of liu and li 2011 and liu et al 2011 studied the wave action on a submerged horizontal porous disk using the explicit relation for reflection coefficient evans and peter 2011 modeled the singularity at edge of submerged porous plate that occurs in velocity continuity using the matched eigenfunction expansion cho and kim 2013 investigated the oblique wave action on a horizontal porous structure and the theoretical results are compared against their experimental results on the other hand for effective usage of ocean space and protection against ocean waves of high amplitude the floating rigid flexible circular structures are preferred garrett 1971 investigated the scattering of surface gravity waves by a circular dock to determine the torque surge and heave forces acting on the dock norris and vemula 1995 derived the flux conservation relation for arbitrary motion for wave interaction with thin plates using linear hydro elastic theory cho and kim 1998 studied the diffraction of surface gravity waves by a horizontal flexible membrane using the method of zilman and miloh 2000 peter et al 2004 extended the same physical problem to the finite water depth and obtained the closed form solution karmakar and soares 2012 investigated the effect of bottom topography on the moored floating membrane using shallow water approximation by using eigenfunction expansion method meylan and peter 2009 obtained an analytical solution to wave scattering by the submerged elastic plate of negligible thickness mondal et al 2014 made a detailed study on the wave forcing on circular flexible structures in the both single and double layered fluid recently das et al 2018 investigated the effect of external loading on the flexural wave motion in the two layer fluid further by addition of structural porosity a significant wave energy can be dissipated by the floating submerged flexible structures it can be employed as an efficient breakwater which is cost effective and light weight in order to reduce the harbour resonance chwang and chan 1998 analyzed the usage of porous structure as wavemaker and breakwater cho and kim 2000 validated the analytical solution with the experimental results for wave forcing on a submerged porous flexible membrane trapping and scattering by the vertical flexible porous plate is analyzed by yip et al 2002 using the matched eigenfunction expansion method molin 2011 used quadratic pressure difference between the reflected and transmitted regions in darcy s law while analyzing the hydrodynamic performance of a permeable slotted barrier both scattering and trapping by submerged porous elastic plate is studied by behera and sahoo 2015 using matched eigenfunction expansion method it is interpreted that the porous submerged plate membrane dissipates most of the surface mode waves and transmit less wave in the lee side these porous structure can also used for various marine application such as fish cages mandal and sahoo 2016 developed the fish cage model with bottom porous submerged membrane and studied its hydrodynamic response by utilizing matched eigenfunction and least squares method further behera and ng 2017 studied the effect of floating and submerged porous elastic plates on a transmission of surface waves they found that the presence of submerged porous elastic plate damps the surface wave modes and reduces the deflection of floating plate recently the role of multiple bottom standing flexible barriers on wave trapping near a rigid wall was examined by behera and ng 2018 in the presence of a undulated bottom they found that number of barrier and porosity of the barriers play vital role to reduce wave force on the rigid wall on the other hand there are several studies on flexural gravity wave problems in the stratified fluid as in cadby and linton 2000 sherief et al 2004 manam and sahoo 2005 and the literature cited therein a two dimensional radiation problem for a floating body in a finite depth of two layer fluid is investigated by ten and kashiwagi 2004 using boundary integral equation chamberlain and porter 2005 exploited a variational technique in examining the three dimensional water wave scattering in a stratified fluid bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 developed the expansion formula for flexural gravity wave problem in two layer fluid the wave propagation in ice covered two layer fluid having bottom undulation is analyzed by mohapatra and bora 2009 using perturbation analysis and found that there is energy transfer between the surface and interface modes due to incident waves for certain parametric values mondal and sahoo 2012 applied the expansion formula of bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 to study the scattering due to frozen cracks in floating ice sheet in presence of compressive force having finite water depth lin and lu 2013 investigated the oblique wave scattering by thin floating semi infinite plate in a two layer fluid having finite water depth an analytic solution is developed by behera et al 2018 to investigate the oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate over a porous seabed in two layer fluid it is found that wave transmission through the floating plate is significantly reduced due to presence of porous bed although the two dimensional setting has been explored in koley and sahoo 2017 behera and ng 2017 and koley et al 2018 for understanding the wave response of floating elastic permeable plate membrane in a homogeneous fluid however a three dimensional approach is needed for applications in ocean waves to use floating circular flexible porous plate membrane as an effective breakwater for protecting the coastal areas from incoming wave action in both homogeneous and stratified fluids meylan et al 2017 used eigenfunction expansion method along with free edge condition for the wave scattering by a circular floating flexible porous plate in single layer fluid furthermore they used coupled boundary element and finite difference methods for the plate having an arbitrary shape in their study the imaginary part of the porous effect parameter was not considered i e they neglected the inertial effect however in the present study by exploiting the matched eigenfunction expansion method as in meylan et al 2017 the influence of complex porous effect parameter along with three different edge conditions free moored and clamped edge are examined for surface gravity wave scattering by a floating circular elastic porous membrane in both homogeneous and stratified fluids the contour plots are used to analyze the behavior of the roots of complex dispersion relation moreover to study the influence of porous structure in damping the far field wave energy in both single and two layer fluids the plane wave integral representation of bessel and hankel functions are used by following the similar procedure of montiel et al 2015 and meylan et al 2017 the heave force exerted on the membrane membrane s deflection reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes far field energy dissipation and flow distribution are analyzed for the single layer fluid the mathematical formulation along with the solution procedure are elaborated in section 2 further the effects of three edge conditions are presented in three different subsections on the other hand for two layer fluids the required extra boundary conditions solutions and results are discussed in section 3 finally in section 4 the important observations are discussed 2 floating circular flexible permeable membrane in a homogeneous fluid in this section the effect of surface gravity wave on the floating circular flexible permeable membrane in a homogeneous fluid is investigated in cylindrical polar coordinates using linear water wave theory 2 1 mathematical formulation a cylindrical polar coordinate system is considered to represent the physical problem where r θ being the horizontal plane and positive z axis in the vertically downwards direction a floating permeable membrane of radius a and thickness d placed on the still surface z 0 is considered with center as origin fig 1 the fluid domain into membrane covered r a 0 z h and open water r a 0 z h regions the incompressible and inviscid fluid having irrotational flow is assumed thus the velocity potentials φ i r θ z t satisfy the following governing equation 1 2 r 2 1 r r 1 r 2 2 θ 2 2 z 2 φ i 0 for i 1 2

scattered wave satisfy the sommerfeld radiation condition given by 12 lim r r φ φ 0 r i k 0 φ φ 0 0 where φ 0 is the velocity potential of an incident wave and is of the form mandal et al 2013 13 φ 0 a 0 cosh k 0 h z cosh k 0 h e i ω t m 0 ϵ m j m k 0 r cos m θ where a 0 i g i 0 2 ω with amplitude of the incident wave is denoted as i 0 further the bessel function of first kind having order m is given as j m for m 0 1 2 3 and ϵ m 1 for m 0 ϵ m 2 i m for m 1 2 3 along the circumference of the membrane velocity and pressure continuity are given by 14 φ 1 r φ 2 r and φ 1 φ 2 at r a with 0 θ 2 π 0 z h the problem is studied under three different edge conditions selvan et al 2019 are as follow free edge here the vertical force becomes zero at r a and z 0 which result in the following condition 15 r φ 2 z i k 0 g φ 2 0 moored edge in this case the edge of membrane is connected to the rigid loop which moves on the frictionless rigid bar in order to maintain the tension t on the entire surface of the circular porous flexible membrane the mooring condition at z 0 and r a is given by 16 t r w φ 2 z i k 0 g φ 2 0 where w 2 μ s i n 2 β karmakar and soares 2012 with μ and β being mooring spring constant and mooring angle respectively clamped edge in this case the deflection of the membrane is zero at r a and z 0 which is given as 17 φ 2 z i k 0 g φ 2 0 the fluid is assumed to be simple harmonic motion with respect to the angular velocity ω so the velocity potentials φ i r θ z t i 1 2 can be rewritten in the form φ i r θ z t re ϕ i r θ z e i ω t in which the spatial velocity potentials are denoted as ϕ i r θ z i 1 2 and re denotes the real part of a complex number consequently the time independent velocity potentials ϕ i r θ z i 1 2 satisfy the governing equation 1 and the boundary conditions 2 10 12 and 13 furthermore the boundary condition 7 yield 18 ϕ 1 z k ϕ 1 0 on z 0 where k ω 2 g the linearized boundary condition 11 in the membrane covered region at z 0 yields 19 q 3 z 3 z l z k i k 0 g q 2 z 2 l 1 ϕ 2 0 where q t ρ g l m m ω 2 ρ g and m m ρ m d 2 2 method of solution the governing equation 1 is solved using the boundary conditions 2 12 and 13 yield the following velocity potentials ϕ i r θ z i 1 2 20 ϕ 1 r θ z m 0 a 0 ϵ m j m k 0 r f 10 z n 0 a m n h m 1 k n r f 1 n z cos m θ 21 ϕ 2 r θ z m 0 n 0 i 1 b m n j m p n r f 2 n z cos m θ where a m n for m n n 0 and b m n for m n n n 0 i are the constant coefficients further h m 1 is the hankel function of first kind of order m in addition the open water f 1 n z and membrane covered f 2 n z eigenfunctions are obtained as 22 f 1 n z cosh k n h z cosh k n h for n 0 1 2 3 23 f 2 n z cosh p n h y cosh p n h for n 0 i 1 2 3 where k 0 denotes the positive real roots known as the progressive wave mode and k n n 1 2 are the imaginary roots known as the evanescent wave modes thus the eigenvalues k n n 0 1 for open water region obeys following dispersion relation 24 k k n tanh k n h with k ω 2 g similarly for the porous membrane covered region p n satisfies the dispersion equation 25 k q p n 2 l 1 p n tanh p n h i k 0 g q p n 2 l 1 0 it is worth to note that for g 0 the dispersion relation 25 becomes the dispersion relation for the impermeable floating elastic membrane which has one positive real root p 0 one extra imaginary roots p i due to local effect and infinitely many positive imaginary roots p 1 p 2 see mondal et al 2014 and theorem 4 of rhodes robinson 1971 the roots of impermeable membrane g 0 covered dispersion relation is shown in the contour plot as in fig 2 a in the case of porous elastic membrane for g 0 all the roots are complex in nature fig 2 b further the roots of porous elastic membrane are in close proximity to the roots of flexural gravity wave as in fig 2 a nb it may be noted that in fig 2 b it seems that all the roots are purely real or imaginary however all roots are complex in nature as shown in table 1 further the roots in fourth quadrant are used in the present study and to handle the physical problem the orthogonality of vertical eigenfunction with respect to the open water region is considered the eigenfunction ψ m n θ z f 1 n z cos m θ satisfies the orthogonality condition 26 ψ m n θ z ψ l q θ z 0 2 π 0 h ψ m n θ z ψ l q θ z d z d θ π c k q for n q and m l 0 for n q and m l where m n l q n 0 and c k q is given by c k q

q z d z π k q tanh h k q p n tanh h p n k q 2 p n 2 furthermore using the free edge conditions as in eq 15 the equation is given by 29 n 0 i 1 b m n j m p n r p n tanh p n h i k 0 g 0 in case of moored edge by using eq 16 the equation obtained as 30 n 0 i 1 b m n t j m p n r w j m p n r p n tanh p n h i k 0 g 0 on the other hand for the clamped edge condition in eq 17 the equation yield as 31 n 0 i 1 b m n j m p n r p n tanh p n h i k 0 g 0 further the detailed procedure for solving the above system of equation is elaborated in the next subsection 2 3 steps to solve the system of equation for finding unknown coefficients a matlab 2014a routine is employed to solve the system of equation in order to obtain the unknown coefficients the detailed procedures are given below input all the necessary wave and structural parameters solve the open water and membrane covered dispersion relations eqs 24 and 25 using the newton raphsons method in which the initial guesses are chosen from the contour plots of the corresponding dispersion relations truncate the infinite series of bessel mode m and eigen mode n of the system of eqs 27 28 and 29 or 30 or 31 to a finite values say m 1 and n 1 solve the truncated system of equations to find all the unknown coefficients in the velocity potentials as in eqs 20 and 21 then determine the amplitudes of reflection and transmission far field energy dissipation flow distribution around the membrane and deflection of the membrane for different physical variables in the next subsection the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated using the constant coefficients in the integral expansion of incident and scattered velocity potentials 2 4 far field energy dissipation the problem is analyzed at far field r a by decomposing the velocity potential ϕ 1 r θ z into incident and scattered potentials ϕ 0 and ϕ s respectively and are given as 32 ϕ 0 r θ z m 0 a ϵ m j m k 0 r f 10 z e i m θ for r a 33 ϕ s r θ z m 0 a m 0 h m 1 k 0 r f 10 z e i m θ for r a further the plane integral form of first kind bessel and hankel functions are given as montiel et al 2015 and meylan et al 2017 34 j m k 0 r e i m θ 1 2 π π 2 3

floating circular flexible porous membrane is calculated along the entire interval of 2 π 2 5 results and discussion in this section in the case of homogeneous fluid heave force on the membrane deflection of the membrane amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves energy dissipation by the porous membrane and flow distribution around the membrane are investigated in different subsections in addition the significance of three different edge conditions are studied separately for various physical parameters in the present work water depth h 50 m incident wave amplitude i 0 1 radius a h 2 non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h 1 5 density of the membrane ρ m 10 kg m3 density of water ρ 1025 kg m3 tensile force t ρ g h 2 0 1 thickness d h 0 01 and g 0 2 0 3 i are fixed unless mentioned accordingly the heave force k v acting on the porous membrane is given by as in garrett 1971 40 k v i ω ρ 0 2 π 0 a ϕ 2 r θ 0 r d r d θ the non dimensional form of the heave force is given as 41 f v k v ρ g h 3 further in the present study the absolute value of surface elevation flow distribution is calculated using 42 η 01 i ω ϕ 1 z and η 02 i ω ϕ 2 z i k 0 ϕ 2 at z 0 it may be noted that the flow distribution describe the absolute value of the surface elevation and plate deflection in abstract view it is nothing but the distribution of wave amplitude around the structure similar study can be found in mondal et al 2014 and mandal et al 2013 for the correctness of the present numerical scheme energy balance of the above system of equation is checked for the progressive wave mode in the absence of porosity it says that if the bessel function of first kind j m is replaced by hankel function of second kind h m 2 in the incident part of the total potential ϕ 1 then the coefficients in the scattered part of potential must have modulus one the same is validated and shown in table 2 for different values of k 0 h against the various bessel mode m the convergence of numerical results are studied in table 3 by evaluating the heave force f v on the floating elastic permeable membrane for different truncated eigenvalues n 1 and wavenumber k 0 h from table 3 it is found that the series solution converges for n 1 7 up to three decimal places moreover the bessel modes m converges for m 1 8 and the same was reported in peter et al 2004 and mondal et al 2014 therefore the bessel modes and eigenvalues are fixed as m 1 8 and n 1 7 respectively for the computational purpose in the present study 2 5 1 floating circular flexible permeable membrane having free edge the heave force acting on the membrane is plotted as a function k 0 h to study the role of different g and t ρ g h 2 in fig 3 a and b respectively it is observed that around the moderate values of k 0 h the heave force increases due to the gradual growth of evanescent modes which result in high transmission then it attains maximum value and decreases gradually for higher values of k 0 h due to partial reflection and predominant progressive mode similar observations were found by garrett 1971 for wave diffraction by circular dock in fig 3 a the heave force decreases as a consequence of wave energy dissipation for larger values of g thus it results in less heave force on bottom of the membrane similar observations were found in case of wave scattering by floating permeable membrane and plate by koley and sahoo 2017 and koley et al 2018 respectively similarly in fig 3 b the heave force increases with increase in the values of t ρ g h 2 till k 0 h 0 8 and follows the opposite patterns for k 0 h 0 8 in addition it is also found that the maxima of heave force shift towards left for larger t ρ g h 2 due to restoring force developed inside the membrane fig 4 shows the effect of g on the deflection of elastic membrane the results are verified with mondal et al 2014 for wave forcing on the floating circular elastic impermeable membrane it is observed that the majority of incident wave energy is dissipated by the pores resulting in less deformation of elastic membrane further the membrane becomes transparent to the incident surface waves as the value of g increases similarly fig 5 depicts the deflection of porous elastic membrane for various t ρ g h 2 in the case of larger tensile force t ρ g h 2 the membrane s stiffness increases resulting in the less heave force as in fig 3 b as a consequence of this the deformation of porous elastic membrane decreases fig 6 shows the effect of g on the flow distributions around the floating elastic membrane for smaller value of t ρ g h 2 0 1 it is seen that the magnitude of surface wave amplitude reduces with increase in the absolute values of g further the tensile force provides the necessary restoring force which reduces the surface wave amplitude in the transmitted region on the other hand for larger value of t ρ g h 2 0 5 as in fig 7 the deflection of elastic membrane decreases as in fig 5 and strong restoring force suppress the amplitude of wave transmitting through the porous membrane by reflecting the incoming wave the reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes are plotted for varying incident wave amplitude in fig 8 a and b respectively fig 8 a reveals that the reflected amplitude attains a peak for impermeable membrane g 0 which is absent for permeable membrane g 0 moreover the reflected wave amplitude peaks in the direction of incident wave for g 0 with increase in the absolute values of g wave reflection increases and becomes smooth this is due to the impedance mismatch between the two regions 1 and 2 which increases for increase in g thus the reflected wave amplitude from the circular porous elastic membrane increases for larger g similarly the transmitted wave amplitude for varying incident amplitudes contains no side band for permeable membrane as observed in fig 8 b as g increases the transmitted wave amplitude decreases initially due to addition of porosity to the structure further the circular porous membrane becomes transparent to the incoming wave for larger g thus the transmitted wave amplitude increases in the direction of incident wave fig 9 exhibits the wave energy dissipation by porous elastic membrane as a function of real porous effect parameter g for free edge condition it is deduced that the energy dissipation increases initially for increase in the value of g and attains a maximum then decreases slowly for larger values of g 2 5 2 floating circular flexible permeable membrane having moored edge the heave force acting on the membrane is plotted as a function k 0 h to study the role of different g and t ρ g h 2 in fig 10 a and b respectively in this case the patterns of heave force and the observations for variation of g and t ρ g h 2 are similar to that observed in the case free edge condition as in fig 3 moreover due to the moored edge the stiffness of membrane increases which results in the less heave force acting on the floating membrane as compared to that of free edge further the effect of μ and β on the heave force acting on the membrane are illustrated in fig 11 a and b respectively in both fig 11 a and b the heave force follows the same pattern as observed in fig 10 in fig 11 a with increase in the values of μ the maxima of heave force shift towards left due to strong restoring force developed in the mooring lines for increase in the value of mooring angle β as in fig 11 b the magnitude of heave force decreases which is due to larger stiffness of the membrane fig 12 shows the effect of g on the deflection of elastic membrane the deflection of circular elastic membrane decreases for increase in the value of g the same observation was found for free edge condition fig 4 but in the case of moored edge the membrane stiffness reduces the heave force exerted on the membrane fig 10 thus the deflection of moored porous elastic membrane is less as compared that of membrane having the free edge in fig 13 the impact of mooring angle on the membrane deformation is illustrated for larger values of β the heave force exerted on the membrane decreases as in fig 11 b thus the membrane deformation due to transmitted wave decreases for larger values of mooring angle β in fig 14 the effect of g on the flow distributions around the membrane is illustrated due to the presence of moored line the deflection of an impermeable membrane is high along the edges the surface elevation decreases in the lees side of the structure this is due to the partial reflection and transmission by an impermeable membrane but on comparing with fig 14 b there is a significant reduction in the amplitude of free surface elevation due to the wave energy dissipation by pores present on the membrane in fact from fig 14 b it is evident that the membrane deformation decreases as observed in fig 12 thus wave transmission through the membrane is damped and the free surface amplitude on the lee side of porous elastic membrane reduces significantly fig 15 a and b illustrate the amplitude of reflected and transmitted waves respectively as a function of incident amplitude for different values of g the patterns of reflected and transmitted amplitudes resemble similar to the free edge fig 8 but the magnitude of transmitted wave amplitudes for moored porous membrane is less on comparing with free edge due to the strong restoring force produced by the mooring lines which results in more wave energy dissipation furthermore fig 16 shows the wave energy dissipation by porous elastic membrane as a function of real g the pattern is similar to that in the case of free edge condition as in fig 9 for moored edge the motion of floating elastic membrane constrained due to the action of restoring force by mooring line thus more wave energy is dissipated for moored edge condition as compared to that for free edge 2 5 3 floating circular flexible permeable membrane having clamped edge here the wave forcing on a floating porous elastic membrane having clamped edge is investigated and the effects of various physical parameters are studied in this section in fig 17 a and b the effect of g and t ρ g h 2 on the heave force f v which is plotted against k 0 h are illustrated respectively the patterns observed are similar to that in the case of free and moored edge as in figs 3 and 10 respectively but in the case of clamped edge energy dissipation rate is very high due to fixed position of porous membrane thus the magnitude of heave force is less as compared to that of the free and moored edge conditions fig 18 exhibits the effect of g on the deflection of membrane since the edges are clamped there is no deflection along the edges of the membrane due to the high dissipation rate the heave force due to transmitted wave is reduced significantly as in fig 15 a thus the deflection of elastic membrane decreases for increase in the value of g and its magnitude becomes very less as compared to that of free and clamped edge the effect of g on the flow distributions around the membrane is analyzed by fig 19 since the membrane deformation decreases for the larger values of g the transmitted wave is suppressed by the porous elastic membrane g 0 to a great extent as compared to that of elastic membrane g 0 thus the surface amplitude significantly decreases in the lee side of clamped porous membrane as compared to that of free and moored edge fig 20 a and b depicts the amplitude of reflected and transmitted waves as a function of incident amplitude for different values of g respectively the magnitude of reflected and transmitted amplitude in the case of clamped edge is very less as compared to that of moored edge further the energy dissipation is more for clamped edge due to its fixed position as a result of this the reflected wave amplitude increases with larger values of g as in fig 20 a and transmitted wave amplitude decreases as in fig 20 b for varying incident amplitude in fig 21 wave energy dissipation by porous elastic membrane as a function of real g is plotted in this case the floating membrane is fixed at specific position and majority of membrane s portion is exposed to wave action thus in the case of clamped edge there is very rapid increase in the wave energy dissipation as compared to that of free and moored edge conditions 3 floating circular flexible permeable membrane in a stratified fluid in this section the effect of surface gravity wave on a floating circular porous elastic membrane is studied in a two layer fluid the entire domain contains two immiscible fluids of densities ρ 1 and ρ 2 confined in the regions 0 z h upper layer and h z h lower layer respectively as in fig 22 the interface between upper and lower layers for both the regions is denoted as z h both the fluids are inviscid and incompressible as dealt in the case of homogeneous fluid in both the regions the surface and interfacial elevations are given as

eq 52 it leads to the open water dispersion relation for the two layer fluid in this case eq 52 has two positive real roots k i and k i i in sm and im and infinite number of positive imaginary roots k 1 k 2 as in mondal et al 2014 on the other hand for g 0 eq 52 has two positive real roots p i and p i i for sm and im one extra imaginary roots p i i i due to the local effect and infinite number of positive imaginary roots p 1 p 2 however for g 0 all the roots of the dispersion relation 52 are complex in nature in the present study k i and p i are the roots in sm while k ii and p ii are the

stratified fluid the physical parameters such as water depth h non dimensional radius of the membrane a h non dimensional tensile force t density of water ρ 2 non dimensional wavenumber k i h and dimensionless thickness d h are same to that used in the case of homogeneous fluid section 2 5 and the density ratio s 0 8 and depth ratio h h 0 5 are considered unless it is not mentioned moreover for two layer fluid the series converges for m 1 8 and n 1 8 the heave force acting on the flexible permeable membrane due to surface and interface waves is given by 62 k v i ω ρ 2 0 2 π 0 a ϕ 2 r θ 0 r d r d θ further the non dimensional heave force is given as f v k v ρ 2 g h 3 3 2 1 floating circular flexible porous membrane having free edge fig 23 a and b demonstrates the heave force as a function of k i h to analyze the impact of different values of g and t ρ 2 g h 2 there is difference in energy distribution from long wave to short waves hence the wave force increases till k i h 1 and starts decreasing for k i h 1 for the elastic membrane g 0 on comparing with single layer fluid fig 3 magnitude of the wave force is more and maxima shifted towards left for the two layer fluid as a result of energy difference between the layers the energy dissipation by the porous membrane is more for moderate values of g fig 23 a which reduce the wave force to a great extent similarly for larger values of t ρ 2 g h 2 from fig 23 b the structural rigidity increases due to this the heave force acting on the porous elastic membrane increases with increase in the values of t ρ 2 g h 2 there is a major deviation occurs in long wave region as compared to that of short wave region due to the difference in wave energy distribution fig 24 a and b reveal the impact of h h and s respectively on the heave force when the interface is nearer to the free surface when h h decreases there is a constructive interference between both the layers thus it results in more heave force on the flexible permeable membrane fig 24 a on the other hand from fig 24 b it is inferred that more wave force acting on the membrane for smaller values of s due to the less mass and high energy concentration on the upper layer as s 1 the wave loads acting on the two layer fluid is homologous to a homogeneous fluid as in fig 3 the effect of g on the deflection of membrane is exhibited in fig 25 the deformation of elastic membrane decreases as a consequence of less heave force fig 25 a for larger g similar observation was made in the case of homogeneous fluid fig 4 but amplitude of the deflection is high for stratified fluid because of more energy distribution in the upper layer on the other hand fig 26 exhibits the deflection of porous membrane for varying h h the interaction between upper and lower layers increases for smaller values of h h which results in more wave force thus the membrane deflection increases for smaller values of h h as a special case as h h 1 the porous membrane deformation in heterogeneous fluid is similar to the homogeneous fluid in fig 27 the deflection of porous membrane is studied for different values of s as the density ratio s ρ 1 ρ 2 becomes larger and tends to unity the density of upper fluid will be closer enough to lower fluid thus the deflection of membrane in two layer fluid is similar to that in the case of homogeneous fluid for smaller values of s the deflection is high due to the less mass concentration in upper layer fluid which results in more wave transmission accompanied by increase in porous membrane deformation for smaller values of s fig 28 depicts the flow distribution around circular elastic membrane in the two layer fluids for different values of g in fig 28 a the incident wave interacts with the floating flexible porous membrane in two layer fluid due to the wave scattering by flexible membrane the surface wave amplitude decreases from incident to transmitted regions the wave transmission in lee side is reduced due to reflection of incident wave by flexible membrane thus on the transmitted region amplitude of the surface elevation decreases similarly in fig 28 b the porous membrane is subjected to the wave action due to the wave energy dissipation it is found that the surface wave amplitude decreases from the incident region to transmitted region which is negligible as compared to an impermeable flexible membrane fig 28 a in fig 29 a and b the reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes from the circular porous elastic membrane against the incident wave amplitude are plotted for various g respectively the wave reflected from the impermeable membrane fig 29 a in the direction of incident wave does not possess the peak as compared to that for a homogeneous fluid fig 8 a this may due to the interference between the layers as value of g increases there is increase in the impedance mismatch between the two regions thus reflected wave amplitude from the membrane increases for increase in the value of g further the transmitted wave amplitude from the circular elastic membrane fig 29 b decreases in the incident wave direction and it becomes oscillatory due to the energy difference between upper and lower layers the transmitted wave amplitude reduces for larger g as a result of wave energy dissipation fig 30 illustrates the effect of h h on the energy dissipation by the flexible permeable membrane having free edge as a function of real g the wave energy dissipation follows the same pattern as observed in the case of homogeneous fluid figs 9 16 and 21 for g 1 there is a minor deviation for changing in interface position however for g 1 wave energy dissipation decreases with increase in the depth ratio h h which is due to the less wave energy concentration near the bottom than near free surface 3 2 2 floating circular flexible porous membrane having moored edge fig 31 exhibits the effect of g on the deflection of the membrane as a consequence of wave energy dissipation the deformation of membrane reduces for larger values of g on the other hand the effect of β on the membrane deformation is illustrated in fig 32 it is found that the deformation of membrane decreases for larger mooring angle similar observation was made in the homogeneous fluid as in fig 13 the flow distribution around the porous elastic membrane having moored edge is plotted in fig 33 for different values of g as compared for the free edge condition as in fig 28 the membrane deflection and amplitude of the free surface elevation reduces due to the inclusion of mooring stiffness as shown in fig 33 a and b in addition the energy dissipation rate is high as compared to that for free edge thus the amplitude of surface elevation in the lee side of the plate is less as compared to that of free edge in fig 34 a and b the reflected and transmitted wave amplitude from the circular elastic membrane is plotted for varying incident amplitude for different values of g an analogous patterns were found for free edge condition as in fig 29 a and b but the reflected wave amplitude is less as compared to that of free edge due to more wave energy dissipation in the case moored edge similarly in fig 32 b the transmitted wave amplitude decreases and its magnitude is less as compared to that of free edge fig 35 illustrates the effect of h h on the energy dissipation of permeable elastic membrane having moored edge condition against the real value of g the patterns are similar to the free edge condition fig 30 the mooring lines restrict the relative motion of membrane and dissipates the most of an incoming wave due to this the magnitude of wave energy dissipation increases as compared to the free edge same phenomenon was observed for a homogeneous fluid fig 16 3 2 3 floating circular flexible porous membrane having clamped edge fig 36 a and b illustrate the effect of h h and s respectively on the heave force f v on permeable elastic membrane the pattern observed in both the figures is analogous to that shown in fig 23 a and b for free edge condition but due to rapid growth and decay of evanescent modes at higher wavenumber the heave force attains maximum in the case of clamped edge condition furthermore as s 1 and h h 1 the patterns of heave force acting on the circular porous elastic membrane is similar to that observed for a homogeneous fluid the role of g on membrane deflection is shown in fig 37 as observed in the case of homogeneous fluid fig 18 for larger g the deformation of flexible membrane decreases but the magnitude of deflection is high due to the high energy concentration near surface on comparing with free and moored edge the membrane having clamped possess high energy dissipation rate due to this the deflection is less as compared to that for the membrane having free and moored edge further the flow distribution around the clamped circular porous elastic membrane is plotted in fig 38 for different values of g it is observed that the amplitude of free surface elevation in lee side becomes nearly zero and the deflection of porous elastic membrane is less as compared to that of free and moored edge in addition due to interference between the two layers the amplitude of surface wave is more as compared to that for a homogeneous fluid as in fig 19 the reflected and transmitted wave amplitude are plotted for varying incident wave amplitude for different value of g are depicted in fig 39 a and b respectively due to the clamped edge the energy dissipation is more as compared to that for the moored and free edge conditions which decreases the magnitude of reflected and transmitted wave amplitude from the floating porous elastic membrane in fig 40 the wave energy dissipation is plotted as function of real porous effect parameter g for various h h in the case of homogeneous fluid it is found that the wave energy dissipation increases initially attains maximum and then decays gradually with increase in the values of g similar observation was found by meylan et al 2017 for wave diffraction by floating circular permeable elastic plate in the case of a homogeneous fluid furthermore the membrane having clamped edge dissipates more wave energy on comparing with the free and moored edge conditions moreover for g 0 8 there is a negligible deviation for changing the position of interface however for g 0 8 the wave energy dissipation increases with an increase in h h 4 conclusion in the present paper the effect of surface gravity waves on the floating circular porous elastic membrane in homogeneous and stratified fluid is studied using eigenfunction expansion method under the assumption of small amplitude water wave theory and structural response the problem is studied under three different edge conditions i e free moored and clamped edge the numerical results for the heave force on the structure amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves wave energy dissipation membrane deflection and flow distributions around the membrane are investigated for different physical quantities the study unveils that for both homogeneous and stratified fluids a large wave energy is dissipated by a floating permeable elastic membrane which results in less wave force on the structure and thus deflection of the membrane is less on comparing with the impermeable membrane furthermore the deflection of porous membrane is reduced significantly while moving from incident wave region to the transmitted wave region the transmitted wave amplitude reduces for the larger absolute value of g however the wave energy dissipation increases initially to a maximum then decreases slowly for larger values of g in both single and two layer fluids it is observed that due to more energy dissipation by the porous membrane having clamped edge condition heave force on the structure deformation and surface amplitudes in the lee side of the structure are less as compared to that in the case of free or moored edge conditions on the other hand for a two layer fluid the wave force on the membrane and membrane deformation are more as compared to that for a homogeneous fluid both the wave force and deflection are more for smaller values of depth ratio and as h h 1 the wave force and membrane deformation is similar to that found in the case of a single layer fluid with the decrease in density ratio s both the wave force and deflection of the porous elastic membrane increase as s 1 the patterns of wave force and deflection resemble same as that of a homogeneous fluid moreover for two layer fluid the reflected wave amplitude increases and transmitted becomes more oscillatory as compared to that for a homogeneous fluid finally for both single and two layer fluids the edge conditions porous effect parameter and the tensile force play an important role for reducing the amplitude of free surface elevation in the lee side of the structure it is concluded that with a suitable combination of wave and structural parameters floating circular porous elastic membrane can be used as an effective breakwater to protect a coast or activities along a

eigenfunction expansion method membrane deflection flow distribution energy dissipation 1 introduction in the last two decades an increasing number of porous structures have been proposed as breakwaters and constructed in offshore areas to protect the coastline from wave action or to extract wave energy from oceans the main benefit of these porous structures is that it significantly decrease the disturbances in marine environment apart from vertical porous structure there is a significant interest in submerged horizontal porous structure as these structures are less dependent on water depth and sea bed condition many theoretical and experimental studies have been developed regarding the diffraction of water waves by submerged horizontal structures the role of porosity on scattered wave height and excitation force on a submerged porous disk was studied by chwang and wu 1994 the effect of a submerged and essentially horizontal plate for offshore wave control was reviewed by yu 2002 by employing eigenfunction expansion method hu and wang 2005 analyzed the model consists of vertical permeable wall and a submerged horizontal plate they observed that a large amount of wave energy can be reduced by the system liu et al 2007 modeled a breakwater which consists a submerged horizontal porous plate placed between the permeable front and rigid back wall further they found that the porosity damps wave force on both horizontal plate and rigid back wall liu et al 2008 developed another model by considering the submerged horizontal plates between the upper porous and lower rigid plate in general for solving the physical problem of wave forcing on the submerged permeable structures the solution of complex dispersion relation is required however the new method developed by liu and li 2011 help to avoid complex dispersion relation in the case of wave action on horizontal submerged permeable plate later using the method of liu and li 2011 and liu et al 2011 studied the wave action on a submerged horizontal porous disk using the explicit relation for reflection coefficient evans and peter 2011 modeled the singularity at edge of submerged porous plate that occurs in velocity continuity using the matched eigenfunction expansion cho and kim 2013 investigated the oblique wave action on a horizontal porous structure and the theoretical results are compared against their experimental results on the other hand for effective usage of ocean space and protection against ocean waves of high amplitude the floating rigid flexible circular structures are preferred garrett 1971 investigated the scattering of surface gravity waves by a circular dock to determine the torque surge and heave forces acting on the dock norris and vemula 1995 derived the flux conservation relation for arbitrary motion for wave interaction with thin plates using linear hydro elastic theory cho and kim 1998 studied the diffraction of surface gravity waves by a horizontal flexible membrane using the method of zilman and miloh 2000 peter et al 2004 extended the same physical problem to the finite water depth and obtained the closed form solution karmakar and soares 2012 investigated the effect of bottom topography on the moored floating membrane using shallow water approximation by using eigenfunction expansion method meylan and peter 2009 obtained an analytical solution to wave scattering by the submerged elastic plate of negligible thickness mondal et al 2014 made a detailed study on the wave forcing on circular flexible structures in the both single and double layered fluid recently das et al 2018 investigated the effect of external loading on the flexural wave motion in the two layer fluid further by addition of structural porosity a significant wave energy can be dissipated by the floating submerged flexible structures it can be employed as an efficient breakwater which is cost effective and light weight in order to reduce the harbour resonance chwang and chan 1998 analyzed the usage of porous structure as wavemaker and breakwater cho and kim 2000 validated the analytical solution with the experimental results for wave forcing on a submerged porous flexible membrane trapping and scattering by the vertical flexible porous plate is analyzed by yip et al 2002 using the matched eigenfunction expansion method molin 2011 used quadratic pressure difference between the reflected and transmitted regions in darcy s law while analyzing the hydrodynamic performance of a permeable slotted barrier both scattering and trapping by submerged porous elastic plate is studied by behera and sahoo 2015 using matched eigenfunction expansion method it is interpreted that the porous submerged plate membrane dissipates most of the surface mode waves and transmit less wave in the lee side these porous structure can also used for various marine application such as fish cages mandal and sahoo 2016 developed the fish cage model with bottom porous submerged membrane and studied its hydrodynamic response by utilizing matched eigenfunction and least squares method further behera and ng 2017 studied the effect of floating and submerged porous elastic plates on a transmission of surface waves they found that the presence of submerged porous elastic plate damps the surface wave modes and reduces the deflection of floating plate recently the role of multiple bottom standing flexible barriers on wave trapping near a rigid wall was examined by behera and ng 2018 in the presence of a undulated bottom they found that number of barrier and porosity of the barriers play vital role to reduce wave force on the rigid wall on the other hand there are several studies on flexural gravity wave problems in the stratified fluid as in cadby and linton 2000 sherief et al 2004 manam and sahoo 2005 and the literature cited therein a two dimensional radiation problem for a floating body in a finite depth of two layer fluid is investigated by ten and kashiwagi 2004 using boundary integral equation chamberlain and porter 2005 exploited a variational technique in examining the three dimensional water wave scattering in a stratified fluid bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 developed the expansion formula for flexural gravity wave problem in two layer fluid the wave propagation in ice covered two layer fluid having bottom undulation is analyzed by mohapatra and bora 2009 using perturbation analysis and found that there is energy transfer between the surface and interface modes due to incident waves for certain parametric values mondal and sahoo 2012 applied the expansion formula of bhattacharjee and sahoo 2008 to study the scattering due to frozen cracks in floating ice sheet in presence of compressive force having finite water depth lin and lu 2013 investigated the oblique wave scattering by thin floating semi infinite plate in a two layer fluid having finite water depth an analytic solution is developed by behera et al 2018 to investigate the oblique wave scattering by a floating elastic plate over a porous seabed in two layer fluid it is found that wave transmission through the floating plate is significantly reduced due to presence of porous bed although the two dimensional setting has been explored in koley and sahoo 2017 behera and ng 2017 and koley et al 2018 for understanding the wave response of floating elastic permeable plate membrane in a homogeneous fluid however a three dimensional approach is needed for applications in ocean waves to use floating circular flexible porous plate membrane as an effective breakwater for protecting the coastal areas from incoming wave action in both homogeneous and stratified fluids meylan et al 2017 used eigenfunction expansion method along with free edge condition for the wave scattering by a circular floating flexible porous plate in single layer fluid furthermore they used coupled boundary element and finite difference methods for the plate having an arbitrary shape in their study the imaginary part of the porous effect parameter was not considered i e they neglected the inertial effect however in the present study by exploiting the matched eigenfunction expansion method as in meylan et al 2017 the influence of complex porous effect parameter along with three different edge conditions free moored and clamped edge are examined for surface gravity wave scattering by a floating circular elastic porous membrane in both homogeneous and stratified fluids the contour plots are used to analyze the behavior of the roots of complex dispersion relation moreover to study the influence of porous structure in damping the far field wave energy in both single and two layer fluids the plane wave integral representation of bessel and hankel functions are used by following the similar procedure of montiel et al 2015 and meylan et al 2017 the heave force exerted on the membrane membrane s deflection reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes far field energy dissipation and flow distribution are analyzed for the single layer fluid the mathematical formulation along with the solution procedure are elaborated in section 2 further the effects of three edge conditions are presented in three different subsections on the other hand for two layer fluids the required extra boundary conditions solutions and results are discussed in section 3 finally in section 4 the important observations are discussed 2 floating circular flexible permeable membrane in a homogeneous fluid in this section the effect of surface gravity wave on the floating circular flexible permeable membrane in a homogeneous fluid is investigated in cylindrical polar coordinates using linear water wave theory 2 1 mathematical formulation a

15 r φ 2 z i k 0 g φ 2 0 moored edge in this case the edge of membrane is connected to the rigid loop which moves on the frictionless rigid bar in order to maintain the tension t on the entire surface

positive imaginary roots p 1 p 2 see mondal et al 2014 and theorem 4 of rhodes robinson 1971 the roots of impermeable membrane g 0 covered dispersion relation is shown in the contour plot as in fig 2 a in the case of porous elastic membrane for g 0 all the roots are complex in nature fig 2 b further the roots of porous elastic membrane are in close proximity to the roots of flexural gravity wave as in fig 2 a nb it may be noted that in fig 2 b it seems that all the roots are purely real or imaginary however all roots are complex in nature as shown in table 1 further the roots in fourth quadrant are used in the present study and to handle the physical problem the orthogonality of vertical eigenfunction with respect to the open water region is considered the eigenfunction ψ m n θ z f

n 0 i 1 b m n j m p n r p n tanh p n h i k 0 g 0 further the detailed procedure for solving the above system of equation is elaborated in the next subsection 2 3 steps to solve the system of equation for finding unknown coefficients a matlab 2014a routine is employed to solve the system of equation in order to obtain the unknown coefficients the detailed procedures are given below input all the necessary wave and structural parameters solve the open water and membrane covered dispersion relations eqs 24 and 25 using the newton raphsons method in which the initial guesses are chosen from the contour plots of the corresponding dispersion relations truncate the infinite series of bessel mode m and eigen mode n of the system of eqs 27 28 and 29 or 30 or 31 to a finite values say m 1 and n 1 solve the truncated system of equations to find all the unknown coefficients in the velocity potentials as in eqs 20 and 21 then determine the amplitudes of reflection and transmission far field energy dissipation flow distribution around the membrane and deflection of the membrane for different physical variables in the next subsection the reflection and transmission coefficients are calculated using the constant coefficients in the integral expansion of incident and scattered velocity potentials 2 4 far field energy dissipation the problem is analyzed at far field r a by decomposing the velocity potential ϕ 1 r θ z into incident and scattered potentials ϕ 0 and ϕ s respectively and are given as 32 ϕ 0 r θ z m 0 a ϵ m j m k 0 r f 10 z e i m θ for r a 33 ϕ s r θ z m 0 a

floating circular flexible porous membrane is calculated along the entire interval of 2 π 2 5 results and discussion in this section in the case of homogeneous fluid heave force on the membrane deflection of the membrane amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves energy dissipation by the porous membrane and flow distribution around the membrane are investigated in different subsections in addition the significance of three different edge conditions are studied separately for various physical parameters in the present work water depth h 50 m incident wave amplitude i 0 1 radius a h 2 non dimensional wavenumber k 0 h 1 5 density of the membrane ρ m 10 kg m3 density of water ρ 1025 kg m3 tensile force t ρ g h 2 0 1 thickness d h 0 01 and g 0 2 0 3 i are fixed unless mentioned accordingly the heave force k v acting on the porous membrane is given by as in garrett 1971 40 k v i ω ρ 0 2 π 0 a ϕ 2 r θ 0 r d r d θ the non dimensional form of the heave force is given as 41 f v k v ρ g h 3 further in the present study the absolute value of surface elevation flow distribution is calculated using 42 η 01 i ω ϕ 1 z and η 02 i ω ϕ 2 z i k 0 ϕ 2 at z 0 it may be noted that the flow distribution describe the absolute value of the surface elevation and plate deflection in abstract view it is nothing but the distribution of wave amplitude around the structure similar study can be found in mondal et al 2014 and mandal et al 2013 for the correctness of the present numerical scheme energy balance of the above system of equation is checked for the progressive wave mode in the absence of porosity it says that if the bessel function of first kind j m is replaced by hankel function of second kind h m 2 in the incident part of the total potential ϕ 1 then the coefficients in the scattered part of potential must have modulus one the same is validated and shown in table 2 for different values of k 0 h against the various bessel mode m the convergence of numerical results are studied in table 3 by evaluating the heave force f v on the floating elastic permeable membrane for different truncated eigenvalues n 1 and wavenumber k 0 h from table 3 it is found that the series solution converges for n 1 7 up to three decimal places moreover the bessel modes m converges for m 1 8 and the same was reported in peter et al 2004 and mondal et al 2014 therefore the bessel modes and eigenvalues are fixed as m 1 8 and n 1 7 respectively for the computational purpose in the present study 2 5 1 floating circular flexible permeable membrane having free edge the heave force acting on the membrane is plotted as a function k 0 h to study the role of different g and t ρ g h 2 in fig 3 a and b respectively it is observed that around the moderate values of k 0 h the heave force increases due to the gradual growth of evanescent modes which result in high transmission then it attains maximum value and decreases gradually for higher values of k 0 h due to partial reflection and predominant progressive mode similar observations were found by garrett 1971 for wave diffraction by circular dock in fig 3 a the heave force decreases as a consequence of wave energy dissipation for larger values of g thus it results in less heave force on bottom of the membrane similar observations were found in case of wave scattering by floating permeable membrane and plate by koley and sahoo 2017 and koley et al 2018 respectively similarly in fig 3 b the heave force increases with increase in the values of t ρ g h 2 till k 0 h 0 8 and follows the opposite patterns for k 0 h 0 8 in addition it is also found that the maxima of heave force shift towards left for larger t ρ g h 2 due to restoring force developed inside the membrane fig 4 shows the effect of g on the deflection of elastic membrane the results are verified with mondal et al 2014 for wave forcing on the floating circular elastic impermeable membrane it is observed that the majority of incident wave energy is dissipated by the pores resulting in less deformation of elastic membrane further the membrane becomes transparent to the incident surface waves as the value of g increases similarly fig 5 depicts the deflection of porous elastic membrane for various t ρ g h 2 in the case of larger tensile force t ρ g h 2 the membrane s stiffness increases resulting in the less heave force as in fig 3 b as a consequence of this the deformation of porous elastic membrane decreases fig 6 shows the effect of g on the flow distributions around the floating elastic membrane for smaller value of t ρ g h 2 0 1 it is seen that the magnitude of surface wave amplitude reduces with increase in the absolute values of g further the tensile force provides the necessary restoring force which reduces the surface wave amplitude in the transmitted region on the other hand for larger value of t ρ g h 2 0 5 as in fig 7 the deflection of elastic membrane decreases as in fig 5 and strong restoring force suppress the amplitude of wave transmitting through the porous membrane by reflecting the incoming wave the reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes are plotted for varying incident wave amplitude in fig 8 a and b respectively fig 8 a reveals that the reflected amplitude attains a peak for impermeable membrane g 0 which is absent for permeable membrane g 0 moreover the reflected wave amplitude peaks in the direction of incident wave for g 0 with increase in the absolute values of g wave reflection increases and becomes smooth this is due to the impedance mismatch between the two regions 1 and 2 which increases for increase in g thus the reflected wave amplitude from the circular porous elastic membrane increases for larger g similarly the transmitted wave amplitude for varying incident amplitudes contains no side band for permeable membrane as observed in fig 8 b as g increases the transmitted wave amplitude decreases initially due to addition of porosity to the structure further the circular porous membrane becomes transparent to the incoming wave for larger g thus the transmitted wave amplitude increases in the direction of incident wave fig 9 exhibits the wave energy dissipation by porous elastic membrane as a function of real porous effect parameter g for free edge condition it is deduced that the energy dissipation increases initially for increase in the value of g and attains a maximum then decreases slowly for larger values of g 2 5 2 floating circular flexible permeable membrane having moored edge the heave force acting on the membrane is plotted as a function k 0 h to study the role of different g and t ρ g h 2 in fig 10 a and b respectively in this case the patterns of heave force and the observations for variation of g and t ρ g h 2 are similar to that observed in the case free edge condition as in fig 3 moreover due to the moored edge the stiffness of membrane increases which results in the less heave force acting on the floating membrane as compared to that of free edge further the effect of μ and β on the heave force acting on the membrane are illustrated in fig 11 a and b respectively in both fig 11 a and b the heave force follows the same pattern as observed in fig 10 in fig 11 a with increase in the values of μ the maxima of heave force shift towards left due to strong restoring force developed in the mooring lines for increase in the value of mooring angle β as in fig 11 b the magnitude of heave force decreases which is due to larger stiffness of the membrane fig 12 shows the effect of g on the deflection of elastic membrane the deflection of circular elastic membrane decreases for increase in the value of g the same observation was found for free edge condition fig 4 but in the case of moored edge the membrane stiffness reduces the heave force exerted on the membrane fig 10 thus the deflection of moored porous elastic membrane is less as compared that of membrane having the free edge in fig 13 the impact of mooring angle on the membrane deformation is illustrated for larger values of β the heave force exerted on the membrane decreases as in fig 11 b thus the membrane deformation due to transmitted wave decreases for larger values of mooring angle β in fig 14 the effect of g on the flow distributions around the membrane is illustrated due to the presence of moored line the deflection of an impermeable membrane is high along the edges the surface elevation decreases in the lees side of the structure this is due to the partial reflection and transmission by an impermeable membrane but on comparing with fig 14 b there is a significant reduction in the amplitude of free surface elevation due to the wave energy dissipation by pores present on the membrane in fact from fig 14 b it is evident that the membrane deformation decreases as observed in fig 12 thus wave transmission through the membrane is damped and the free surface amplitude on the lee side of porous elastic membrane reduces significantly fig 15 a and b illustrate the amplitude of reflected and transmitted waves respectively as a function of incident amplitude for different values of g the patterns of reflected and transmitted amplitudes resemble similar to the free edge fig 8 but the magnitude of transmitted wave amplitudes for moored porous membrane is less on comparing with free edge due to the strong restoring force produced by the mooring lines which results in more wave energy dissipation furthermore fig 16 shows the wave energy dissipation by porous elastic membrane as a function of real g the pattern is similar to that in the case of free edge condition as in fig 9 for moored edge the motion of floating elastic membrane constrained due to the action of restoring force by mooring line thus more wave energy is dissipated for moored edge condition as compared to that for free edge 2 5 3 floating circular flexible permeable membrane having clamped edge here the wave forcing on a floating porous elastic membrane having clamped edge is investigated and the effects of various physical parameters are studied in this section in fig 17 a and b the effect of g and t ρ g h 2 on the heave force f v which is plotted against k 0 h are illustrated respectively the patterns observed are similar to that in the case of free and moored edge as in figs 3 and 10 respectively but in the case of clamped edge energy dissipation rate is very high due to fixed position of porous membrane thus the magnitude of heave force is less as compared to that of the free and moored edge conditions fig 18 exhibits the effect of g on the deflection of membrane since the edges are clamped there is no deflection along the edges of the membrane due to the high dissipation rate the heave force due to transmitted wave is reduced significantly as in fig 15 a thus the deflection of elastic membrane decreases for increase in the value of g and its magnitude becomes very less as compared to that of free and clamped edge the effect of g on the flow distributions around the membrane is analyzed by fig 19 since the membrane deformation decreases for the larger values of g the transmitted wave is suppressed by the porous elastic membrane g 0 to a great extent as compared to that of elastic membrane g 0 thus the surface amplitude significantly decreases in the lee side of clamped porous membrane as compared to that of free and moored edge fig 20 a and b depicts the amplitude of reflected and transmitted waves as a function of incident amplitude for different values of g respectively the magnitude of reflected and transmitted amplitude in the case of clamped edge is very less as compared to that of moored edge further the energy dissipation is more for clamped edge due to its fixed position as a result of this the reflected wave amplitude increases with larger values of g as in fig 20 a and transmitted wave amplitude decreases as in fig 20 b for varying incident amplitude in fig 21 wave energy dissipation by porous elastic membrane as a function of real g is plotted in this case the floating membrane is fixed at specific position and majority of membrane s portion is exposed to wave action thus in the case of clamped edge there is very rapid increase in the wave energy dissipation as compared to that of free and moored edge conditions 3 floating circular flexible permeable membrane in a stratified fluid in this section the effect of surface gravity wave on a floating circular porous elastic membrane is studied in a two layer fluid the entire domain contains two immiscible fluids of densities ρ 1 and ρ 2 confined in the regions 0 z h upper layer and h z h lower layer respectively as in fig 22 the interface between upper and lower layers for both the regions is denoted as z h both the fluids are inviscid and incompressible as dealt in the case of homogeneous fluid in both the regions the surface and interfacial elevations are given as 43 η i ζ i e i ω t with i 1 2 3 4 where ζ 1 and ζ 2 are the surface amplitudes in open water and membrane covered regions respectively similarly ζ 3 and ζ 4 are the interface amplitudes in open water and membrane covered regions respectively in the present study the amplitudes ratio of the free surface elevation in sm and im is same as given in behera et al 2018 for impermeable sea bed further the laplace equation 1 and boundary conditions 2 11 are same as considered in section 2 for homogeneous fluid in the case of stratified fluid the scattered potentials in surface mode sm and interface mode im satisfy the far field radiation condition 44 lim r n i ii r φ φ 0 n r i k n φ φ 0 n 0 where k i and k i i are the wave numbers of undisturbed incident wave in sm and im respectively the velocity

given as u p n sinh p n h h p n l sinh p n h k i k 0 g l cosh p n h and l q p n 2 l 1 with q t ρ 2 g l m m ω 2 ρ 2 g and m m ρ m d moreover the eigenvalues p satisfy the dispersion relation in region

eq 52 it leads to the open water dispersion relation for the two layer fluid in this case eq 52 has two positive real roots k i and k i i in sm and im and infinite number of positive imaginary roots k 1 k 2 as in mondal et al 2014 on the other hand for g 0 eq 52 has two positive real roots p i and p i i for sm and im one extra imaginary roots p i i i due to the local effect and infinite number of positive imaginary roots p 1 p 2 however for g 0 all the roots of the dispersion relation 52 are complex in nature in the present study k i and p i are the roots in sm while k ii and p ii are the roots in im the orthogonality of open water eigenfunctions eq 50 yield 53 ψ m n θ z ψ l q θ z 0 2 π s 0 h ψ m n θ z ψ l q θ z d z h h ψ m n θ z ψ l q θ z d z d θ π c k q for n q and m l 0 for n q and

stratified fluid the physical parameters such as water depth h non dimensional radius of the membrane a h non dimensional tensile force t density of water ρ 2 non dimensional wavenumber k i h and dimensionless thickness d h are same to that used in the case of homogeneous fluid section 2 5 and the density ratio s 0 8 and depth ratio h h 0 5 are considered unless it is not mentioned moreover for two layer fluid the series converges for m 1 8 and n 1 8 the heave force acting on the flexible permeable membrane due to surface and interface waves is given by 62 k v i ω ρ 2 0 2 π 0 a ϕ 2 r θ 0 r d r d θ further the non dimensional heave force is given as f v k v ρ 2 g h 3 3 2 1 floating circular flexible porous membrane having free edge fig 23 a and b demonstrates the heave force as a function of k i h to analyze the impact of different values of g and t ρ 2 g h 2 there is difference in energy distribution from long wave to short waves hence the wave force increases till k i h 1 and starts decreasing for k i h 1 for the elastic membrane g 0 on comparing with single layer fluid fig 3 magnitude of the wave force is more and maxima shifted towards left for the two layer fluid as a result of energy difference between the layers the energy dissipation by the porous membrane is more for moderate values of g fig 23 a which reduce the wave force to a great extent similarly for larger values of t ρ 2 g h 2 from fig 23 b the structural rigidity increases due to this the heave force acting on the porous elastic membrane increases with increase in the values of t ρ 2 g h 2 there is a major deviation occurs in long wave region as compared to that of short wave region due to the difference in wave energy distribution fig 24 a and b reveal the impact of h h and s respectively on the heave force when the interface is nearer to the free surface when h h decreases there is a constructive interference between both the layers thus it results in more heave force on the flexible permeable membrane fig 24 a on the other hand from fig 24 b it is inferred that more wave force acting on the membrane for smaller values of s due to the less mass and high energy concentration on the upper layer as s 1 the wave loads acting on the two layer fluid is homologous to a homogeneous fluid as in fig 3 the effect of g on the deflection of membrane is exhibited in fig 25 the deformation of elastic membrane decreases as a consequence of less heave force fig 25 a for larger g similar observation was made in the case of homogeneous fluid fig 4 but amplitude of the deflection is high for stratified fluid because of more energy distribution in the upper layer on the other hand fig 26 exhibits the deflection of porous membrane for varying h h the interaction between upper and lower layers increases for smaller values of h h which results in more wave force thus the membrane deflection increases for smaller values of h h as a special case as h h 1 the porous membrane deformation in heterogeneous fluid is similar to the homogeneous fluid in fig 27 the deflection of porous membrane is studied for different values of s as the density ratio s ρ 1 ρ 2 becomes larger and tends to unity the density of upper fluid will be closer enough to lower fluid thus the deflection of membrane in two layer fluid is similar to that in the case of homogeneous fluid for smaller values of s the deflection is high due to the less mass concentration in upper layer fluid which results in more wave transmission accompanied by increase in porous membrane deformation for smaller values of s fig 28 depicts the flow distribution around circular elastic membrane in the two layer fluids for different values of g in fig 28 a the incident wave interacts with the floating flexible porous membrane in two layer fluid due to the wave scattering by flexible membrane the surface wave amplitude decreases from incident to transmitted regions the wave transmission in lee side is reduced due to reflection of incident wave by flexible membrane thus on the transmitted region amplitude of the surface elevation decreases similarly in fig 28 b the porous membrane is subjected to the wave action due to the wave energy dissipation it is found that the surface wave amplitude decreases from the incident region to transmitted region which is negligible as compared to an impermeable flexible membrane fig 28 a in fig 29 a and b the reflected and transmitted wave amplitudes from the circular porous elastic membrane against the incident wave amplitude are plotted for various g respectively the wave reflected from the impermeable membrane fig 29 a in the direction of incident wave does not possess the peak as compared to that for a homogeneous fluid fig 8 a this may due to the interference between the layers as value of g increases there is increase in the impedance mismatch between the two regions thus reflected wave amplitude from the membrane increases for increase in the value of g further the transmitted wave amplitude from the circular elastic membrane fig 29 b decreases in the incident wave direction and it becomes oscillatory due to the energy difference between upper and lower layers the transmitted wave amplitude reduces for larger g as a result of wave energy dissipation fig 30 illustrates the effect of h h on the energy dissipation by the flexible permeable membrane having free edge as a function of real g the wave energy dissipation follows the same pattern as observed in the case of homogeneous fluid figs 9 16 and 21 for g 1 there is a minor deviation for changing in interface position however for g 1 wave energy dissipation decreases with increase in the depth ratio h h which is due to the less wave energy concentration near the bottom than near free surface 3 2 2 floating circular flexible porous membrane having moored edge fig 31 exhibits the effect of g on the deflection of the membrane as a consequence of wave energy dissipation the deformation of membrane reduces for larger values of g on the other hand the effect of β on the membrane deformation is illustrated in fig 32 it is found that the deformation of membrane decreases for larger mooring angle similar observation was made in the homogeneous fluid as in fig 13 the flow distribution around the porous elastic membrane having moored edge is plotted in fig 33 for different values of g as compared for the free edge condition as in fig 28 the membrane deflection and amplitude of the free surface elevation reduces due to the inclusion of mooring stiffness as shown in fig 33 a and b in addition the energy dissipation rate is high as compared to that for free edge thus the amplitude of surface elevation in the lee side of the plate is less as compared to that of free edge in fig 34 a and b the reflected and transmitted wave amplitude from the circular elastic membrane is plotted for varying incident amplitude for different values of g an analogous patterns were found for free edge condition as in fig 29 a and b but the reflected wave amplitude is less as compared to that of free edge due to more wave energy dissipation in the case moored edge similarly in fig 32 b the transmitted wave amplitude decreases and its magnitude is less as compared to that of free edge fig 35 illustrates the effect of h h on the energy dissipation of permeable elastic membrane having moored edge condition against the real value of g the patterns are similar to the free edge condition fig 30 the mooring lines restrict the relative motion of membrane and dissipates the most of an incoming wave due to this the magnitude of wave energy dissipation increases as compared to the free edge same phenomenon was observed for a homogeneous fluid fig 16 3 2 3 floating circular flexible porous membrane having clamped edge fig 36 a and b illustrate the effect of h h and s respectively on the heave force f v on permeable elastic membrane the pattern observed in both the figures is analogous to that shown in fig 23 a and b for free edge condition but due to rapid growth and decay of evanescent modes at higher wavenumber the heave force attains maximum in the case of clamped edge condition furthermore as s 1 and h h 1 the patterns of heave force acting on the circular porous elastic membrane is similar to that observed for a homogeneous fluid the role of g on membrane deflection is shown in fig 37 as observed in the case of homogeneous fluid fig 18 for larger g the deformation of flexible membrane decreases but the magnitude of deflection is high due to the high energy concentration near surface on comparing with free and moored edge the membrane having clamped possess high energy dissipation rate due to this the deflection is less as compared to that for the membrane having free and moored edge further the flow distribution around the clamped circular porous elastic membrane is plotted in fig 38 for different values of g it is observed that the amplitude of free surface elevation in lee side becomes nearly zero and the deflection of porous elastic membrane is less as compared to that of free and moored edge in addition due to interference between the two layers the amplitude of surface wave is more as compared to that for a homogeneous fluid as in fig 19 the reflected and transmitted wave amplitude are plotted for varying incident wave amplitude for different value of g are depicted in fig 39 a and b respectively due to the clamped edge the energy dissipation is more as compared to that for the moored and free edge conditions which decreases the magnitude of reflected and transmitted wave amplitude from the floating porous elastic membrane in fig 40 the wave energy dissipation is plotted as function of real porous effect parameter g for various h h in the case of homogeneous fluid it is found that the wave energy dissipation increases initially attains maximum and then decays gradually with increase in the values of g similar observation was found by meylan et al 2017 for wave diffraction by floating circular permeable elastic plate in the case of a homogeneous fluid furthermore the membrane having clamped edge dissipates more wave energy on comparing with the free and moored edge conditions moreover for g 0 8 there is a negligible deviation for changing the position of interface however for g 0 8 the wave energy dissipation increases with an increase in h h 4 conclusion in the present paper the effect of surface gravity waves on the floating circular porous elastic membrane in homogeneous and stratified fluid is studied using eigenfunction expansion method under the assumption of small amplitude water wave theory and structural response the problem is studied under three different edge conditions i e free moored and clamped edge the numerical results for the heave force on the structure amplitudes of the reflected and transmitted waves wave energy dissipation membrane deflection and flow distributions around the membrane are investigated for different physical quantities the study unveils that for both homogeneous and stratified fluids a large wave energy is dissipated by a floating permeable elastic membrane which results in less wave force on the structure and thus deflection of the membrane is less on comparing with the impermeable membrane furthermore the deflection of porous membrane is reduced significantly while moving from incident wave region to the transmitted wave region the transmitted wave amplitude reduces for the larger absolute value of g however the wave energy dissipation increases initially to a maximum then decreases slowly for larger values of g in both single and two layer fluids it is observed that due to more energy dissipation by the porous membrane having clamped edge condition heave force on the structure deformation and surface amplitudes in the lee side of the structure are less as compared to that in the case of free or moored edge conditions on the other hand for a two layer fluid the wave force on the membrane and membrane deformation are more as compared to that for a homogeneous fluid both the wave force and deflection are more for smaller values of depth ratio and as h h 1 the wave force and membrane deformation is similar to that found in the case of a single layer fluid with the decrease in density ratio s both the wave force and deflection of the porous elastic membrane increase as s 1 the patterns of wave force and deflection resemble same as that of a homogeneous fluid moreover for two layer fluid the reflected wave amplitude increases and transmitted becomes more oscillatory as compared to that for a homogeneous fluid finally for both single and two layer fluids the edge conditions porous effect parameter and the tensile force play an important role for reducing the amplitude of free surface elevation in the lee side of the structure it is concluded that with a suitable combination of wave and structural parameters floating circular porous elastic membrane can be used as an effective breakwater to protect a coast or activities along a coastline from wave action credit authorship contribution statement siluvai antony selvan writing original draft software harekrushna behera define problem writing review editing supervision
