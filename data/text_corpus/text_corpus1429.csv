7145,non rainfall events like dew or hoar frost formation are often neglected in the water budget because either assumed to be too small or their determination requires time consuming and difficult measurements these events supply in many dryland ecosystems a substantial amount of water but their role for northern humid ecosystems is largely unknown there is a general need to quantify the ecological relevance for ecosystems of the water amount from dew and hoar frost formation weighable precision lysimeters were used to determine dew and hoar frost formation for a low mountain range and alpine grassland site for the hydrological years 2013 2015 together dew and hoar frost formation ranged on a yearly basis between 42 1 and 67 7 mm which corresponds to 4 2 6 of the total annual amount of precipitation in drier months dew and hoar frost contributed up to 16 1 of total monthly precipitation amount in winter months dew and hoar frost formation contributed up to 38 to the total monthly precipitation amount our investigation suggests that dew and hoar frost formation are of ecological importance during droughts as well as cold periods the amounts and seasonal patterns of dew and hoar frost formation could be predicted relatively well based on standard meteorological variables with the penman monteith equation however our results also showed that the surface energy balance model from penman monteith underestimated the amount of dew and hoar frost during colder periods and specific meteorological site conditions i e high wind speeds at night the mean underestimation between calculated and measured dew and hoar frost on a yearly scale were 63 2 and 16 6 at rollesbroich and gumpenstein respectively dew and hoar frost formation contributes substantially to the water

rainfall water ecological relevance dew hoar frost estimation dew hoar frost 1 introduction dew forms when the temperature of a surface is lower than or equal to the dew point temperature such that water vapour of the ambient air condenses at the colder surface free water on the soil or surface of plants can originate from separate processes we distinguish between i dew formation and direct water vapour adsorption in case that condensed water originate from the atmosphere monteith 1957 ii distillation if the source of water vapour comes from the soil and iii guttation if the water comes from the plant itself singh 2014 however the latter both represent only a redistribution of water within the soil plant atmosphere system and hence do not really contribute to the water balance please note we followed the terminology of agam and berliner 2006 and used in our investigation the term dew formation instead of dew deposition or dewfall this prevents that one may misinterpret from the terms dew deposition or dewfall that droplets of water were formed in the air and not at the surface dew is a natural phenomenon and results from a phase transition between the gaseous and liquid state when moist air comes in contact with a surface agam and berliner 2006 and hence heterogeneous nucleation with a growth of water droplets starts beysens 1995 in case that surface temperature falls below the frost point of the air we can observe the formation of hoar frost rather than dew monteith and unsworth 2013 so dew and hoar frost formation can be seen in the absence of fog and precipitation as a mechanism by which water can be added to the soil plant system the physical phenomena of dew formation is ecologically and biologically important as the non rainfall water directly impact the productivity of mosses and lichens csintalan et al 2000 gauslaa 2014 goetz and price 2016 provide sufficient water for the growth of microbiotic crusts kidron et al 2002 is a major water source for plants in many arid and semi arid regions hanisch et al 2015 guo et al 2016 influence barren landscapes and their micrometeorological conditions by enhancing the moisture cycle of bare soils graf et al 2004 and is in drylands often the only water source for small animals guadarrama cetina et al 2014 wang et al 2017 dew is also from an economical perspective beneficial and improve the water use efficiency of plants ben asher et al 2010 serve in water scarce regions as supplement irrigation demand for reforestation and agriculture tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 can negatively affect yields because they may lead to a spread of plant disease agam and berliner 2006 affect the efficiency of agrochemicals saab et al 2017 and thus impact on crop yield modern dew harvesting can supply water for human consumption and reduce the water scarcity in many parts of the world muselli et al 2009 tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 beysens 2016 some studies emphasized that dew is not a significant component as it contributes only small amounts to the total annual water balance in humid areas malek et al 1999 as such quantities are often an order of magnitude smaller than potential evapotranspiration fluxes monteith and unsworth 2013 thus most studies on dew formation focused on arid and semi arid regions kidron 2000 agam and berliner 2006 because here the impact of non rainfall water can be considered as most significant for the water balance and the survival of various plant species price and clark 2014 but during short periods even small amounts of water from dew formation can be highly beneficial for plants not only for arid regions but also for humid regions xiao et al 2009 only few studies were conducted in humid areas for arable or grassland and the amount of dew was determined with artificial devices e g passive dewfall collector jacobs et al 2008 filter papers hughes and brimblecombe 1994 kabela et al 2009 or dewmeter price and clark 2014 however the properties of these artificial devices differed considerably from those of a natural soil plant system beysens 1995 emphasized that the formation of dew under appropriate atmospheric conditions depends mainly on the temperature and wetting properties of the substrate which control the nucleation rate additionally the wetting properties affect the form and growth of the droplet patterns beysens 1995 also the seasonal development of the land surface will impact the formation of non rainfall water i e dew and hoar frost formation as canopy height thermal regime and the plant as well as soil surface will change thus the dew yield of artificial devices used to collect dew or hoar frost will differ from that of dynamic and heterogeneous natural land surface coverages all mentioned techniques to quantify the amount of dew cannot detect direct adsorption as their artificial surfaces properties are not able to adsorb vapour agam and berliner 2006 at the same time they record not only water from dew formation but also from distillation xiao et al 2009 high precision weighable lysimeters do not have such issues because they are filled with natural soils which can reproduce direct water adsorption and measure at the same time only the formation of dew or hoar frost since the distilled water comes from the lysimeter interior and does not lead to a change of weight earlier lysimeter studies meissner et al 2007 fank 2013 showed that such measuring systems are suitable to detect the formation of dew however the precision of lysimeter measurements and the temporal resolution have to be high enough in order to record such small amounts of water on the land surface recent developments in lysimeter technology improved not only the precision and the temporal resolution of the measurements but also provide a more dynamic and field related flow across the bottom of the lysimeter unold and fank 2008 which is important for the temperature profile in the soil also the recent study from peters et al 2017 showed that not only the measuring system needs certain requirements also the pre and post processing of the noise prone lysimeter balance data is of crucial importance xiao et al 2009 investigated with lysimeters which are located in the central german dry area dryness index 0 92 meissner et al 2009 that the seasonal vegetation cover influences the annual amount and seasonal formation of dew it is still a research gap how much dew and hoar frost formation contributes to the seasonal and annual water balance and how ecologically relevant those amounts are for grasslands under humid climate conditions in this framework our study presents a comparison of annual and seasonal amounts of dew and hoar frost for two distinct grassland sites from austria alpine and germany low mountain range main objectives of our study are 1 to quantify the amount and the temporal distribution of dew and hoar frost formation over a period of two hydrological years for a low mountain range and alpine grassland 2 to estimate the ecological relevance of dew and hoar frost formation for a low mountain range and alpine grassland 3 to evaluate the use of meteorological variables to quantify the seasonal amount of non rainfall water from dew and hoar frost formation 2 material and methods 2 1 site descriptions the study was conducted at two test sites in humid regions see table 1 one is located at the agricultural research and education centre raumberg gumpenstein gs in the enns valley of styria in austria herndl et al 2011 the other site is located in rollesbroich ro in the tereno eifel lower rhine valley observatory in germany p√ºtz et al 2016 at both test sites six weighable lysimeters were established meter group munich germany fig 1 where at gs three lysimeters gs1 gs2 gs6 and at ro six lysimeters ro1 ro6 were used to quantify amounts of water from dew and hoar frost formation beside the lysimeters at gs an agrometeorological station operated by the university of natural resources and life sciences provided standard meteorological data of air temperature air pressure wind speed and relative humidity precipitation was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge young gwu erftstadt germany the surface temperature was measured since april 2014 at gs with an infrared radiometer sensor si 111 apogee instruments logan usa beside the lysimeters at ro a weather station wxt510 vaisala oyj helsinki finland logged the same meteorological parameters measurements of precipitation were taken from a tipping bucket rain gauge ecotech bonn germany at each station a net radiation sensor lp net07 delta ohm s rl caselle di sevazzano italy was installed above one lysimeter the grassland vegetation at the gs lysimeters is dominated by arrhenatherum elatius and festuca pratensis the management of the grassland during the observation period consisted of three cuts per year where the fertilization was carried out mineral based the plant community of ro was classified according to schubert et al 2001 as ryegrass lolio perennis cynosuretum cristati and the main species are lolium perenne and trifolium repens the grassland vegetation on the lysimeter and the surrounding field is extensively managed with three to four cuts and two to three liquid manure applications 1 6 l m 2 per growing season during the observation period from 2013 11 01 until 2015 10 31 2 2 lysimeter set up the set of lysimeters with 1 m2 surface area and 1 5 m depth each are regularly arranged around a central service well the lysimeters have a controlled bottom boundary condition that enables an upward and downward directed water flux across the lysimeter bottom and ensures that the lysimeter water dynamics are adjusted to observed field dynamics groh et al 2016 the weighing system of the lysimeter and the seepage tank allowed minutely recording water flux changes at a resolution of 10 g 0 01 mm and 1 g 0 001 mm respectively the total weight measured by the lysimeter range in the observation period between 2918 and 3300 kg and 2811 and 3013 kg at ro and gs respectively the measurement accuracy of each lysimeter was routinely checked by a loading and unloading experiment as proposed by nolz et al 2013 the pressure head at the bottom of the lysimeter is controlled and adjusted to measured pressure heads from an undisturbed soil profile nearby all lysimeters consists of a housing area with field identical temperatures unold and fank 2008 hertel and von unold 2014 p√ºtz et al 2016 the installation depth of the time domain reflectometry probes pico32 imko gmbh ettlingen germany at gs cs610 campbell scientific north logan usa at ro for soil moisture determination and the tensiometers combined with temperature sensors t8 30 at gs ts1 at ro both from meter group munich germany to determine matric potential are 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m further details of the lysimeter design can be taken from herndl et al 2011 and p√ºtz et al 2016 2 3 quantification of dew and hoar frost formation from lysimeter data the high temporal resolution and high measurement precision of the lysimeter balance systems are the prerequisite to quantify soil water balance components with high resolution and precision on the natural surface grassland and especially dew fog or hoar frost the changes of the lysimeter weight are in general prone to external forces e g exerted by wind management operations or animals hence lysimeter data require an appropriate data processing scheme to reduce the impact of noise and errors on the determination of land surface water fluxes i e precipitation p and evapotranspiration et marek et al 2014 hannes et al 2015 herbrich and gerke 2016 in a first step the raw data underwent an extensive manual and automated plausibility control p√ºtz et al 2016 k√ºpper et al 2017 subsequently a smoothing of lysimeter data was necessary in order to further reduce the impact of noise the awat filter applies an adaptive smoothing window size and an adaptive threshold value to lysimeter weight data to improve the data reliability peters et al 2014 2016 a piecewise cubic hermitian spline interpolation was carried out between anchor points and the 75th percent quantile was used for the implemented snap routine peters et al 2017 this filter has shown to be able to identify precisely even small land surface fluxes e g low et or dew formation peters et al 2017 processed data were finally used to calculate p and et from lysimeter weight changes we assume that no et can occur during p events 1 min interval and hence every increase or decrease in lysimeter mass change can be attribute to p or et respectively a comparison of p measured with weighable lysimeters compared with p measured by rain gauges tipping bucket method tends to differ by up to 22 fank 2013 hoffmann et al 2016 herbrich et al 2017 one reason might be that weighable lysimeters detect p not only as rainfall but also in form of dew fog and hoar frost another part of the difference might be related to evaporation and wind errors of rain gauges richter 1995 graf et al 2014 however during night the influence of evaporation is small and wind speed are in general much lower than at daytime consequently lysimeter data were surveyed for periods with mass increases between sunset and sunrise these periods with mass increases of a lysimeter were subsequently compared with p from a tipping bucket measurement mass increases not concurrent with rain or snow were classified as dew fank and unold 2007 meissner et al 2007 xiao et al 2009 or hoar frost aggregated hourly amounts of dew and hoar frost were limited by the maximum rate of dew formation during clear nights 0 07 mm h 1 monteith and unsworth 1990 furthermore air temperature was used to differentiate between dew and hoar frost formation during times with air temperature below or equal to the freezing point were related to the formation of hoar frost vice versa times with air temperature above zero were attributed to dew formation this approach might lead to a slight overestimation of dew and underestimation of hoar frost since the surface can be frozen under dew conditions positive temperature profile even when the air temperature is somewhat above zero as in many other studies we could not differentiate between dew formation and fog e g brown et al 2008 xiao et al 2009 to disentangle between fog and dew or hoar frost formation further measurements of precipitation droplet size stable water isotopes camera or light transmittance observations could be used meunier and beysens 2016 kaseke et al 2017 to quantify the possible ecological relevance during the above mentioned soil and atmospheric conditions we counted days with dew when the water content in the topsoil 0 0 1 m was below the permanent wilting point and days with hoar frost the soil water content at the permanent wilting point was estimated according to the method proposed by ad hoc arbeitsgruppe boden 2005 from soil texture and bulk density data both can be used as indicators to quantify the ecological relevance of non rainfall events and represent distinct ecological functions dew can be helpful during droughts because the non rainfall water reduces both plant water stress and et the formation of hoar frost can thermally protect the vegetation and reduced the risk of low temperature injuries of plants 2 4 estimation of potential dew and hoar frost from environmental variables dew amounts can be measured with different methods such as dew collector dew condenser eddy covariance observations blotting drosometer and lysimeter richards 2005 meissner et al 2007 kabela et al 2009 muselli et al 2009 guo et al 2016 but there is still no standard procedure and device the same can be said for the estimation of dew and hoar frost from environmental variables there are different approaches to assess the dew and hoar frost formation from meteorological data with i the energy balance ii the turbulent vapour transport iii the bowen ratio energy balance and iiii the penman monteith pm equation neumann 1956 jacobs et al 1990 madeira et al 2001 in general all four methods can be used to quantify dew but differ in terms of needed variables e g soil heat flux or surface temperature the equation of the energy balance turbulent vapour transport and the bowen ratio energy balance require measurements of the surface temperature to estimate dew formation which is usually not a standard meteorological variable hence in our investigation the pm model will be used to assess dew and hoar frost formation the pm equation accounts with its diabatic and adiabatic terms for the transport of energy and vapour within the atmosphere it was applied to study dew formation over a range of different vegetation forms and regions with artificial devices garratt and segal 1988 sudmeyer et al 1994 jacobs et al 1996 jacobs et al 1999 jacobs et al 2000 luo and goudriaan 2000 jacobs et al 2006 jacobs et al 2008 hourly potential dew and hoar frost formation can be estimated by the fao pm equation food and

below the freezing point 3 results and discussion 3 1 amount of dew and hoar frost measured with lysimeters fig 2 a and b illustrate exemplary for one lysimeter the formation of dew and hoar frost overnight and the prevailing meteorological conditions at the lysimeter station in gs subplot a in fig 2 shows the lysimeter weight surface temperature air temperature mean and range and humidity from 2015 09 10 11 am to 2015 09 11 10 am before sunset and after sunrise the lysimeter weight decreased due to et by in total 1 19 mm and both air and surface temperature increased however after sunset the lysimeter weight started to increase from 7 pm 2015 09 10 until 8 am of the following day whereas the temperature of the surface decreased below the dew point temperature of the surrounding air at the same time we assume that the vapour contained in the thin layer of air above the plant starts to condense on the surface and the relative humidity was close to 100 which was visible with a delay from relative humidity measurements at 2 m above the grass canopy the external rain gauge did not detect any rain during this time period under such meteorological conditions the slow increase of lysimeter weight can be related to formation conditions of dew as the air and surface temperature stayed above zero hence the increase in lysimeter weight between sunset and sunrise corresponds to the formation of dew by 0 3 mm in the subplot b from fig 2 the lysimeter weight increased between sunset and sunrise and thus corresponded to the formation of hoar frost as surface and air temperature were below the freezing point of water the hoar frost formation was 0 24 mm during 2014 12 09 4 pm and 2014 12 10 8 pm the average monthly amounts of precipitation dew and hoar formation at gs and ro during two consecutive hydrological years 2013 2014 hy 13 14 and 2014 2015 hy 14 15 are summarized in table 2 the precipitation amount during the first hydrological year 2013 2014 was 1132 2 mm and 1126 9 mm at ro and gs respectively the corresponding amount of dew of 61 9 mm at ro was larger than at gs 52 1 mm the highest monthly amount of dew formation was obtained in november at both test sites dew formation followed at ro in comparison to gs a seasonal pattern with overall higher average monthly amounts of dew during autumn and winter than during spring and summer months the dew formation reached 5 5 and 4 6 of the annual precipitation at the low mountain range and alpine grassland site respectively the spatial variability at the annual scale which was observed between the different lysimeters at the corresponding station was small with respect to measurement accuracy of the system with 4 4 mm at ro and 3 6 mm at gs larger average monthly amounts of hoar frost formation were achieved at both sites between november 2013 and march 2014 the total amount of water from hoar frost during the hy 13 14 was with 5 8 mm and 12 6 mm for ro and gs respectively clearly lower than those from dew but in months with low air temperatures and few p monthly values of hoar frost were up to 7 18 mm dec 2013 which corresponded to nearly 29 of the monthly p amount at test site gs the hoar frost formation contributed with 0 5 ro and 1 1 gs at the annual scale hy 13 14 a rather small amount in comparison to dew however the spatial variability of hoar frost formation with 0 7 mm and 0 5 mm was clearly higher than for dew during the second hydrological year 2014 2015 the precipitation amounts were 1036 8 mm at ro and 991 5 mm at gs and thus were clearly lower than the p for the hy 13 14 at ro the measured amount of dew was higher with 56 9 mm than at gs 38 8 mm and the spatial variability was small with 1 9 mm and 5 2 mm at both sites the highest monthly amount of dew formation in this hy 14 15 was achieved in december at both test sites the average monthly contribution of dew on the p amount reached values between 2 5 15 5 and 1 6 16 3 at ro and gs respectively and showed a seasonal tendency with higher contributions during winter and autumn months in the months january and february 2015 very few or no dew was measured at gs during this time the lysimeter surface was covered with a 15 cm thick snow layer for 40 days and records of lysimeter weight changes were unreliable in hy 14 15 the dew formation reached with 5 5 and 3 9 of the total precipitation similar values than for the hy 13 14 at ro and gs respectively the measured total water amount from hoar frost was 8 5 mm at ro and therefore larger than the year before however at gs hoar frost formation was with 3 3 mm clearly smaller than in hy 13 14 hoar frost amounts reached in december 2014 with 2 57 mm a peak at ro dew formation in ro was in this month also large 6 8 mm and thus both dew and hoar frost contributed together more than 10 of the monthly amount of p the long snow cover in the winter reduced the formation of hoar frost at gs our results are in line with previous studies which showed that dew contributes on a yearly base between 4 5 and 6 9 of the total precipitation for different grassland sites under regional climate conditions in croatia germany and the netherlands jacobs et al 2006 xiao et al 2009 heusinger and weber 2015 dew formation for arid and semi arid climates were reported for various continents e g africa australia south and north america and ranged for different land cover forms from 2 up to 48 of the total precipitation baier 1966 evenari et al 1971 sharma 1976 malek et al 1999 kalthoff et al 2006 hanisch et al 2015 kalthoff et al 2006 reported for an arid valley in chile located south of the hyper arid atacama desert that dew formation which ranged between 5 mm and 10 mm can even reach the dimension of yearly precipitation amounts in extreme dry years it suggests that the contribution of dew on the annual precipitation amount is much larger under drier climatic conditions most studies on non rainfall events were conducted in arid to semi arid regions thus very little data exists on the quantification of water added to soil plant system by hoar frost formation on the yearly basis while hoar frost does not occur during the main vegetation period it can be of ecological relevance for the plant as will be shown in the following section 3 2 ecological relevance of dew and hoar frost the indicator to quantify the ecological relevance of dew formation is summarized in table 3 and describes the average number of days per month with dew during water stress the critical soil water content at the permanent wilting point was set according to texture and bulk density information from the topsoil on 0 22 m3 m 3 and 0 12 m3 m 3 at ro and gs respectively plant water stress can occur in dependence on vegetation type much earlier than at the permanent wilting point but verifying this requires leaf water potential measurements of the grassland ecosystem in the first hydrological year no water stress occurred and hence the ecological relevance of dew was due to relatively humid conditions negligible at both test sites this was also the case for the second hy 14 15 at gs however for ro in months june july and august 2015 5 to 11 days per month were observed where dew occurred during times with water stress in the upper soil layer the standard deviation for those months was relatively high and ranged between 3 and 6 days this suggests that the ecological relevance of dew varied over space this is mainly related to pronounced differences in soil water contents at the same depth in different locations caused by spatial variations in hydraulic parameters and is in line with a study at the catchment scale from a soil moisture sensor network qu et al 2014 the dry conditions in those months agreed well with a large scale investigation which demonstrated that most parts of europe were affected by a drought ionita et al 2016 which was after the exceptional drought in 2003 one of the most severe droughts in the region laaha et al 2016 thus dew is also under humid climate conditions an important water supply during periods of drought when plants have only limited access to available water resources in the effective root zone agam and berliner 2006 ben asher et al 2010 a second ecological function of dew could be a suppression or reduction of transpiration rates during early morning hours which prevents higher water loss due to transpiration especially at times with a high atmospheric et demand during droughts periods a recent study by gerlein safdi et al 2017 confirmed this and showed that dew formation induced suppression of plant transpiration processes of a tropical plant colocasia esculenta the indicator to quantify the ecological relevance of hoar frost formation also is summarized in table 3 and describes the days with hoar frost for hoar frost table 3 shows that during november until april depending on the seasonal meteorological conditions average monthly days with hoar frost ranged between 1 and 13 days at ro and between 1 and 24 days at gs on the annual scale we can see that in hy 13 14 on more than 52 and 82 days and in hy 14 15 on 67 and 41 days hoar frost at ro and gs respectively during the formation process of hoar frost white frost heat is released when liquid water vapour freezes to ice on the plant surface and thus naturally protected plant tissues from freezing and causes less damage on plants than the so called black frost which forms under drier atmospheric air conditions snyder et al 2005 pessarakli 2014 the lower values of days with hoar frost in gs hy 14 15 can be explained by the closed snow cover in january and february which provides in addition to hoar frost an optimal insulation from lethal freezing temperatures thorsen et al 2010 our study results indicate that dew and hoar frost formation fulfils an important ecological function for grassland and thus might be of ecological relevance during periods of drought and wintertime but further plant specific observations are of need to directly quantify the ecological relevance and impact of non rainfall water on the development of plant communities and their functional traits 3 3 comparison of actual and potential dew and hoar frost formation fig 3 depicts the measured and estimated monthly amounts of dew and hoar frost formation at both test sites estimates of potential dew achieved values of 25 0 mm and 17 3 mm at ro and 38 7 mm and 32 2 mm at gs for the hy 13 14 and hy 14 15 thus the pm model underestimated the formation of dew on average on a yearly scale by 64 4 38 0 mm and 22 0 10 4 mm at ro and gs respectively the seasonal patterns of dew formation were captured well at both sites with the pm model see fig 3 a and c an underestimation of potential dew formation at gs by the pm model was notable for november 2013 and during the months january until may for ro we observed a general underestimation of dew by the pm model this was more pronounced during autumn to winter sondjf than in spring to summer months mamjja the larger deviations during this period of time at the test site ro might be related to nighttime transpiration the average diurnal cycle of pet during both periods is depicted in fig 4 for both sites decreasing surface temperature radiative cooling combined with sufficient moisture in the air in the night with a small adiabatic term results in negative values of pet which indicate the formation of dew asce ewri 2005 this is more pronounced during spring to summer mamjja because of higher radiative cooling clear nights fewer clouds and the fact that vapour holding capacity of air increases exponentially with air temperature thus average hourly pet rates during the vegetation period mamjja are much lower than during autumn and winter time sondjf see fig 4 dew formation started at both sites during period mamjja in the late evening 8pm and lasted until early morning hours 5pm however for the autumn to winter period sondjf pet during nighttime showed only at the gs tests site the formation of dew or hoar frost the corresponding values of pet during night at ro were on average above zero and predicted the occurrence of nighttime pet recent investigations with lysimeters at ro nevertheless confirmed the occurrence of nighttime et however investigation also reveals that larger nighttime pet rates are related to relative high wind speeds during night in periods sondjf on average 3 m s 1 which consequently enlarged the adiabatic term and exceeded the diabatic component in the pm equation this suggests that the pm model tends to underestimate dew formation at test sites with large wind speeds at night the estimates of potential hoar frost achieved on average 3 3 mm and 9 1 mm at the annual scale at ro and gs respectively the seasonal monthly tendency was captured well for both sites with the pm model however single months especially at the beginning of november until december showed a clear underestimation of hoar frost with the pm model for the second hydrological year the pm model showed an overestimation by in total 4 4 mm at gs this can be related mainly to missing information on hoar frost formation during the time from january until february 2015 where the lysimeter surface was covered by snow thus our results showed that the pm model is in general able to capture well the seasonal tendency of dew and hoar frost formation at both sites but our investigation also demonstrates that the pm model underestimated dew and hoar frost formation during colder time of the year and under specific meteorological conditions like high wind speeds at night 4 summary and outlook our analysis provides observations of dew and hoar frost formation for two distinct grassland ecosystems at a low mountain range and alpine site over two consecutive hydrological years the dew and hoar frost formation ranged between 42 1 and 67 7 mm which corresponds to 4 2 6 0 of the precipitation on a yearly basis seasonal patterns of dew and hoar frost amounts were in general larger during autumn and winter months in winter months with lower precipitation events dew and hoar frost formation contributed together substantially to the total monthly precipitation amount up to 38 moreover our investigation showed that dew was an ecologically important source of water during periods of drought when plants had only a limited access on water resources in the effective root zone during colder periods of the year hoar frost formation took over an ecological function at both grassland sites as it thermally protected crops and thus potentially reduced the risk of low temperature injuries of plants the estimates of potential dew and hoar frost formation with the pm model were underestimated but showed in general promising results to capture the observed seasonal patterns and amount of additional precipitation water the mean underestimation between calculated and measured dew and hoar frost on a yearly scale were 63 2 and 16 6 at rollesbroich and gumpenstein respectively using the pm model might thus enable to account for dew and hoar frost at large scales e g catchment landscape continents however the pm model underestimated dew and hoar frost formation during colder periods and specific meteorological conditions i e high wind speeds at night the study revealed that dew and hoar frost formation contribute substantially to the water budgets of a low mountain range and alpine grassland site non rainfall water can be of relevance when quantifying water budget components at larger scales as it might impact the transport of contaminants transit time nutrient budgets alter et change the water use efficiency and consequently affect the seasonal crop growth the urgency to account for such water fluxes is even more important for studies in arid semiarid regions where water scarcity often occurs during the year and which might be more sensitive to climate variability and climate change recent investigations for the mediterranean region indicate that climate change will lead to a substantial reduction of dew yields and thus amplify water scarcity tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 this demonstrates the overall importance to precisely quantify low precipitation fluxes such as dew and hoar frost formation in the water and nutrient cycling of ecosystems especially in the context of climate change and occurrence of droughts however there is still a lack of information how different vegetation types and soils affect the formation of dew and hoar frost as most recent dew studies were conducted with devices which have artificial surface e g dew condenser because their main research focused was to increase dew yield for human consumption these substrates largely differ in terms of wetting properties from natural surface and thus might amplify the bias to estimate dew and hoar frost formation for different ecosystems additionally dew condensers often not only quantify the amount of dew but also from dew condensation which complicates to distinguish between different water sources of dew observed with an artificial and natural measurement device however water from soil distillation matters only close to ground under strong humidity and temperature gradients and typically during low wind speed monteith 1957 declarations of

7145,non rainfall events like dew or hoar frost formation are often neglected in the water budget because either assumed to be too small or their determination requires time consuming and difficult measurements these events supply in many dryland ecosystems a substantial amount of water but their role for northern humid ecosystems is largely unknown there is a general need to quantify the ecological relevance for ecosystems of the water amount from dew and hoar frost formation weighable precision lysimeters were used to determine dew and hoar frost formation for a low mountain range and alpine grassland site for the hydrological years 2013 2015 together dew and hoar frost formation ranged on a yearly basis between 42 1 and 67 7 mm which corresponds to 4 2 6 of the total annual amount of precipitation in drier months dew and hoar frost contributed up to 16 1 of total monthly precipitation amount in winter months dew and hoar frost formation contributed up to 38 to the total monthly precipitation amount our investigation suggests that dew and hoar frost formation are of ecological importance during droughts as well as cold periods the amounts and seasonal patterns of dew and hoar frost formation could be predicted relatively well based on standard meteorological variables with the penman monteith equation however our results also showed that the surface energy balance model from penman monteith underestimated the amount of dew and hoar frost during colder periods and specific meteorological site conditions i e high wind speeds at night the mean underestimation between calculated and measured dew and hoar frost on a yearly scale were 63 2 and 16 6 at rollesbroich and gumpenstein respectively dew and hoar frost formation contributes substantially to the water

rainfall water ecological relevance dew hoar frost estimation dew hoar frost 1 introduction dew forms when the temperature of a surface is lower than or equal to the dew point temperature such that water vapour of the ambient air condenses at the colder surface free water on the soil or surface of plants can originate from separate processes we distinguish between i dew formation and direct water vapour adsorption in case that condensed water originate from the atmosphere monteith 1957 ii distillation if the source of water vapour comes from the soil and iii guttation if the water comes from the plant itself singh 2014 however the latter both represent only a redistribution of water within the soil plant atmosphere system and hence do not really contribute to the water balance please note we followed the terminology of agam and berliner 2006 and used in our investigation the term dew formation instead of dew deposition or dewfall this prevents that one may misinterpret from the terms dew deposition or dewfall that droplets of water were formed in the air and not at the surface dew is a natural phenomenon and results from a phase transition between the gaseous and liquid state when moist air comes in contact with a surface agam and berliner 2006 and hence heterogeneous nucleation with a growth of water droplets starts beysens 1995 in case that surface temperature falls below the frost point of the air we can observe the formation of hoar frost rather than dew monteith and unsworth 2013 so dew and hoar frost formation can be seen in the absence of fog and precipitation as a mechanism by which water can be added to the soil plant system the physical phenomena of dew formation is ecologically and biologically important as the non rainfall water directly impact the productivity of mosses and lichens csintalan et al 2000 gauslaa 2014 goetz and price 2016 provide sufficient water for the growth of microbiotic crusts kidron et al 2002 is a major water source for plants in many arid and semi arid regions hanisch et al 2015 guo et al 2016 influence barren landscapes and their micrometeorological conditions by enhancing the moisture cycle of bare soils graf et al 2004 and is in drylands often the only water source for small animals guadarrama cetina et al 2014 wang et al 2017 dew is also from an economical perspective beneficial and improve the water use efficiency of plants ben asher et al 2010 serve in water scarce regions as supplement irrigation demand for reforestation and agriculture tomaszkiewicz et al 2017 can negatively affect yields because they may lead to a spread of plant disease agam and berliner 2006 affect the efficiency of agrochemicals saab et al 2017 and thus impact on crop yield modern dew harvesting can supply water for human consumption and reduce the water scarcity in many parts of the world muselli et al 2009 tomaszkiewicz et al 2015 beysens 2016 some studies emphasized that dew is not a significant component as it contributes only small amounts to the total annual water balance in humid areas malek et al 1999 as such quantities are often an order of magnitude smaller than potential evapotranspiration fluxes monteith and unsworth 2013 thus most studies on dew formation focused on arid and semi arid regions kidron 2000 agam and berliner 2006 because here the impact of non rainfall water can be considered as most significant for the water balance and the survival of various plant species price and clark 2014 but during short periods even small amounts of water from dew formation can be highly beneficial for plants not only for arid regions but also for humid regions xiao et al 2009 only few studies were conducted in humid areas for arable or grassland and the amount of dew was determined with artificial devices e g passive dewfall collector jacobs et al 2008 filter papers hughes and brimblecombe 1994 kabela et al 2009 or dewmeter price and clark 2014 however the properties of these artificial devices differed considerably from those of a natural soil plant system beysens 1995 emphasized that the formation of dew under appropriate atmospheric conditions depends mainly on the temperature and wetting properties of the substrate which control the nucleation rate additionally the wetting properties affect the form and growth of the droplet patterns beysens 1995 also the seasonal development of the land surface will impact the formation of non rainfall water i e dew and hoar frost formation as canopy height thermal regime and the plant as well as soil surface will change thus the dew yield of artificial devices used to collect dew or hoar frost will differ from that of dynamic and heterogeneous natural land surface coverages all mentioned techniques to quantify the amount of dew cannot detect direct adsorption as their artificial surfaces properties are not able to adsorb vapour agam and berliner 2006 at the same time they record not only water from dew formation but also from distillation xiao et al 2009 high precision weighable lysimeters do not have such issues because they are filled with natural soils which can reproduce direct water adsorption and measure at the same time only the formation of dew or hoar frost since the distilled water comes from the lysimeter interior and does not lead to a change of weight earlier lysimeter studies meissner et al 2007 fank 2013 showed that such measuring systems are suitable to detect the formation of dew however the precision of lysimeter measurements and the temporal resolution have to be high enough in order to record such small amounts of water on the land surface recent developments in lysimeter technology improved not only the precision and the temporal resolution of the measurements but also provide a more dynamic and field related flow across the bottom of the lysimeter unold and fank 2008 which is important for the temperature profile in the soil also the recent study from peters et al 2017 showed that not only the measuring system needs certain requirements also the pre and post processing of the noise prone lysimeter balance data is of crucial importance xiao et al 2009 investigated with lysimeters which are located in the central german dry area dryness index 0 92 meissner et al 2009 that the seasonal vegetation cover influences the annual amount and seasonal formation of dew it is still a research gap how much dew and hoar frost formation contributes to the seasonal and annual water balance and how ecologically relevant those amounts are for grasslands under humid climate conditions in this framework our study presents a comparison of annual and seasonal amounts of dew and hoar frost for two distinct grassland sites from austria alpine and germany low mountain range main objectives of our study are 1 to quantify the amount and the temporal distribution of dew and hoar frost formation over a period of two hydrological years for a low mountain range and alpine grassland 2 to estimate the ecological relevance of dew and hoar frost formation for a low mountain range and alpine grassland 3 to evaluate the use of meteorological variables to quantify the seasonal amount of non rainfall water from dew and hoar frost formation 2 material and methods 2 1 site descriptions the study was conducted at two test sites in humid regions see table 1 one is located at the agricultural research and education centre raumberg gumpenstein gs in the enns valley of styria in austria herndl et al 2011 the other site is located in rollesbroich ro in the tereno eifel lower rhine valley observatory in germany p√ºtz et al 2016 at both test sites six weighable lysimeters were established meter group munich germany fig 1 where at gs three lysimeters gs1 gs2 gs6 and at ro six lysimeters ro1 ro6 were used to quantify amounts of water from dew and hoar frost formation beside the lysimeters at gs an agrometeorological station operated by the university of natural resources and life sciences provided standard meteorological data of air temperature air pressure wind speed and relative humidity precipitation was measured with a tipping bucket rain gauge young gwu erftstadt germany the surface temperature was measured since april 2014 at gs with an infrared radiometer sensor si 111 apogee instruments logan usa beside the lysimeters at ro a weather station wxt510 vaisala oyj helsinki finland logged the same meteorological parameters measurements of precipitation were taken from a tipping bucket rain gauge ecotech bonn germany at each station a net radiation sensor lp net07 delta ohm s rl caselle di sevazzano italy was installed above one lysimeter the grassland vegetation at the gs lysimeters is dominated by arrhenatherum elatius and festuca pratensis the management of the grassland during the observation period consisted of three cuts per year where the fertilization was carried out mineral based the plant community of ro was classified according to schubert et al 2001 as ryegrass lolio perennis cynosuretum cristati and the main species are lolium perenne and trifolium repens the grassland vegetation on the lysimeter and the surrounding field is extensively managed with three to four cuts and two to three liquid manure applications 1 6 l m 2 per growing season during the observation period from 2013 11 01 until 2015 10 31 2 2 lysimeter set up the set of lysimeters with 1 m2 surface area and 1 5 m depth each are regularly arranged around a central service well the lysimeters have a controlled bottom boundary condition that enables an upward and downward directed water flux across the lysimeter bottom and ensures that the lysimeter water dynamics are adjusted to observed field dynamics groh et al 2016 the weighing system of the lysimeter and the seepage tank allowed minutely recording water flux changes at a resolution of 10 g 0 01 mm and 1 g 0 001 mm respectively the total weight measured by the lysimeter range in the observation period between 2918 and 3300 kg and 2811 and 3013 kg at ro and gs respectively the measurement accuracy of each lysimeter was routinely checked by a loading and unloading experiment as proposed by nolz et al 2013 the pressure head at the bottom of the lysimeter is controlled and adjusted to measured pressure heads from an undisturbed soil profile nearby all lysimeters consists of a housing area with field identical temperatures unold and fank 2008 hertel and von unold 2014 p√ºtz et al 2016 the

combined with temperature sensors t8 30 at gs ts1 at ro both from meter group munich germany to determine matric potential are 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 m further details of the lysimeter design can be taken from herndl et al 2011 and p√ºtz et al 2016 2 3 quantification of dew and hoar frost formation from lysimeter data the high temporal resolution and high measurement precision of the lysimeter balance systems are the prerequisite to quantify soil water balance components with high resolution and precision on the natural surface grassland and especially dew fog or hoar frost the changes of the lysimeter weight are in general prone to external forces e g exerted by wind management operations or animals hence lysimeter data require an appropriate data processing scheme to reduce the impact of noise and errors on the determination of land surface water fluxes i e precipitation p and evapotranspiration et marek et al 2014 hannes et al 2015 herbrich and gerke 2016 in a first step the raw data underwent an extensive manual and automated plausibility control p√ºtz et al 2016 k√ºpper et al 2017 subsequently a smoothing of lysimeter data was necessary in order to further reduce the impact of noise the awat filter applies an adaptive smoothing window size and an adaptive threshold value to lysimeter weight data to improve the data reliability peters et al 2014 2016 a piecewise cubic hermitian spline interpolation was carried out between anchor points and the 75th percent quantile was used for the implemented snap routine peters et al 2017 this filter has shown to be able to identify precisely even small land surface fluxes e g low et or dew formation peters et al 2017 processed data were finally used to calculate p and et from lysimeter weight changes we assume that no et can occur during p events 1 min interval and hence every increase or decrease in lysimeter mass change can be attribute to p or et respectively a comparison of p measured with weighable lysimeters compared with p measured by rain gauges tipping bucket method tends to differ by up to 22 fank 2013 hoffmann et al 2016 herbrich et al 2017 one reason might be that weighable lysimeters detect p not only as rainfall but also in form of dew fog and hoar frost another part of the difference might be related to evaporation and wind errors of rain gauges richter 1995 graf et al 2014 however during night the influence of evaporation is small and wind speed are in general much lower than at daytime consequently lysimeter data were surveyed for periods with mass increases between sunset and sunrise these periods with mass increases of a lysimeter were subsequently compared with p from a tipping bucket measurement mass increases not concurrent with rain or snow were classified as dew fank and unold 2007 meissner et al 2007 xiao et al 2009 or hoar frost aggregated hourly amounts of dew and hoar frost were limited by the maximum rate of dew formation during clear nights 0 07 mm h 1 monteith and unsworth 1990 furthermore air temperature was used to differentiate between dew and hoar frost formation during times with air temperature below or equal to the freezing point were related to the formation of hoar frost vice versa times with air temperature above zero were attributed to dew formation this approach might lead to a slight overestimation of dew and underestimation of hoar frost since the surface can be frozen under dew conditions positive temperature profile even when the air temperature is somewhat above zero as in many other studies we could not differentiate between dew formation and fog e g brown et al 2008 xiao et al 2009 to disentangle between fog and dew or hoar frost formation further measurements of precipitation droplet size stable water isotopes camera or light transmittance observations could be used meunier and beysens 2016 kaseke et al 2017 to quantify the possible ecological relevance during the above mentioned soil and atmospheric conditions we counted days with dew when the water content in the topsoil 0 0 1 m was below the permanent wilting point and days with hoar frost the soil water content at the permanent wilting point was estimated according to the method proposed by ad hoc arbeitsgruppe boden 2005 from soil texture and bulk density data both can be used as indicators to quantify the ecological relevance of non rainfall events and represent distinct ecological functions dew can be helpful during droughts because the non rainfall water reduces both plant water stress and et the formation of hoar frost can thermally protect the vegetation and reduced the risk of low temperature injuries of plants 2 4 estimation of potential dew and hoar frost from environmental variables dew amounts can be measured with different methods such as dew collector dew condenser eddy covariance observations blotting drosometer and lysimeter richards 2005 meissner et al 2007 kabela et al 2009 muselli et al 2009 guo et al 2016 but there is still no standard procedure and device the same can be said for the estimation of dew and hoar frost from environmental variables there are different approaches to assess the dew and hoar frost formation from meteorological data with i the energy balance ii the turbulent vapour transport iii the bowen ratio energy balance and iiii the penman monteith pm equation neumann 1956 jacobs et al 1990 madeira et al 2001 in general all four methods can be used to quantify dew but differ in terms of needed variables e g soil heat flux or surface temperature the equation of the energy balance turbulent vapour transport and the bowen ratio energy balance require measurements of the surface temperature to estimate dew formation which is usually not a standard meteorological variable hence in our investigation the pm model will be used to assess dew and hoar frost formation the pm equation accounts with its diabatic and adiabatic terms for the transport of energy and vapour within the atmosphere it was applied to study dew formation over a range of different vegetation forms and regions with artificial devices garratt and segal 1988 sudmeyer et al 1994 jacobs et al 1996 jacobs et al 1999 jacobs et al 2000 luo and goudriaan 2000 jacobs et al 2006 jacobs et al 2008 hourly potential dew and hoar frost formation can be estimated by the fao pm equation food and

below the freezing point 3 results and discussion 3 1 amount of dew and hoar frost measured with lysimeters fig 2 a and b illustrate exemplary for one lysimeter the formation of dew and hoar frost overnight and the prevailing meteorological conditions at the lysimeter station in gs subplot a in fig 2 shows the lysimeter weight surface temperature air temperature mean and range and humidity from 2015 09 10 11 am to 2015 09 11 10 am before sunset and after sunrise the lysimeter weight decreased due to et by in total 1 19 mm and both air and surface temperature increased however after sunset the lysimeter weight started to increase from 7 pm 2015 09 10 until 8 am of the following day whereas the temperature of the surface decreased below the dew point temperature of the surrounding air at the same time we assume that the vapour contained in the thin layer of air above the plant starts to condense on the surface and the relative humidity was close to 100 which was visible with a delay from relative humidity measurements at 2 m above the grass canopy the external rain gauge did not detect any rain during this time period under such meteorological conditions the slow increase of lysimeter weight can be related to formation conditions of dew as the air and surface temperature stayed above zero hence the increase in lysimeter weight between sunset and sunrise corresponds to the formation of dew by 0 3 mm in the subplot b from fig 2 the lysimeter weight increased between sunset and sunrise and thus corresponded to the formation of hoar frost as surface and air temperature were below the freezing point of water the hoar frost formation was 0 24 mm during 2014 12 09 4 pm and 2014 12 10 8 pm the average monthly amounts of precipitation dew and hoar formation at gs and ro during two consecutive hydrological years 2013 2014 hy 13 14 and 2014 2015 hy 14 15 are summarized in table 2 the precipitation amount during the first hydrological year 2013 2014 was 1132 2 mm and 1126 9 mm at ro and gs respectively the corresponding amount of dew of 61 9 mm at ro was larger than at gs 52 1 mm the highest monthly amount of dew formation was obtained in november at both test sites dew formation followed at ro in comparison to gs a seasonal pattern with overall higher average monthly amounts of dew during autumn and winter than during spring and summer months the dew formation reached 5 5 and 4 6 of the annual precipitation at the low mountain range and alpine grassland site respectively the spatial variability at the annual scale which was observed between the different lysimeters at the corresponding station was small with respect to measurement accuracy of the system with 4 4 mm at ro and 3 6 mm at gs larger average monthly amounts of hoar frost formation were achieved at both sites between november 2013 and march 2014 the total amount of water from hoar frost during the hy 13 14 was with 5 8 mm and 12 6 mm for ro and gs respectively clearly lower than those from dew but in months with low air temperatures and few p monthly values of hoar frost were up to 7 18 mm dec 2013 which corresponded to nearly 29 of the monthly p amount at test site gs the hoar frost formation contributed with 0 5 ro and 1 1 gs at the annual scale hy 13 14 a rather small amount in comparison to dew however the spatial variability of hoar frost formation with 0 7 mm and 0 5 mm was clearly higher than for dew during the second hydrological year 2014 2015 the precipitation amounts were 1036 8 mm at ro and 991 5 mm at gs and thus were clearly lower than the p for the hy 13 14 at ro the measured amount of dew was higher with 56 9 mm than at gs 38 8 mm and the spatial variability was small with 1 9 mm and 5 2 mm at both sites the highest monthly amount of dew formation in this hy 14 15 was achieved in december at both test sites the average monthly contribution of dew on the p amount reached values between 2 5 15 5 and 1 6 16 3 at ro and gs respectively and showed a seasonal tendency with higher contributions during winter and autumn months in the months january and february 2015 very few or no dew was measured at gs during this time the lysimeter surface was covered with a 15 cm thick snow layer for 40 days and records of lysimeter weight changes were unreliable in hy 14 15 the dew formation reached with 5 5 and 3 9 of the total precipitation similar values than for the hy 13 14 at ro and gs respectively the measured total water amount from hoar frost was 8 5 mm at ro and therefore larger than the year before however at gs hoar frost formation was with 3 3 mm clearly smaller than in hy 13 14 hoar frost amounts reached in december 2014 with 2 57 mm a peak at ro dew formation in ro was in this month also large 6 8 mm and thus both dew and hoar frost contributed together more than 10 of the monthly amount of p the long snow cover in the winter reduced the formation of hoar frost at gs our results are in line with previous studies which showed that dew contributes on a yearly base between 4 5 and 6 9 of the total precipitation for different grassland sites under regional climate conditions in croatia germany and the netherlands jacobs et al 2006 xiao et al 2009 heusinger and weber 2015 dew formation for arid and semi arid climates were reported for various continents e g africa australia south and north america and ranged for different land cover forms from 2 up to 48 of the total precipitation baier 1966 evenari et al 1971 sharma 1976 malek et al 1999 kalthoff et al 2006 hanisch et al 2015 kalthoff et al 2006 reported for an arid valley in chile located south of the hyper arid atacama desert that dew formation which ranged between 5 mm and 10 mm can even reach the dimension of yearly precipitation amounts in extreme dry years it suggests that the contribution of dew on the annual precipitation amount is much larger under drier climatic conditions most studies on non rainfall events were conducted in arid to semi arid regions thus very little data exists on the quantification of water added to soil plant system by hoar frost formation on the yearly basis while hoar frost does not occur during the main vegetation period it can be of ecological relevance for the plant as will be shown in the following section 3 2 ecological relevance of dew and hoar frost the indicator to quantify the ecological relevance of dew formation is summarized in table 3 and describes the average number of days per month with dew during water stress the critical soil water content at the permanent wilting point was set according to texture and bulk density information from the topsoil on 0 22 m3 m 3 and 0 12 m3 m 3 at ro and gs respectively plant water stress can occur in dependence on vegetation type much earlier than at the permanent wilting point but verifying this requires leaf water potential measurements of the grassland ecosystem in the first hydrological year no water stress occurred and hence the ecological relevance of dew was due to relatively humid conditions negligible at both test sites this was also the case for the second hy 14 15 at gs however for ro in months june july and august 2015 5 to 11 days per month were observed where dew occurred during times with water stress in the upper soil layer the standard deviation for those months was relatively high and ranged between 3 and 6 days this suggests that the ecological relevance of dew varied over space this is mainly related to pronounced differences in soil water contents at the same depth in different locations caused by spatial variations in hydraulic parameters and is in line with a study at the catchment scale from a soil moisture sensor network qu et al 2014 the dry conditions in those months agreed well with a large scale investigation which demonstrated that most parts of europe were affected by a drought ionita et al 2016 which was after the exceptional drought in 2003 one of the most severe droughts in the region laaha et al 2016 thus dew is also under humid climate conditions an important water supply during periods of drought when plants have only limited access to available water resources in the effective root zone agam and berliner 2006 ben asher et al 2010 a second ecological function of dew could be a suppression or reduction of transpiration rates during early morning hours which prevents higher water loss due to transpiration especially at times with a high atmospheric et demand during droughts periods a recent study by gerlein safdi et al 2017 confirmed this and showed that dew formation induced suppression of plant transpiration processes of a tropical plant colocasia esculenta the indicator to quantify the ecological relevance of hoar frost formation also is summarized in table 3 and describes the days with hoar frost for hoar frost table 3 shows that during november until april depending on the seasonal meteorological conditions average monthly days with hoar frost ranged between 1 and 13 days at ro and between 1 and 24 days at gs on the annual scale we can see that in hy 13 14 on more than 52 and 82 days and in hy 14 15 on 67 and 41 days hoar frost at ro and gs respectively during the formation process of hoar frost white frost heat is released when liquid water vapour freezes to ice on the plant surface and thus naturally protected plant tissues from freezing and causes less damage on plants than the so called black frost which forms under drier atmospheric air conditions snyder et al 2005 pessarakli 2014 the lower values of days with hoar frost in gs hy 14 15 can be explained by the closed snow cover in january and february which provides in addition to hoar frost an optimal insulation from lethal freezing temperatures thorsen et al 2010 our study results indicate that dew and hoar frost formation fulfils an important ecological function for grassland and thus might be of ecological relevance during periods of drought and wintertime but further plant specific observations are of need to directly quantify the ecological relevance and impact of non rainfall water on the development of plant communities and their functional traits 3 3 comparison of actual and potential dew and hoar frost formation fig 3 depicts the measured and estimated monthly amounts of dew and hoar frost formation at both test sites estimates of potential dew achieved values of 25 0 mm and 17 3 mm at ro and 38 7 mm and 32 2 mm at gs for the hy 13 14 and hy 14 15 thus the pm model underestimated the formation of dew on average on a yearly scale by 64 4 38 0 mm and 22 0 10 4 mm at ro and gs respectively the seasonal patterns of dew formation were captured well at both sites with the pm model see fig 3 a and c an underestimation of potential dew formation at gs by the pm model was notable for november 2013 and during the months january until may for ro we observed a general underestimation of dew by the pm model this was more pronounced during autumn to winter sondjf than in spring to summer months mamjja the larger deviations during this period of time at the test site ro might be related to nighttime transpiration the average diurnal cycle of pet during both periods is depicted in fig 4 for both sites decreasing surface temperature radiative cooling combined with sufficient moisture in the air in the night with a small adiabatic term results in negative values of pet which indicate the formation of dew asce ewri 2005 this is more pronounced during spring to summer mamjja because of higher radiative cooling clear nights fewer clouds and the fact that vapour holding capacity of air increases exponentially with air temperature thus average hourly pet rates during the vegetation period mamjja are much lower than during autumn and winter time sondjf see fig 4 dew formation started at both sites during period mamjja in the late evening 8pm and lasted until early morning hours 5pm however for the autumn to winter period sondjf pet during nighttime showed only at the gs tests site the formation of dew or hoar frost the corresponding values of pet during night at ro were on average above zero and predicted the occurrence of nighttime pet recent investigations with lysimeters at ro nevertheless confirmed the occurrence of nighttime et however investigation also reveals that larger nighttime pet rates are related to relative high wind speeds during night in periods sondjf on average 3 m s 1 which consequently enlarged the adiabatic term and exceeded the diabatic component in the pm equation this suggests that the pm model tends to underestimate dew formation at test sites with large wind speeds at night the estimates of potential hoar frost achieved on average 3 3 mm and 9 1 mm at the annual scale at ro and gs respectively the seasonal monthly tendency was captured well for both sites with the pm model however single months especially at the beginning of november until december showed a clear underestimation of hoar frost with the pm model for the second hydrological year the pm model showed an overestimation by in total 4 4 mm at gs this can be related mainly to missing information on hoar frost formation during the time from january until february 2015 where the lysimeter surface was covered by snow thus our results showed that the pm model is in general able to capture well the seasonal tendency of dew and hoar frost formation at both sites but our investigation also demonstrates that the pm model underestimated dew and hoar frost formation during colder time of the year and under specific meteorological conditions like high wind speeds at night 4 summary and outlook our analysis provides observations of dew and hoar frost formation for two distinct grassland ecosystems at a low mountain range and alpine site over two consecutive hydrological years the dew and hoar frost formation ranged between 42 1 and 67 7 mm which corresponds to 4 2 6 0 of the precipitation on a yearly basis seasonal patterns of dew and hoar frost amounts were in general larger during autumn and winter months in winter months with lower precipitation events dew and hoar frost formation contributed together substantially to the total monthly precipitation amount up to 38 moreover our investigation showed that dew was an ecologically important source of water during periods of drought when plants had only a limited access on water resources in the effective root zone during colder periods of the year hoar frost formation took over an ecological function at both grassland sites as it thermally protected crops and thus potentially reduced the risk of low temperature injuries of plants the estimates of potential dew and hoar frost formation with the pm model were underestimated but showed in general promising results to capture the observed seasonal patterns and amount of additional precipitation water the mean underestimation between calculated and measured dew and hoar frost on a yearly scale were 63 2 and 16 6 at rollesbroich and gumpenstein respectively using the pm model might thus enable to account for dew and hoar frost at large scales e g catchment landscape continents however the pm model underestimated dew and hoar frost formation during colder periods and specific meteorological conditions i e high wind speeds at night the study revealed that dew and hoar frost formation contribute substantially to the water budgets of a low mountain range and alpine grassland site non rainfall water can be of relevance when quantifying water budget components at larger scales as it might impact the transport of contaminants transit time nutrient budgets alter et change the water use efficiency and consequently affect the seasonal crop growth the urgency to account for such water fluxes is even more important for studies in arid semiarid regions where water scarcity often occurs during the year and which might be more sensitive to climate variability and climate change recent investigations for the mediterranean region indicate that climate change will lead to a substantial reduction of dew yields and thus amplify water scarcity tomaszkiewicz et al 2016 this demonstrates the overall importance to precisely quantify low precipitation fluxes such as dew and hoar frost formation in the water and nutrient cycling of ecosystems especially in the context of climate change and occurrence of droughts however there is still a lack of information how different vegetation types and soils affect the formation of dew and hoar frost as most recent dew studies were conducted with devices which have artificial surface e g dew condenser because their main research focused was to increase dew yield for human consumption these substrates largely differ in terms of wetting properties from natural surface and thus might amplify the bias to estimate dew and hoar frost formation for different ecosystems additionally dew condensers often not only quantify the amount of dew but also from dew condensation which complicates to distinguish between different water sources of dew observed with an artificial and natural measurement device however water from soil distillation matters only close to ground under strong humidity and temperature gradients and typically during low wind speed monteith 1957 declarations of

7146,using data from 22 catchments in northern finland this study demonstrates how runoff prediction in ungauged high latitude catchments can be improved using simplified conceptual models tailored to readily available data in the region the newly developed current precipitation index cpisnow model provides a parsimonious tool to predict streamflow in data limited high latitude regions use of current precipitation index cpi and runoff coefficient formulation in the soil moisture and response routine conceptualization makes soil moisture and response routine parameters in the model identifiable with catchment properties influencing storage evapotranspiration and infiltration losses most of the model parameters showed a significant relationship with observable physical catchment properties climate properties or both this made it easier to estimate the values of the model parameters in an ungauged catchment with minimal uncertainty the parameter functional relationships derived with catchment attributes produced equally good model results when applied to independent test catchments inclusion of snow water equivalent records and use of multiple objective functions for both snow water equivalent and runoff simulations in the model optimization process helped reduce the effect of parameter equifinality thereby making it easier to determine the optimal parameter values ranges of parameter values are proposed for the cpisnow model in relation to key observable catchment characteristics in the boreal zone enabling application of the model in ungauged catchments

data demand bergstr√∂m 1991 bl√∂schl et al 2013 runoff prediction in ungauged catchments in these regions relies on model parameter regionalization through functional relationships to catchment attributes however because of the complex structure of most conceptual models previous attempts to relate conceptual model parameters to catchment attributes have yielded mixed results due to the effects of parameter non uniqueness and equifinality caused by model over parameterization magette et al 1976 hughes 1989 servat and dezetter 1993 ibrahim and cordery 1995 post and jakeman 1996 sefton and howarth 1998 seibert 1999 over parameterization is often the result of a model structure requiring more input information than can be derived from available input data bergstr√∂m 1991 van der linden and woo 2003 gupta et al 2012 ghasemizade et al 2015 shin et al 2015 chang et al 2017 beven 1989 2012 and bergstr√∂m 1991 suggest that a simple model with a small number of parameters good numerical implementation and less data demand would eliminate the problem of over parameterization moreover beven 2012 suggested that 3 5 parameters should be sufficient to reproduce most of the information in hydrological records the predominant linearity in the response of watersheds jakeman and hornberger 1993 indicates that rainfall runoff models with only a small number of conceptual storage units will satisfactorily reproduce observed runoff records over a wide range of catchment scales kokkonen and jakeman 2001 achieved more accurate reproduction of measured runoff with a simple conceptualized model than a highly conceptualized model they concluded that substantial conceptualization of complex hydrological processes is not justified if only rainfall runoff data are available this is because more complexity requires several types of data such as soil profile groundwater position etc and higher information content for the model to achieve good performance in addition studies by e g perrin et al 2001 val√©ry et al 2014a b orth et al 2015 and chang et al 2017 have shown benefits from model simplification in previous work akanegbu et al 2017 we developed a robust and simple hydrological model cpisnow for streamflow prediction in seasonally snow covered high latitude regions based on the principle of current precipitation index smakhtin and masse 2000 in the present study we investigated the effect of simplified linear conceptualization of the soil moisture and response routine in cpisnow on its parameter uniqueness and identification with observable catchment descriptors our main focus was to test the efficiency of the model in predicting streamflow from ungauged high latitude catchments using functional relationships between its parameters and observable catchment attributes the hypotheses tested were that i since the response routine in the cpisnow model is conceptualized based on the principles of current precipitation index and runoff coefficients its response routine parameters can be determined by observable catchment descriptors that influence evapotranspiration and infiltration losses in the catchment and ii since the cpisnow model uses only one soil moisture routine parameter to account for low flow conditions in the catchment the parameter will be identifiable with catchment properties that regulate baseflow in the catchment such as lake percentage and slope an additional aim was to produce a range of parameter values for the cpisnow model in high latitude regions in relation to easily obtainable catchment physical and climate attributes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study was conducted using 22 forested boreal catchments located in finland fig 1 a set of 14 catchments with snow water equivalent records was used for model parameter optimization and parameter uniqueness evaluation while the remaining eight catchments were used as independent catchments to test the performance of the established functional relationships between model parameters and observable catchment characteristics in mock ungauged high latitude catchments three catchments in southern finland were included in order to ensure that differences in climate between the upper north and lower north were captured the area of the catchments ranges from 13 62 to 3814 km2 table 1 the dominant land use in the catchments is forest covering 50 of the area the catchments have relatively flat topography with the mean elevation difference being 195 m a s l and a shallow water table around 3 5 m below the surface finnish environmental institute 2017 the surface lithology of the catchments with the exception of myllym√§ki ylijoki and laanioja is mainly basal till which occupies over 40 of the land area the surface lithology in myllym√§ki is mainly fine marine sediment while that in ylijoki and laanioja is mainly hummock moraine and migmatitic metapelite respectively geological survey of finland database superficial deposits are on average 10 m thick and storage units in the catchments are mainly lakes and peatlands climate conditions in the region are humid with an aridity index of 0 7 0 9 mean annual air temperature is 1 5 c in the south and 0 to 2 c in the north while mean annual precipitation is 600 700 mm in the south and 400 550 mm in the north finnish meteorological institute 2017a mean snow depth at the end of march is 5 40 cm in the south and 60 80 cm in the north finnish meteorological institute 2017b the catchments used in the study were selected based on availability of long term runoff records snow line records and meteorological data precipitation and temperature data used in the study were national 10 km 10 km interpolated gridded temperature and precipitation data from the finnish meteorological institute the snow course data and runoff data used were obtained from the finnish environmental institute s open database oiva the snow line measurement points used in the study were either located inside the study catchments or 10 km from the catchment divide daily runoff from the catchments was measured using water stage recorders and weirs for smaller sites as described in seuna and linjama 2004 and discharge rating curves for defined channel cross sections for larger sites and were checked for errors by the finnish environmental institute 2 2 cpisnow model the cpisnow model was developed by akanegbu et al 2017 for use in high latitude regions where snowmelt is the dominant hydrological process controlling runoff and hydrological data are limited it is very similar to the hbv model bergstr√∂m 1976 1992 seibert 1999 in the snow and routing routines however instead of using a soil box and storage boxes in the soil moisture and response routines as in hbv cpisnow uses a modified form of the current precipitation index equation by smakhtin and masse 2000 to transform precipitation into runoff hydrograph form akanegbu et al 2017 see appendix fig a1 the transformed precipitation is converted to runoff using two runoff conversion parameters c t and lf for the winter spring and summer autumn period respectively akanegbu et al 2017 fig a1 the converted runoff is routed out using the same routing routine parameter maxbas as in the hbv model the snow routine in the cpisnow model is controlled using five parameters t crit ddf cfr tsf f and s corr the soil moisture routine is controlled using only one parameter th q while the response routine is controlled using three parameters k r c t and lf an input modifier p corr is used to correct for errors in precipitation input data for a detailed description of the cpisnow model algorithm and parameters see akanegbu et al 2017 and the appendix fig a1 2 3 evaluation of parameter catchment attribute relationships 2 3 1 identification of runoff control factors the first step towards evaluation of the model s parameter relationships with catchment attributes was to identify catchment physical and climate characteristics which could have a profound effect on the cpisnow model parameters in order to fulfil the objectives of the study only physical catchment data and catchment climate information measurable in ungauged basins without extensive site investigation were considered based on the structure of the cpisnow model the physical catchment characteristics considered were catchment surface area sa km2 land use forest fst agriculture agr peatland ptl mean slope mslp mean slope of the highest order stream channel stslp Œ∏ lake percentage lk and outlet lake percentage o lk table 1 the catchment climate characteristics considered were average total annual precipitation tot p mm a average summer autumn total annual precipitation totsa p mm a average winter spring total annual precipitation totws p mm a snow day ratio sdr and warm dry day index wd d the snow day ratio is defined as the number of days that experience precipitation when the average daily air temperature is below 2 c divided by the total number of days per year with precipitation sawicz et al 2011 the warm dry day index is defined as number of days with air temperature 5th percentile of daily mean air temperature and precipitation 25th percentile of daily amounts arsenoviƒá et al 2013 the 75th percentile air temperature and 25th percentile daily precipitation were calculated from 22 years 1990 2011 average daily air temperature and precipitation in finland the highest order stream was taken to be the main stream channel leading to the outlet into which other lower order channels drain fig 2 the outlet lake was regarded as any lake that cuts across the highest order stream channel as shown in fig 2 and the lake coverage in each catchment was determined from corine land use data from finnish environmental institute database using arcgis the average slope mslp of the catchments was calculated using a digital elevation map dem derived index characterizing typical hillslopes while the average slope of the highest order stream channel was calculated as mean gradient from elevation differences in the main stream channel the summer autumn period was defined to run from june 20 to october 20 while the winter spring period was defined to run from october 21 to june 19 these seasonal periods were defined based on their average duration in finland finnish meteorological institute 2017c 2 3 2 model calibration and parameter optimization procedure after identification of daily runoff control factors the next step was calibration and optimization of model parameters for each of the study catchments this was done using the monte carlo sampling scheme with a set of objective functions that evaluate the efficiency of the model on different aspects of the stream hydrograph and snow line in order to minimize the effect of climate variability on model calibrations and model parameter comparisons between catchments the same number of years was used for both calibration and validation of the models in each of the study catchments the calibration period was 1990 2000 and the validation period 2001 2011 model calibration was carried out using a one stage approach snow water equivalent and runoff were calibrated simultaneously using multiple objective functions for both the snow water equivalent and runoff performance evaluation this allowed us to evaluate the uniqueness of the model parameters and inter dependence between the snow routine parameters and other model parameters the prior parameter space for the cpisnow model was selected based on a previous study in finland using the model akanegbu et al 2017 uniform distribution of the parameters within the prior parameter space was assumed and 5000 runs of the monte carlo sampling scheme were performed after which range between the minimum and the maximum parameter sets with acceptable objective function values were selected as the posterior parameter space the posterior parameter space was repeatedly used as the prior parameter space to run the monte carlo procedure until an insignificant difference between the cumulative distribution of the prior and posterior parameter space was achieved the parameter sets with acceptable objective functions were evaluated for uniqueness using dotty plots the best fit parameter sets were taken as the parameter sets with the highest combined objective functions each of the best fit parameter sets generated was then validated using the validation period 2000 2011 after which the optimal parameter set was selected as the best fit parameter set with best model performance in both the calibration and validation periods the objective functions appendix table a1 used for selection of the posterior parameter space best fit parameters for both simulated runoff and simulated snow water equivalent swe were nash sutcliffe model efficiency eff and natural logarithm of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency eff log krause et al 2005 akanegbu et al 2017 in addition the coefficient of determination r 2 and absolute volume error ve abs were used seibert 1999 2005 the cpisnow conceptual model was applied to the study and test catchments while keeping its less sensitive parameters cfr 0 05 f 0 03 tsf 0 5 constant as recommended by akanegbu et al 2017 the input modifier p corr was also kept at a constant value 1 1 typical for scandinavian conditions smhi 2013 2 3 3 evaluation of parameter functional relationship after generating optimal model parameters for each of the study catchments functional relationships between the optimal model parameters and catchment physical and climate characteristics were examined this was done by first fitting two parameter regression functions linear exponential power and log to the relationships as done by seibert 1999 multi regression analysis was then performed to determine whether there was a co relationship between a parameter and multiple catchment characteristics the significance of relationships was evaluated using a two tailed significance test p value and pearson s linear correlation coefficient of determination r 2 fitting different two parameter regression functions to the relationships ensured that relationships with the highest correlation r2 0 5 was selected as the parameter functional relationship a relationship was deemed significant at p 0 05 and r2 0 5 the performance of the functional relationships established was assessed by applying them to the independent test catchments and evaluating the model performance for those catchments this allowed the ability of the functional relationships to produce equally good results in catchments that had no influence on their derivation to be evaluated performance evaluation was based on the objective functions used in the optimization procedure for parameters where a significant relationship with catchment characteristics could not be established the median parameter value for all study catchments was used in performance evaluation of the relationship functions 3 results 3 1 model performance good daily runoff simulations and swe simulations with model efficiency criteria eff eff log r 2 0 5 were achieved with the cpisnow model in most of the study catchments in both the calibration and validation period fig 3 the only exceptions were mustajoki sc5 nuorittajoki sc8 and ylijoki sc14 catchments where efflog 0 5 was achieved fig 4 the margins of absolute volume error in the calibration period were 0 013 0 141 for runoff and 0 018 0 3 for the swe simulation while the margins of error in the validation period were 0 004 0 445 for runoff and 0 001 0 29 for swe fig 3 evaluation of the prior parameter space distribution from the monte carlo sampling scheme with dotty plots showed that the calibrated parameters of the cpisnow model were identifiable with distinct optimal peak figs 5 and 6 the dotty plots of the model objective functions against sampled parameter values revealed that while the snow routine parameters influenced the efficiencies of the runoff simulation the soil moisture response routine and routing routine parameters had no influence on the efficiency of the swe simulation in addition the dotty plots showed the identifiability of each model parameter with the four objective functions eff eff log r 2 ve abs used for runoff and swe optimization the t crit parameter was identifiable with eff eff log and r 2 of runoff simulation but not with ve abs whereas it was identifiable with eff eff log r 2 and ve abs of the swe simulation a similar trend was observed for the ddf parameter with the exception that it was not identifiable with ve abs of the swe simulation the s corr parameter was identifiable with eff and eff log of the runoff simulation and eff eff log and ve abs of the swe simulation but only mildly identifiable with r 2 and ve abs of the runoff simulation and r 2 of the swe simulation none of the soil moisture accounting response routine and routing routine parameters had any influence on the efficiency of the swe simulation fig 6 the th q parameter was mostly identifiable with eff log and mildly identifiable eff of the runoff simulation but was not identifiable with r 2 and ve abs of the runoff simulation the k r parameter was strongly identifiable with eff eff log and ve abs of the runoff simulation and mildly identifiable with r 2 a similar trend was observed with the c t and lf parameters maxbas was the least identifiable parameter in the model showing only mild identification with eff and eff log and no identifiability with r 2 and ve abs of the runoff simulation fig 5 the optimal parameter set realized from model optimization in each of the study catchments showed less deviation in parameter values between catchments except for the th q and maxbas parameters for which there was higher deviation between catchments table 2 evaluation with the posterior parameter distribution revealed parameter inter dependency between k r and c t and between k r and lf with linear correlation coefficient of determination r2 0 5 fig 7 other parameters showed no significant collinearity with each other the c t and lf parameter values tended to decrease with increasing k r fig 7 3 2 model parameter relationship with catchment characteristics all the calibrated cpisnow model parameters with the exception of s corr displayed varying degrees of linear or multilinear relatedness r 2 0 5 p 0 05 with some physical and climate characteristics of the catchments considered in the study the snow routine parameter t crit and ddf displayed a significant linear relationship with snow day ratio sdr r 2 0 55 p 0 003 and forest percentage fst r 2 0 51 p 0 004 respectively fig 8 t crit decreased with increasing sdr while ddf decreased with increasing fst significant linear relationships were found between the soil moisture routine parameter th q and catchment outlet lake percentage o lk and lake percentage lk however the correlation coefficient of determination r 2 0 77 and level of significance p 0 000 were higher between thq and o lk than between th q and lk r 2 0 64 p 0 001 the th q value increased with higher outlet lake and lake percentage the response routine parameters k r and c t but not lf showed a significant linear relationship r 2 0 80 p 0 000 and r 2 0 82 p 0 000 with catchment lake percentage lk fig 8 however with multi linear regression analysis a significant multi linear relationship r 2 0 55 p 0 012 was found between lk warm dry day index wd and the lf parameter table 2 the routing routine parameter maxbas showed a significant linear relationship r 2 0 58 p 0 002 with lk with the exception of the lf parameter no significant multi linear relationship was found between the catchment characteristics studied and other model parameters t crit ddf s corr th q k r c t maxbas in addition other parametric regression fitting exponential power and log produced no significant relationship between the model parameters and the catchment characteristics studied the functional relationships derived from the parameter catchment characteristics relationships are presented in table 2 while the recommended regional parameter ranges for applying the cpisnow model in ungauged high latitude catchments are presented in table 3 given that the catchments used in this study differ insignificantly in terms of land use and topography effects of catchment slope and differences in land use on the model parameters were not observed in our analysis however these catchment characteristics need to be taken into account when applying the recommended parameter range further studies with more heterogeneous catchments are needed in order to quantify how these catchment characteristics influence the cpisnow model parameters 3 3 evaluation of parameter functional relationship performance the daily runoff and swe simulations with parameter functional relationships on the independent test catchments fig 11 showed that the cpisnow model performed satisfactorily fig 9 the functional relationships produced satisfactory model objective functions for runoff eff 0 57 0 83 eff log 0 50 0 70 r 2 0 62 0 83 in all the independent test catchments but in sonkajarvi lamujoki uva and laanioja catchments poor eff log 0 34 0 47 was obtained fig 10 swe was simulated with model efficiency eff 0 52 0 94 eff log 0 64 0 82 and r 2 0 80 0 95 which was better than runoff prediction in the independent test catchments the absolute volume error ve abs obtained with the functional relationships was within the range 0 02 0 37 in runoff simulation and 0 01 0 50 in swe simulation comparing model efficiencies achieved with parameter functional relationships with model efficiencies achieved with median of optimal parameter sets from the study sites shows that parameter functional relationships gave better overall model efficiency than median of optimal parameters from calibration catchments figs 12 and 13 in runoff simulation the median of optimal parameter sets produced less eff eff log and r 2 efficiencies in the test catchments with the exceptions of the suolij√§rvi catchment tc5 fig 12a and c and uva catchment tc4 fig 12b were higher efficiencies were obtained than with parameter functional relationships the absolute volume error ve abs increased with the use of median of optimal parameter sets except in uva tc4 and laanioja tc7 catchments where lower ve abs was achieved using the median of optimal parameter sets similar trend was observed in the swe simulation in the test catchments using median of optimal parameter sets except in the eff log criterion where median of optimal parameter sets gave better performance in four of the test catchments fig 13b 4 discussion this study demonstrated the efficiency of the newly developed cpisnow model in simulating runoff from ungauged high latitude catchments where snowmelt runoff is substantial finding a suitable level of model complexity that matches available data and spatial and temporal scales at which major hydrological processes occur in high latitude regions is vital for runoff prediction in ungauged catchments dotting the region van der linden and woo 2003 as climate change will be rapid at high latitudes it is particularly important to understand hydrological processes and predict changes in this region bl√∂schl and montanari 2010 therefore robust models with unique parameters that can be estimated from observable catchment attributes are urgently needed the cpisnow model presented in this study provides a simplified and less data demanding tool to simulate runoff in various boreal and sub arctic catchments to our knowledge this is the first study to report the benefit of using a simplified conceptual hydrological model structure to allow for model parameter estimation based on catchment and climate attributes as the model is designed for ungauged catchments it can be used to estimate runoff based on easily identified catchment and climate properties 4 1 simplified conceptualization improves parameter uniqueness good performance was achieved with the cpisnow model in both the calibration and validation periods figs 3 and 4 this confirms the assertion by beven 1989 that predicting the discharge response to rainfall events should not be difficult since all that is needed is a loss function and a routing function as noted by hornberger et al 1985 attempts to represent all hydrological processes relevant in catchment daily runoff responses often create a risk of parameter non uniqueness which makes model parameters less identifiable from our parameter uniqueness evaluation it is clear that all the soil routine response routine and routing routine parameters in the cpisnow model are highly identifiable with distinct optimal peaks this is because the cpisnow model utilizes simple lost functions and a routing function which reduces the number of inter dependent parameters in the model thereby reducing the potential for parameter equifinality most of the parameters in the cpisnow model show no inter dependency the only exceptions are the c t and lf parameters which show inter dependence with the k r parameter fig 7 although the potential for equifinality exists with the k r c t and lf parameters their range of possible values is narrow k r 0 85 0 98 c t 0 02 0 15 lf 0 01 0 09 fedora and beschta 1989 smakhtin and masse 2000 akanegbu et al 2017 which helps to constrain their parameter space in addition the recommendations on possible values of k r in relation to storage properties of the catchment such as lake percentage fedora and beschta 1989 smakhtin and masse 2000 akanegbu et al 2017 help to determine possible values of k r in relation to the catchment under study this further constrains the prior parameter space another aspect of the model that helps reduce the scope for parameter equifinality is the use of multiple objective functions for calibration of both runoff and swe this allows the sensitivity of each of the model parameters on different aspects of the stream hydrograph to be taken into account while selecting the posterior parameter space as can be seen from the dotty plots of parameter reactiveness to the model s four objective functions figs 5 and 6 the parameters react differently to each of these functions some of the model parameters are sensitive to high flows while some are only sensitive to low flows as noted by krause et al 2005 using only one objective function for hydrological model assessment often results in poor identification of agreement between observed and simulated runoff in all aspects of the stream hydrograph for instance from our results it was clear that the snow routine t crit ddf and s corr and response routine k r c t and lf parameters showed identification with the eff objective function whereas the soil routine parameter th q showed only a mild reaction to the eff function but was more identifiable with the eff log function fig 5 this demonstrates that using only the eff objective function for the posterior parameter space selection would have resulted in equifinality of the th q parameter since a wide range of th q values would have given an acceptable eff value another efficiency criterion that could help in determining the optimal parameter sets is the benchmark efficiency be garrick et al 1978 wmo 1986 schaefli and gupta 2007 though not used in this study the benchmark efficiency uses inter annual mean value of observed runoff for every calendar day as a reference unlike nash sutcliffe efficiency eff which uses observed period of record mean value as a reference this gives the be greater advantage over eff in evaluating the explanatory power of the model than already contained in the seasonality of the driving forces schaefli and gupta 2007 the be criterion could help in determining the optimal values for the k r c t and lf parameters in the cpisnow model since these parameters controls the daily runoff fluctuation patterns in the catchment the strong reactiveness of the th q parameter to the eff log objective function was expected since this parameter handles baseflow in the catchment i e the low flows and the eff log objective function is known to be more effective in reflecting the influence of low flows in model assessment krause et al 2005 the non reactiveness of the snow routine parameters t crit and ddf to ve abs of the runoff simulation fig 5 was also expected since these parameters only determine the timing of snowmelt and do not influence the volume difference between simulated and observed runoff the s corr parameter on the other hand corrects the volume of accumulated snow in the catchment which in turn affects the volume of simulated runoff furthermore by calibrating swe and runoff simultaneously with the four objective functions satisfactory prediction of both was ensured this helped to reduce the number of possible good fit parameters since incorrect compensation between the snow routine parameters and the soil routine response routine and routing routine parameters was minimized the lack of reactiveness of the soil routine response routine and routing routine parameters to performance efficiency of the swe simulation shows that parameter compensation in the model is one directional while the swe parameters can adjust to improve the efficiency of the runoff simulation the soil routine response routine and routing routine parameters cannot adjust to influence the efficiency of the swe simulation figs 5 and 6 4 2 simplified conceptualization increases parameter identification with catchment attributes from the results it is clear that the highly lumped nature of the cpisnow model resulted in its soil moisture routine and response routine parameters being identifiable with catchment physical characteristics unlike similar models such as hbv which uses soil moisture boxes and storage boxes to control baseflow from the catchment the cpisnow model uses one parameter th q to account for baseflow in the catchment thus the th q parameter in the cpisnow model is highly sensitive to any catchment characteristics with a profound influence on low flows from the catchment the linear relationship found between catchment outlet lake percentage o lk and the th q parameter is justified because o lk influences the volume of low flows from the catchment the response routine structure of the cpisnow model is conceptualized using a simple runoff coefficient like equation akanegbu et al 2017 and a recession coefficient fedora and beschta 1989 smakhtin and masse 2000 whereas in the hbv model storage boxes are used with this approach in the cpisnow model the evaporation infiltration and storage losses in the water balance equation are lumped into two runoff coefficients c t and lf for the winter spring and summer autumn period respectively while the response rate of the catchment is controlled by the recession coefficient parameter k r this makes these parameters highly identifiable with catchment characteristics such as lake percentage lk and warm dry day index wd that control evapotranspiration storage capacity and infiltration capacity in the catchment in the results the c t parameter displayed a linear relationship with lk but no relationship with wd while the lf parameter displayed a multi linear relationship with both of these catchment characteristics the reason for c t not displaying a relationship with wd is that evaporation is minimal during winter spring in high latitude regions dankers and christensen 2005 typically the main factor governing runoff processes during this period is snowmelt quinton and roulet 1998 the value of the c t and lf parameters decreased with increasing lk because lakes play a major role in water storage in high latitude catchments spence 2000 the lf parameter also decreased with an increase in wd because of the influence of evaporation during summer autumn catchments with higher wd values generally displayed lower values of lf compared with catchments with lower wd values this is because higher wd indicates higher evapotranspiration rate and higher infiltration capacity which in turn will decrease the fraction of precipitation coming as runoff the linear relationship found between the recession coefficient k r and lk was expected since k r controls the daily runoff response rate in the cpisnow response routine and the presence of lakes in catchments induces a damping effect on daily catchment runoff response to rainfall gibson et al 2002 the linear relationships observed between the snow routine parameter ddf and catchment forest percentage confirms findings by seibert 1999 using the hbv model and by e g troendle and king 1985 and lundberg and halldin 1994 in experimental studies although seibert 1999 was unable to establish a relationship between catchment characteristics and critical temperature t crit in the cpisnow model here t crit was found to decrease with increasing catchment snow day ratio sdr since the snow day ratio indicates the amount of snow storage in the catchment it can be expected to have a profound effect on snow routine parameters such as t crit however we cannot explain why the value of t crit decreased with increasing snow accumulation in the catchment seibert 1999 observed a linear relationship between the snow correction parameter s corr and catchment forest percentage whereas we found no relationship between s corr and forest percentage or any of the catchment characteristics studied the reason might be that the catchments included in our study do not differ greatly in terms of forest percentage the significant linear relationship found between the routing routine parameter maxbas and lake percentage was expected since maxbas controls delays in catchment daily runoff response and lakes have damping and storage effects on catchment daily runoff response in addition the presence of lakes increases evaporation rates in the catchment thereby damping the runoff response further marsh and bigras 1988 rovansek et al 1996 bowling and lettenmaier 2010 bring et al 2016 as seen from the results catchments with a higher lake percentage displayed higher values of maxbas while catchments with lower lake percentage displayed lower values seibert 1999 observed similar trend with maxbas in the hbv model 4 3 parameter functional relationships produce satisfactory model efficiencies in general the cpisnow model showed satisfactory model performance when established parameter functional relationships from the study catchments were applied to the mock ungauged independent test catchments the poor performance of the parameter functional relationships on the eff log criteria might be because of insufficient number of catchments with larger outlet lake percentage in our study sample this might have affected the functional relationship derived from the th q relationship to outlet lake percentage in addition giving that the model conceptualization is based on current precipitation index the performance of the model in reflecting the daily fluctuations in runoff response might be affected be inter annual climate variations thereby affecting the model performance on eff log criterion the catchments included in the study were selected based on the availability of long term runoff and snow water equivalent records in the catchment these criteria limited our ability to avoid potential sampling bias that might result from under representation of catchments with particular characteristics since not many catchments had the required hydrological data irrespective of the potential bias in catchment sampling the parameter catchment characteristic functional relationships derived produced runoff and swe simulations that were in close agreement with the observed data however further analysis is needed with sample catchments from other snow dominated high latitude regions with more heterogeneous relief in order to be able to establish a more robust statistical relationship between the model parameter and catchment attributes on a global scale this will allow for development of a comprehensive list of model parameter range with respect to each catchment and climatic characteristics which will make the application of the model in ungauged catchments across the high latitude regions easier the benefit of using catchment attributes to estimate the model parameters can be seen from the comparison of the model performance in the test catchments when median of optimal parameter sets from calibration catchments were used and when parameter functional relationships with catchments attributes were used the comparison showed that in general even with the near homogeneous nature of the catchments used in the study the parameter functional relationships produced better model efficiencies in the test catchments than the median optimal parameter sets given that the main component of the model apart from the snow routine phase is the response routine phase the cpisnow model can easily be applied in catchments where there is limited information on the underlying characteristics since the estimated values of the response routine parameters k r c t and lf can be derived from observable catchment physical and climate characteristics table 3 furthermore estimates of monthly or daily evapotranspiration are not required as input data in the cpisnow model which makes it more robust in high latitude regions where hydrological data are lacking 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the efficiency of the cpisnow model in predicting runoff from ungauged high latitude catchments the simplified linear conceptualization of the model using current precipitation index and runoff coefficient formulations makes its response routine parameters unique and they exhibit clear relationships with observable catchment attributes in addition the use of one lumped parameter in the soil moisture routine makes the parameter identifiable with catchment lake and outlet lake percentage which regulate baseflow this makes it easier to estimate the values of the model parameters in ungauged catchments from observable catchment characteristics one novel feature in the model is the inclusion of objective functions for snow water equivalent records in the model calibration and optimization process which helps constrain the parameter space and improves parameter identification by reducing parameter inter dependency in addition the use of multiple performance criteria for calibration of both catchment snow water equivalent and runoff ensures that the performance of the model on every aspect of the hydrograph is evaluated before selecting the optimal parameter set this helps reduce the problem of parameter equifinality during the optimization process apart from the snow correction parameter s corr functional relationships were established for all the calibrated cpisnow model parameters using simple regression analysis the high rate of identification of the response routing parameters k r c t and lf in the cpisnow model to catchment storage attributes shows that the runoff response in high latitude catchments is mainly linear and a lumped loss function parameter is thus more visible than loss functions represented by storage boxes the good performance achieved with the parameter functional relationships derived in the mock ungauged independent test catchments shows that this model can easily be applied in ungauged catchments by using simple functional relationships between the parameters and catchment physical and climate characteristics additionally given that the dominant factors controlling daily runoff response in high latitude regions are snowmelt precipitation temperature and lakes the cpisnow model can be a valuable tool in runoff modeling in these regions since clear functional relationships exist between its parameters and these runoff control factors the lower data information input required in the cpisnow model makes it easier to apply in these regions where limited data availability is a major concern using the range of parameter values provided in table 3 the values of the cpisnow model parameters can be estimated with a high degree of confidence for ungauged high latitude catchments with similar characteristics to those used in this study further studies with catchments in heterogeneous terrains and climate will be needed in other to validate the performance of the

7146,using data from 22 catchments in northern finland this study demonstrates how runoff prediction in ungauged high latitude catchments can be improved using simplified conceptual models tailored to readily available data in the region the newly developed current precipitation index cpisnow model provides a parsimonious tool to predict streamflow in data limited high latitude regions use of current precipitation index cpi and runoff coefficient formulation in the soil moisture and response routine conceptualization makes soil moisture and response routine parameters in the model identifiable with catchment properties influencing storage evapotranspiration and infiltration losses most of the model parameters showed a significant relationship with observable physical catchment properties climate properties or both this made it easier to estimate the values of the model parameters in an ungauged catchment with minimal uncertainty the parameter functional relationships derived with catchment attributes produced equally good model results when applied to independent test catchments inclusion of snow water equivalent records and use of multiple objective functions for both snow water equivalent and runoff simulations in the model optimization process helped reduce the effect of parameter equifinality thereby making it easier to determine the optimal parameter

hydrological data are limited or nonexistent van der linden and woo 2003 gusev et al 2007 lique et al 2016 laudon et al 2017 conceptual models are often used for runoff modelling due to their limited data demand bergstr√∂m 1991 bl√∂schl et al 2013 runoff prediction in ungauged catchments in these regions relies on model parameter regionalization through functional relationships to catchment attributes however because of the complex structure of most conceptual models previous attempts to relate conceptual model parameters to catchment attributes have yielded mixed results due to the effects of parameter non uniqueness and equifinality caused by model over parameterization magette et al 1976 hughes 1989 servat and dezetter 1993 ibrahim and cordery 1995 post and jakeman 1996 sefton and howarth 1998 seibert 1999 over parameterization is often the result of a model structure requiring more input information than can be derived from available input data bergstr√∂m 1991 van der linden and woo 2003 gupta et al 2012 ghasemizade et al 2015 shin et al 2015 chang et al 2017 beven 1989 2012 and bergstr√∂m 1991 suggest that a simple model with a small number of parameters good numerical implementation and less data demand would eliminate the problem of over parameterization moreover beven 2012 suggested that 3 5 parameters should be sufficient to reproduce most of the information in hydrological records the predominant linearity in the response of watersheds jakeman and hornberger 1993 indicates that rainfall runoff models with only a small number of conceptual storage units will satisfactorily reproduce observed runoff records over a wide range of catchment scales kokkonen and jakeman 2001 achieved more accurate reproduction of measured runoff with a simple conceptualized model than a highly conceptualized model they concluded that substantial conceptualization of complex hydrological processes is not justified if only rainfall runoff data are available this is because more complexity requires several types of data such as soil profile groundwater position etc and higher information content for the model to achieve good performance in addition studies by e g perrin et al 2001 val√©ry et al 2014a b orth et al 2015 and chang et al 2017 have shown benefits from model simplification in previous work akanegbu et al 2017 we developed a robust and simple hydrological model cpisnow for streamflow prediction in seasonally snow covered high latitude regions based on the principle of current precipitation index smakhtin and masse 2000 in the present study we investigated the effect of simplified linear conceptualization of the soil moisture and response routine in cpisnow on its parameter uniqueness and identification with observable catchment descriptors our main focus was to test the efficiency of the model in predicting streamflow from ungauged high latitude catchments using functional relationships between its parameters and observable catchment attributes the hypotheses tested were that i since the response routine in the cpisnow model is conceptualized based on the principles of current precipitation index and runoff coefficients its response routine parameters can be determined by observable catchment descriptors that influence evapotranspiration and infiltration losses in the catchment and ii since the cpisnow model uses only one soil moisture routine parameter to account for low flow conditions in the catchment the parameter will be identifiable with catchment properties that regulate baseflow in the catchment such as lake percentage and slope an additional aim was to produce a range of parameter values for the cpisnow model in high latitude regions in relation to easily obtainable catchment physical and climate attributes 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites the study was conducted using 22 forested boreal catchments located in finland fig 1 a set of 14 catchments with snow water equivalent records was used for model parameter optimization and parameter uniqueness evaluation while the remaining eight catchments were used as independent catchments to test the performance of the established functional relationships between model parameters and observable catchment characteristics in mock ungauged high latitude catchments three catchments in southern finland were included in order to ensure that differences in climate between the upper north and lower north were captured the area of the catchments ranges from 13 62 to 3814 km2 table 1 the dominant land use in the catchments is forest covering 50 of the area the catchments have relatively flat topography with the mean elevation difference being 195 m a s l and a shallow water table around 3 5 m below the surface finnish environmental institute 2017 the surface lithology of the catchments with the exception of myllym√§ki ylijoki and laanioja is mainly basal till which occupies over 40 of the land area the surface lithology in myllym√§ki is mainly fine marine sediment while that in ylijoki and laanioja is mainly hummock moraine and migmatitic metapelite respectively geological survey of finland database superficial deposits are on average 10 m thick and storage units in the catchments are mainly lakes and peatlands climate conditions in the region are humid with an aridity index of 0 7 0 9 mean annual air temperature is 1 5 c in the south and 0 to 2 c in the north while mean annual precipitation is 600 700 mm in the south and 400 550 mm in the north finnish meteorological institute 2017a mean snow depth at the end of march is 5 40 cm in the south and 60 80 cm in the north finnish meteorological institute 2017b the catchments used in the study were selected based on availability of long term runoff records snow line records and meteorological data precipitation and temperature data used in the study were national 10 km 10 km interpolated gridded temperature and precipitation data from the finnish meteorological institute the snow course data and runoff data used were obtained from the finnish environmental institute s open database oiva the snow line measurement points used in the study were either located inside the study catchments or 10 km from the catchment divide daily runoff from the catchments was measured using water stage recorders and weirs for smaller sites as described in seuna and linjama 2004 and discharge rating curves for defined channel cross sections for larger sites and were checked for errors by the finnish environmental institute 2 2 cpisnow model the cpisnow model was developed by akanegbu et al 2017 for use in high latitude regions where snowmelt is the dominant hydrological process controlling runoff and hydrological data are limited it is very similar to the hbv model bergstr√∂m 1976 1992 seibert 1999 in the snow and routing routines however instead of using a soil box and storage boxes in the soil moisture and response routines as in hbv cpisnow uses a modified form of the current precipitation index equation by smakhtin and masse 2000 to transform precipitation into runoff hydrograph form akanegbu et al 2017 see appendix fig a1 the transformed precipitation is converted to runoff using two runoff conversion parameters c t and lf for the winter spring and summer autumn period respectively akanegbu et al 2017 fig a1 the converted runoff is routed out using the same routing routine parameter maxbas as in the hbv model the snow routine in the cpisnow model is controlled using five parameters t crit ddf cfr tsf f and s corr the soil moisture routine is controlled using only one parameter th q while the response routine is controlled using three parameters k r c t and lf an input modifier p corr is used to correct for errors in precipitation input data for a detailed description of the cpisnow model algorithm and parameters see akanegbu et al 2017 and the appendix fig a1 2 3 evaluation of parameter catchment attribute relationships 2 3 1 identification of runoff control factors the first step towards evaluation of the model s parameter relationships with catchment attributes was to identify catchment physical and climate characteristics which could have a profound effect on the cpisnow model parameters in order to fulfil the objectives of the study only physical catchment data and catchment climate information measurable in ungauged basins without extensive site investigation were considered based on the structure of the cpisnow model the physical catchment characteristics considered were catchment surface area sa km2 land use forest fst agriculture agr peatland ptl mean slope mslp mean slope of the highest order stream channel stslp Œ∏ lake percentage lk and outlet lake percentage o lk table 1 the catchment climate characteristics considered were average total annual precipitation tot p mm a average summer autumn total annual precipitation totsa p mm a average winter spring total annual precipitation totws p mm a snow day ratio sdr and warm dry day index wd d the snow day ratio is defined as the number of days that experience precipitation when the average daily air temperature is below 2 c divided by the total number of days per year with precipitation sawicz et al 2011 the warm dry day index is defined as number of days with air temperature 5th percentile of daily mean air temperature and precipitation 25th percentile of daily amounts arsenoviƒá et al 2013 the 75th percentile air temperature and 25th percentile daily precipitation were calculated from 22 years 1990 2011 average daily air temperature and precipitation in finland the highest order stream was taken to be the main stream channel leading to the outlet into which other lower order channels drain fig 2 the outlet lake was regarded as any lake that cuts across the highest order stream channel as shown in fig 2 and the lake coverage in each catchment was determined from corine land use data from finnish environmental institute database using arcgis the average slope mslp of the catchments was calculated using a digital elevation map dem derived index characterizing typical hillslopes while the average slope of the highest order stream channel was calculated as mean gradient from elevation differences in the main stream channel the summer autumn period was defined to run from june 20 to october 20 while the winter spring period was defined to run from october 21 to june 19 these seasonal periods were defined based on their average duration in finland finnish meteorological institute 2017c 2 3 2 model calibration and parameter optimization procedure after identification of daily runoff control factors the next step was calibration and optimization of model parameters for each of the study catchments this was done using the monte carlo sampling scheme with a set of objective functions that evaluate the efficiency of the model on different aspects of the stream hydrograph and snow line in order to minimize the effect of climate variability on model calibrations and model parameter comparisons between catchments the same number of years was used for both calibration and validation of the models in each of the study catchments the calibration period was 1990 2000 and the validation period 2001 2011 model calibration was carried out using a one stage approach snow water equivalent and runoff were calibrated simultaneously using multiple objective functions for both the snow water equivalent and runoff performance evaluation this allowed us to evaluate the uniqueness of the model parameters and inter dependence between the snow routine parameters and other model parameters the prior parameter space for the cpisnow model was selected based on a previous study in finland using the model akanegbu et al 2017 uniform distribution of the parameters within the prior parameter space was assumed and 5000 runs of the monte carlo sampling scheme were performed after which range between the minimum and the maximum parameter sets with acceptable objective function values were selected as the posterior parameter space the posterior parameter space was repeatedly used as the prior parameter space to run the monte carlo procedure until an insignificant difference between the cumulative distribution of the prior and posterior parameter space was achieved the parameter sets with acceptable objective functions were evaluated for uniqueness using dotty plots the best fit parameter sets were taken as the parameter sets with the highest combined objective functions each of the best fit parameter sets generated was then validated using the validation period 2000 2011 after which the optimal parameter set was selected as the best fit parameter set with best model performance in both the calibration and validation periods the objective functions appendix table a1 used for selection of the posterior parameter space best fit parameters for both simulated runoff and simulated snow water equivalent swe were nash sutcliffe model efficiency eff and natural logarithm of the nash sutcliffe model efficiency eff log krause et al 2005 akanegbu et al 2017 in addition the coefficient of determination r 2 and absolute volume error ve abs were used seibert 1999 2005 the cpisnow conceptual model was applied to the study and test catchments while keeping its less sensitive parameters cfr 0 05 f 0 03 tsf 0 5 constant as recommended by akanegbu et al 2017 the input modifier p corr was also kept at a constant value 1 1 typical for scandinavian conditions smhi 2013 2 3 3 evaluation of parameter functional relationship after generating optimal model parameters for each of the study catchments functional relationships between the optimal model parameters and catchment physical and climate characteristics were examined this was done by first fitting two parameter regression functions linear exponential power and log to the relationships as done by seibert 1999 multi regression analysis was then performed to determine whether there was a co relationship between a parameter and multiple catchment characteristics the significance of relationships was evaluated using a two tailed significance test p value and pearson s linear correlation coefficient of determination r 2 fitting different two parameter regression functions to the relationships ensured that relationships with the highest correlation r2 0 5 was selected as the parameter functional relationship a relationship was deemed significant at p 0 05 and r2 0 5 the performance of the functional relationships established was assessed by applying them to the independent test catchments and evaluating the model performance for those catchments this allowed the ability of the functional relationships to produce equally good results in catchments that had no influence on their derivation to be evaluated performance evaluation was based on the objective functions used in the optimization procedure for parameters where a significant relationship with catchment characteristics could not be established the median parameter value for all study catchments was used in performance evaluation of the relationship functions 3 results 3 1 model performance good daily runoff simulations and swe simulations with model efficiency criteria eff eff log r 2 0 5 were achieved with the cpisnow model in most of the study catchments in both the calibration and validation period fig 3 the only exceptions were mustajoki sc5 nuorittajoki sc8 and ylijoki sc14 catchments where efflog 0 5 was achieved fig 4 the margins of absolute volume error in the calibration period were 0 013 0 141 for runoff and 0 018 0 3 for the swe simulation while the margins of error in the validation period were 0 004 0 445 for runoff and 0 001 0 29 for swe fig 3 evaluation of the prior parameter space distribution from the monte carlo sampling scheme with dotty plots showed that the calibrated parameters of the cpisnow model were identifiable with distinct optimal peak figs 5 and 6 the dotty plots of the model objective functions against sampled parameter values revealed that while the snow routine parameters influenced the efficiencies of the runoff simulation the soil moisture response routine and routing routine parameters had no influence on the efficiency of the swe simulation in addition the dotty plots showed the identifiability of each model parameter with the four objective functions eff eff log r 2 ve abs used for runoff and swe optimization the t crit parameter was identifiable with eff eff log and r 2 of runoff simulation but not with ve abs whereas it was identifiable with eff eff log r 2 and ve abs of the swe simulation a similar trend was observed for the ddf parameter with the exception that it was not identifiable with ve abs of the swe simulation the s corr parameter was identifiable with eff and eff log of the runoff simulation and eff eff log and ve abs of the swe simulation but only mildly identifiable with r 2 and ve abs of the runoff simulation and r 2 of the swe simulation none of the soil moisture accounting response routine and routing routine parameters had any influence on the efficiency of the swe simulation fig 6 the th q parameter was mostly identifiable with eff log and mildly identifiable eff of the runoff simulation but was not identifiable with r 2 and ve abs of the runoff simulation the k r parameter was strongly identifiable with eff eff log and ve abs of the runoff simulation and mildly identifiable with r 2 a similar trend was observed with the c t and lf parameters maxbas was the least identifiable parameter in the model showing only mild identification with eff and eff log and no identifiability with r 2 and ve abs of the runoff simulation fig 5 the optimal parameter set realized from model optimization in each of the study catchments showed less deviation in parameter values between catchments except for the th q and maxbas parameters for which there was higher deviation between catchments table 2 evaluation with the posterior parameter distribution revealed parameter inter dependency between k r and c t and between k r and lf with linear correlation coefficient of determination r2 0 5 fig 7 other parameters showed no significant collinearity with each other the c t and lf parameter values tended to decrease with increasing k r fig 7 3 2 model parameter relationship with catchment characteristics all the calibrated cpisnow model parameters with the exception of s corr displayed varying degrees of linear or multilinear relatedness r 2 0 5 p 0 05 with some physical and climate characteristics of the catchments considered in the study the snow routine parameter t crit and ddf displayed a significant linear relationship with snow day ratio sdr r 2 0 55 p 0 003 and forest percentage fst r 2 0 51 p 0 004 respectively fig 8 t crit decreased with increasing sdr while ddf decreased with increasing fst significant linear relationships were found between the soil moisture routine parameter th q and catchment outlet lake percentage o lk and lake percentage lk however the correlation coefficient of determination r 2 0 77 and level of significance p 0 000 were higher between thq and o lk than between th q and lk r 2 0 64 p 0 001 the th q value increased with higher outlet lake and lake percentage the response routine parameters k r and c t but not lf showed a significant linear relationship r 2 0 80 p 0 000 and r 2 0 82 p 0 000 with catchment lake percentage lk fig 8 however with multi linear regression analysis a significant multi linear relationship r 2 0 55 p 0 012 was found between lk warm dry day index wd and the lf parameter table 2 the routing routine parameter maxbas showed a significant linear relationship r 2 0 58 p 0 002 with lk with the exception of the lf parameter no significant multi linear relationship was found between the catchment characteristics studied and other model parameters t crit ddf s corr th q k r c t maxbas in addition other parametric regression fitting exponential power and log produced no significant relationship between the model parameters and the catchment characteristics studied the functional relationships derived from the parameter catchment characteristics relationships are presented in table 2 while the recommended regional parameter ranges for applying the cpisnow model in ungauged high latitude catchments are presented in table 3 given that the catchments used in this study differ insignificantly in terms of land use and topography effects of catchment slope and differences in land use on the model parameters were not observed in our analysis however these catchment characteristics need to be taken into account when applying the recommended parameter range further studies with more heterogeneous catchments are needed in order to quantify how these catchment characteristics influence the cpisnow model parameters 3 3 evaluation of parameter functional relationship performance the daily runoff and swe simulations with parameter functional relationships on the independent test catchments fig 11 showed that the cpisnow model performed satisfactorily fig 9 the functional relationships produced satisfactory model objective functions for runoff eff 0 57 0 83 eff log 0 50 0 70 r 2 0 62 0 83 in all the independent test catchments but in sonkajarvi lamujoki uva and laanioja catchments poor eff log 0 34 0 47 was obtained fig 10 swe was simulated with model efficiency eff 0 52 0 94 eff log 0 64 0 82 and r 2 0 80 0 95 which was better than runoff prediction in the independent test catchments the absolute volume error ve abs obtained with the functional relationships was within the range 0 02 0 37 in runoff simulation and 0 01 0 50 in swe simulation comparing model efficiencies achieved with parameter functional relationships with model efficiencies achieved with median of optimal parameter sets from the study sites shows that parameter functional relationships gave better overall model efficiency than median of optimal parameters from calibration catchments figs 12 and 13 in runoff simulation the median of optimal parameter sets produced less eff eff log and r 2 efficiencies in the test catchments with the exceptions of the suolij√§rvi catchment tc5 fig 12a and c and uva catchment tc4 fig 12b were higher efficiencies were obtained than with parameter functional relationships the absolute volume error ve abs increased with the use of median of optimal parameter sets except in uva tc4 and laanioja tc7 catchments where lower ve abs was achieved using the median of optimal parameter sets similar trend was observed in the swe simulation in the test catchments using median of optimal parameter sets except in the eff log criterion where median of optimal parameter sets gave better performance in four of the test catchments fig 13b 4 discussion this study demonstrated the efficiency of the newly developed cpisnow model in simulating runoff from ungauged high latitude catchments where snowmelt runoff is substantial finding a suitable level of model complexity that matches available data and spatial and temporal scales at which major hydrological processes occur in high latitude regions is vital for runoff prediction in ungauged catchments dotting the region van der linden and woo 2003 as climate change will be rapid at high latitudes it is particularly important to understand hydrological processes and predict changes in this region bl√∂schl and montanari 2010 therefore robust models with unique parameters that can be estimated from observable catchment attributes are urgently needed the cpisnow model presented in this study provides a simplified and less data demanding tool to simulate runoff in various boreal and sub arctic catchments to our knowledge this is the first study to report the benefit of using a simplified conceptual hydrological model structure to allow for model parameter estimation based on catchment and climate attributes as the model is designed for ungauged catchments it can be used to estimate runoff based on easily identified catchment and climate properties 4 1 simplified conceptualization improves parameter uniqueness good performance was achieved with the cpisnow model in both the calibration and validation periods figs 3 and 4 this confirms the assertion by beven 1989 that predicting the discharge response to rainfall events should not be difficult since all that is needed is a loss function and a routing function as noted by hornberger et al 1985 attempts to represent all hydrological processes relevant in catchment daily runoff responses often create a risk of parameter non uniqueness which makes model parameters less identifiable from our parameter uniqueness evaluation it is clear that all the soil routine response routine and routing routine parameters in the cpisnow model are highly identifiable with distinct optimal peaks this is because the cpisnow model utilizes simple lost functions and a routing function which reduces the number of inter dependent parameters in the model thereby reducing the potential for parameter equifinality most of the parameters in the cpisnow model show no inter dependency the only exceptions are the c t and lf parameters which show inter dependence with the k r parameter fig 7 although the potential for equifinality exists with the k r c t and lf parameters their range of possible values is narrow k r 0 85 0 98 c t 0 02 0 15 lf 0 01 0 09 fedora and beschta 1989 smakhtin and masse 2000 akanegbu et al 2017 which helps to constrain their parameter space in addition the recommendations on possible values of k r in relation to storage properties of the catchment such as lake percentage fedora and beschta 1989 smakhtin and masse 2000 akanegbu et al 2017 help to determine possible values of k r in relation to the catchment under study this further constrains the prior parameter space another aspect of the model that helps reduce the scope for parameter equifinality is the use of multiple objective functions for calibration of both runoff and swe this allows the sensitivity of each of the model parameters on different aspects of the stream hydrograph to be taken into account while selecting the posterior parameter space as can be seen from the dotty plots of parameter reactiveness to the model s four objective functions figs 5 and 6 the parameters react differently to each of these functions some of the model parameters are sensitive to high flows while some are only sensitive to low flows as noted by krause et al 2005 using only one objective function for hydrological model assessment often results in poor identification of agreement between observed and simulated runoff in all aspects of the stream hydrograph for instance from our results it was clear that the snow routine t crit ddf and s corr and response routine k r c t and lf parameters showed identification with the eff objective function whereas the soil routine parameter th q showed only a mild reaction to the eff function but was more identifiable with the eff log function fig 5 this demonstrates that using only the eff objective function for the posterior parameter space selection would have resulted in equifinality of the th q parameter since a wide range of th q values would have given an acceptable eff value another efficiency criterion that could help in determining the optimal parameter sets is the benchmark efficiency be garrick et al 1978 wmo 1986 schaefli and gupta 2007 though not used in this study the benchmark efficiency uses inter annual mean value of observed runoff for every calendar day as a reference unlike nash sutcliffe efficiency eff which uses observed period of record mean value as a reference this gives the be greater advantage over eff in evaluating the explanatory power of the model than already contained in the seasonality of the driving forces schaefli and gupta 2007 the be criterion could help in determining the optimal values for the k r c t and lf parameters in the cpisnow model since these parameters controls the daily runoff fluctuation patterns in the catchment the strong reactiveness of the th q parameter to the eff log objective function was expected since this parameter handles baseflow in the catchment i e the low flows and the eff log objective function is known to be more effective in reflecting the influence of low flows in model assessment krause et al 2005 the non reactiveness of the snow routine parameters t crit and ddf to ve abs of the runoff simulation fig 5 was also expected since these parameters only determine the timing of snowmelt and do not influence the volume difference between simulated and observed runoff the s corr parameter on the other hand corrects the volume of accumulated snow in the catchment which in turn affects the volume of simulated runoff furthermore by calibrating swe and runoff simultaneously with the four objective functions satisfactory prediction of both was ensured this helped to reduce the number of possible good fit parameters since incorrect compensation between the snow routine parameters and the soil routine response routine and routing routine parameters was minimized the lack of reactiveness of the soil routine response routine and routing routine parameters to performance efficiency of the swe simulation shows that parameter compensation in the model is one directional while the swe parameters can adjust to improve the efficiency of the runoff simulation the soil routine response routine and routing routine parameters cannot adjust to influence the efficiency of the swe simulation figs 5 and 6 4 2 simplified conceptualization increases parameter identification with catchment attributes from the results it is clear that the highly lumped nature of the cpisnow model resulted in its soil moisture routine and response routine parameters being identifiable with catchment physical characteristics unlike similar models such as hbv which uses soil moisture boxes and storage boxes to control baseflow from the catchment the cpisnow model uses one parameter th q to account for baseflow in the catchment thus the th q parameter in the cpisnow model is highly sensitive to any catchment characteristics with a profound influence on low flows from the catchment the linear relationship found between catchment outlet lake percentage o lk and the th q parameter is justified because o lk influences the volume of low flows from the catchment the response routine structure of the cpisnow model is conceptualized using a simple runoff coefficient like equation akanegbu et al 2017 and a recession coefficient fedora and beschta 1989 smakhtin and masse 2000 whereas in the hbv model storage boxes are used with this approach in the cpisnow model the evaporation infiltration and storage losses in the water balance equation are lumped into two runoff coefficients c t and lf for the winter spring and summer autumn period respectively while the response rate of the catchment is controlled by the recession coefficient parameter k r this makes these parameters highly identifiable with catchment characteristics such as lake percentage lk and warm dry day index wd that control evapotranspiration storage capacity and infiltration capacity in the catchment in the results the c t parameter displayed a linear relationship with lk but no relationship with wd while the lf parameter displayed a multi linear relationship with both of these catchment characteristics the reason for c t not displaying a relationship with wd is that evaporation is minimal during winter spring in high latitude regions dankers and christensen 2005 typically the main factor governing runoff processes during this period is snowmelt quinton and roulet 1998 the value of the c t and lf parameters decreased with increasing lk because lakes play a major role in water storage in high latitude catchments spence 2000 the lf parameter also decreased with an increase in wd because of the influence of evaporation during summer autumn catchments with higher wd values generally displayed lower values of lf compared with catchments with lower wd values this is because higher wd indicates higher evapotranspiration rate and higher infiltration capacity which in turn will decrease the fraction of precipitation coming as runoff the linear relationship found between the recession coefficient k r and lk was expected since k r controls the daily runoff response rate in the cpisnow response routine and the presence of lakes in catchments induces a damping effect on daily catchment runoff response to rainfall gibson et al 2002 the linear relationships observed between the snow routine parameter ddf and catchment forest percentage confirms findings by seibert 1999 using the hbv model and by e g troendle and king 1985 and lundberg and halldin 1994 in experimental studies although seibert 1999 was unable to establish a relationship between catchment characteristics and critical temperature t crit in the cpisnow model here t crit was found to decrease with increasing catchment snow day ratio sdr since the snow day ratio indicates the amount of snow storage in the catchment it can be expected to have a profound effect on snow routine parameters such as t crit however we cannot explain why the value of t crit decreased with increasing snow accumulation in the catchment seibert 1999 observed a linear relationship between the snow correction parameter s corr and catchment forest percentage whereas we found no relationship between s corr and forest percentage or any of the catchment characteristics studied the reason might be that the catchments included in our study do not differ greatly in terms of forest percentage the significant linear relationship found between the routing routine parameter maxbas and lake percentage was expected since maxbas controls delays in catchment daily runoff response and lakes have damping and storage effects on catchment daily runoff response in addition the presence of lakes increases evaporation rates in the catchment thereby damping the runoff response further marsh and bigras 1988 rovansek et al 1996 bowling and lettenmaier 2010 bring et al 2016 as seen from the results catchments with a higher lake percentage displayed higher values of maxbas while catchments with lower lake percentage displayed lower values seibert 1999 observed similar trend with maxbas in the hbv model 4 3 parameter functional relationships produce satisfactory model efficiencies in general the cpisnow model showed satisfactory model performance when established parameter functional relationships from the study catchments were applied to the mock ungauged independent test catchments the poor performance of the parameter functional relationships on the eff log criteria might be because of insufficient number of catchments with larger outlet lake percentage in our study sample this might have affected the functional relationship derived from the th q relationship to outlet lake percentage in addition giving that the model conceptualization is based on current precipitation index the performance of the model in reflecting the daily fluctuations in runoff response might be affected be inter annual climate variations thereby affecting the model performance on eff log criterion the catchments included in the study were selected based on the availability of long term runoff and snow water equivalent records in the catchment these criteria limited our ability to avoid potential sampling bias that might result from under representation of catchments with particular characteristics since not many catchments had the required hydrological data irrespective of the potential bias in catchment sampling the parameter catchment characteristic functional relationships derived produced runoff and swe simulations that were in close agreement with the observed data however further analysis is needed with sample catchments from other snow dominated high latitude regions with more heterogeneous relief in order to be able to establish a more robust statistical relationship between the model parameter and catchment attributes on a global scale this will allow for development of a comprehensive list of model parameter range with respect to each catchment and climatic characteristics which will make the application of the model in ungauged catchments across the high latitude regions easier the benefit of using catchment attributes to estimate the model parameters can be seen from the comparison of the model performance in the test catchments when median of optimal parameter sets from calibration catchments were used and when parameter functional relationships with catchments attributes were used the comparison showed that in general even with the near homogeneous nature of the catchments used in the study the parameter functional relationships produced better model efficiencies in the test catchments than the median optimal parameter sets given that the main component of the model apart from the snow routine phase is the response routine phase the cpisnow model can easily be applied in catchments where there is limited information on the underlying characteristics since the estimated values of the response routine parameters k r c t and lf can be derived from observable catchment physical and climate characteristics table 3 furthermore estimates of monthly or daily evapotranspiration are not required as input data in the cpisnow model which makes it more robust in high latitude regions where hydrological data are lacking 5 conclusions this study demonstrated the efficiency of the cpisnow model in predicting runoff from ungauged high latitude catchments the simplified linear conceptualization of the model using current precipitation index and runoff coefficient formulations makes its response routine parameters unique and they exhibit clear relationships with observable catchment attributes in addition the use of one lumped parameter in the soil moisture routine makes the parameter identifiable with catchment lake and outlet lake percentage which regulate baseflow this makes it easier to estimate the values of the model parameters in ungauged catchments from observable catchment characteristics one novel feature in the model is the inclusion of objective functions for snow water equivalent records in the model calibration and optimization process which helps constrain the parameter space and improves parameter identification by reducing parameter inter dependency in addition the use of multiple performance criteria for calibration of both catchment snow water equivalent and runoff ensures that the performance of the model on every aspect of the hydrograph is evaluated before selecting the optimal parameter set this helps reduce the problem of parameter equifinality during the optimization process apart from the snow correction parameter s corr functional relationships were established for all the calibrated cpisnow model parameters using simple regression analysis the high rate of identification of the response routing parameters k r c t and lf in the cpisnow model to catchment storage attributes shows that the runoff response in high latitude catchments is mainly linear and a lumped loss function parameter is thus more visible than loss functions represented by storage boxes the good performance achieved with the parameter functional relationships derived in the mock ungauged independent test catchments shows that this model can easily be applied in ungauged catchments by using simple functional relationships between the parameters and catchment physical and climate characteristics additionally given that the dominant factors controlling daily runoff response in high latitude regions are snowmelt precipitation temperature and lakes the cpisnow model can be a valuable tool in runoff modeling in these regions since clear functional relationships exist between its parameters and these runoff control factors the lower data information input required in the cpisnow model makes it easier to apply in these regions where limited data availability is a major concern using the range of parameter values provided in table 3 the values of the cpisnow model parameters can be estimated with a high degree of confidence for ungauged high latitude catchments with similar characteristics to those used in this study further studies with catchments in heterogeneous terrains and climate will be needed in other to validate the performance of the

7147,surface flows of hydrological interest including overland flow runoff river and channel flow and flooding have received significant attention from modellers in the past 30 years a growing effort to address these complex environmental problems is in place in the scientific community researchers have studied and favoured a plethora of techniques to approach this issue ranging from very simple empirically based mathematical models to physically based deductive and very formal numerical integration of systems of partial differential equations in this work we review two families of methods cell based simulators later called cellular automata and finite volume solvers for the zero inertia equation which we show to converge into a single methodology given appropriate choices furthermore this convergence mathematically shown in this work can also be identified by critically reviewing the existing literature which leads to the conclusion that two methods originating from different reasoning and fundamental philosophy fundamentally converge into the same method moreover acknowledging such convergence allows for some generalisation of properties of numerical schemes such as error behaviour and stability which importantly is the same for the converging methodology a fact with practical implications both the review of existing literature and reasoning in this work attempts to aid in the effort of synchronising and cross fertilizing efforts to improve the understanding and the outlook of zero inertia solvers for surface flows as well as to help in clarifying the possible confusion and parallel developments that may arise from the use of different terminology originating from historical reasons moreover synchronising and unifying this knowledge base can help clarify model capabilities applicability and modelling issues for hydrological modellers specially for those not deeply familiar with the mathematical and numerical details keywords surface runoff zero inertia equation shallow water equations cellular automata finite volume diffusive wave equation 1 introduction the simulation of spatially distributed and time dependant surface flow processes with interests on flood modelling runoff modelling and geomorphology has been approached with different levels of complexity one of the simplest and general approaches are cell based methods often but not always termed the cellular automata ca approach originally proposed by von neumann 1966 in the context of computationally mimicking biological behaviours in this approach an individual automaton a discrete entity with properties communicates with its neighboring automata through some prescribed rules of interaction fonstad 2006 which may be argued to be fluxes clearly this requires to define what is meant by neighborhood and what are such rules which in turn obviously depends on the intended application within the plethora of applications for ca models only those on runoff and surface flow phenomena are of interest to this work one of the earliest works in this context is that of murray and paola 1994 who attempted to model braided rivers using ca in their approach ca was used to discretise space and interaction rules were implemented for both water and sediment flows such rules depended basically on bed slope and were rather convenient conceptual formulations other authors have chosen different intercell fluxes depending on their interest for example cai et al 2014 chose a broad crested weir rating curve to describe the intercell flux ghimire et al 2013 proposed fluxes based on a cascade volume transfer strategy among pre determined cell sets including a relaxation parameter to aggressively damp numerical oscillations on the other side models spawning from simplified shallow water dynamics have also been present solving the full shallow water equations swe can be challenging and computationally costly in particular for large domains typical of hydrological problems garc√≠a navarro 2016 although this issue is currently being addressed through the development of advanced numerical strategies and the use parallel and gpu graphical processing unit computing kesserwani et al 2016 alternative approaches which are mathematically numerically and computationally simpler have also been historically adopted to make simulation of these types of problems feasible and accessible various studies have explored the zero inertia zi also often inaccurately termed diffusive wave yen and tsai 2001 model with different numerical strategies costabile et al 2017 dottori and todini 2011 fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 julien et al 1995 panday et al 2004 e g the growing and very recent literature on both cellular automata ca and finite volumes fv based solvers clearly indicates that this remains an active field and that an effort is required so that several communities and methods may effectively converge most importantly the growing use of these models for sophisticated spatially distributed large scale hydrological simulation prompts the need to robustly identify key advantages and disadvantages of the underlying numerical approaches and requires for modellers to be deeply aware of the applicability and assumptions of the models available to them and a working understanding of the underlying numerics of their computational tools this needs motivate this review in particular we set out to draw attention and clearly show how some so called cellular automata solvers are exactly the same as the explicit finite volume solvers of the zi equation this is the main contribution of this work which has the significant implication that a vast knowledge base can be brought together thus aiding hydrological modellers to better understand the available computational tools in particular it is noteworthy that stability and error properties of the two solvers are the same and well known and that they differ from the less studied stability properties of other perhaps less formal cell based routing models in order to advocate that effort it is our goal to review and summarize the contributions from both communities to what is in fact the same numerical approach to the same mathematical approximation of the shallow water equations to do so we derive both a ca simulator from fundamental discrete principles in section 2 we derive the mathematical and numerical expressions for a fv zi solver in section 3 and we finally show and discuss the equivalence between methods review and classify a plethora of existing models reported as ca and fv in the literature and compare and contrast them in section 4 5 briefly summarises key insights and outlook 2 the cellular automata approach for surface flows a general form for the ca state evolution rule cai et al 2014 for a state variable s is 1 s i n 1 f s i n s j n where j denotes all the neighboring cells surrounding cell i superindex n denotes the current time level and n 1 the future time eq 1 simply states that the future state of a cell depends on the current state of that cell and the states of its neighbors how each neighbor influences the cell of interest is determined by the function f such function can be very simple and may only require to evaluate the states of the cells without the need for a rate of information exchange on the other hand in the context of fluid motion the state variables are indeed exchanged between cells at particular rates called fluxes f by assuming that the interaction function f depends on such fluxes and that information is exchanged during a time interval Œ¥ t it is possible to write eq 1 as 2 s i n 1 s i n Œ¥ t i i n j 1 n j f ij n where i indicates a cell which is connected to n j other cells in a prescribed neighborhood or stencil any neighboring cell j will exchange information with cell i through the local flux f ij which may depend on the states of both cell i and j in eq 2 information can also change due to sources and sinks through i which is a rate of change of the quantity s in general the source term i and the flux f may or may not depend on the state variables eq 2 is the evolution equation at the core of ca based models in particular those concerned with flood problems from a discretisation point of view it is relevant to point out that eq 2 can be posed with no inherent knowledge of what information is being exchanged nor how i e what exactly s or f are this is a generic concept in the ca method moreover the reader should note that eq 2 is an explicit time discretisation since the state at time n 1 is computed based exclusively on states at time n moreover if dealing with a spatial problem as surface flow modelling is cells represent regions in space typically in two dimensional ca models square cells are chosen for convenience to discretise space although there is no particular requirement for this ortigoza 2015 particular ca methods such as those listed in table 1 can be obtained by choosing a suitable state variable s and formulating f accordingly and conveniently thus defining the rules for information exchange herein the interest is on surface flow modelling in particular models dealing with runoff and floods to proceed in such direction let the state variable be water volume v l 3 in a cell 3 v i n 1 v i n Œ¥ t i i n j 1 n j f ij n at this point f and i must be volumetric fluxes rates of change of volume l 3 t for the equation to be consistent let the problem be two dimensional therefore cells can be characterized by their area a l 2 dividing eq 4 by the area 4 h i n 1 h i n Œ¥ t a i i n j 1 n j f ij n where h v a l is the piece wise constant water depth in a cell observe that the meaning of i and f remains unchanged they are still volumetric fluxes at this point the choice of f creates a divergence between methods a simple possibility is to select f f z x y i e the volumetric flux depends only on surface elevation z x y or more precisely on the slopes z baartman et al 2012 in such case the fluxes depend only on the topography itself and the definition of the neighborhood which sometimes contains only four cells direct neighbors in both cartesian directions referred to as the von neumann neighborhood and in other cases it contains eight cells the moore neighborhood which expands on the von neumann neighborhood to also include the direct neighbor cells at a 45 degree angle from cartesian directions herein only the von neumann neighborhood is considered since it is the most common in overland flow models it is also possible to formulate the flux as f f h x y z x y meaning that both topography and water depth play a role this in turn allows for different levels of complexity in the representation of the physical processes leading to different reliability and applicability of models it is at this point in the mathematical modelling process where many of the surface flow oriented ca models diverge broadly two sets of models can be distinguished firstly those attempting to capture physically the competing forces which drive the flow gravity friction inertia and those which neglect explicitly recalling the driving forces but prefer simpler proxies and in the process assuming particular flow conditions for which such proxies are valid in the first group notably many authors developing ca models have chosen to keep gravity and friction forces but have neglected inertia thus assuming pseudo steady flow conditions in which friction and gravity balance each other thus the flow rates can be represented with well known friction laws such as chezy darcy weisbach and most frequently manning s equation in general terms such friction laws yield a flux in the form of 5 f Œ± h l Œ¥ h z d where Œ± depends on the selected friction formulation most ca models are based on manning s equation which imposes 6 Œ± h h 5 3 n allowing to write the flux as 7 f lh 5 3 n Œ¥ h z d which substituted in 4 results in 8 h i n 1 h i n Œ¥ t a i i i n j 1 n j lh 5 3 n Œ¥ h z d by defining the water surface gradient between two cells as 9 z œâ n h j h i z j z i d œâ and manipulating together with eq 8 slightly yields 10 h i n 1 h i n Œ¥ ti i n Œ¥ t a i j 1 n j h 5 3 n z œâ n z œâ n l œâ defining the surface gradient vector z œâ across an edge œâ with normal vector n œâ so that 11 z œâ n n œâ z œâ allows to rewrite eq 10 into vector form 12 h i n 1 h i n Œ¥ ti i n Œ¥ t a i j 1 n j h 5 3 n z œâ n z œâ n n œâ l œâ where i i a are source term contributions per unit area l t which can account for rain rate r l t and infiltration exfiltration rate i l t so that i r i for example eq 12 has been termed often in the literature as cellular automata solver of the diffusive wave equation ca dw it should be noted that the accurate terminology for eq 12 should be a ca solver for the zero inertia equation ca zi as was pointed out by yen and tsai 2001 issue on which more details are discussed later on 3 a finite volume approach for surface flows 3 1 zero inertia approximation the zero inertia zi assumption to simplify the shallow water equations requires to neglect acceleration terms in the momentum equation fern√°ndez pato and garc√≠a navarro 2016 thus resulting in a steady momentum equation in which only hydrostatic bed and friction terms appear 13 z œÉ where z h z is the surface gradient h l is depth z l is bed elevation and œÉ is the friction slope eq 13 accompanies the mass conservation equation 14 h t h q i where q qx qy l 2 t is the unit discharge momentum i l t is a source term which can account for example for rain r l t and infiltration i l t rates the friction slope œÉ œÉ x œÉ y and its equality to the water surface slope eq 13 allow to express unit discharge q generically in terms of the water surface gradient z 15 q Œ± h z z where Œ± h is a non linear coefficient which depends on the friction formulation of choice for manning s friction with a manning s roughness coefficient n tl 1 3 the coefficient Œ± is 16 Œ± h h 5 3 n for the darcy weisbach friction law with friction coefficient f 17 Œ± h h 3 2 8 g f 1 2 and for the chezy equation with chezy roughness coefficient c l 1 2 t 18 Œ± h ch 3 2 the standard approach in the literature for the zi equation relies on manning s formulation thus substituting eqs 16 and 15 in the mass conservation eq 14 yields the classical 2d zi equation based on manning s friction 19 h t h 5 3 n z z i 3 2 finite volume discretisation the zi can be solved by means of the finite volume fv method to do so eq 19 is first integrated in a finite control volume a 20 a h t da a h 5 3 n z z da a ida invoking gauss theorem yields 21 a h t da s h 5 3 n z z n dl a ida where s is the surface enclosing volume a and n is the outer pointing vector normal to s finally choosing polygonal cells comprised of n œâ sides as control volumes and choosing a piece wise constant representation of functions in the cells the semi discretisation for any cell i is achieved 22 h t i i 1 a i œâ 1 n œâ h œâ 5 3 n œâ z œâ z œâ n œâ l œâ where œâ denotes the edge between cells i and j h œâ is the estimated depth at the cell edge œâ a is the cell area l œâ is the length of the edge œâ z œâ is the water surface gradient across the edge with normal vector n œâ the gradient across an edge z œâ is defined as 23 z œâ z œâ h z x h z y œâ so that effectively 24 z œâ n œâ h j z j h i z i d œâ with d œâ the distance between cell centers perpendicular to edge œâ note that z œâ is well defined at the edge but h œâ is not and must be estimated to cope with its bi valuated nature at such edge approximating the value at the edge has implications in both the accuracy and efficiency of the method dottori and todini 2011 hunter et al 2005 mendicino et al 2015 the semi discretisation in eq 22 still requires to integrate in time adopting an explicit time discretisation approach a standard forward euler approximation the complete numerical scheme reads 25 h i n 1 h i n Œ¥ ti i n Œ¥ t a i œâ 1 n œâ h œâ n 5 3 n œâ z œâ n z œâ n n œâ l œâ eq 25 is the explicit finite volume solution to the zi approximation thus this is termed the fv zi solver as reported in the literature cea et al 2010 fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 leandro et al 2014 wang et al 2011 note again that this solver is often also inaccurately termed fv dw solver yen and tsai 2001 furthermore eq 25 does not require any particular shape or arrangement for the computational cells it allows for fully unstructured meshes with convex polygonal cells a particular case of this is of course a structured mesh of squared cells 4 review and discussion a key interest of this paper is to strongly point out that the fv zi solver in eq 25 cea et al 2010 fern√°ndez pato and garc√≠a navarro 2016 leandro et al 2014 wang et al 2011 is identical to the cellular automata approach described by eq 12 dottori and todini 2011 mendicino et al 2015 parsons and fonstad 2007 which is henceforth denoted ca zi and also identical to the so called raster based solvers bates and roo 2000 hunter et al 2005 or cell based solvers julien et al 1995 in other words ca zi solvers are at the core no different from fv zi solvers although obtained by reasoning which originates from a discrete system somewhat different technical approximations to different components may be the sole differences but this is also the case of different fv zi approaches by various authors this identity has been seldom pointed out which together with the wide variety of ca approaches see table 1 have lead to parallel literature from researchers in hydrology and geology and researchers in fluid dynamics and computational hydraulics this issue of terminology is also entangled with the misuse of the diffusive wave term for what the zero inertia equation although the zi equation is a dw equation not all dw equations are zi sivapalan et al 1997 yen and tsai 2001 it is relevant to point out that the definition of flux f is critical to the meaning and capabilities of ca solvers ca zi solvers identical to fv zi solvers are obtained when the flux f corresponds to the unit discharge momentum q i e eq 7 is equivalent to 15 evaluated with 16 another relevant choice in the numerical formulation common to models termed ca zi or fv zi is that depth must be estimated at the edge between two cells where it is bi valuated several studies from the ca literature dottori and todini 2011 mendicino et al 2015 hunter et al 2005 have shown showed that the na√Øve arithmetic mean between neighboring cells is computationally inefficient due to numerical stability issues in particular in the presence of complex topography dottori and todini 2011 and have proposed a more stable estimation hunter et al 2005 26 h œâ max h i z i h j z j max z i z j which has been also adopted in fv models identified as fv zi hinting the relevance of finding a common ground between the research communities similar to the fv zi solver in eq 19 is also that of lopez barrera et al 2012 which attempts to incorporate elements of the hyperbolicity present in the swe requiring a redefinition of the fluxes on the other hand the fv zi solver in eq 25 differs obviously from implicit approaches relying either on fv fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 or fe panday et al 2004 weill et al 2009 since it requires no matrix inversion and allows for direct parallelization the fv zi solver also differs clearly from other ca based approaches which input convenient yet not necessarily formal or physical expressions in the flux terms i e choosing a flux f different than the one spawning from manning s equation eq 7 or alternative friction laws which do not really account for the physics as described in the swe d ambrosio et al 2001 ghimire et al 2013 parsons and fonstad 2007 rinaldi et al 2007 shao et al 2015 e g or are not really dw zi simplifications bates et al 2010 the rather loose use of terminology in different communities seems to have encouraged parallel developments with researchers not benefiting from the knowledge base from related fields many studies in geological and hydrological related fields are based on the fv ca zi approach mainly because of the convenient simplicity of the equation and its numerical solution and some pointing out stability as a relevant issue mendicino et al 2015 however it has been pointed out that the price for simplicity is computational efficiency i e the ca zi approach can often be computationally more expensive than swe solvers cea et al 2010 fern√°ndez pato and garc√≠a navarro 2016 lopez barrera et al 2012 wang et al 2011 although studies have found the opposite dottori and todini 2011 martins et al 2017 the cost of the explicit zi solvers is related to stability issues thus justifying implicit approaches fern√°ndez pato and garc√≠a navarro 2016 panday et al 2004 weill et al 2009 which are not equivalent to ca zi solvers in terms of time discretisation although they solve the same partial differential equation pde it has been suggested that the high cost of solving zi explicitly is inherent to the equation wang et al 2011 and various researchers have independently proposed and studied ways to reduce the computational cost of the zi approximation by addressing the underlying stability issues some of the reasoning is obtained by following ideas from the stability of hyperbolic systems i e the courant friedrich lewy cfl condition lopez barrera et al 2012 wang et al 2011 dottori and todini 2011 and von neumann stability analysis hunter et al 2005 which is similar and consistent to stability analysis of parabolic elliptic equations such as the richards equation caviedes voulli√®me et al 2013 mendicino et al 2015 which shows a similar non linear behaviour as the zi approach interestingly it has also been pointed out that adding an inertial term to the zi equation without reverting to the full swe also reduces stability constrains bates et al 2010 dottori and todini 2011 an idea which should be further pursued table 1 presents a non exhaustive chronological review of many ca models reported in the literature for different types of surface flow simulation these ca models have smartly and conveniently selected fluxes which might represent the physics to some extent under certain conditions the table also includes a chronological review of many cfd based models most of which were developed for flood modelling in the table it can be seen that some models referred to as ca models are in fact fv solvers of a pde based reasoning which leads to zi equation the reported models are classified in terms of how they were termed by their authors how in fact they are spatially and temporally discretised how the flux f is formulated the definition of the neighborhood and the application intended by the authors some additional comments are included for clarifications and particular highlights authors might term their models ca but the model may in fact be a fv discretisation similarly authors might term their model to solve de dw equation but the flux formulation is stated as zi in the table in an effort to generate a consistent terminology one of the interesting observations to be drawn from table 1 is that there has been a continuous development of ca ca zi and fv zi solvers in the past 25 years nonetheless a number of recent publications have indeed tackled some of the complex issues such as stability mendicino et al 2015 or computational efficiency through local time stepping dottori and todini 2011 very recent publications have also provided new observations on the performance of the methods in contrast to swe solvers costabile et al 2017 fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 jahanbazi et al 2017 interestingly as a group these very recent papers still carry with them the mix of terminology pointed out in this paper even though some of them dottori and todini 2011 jahanbazi et al 2017 actually do realise and comment on the equivalent nature of the methodologies other very recent publications do still approach the problem from a strictly ca non fv zi approach exploring ad hoc flux formulations and algorithms liu et al 2015 ghimire et al 2013 shao et al 2015 table 1 also allows to visualize the range of modelling choices within the models most models reported in table 1 are explicit in time with the notable exceptions of panday et al 2004 2006 and weill et al 2009 all of which were intended to solve the zi equation coupled to richards equation which is commonly solved implicitly caviedes voulli√®me et al 2013 mendicino et al 2015 notable as well are the studies by lal 1998 who found that explicit solvers are less efficient than implicit solvers and by fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 who compared explicit and implicit fv zi solvers finding that implicit solvers may be more efficient than explicit solvers under certain conditions but not always it is striking that most of the zi solvers take an explicit approach since the parabolic nature of the zi equation classically calls for implicit solvers following von neumann stability analysis and to the significant problems that arise from the stability constrains of the explicit solution of zi mendicino et al 2015 this may be due to a combination the at times ca driven developments bates and roo 2000 hunter et al 2005 e g in which the ansatz is always based on an explicit update scheme contrary to what is classical and well established in numerical analysis nonetheless there is still an open debate on how to ensure the stability of the solver while keeping performance and efficiency with most authors favouring formal stability constrains a peclet like number depending on the square of the spatial resolution cea et al 2010 leandro et al 2014 mendicino et al 2015 hunter et al 2005 and others suggesting a less formal alternative approach lopez barrera et al 2012 jahanbazi et al 2017 wang et al 2011 of choosing a hyperbolic like stability constrain the courant friedrich lewy cfl condition proportional to the spatial resolution there is merit to this idea since the formal approach has been shown to both over restrict the time step dottori and todini 2011 and not strictly guarantee stability giving rise to the issue known as checkerboarding hunter et al 2005 hunter et al 2007 lopez barrera et al 2012 whereas keeping non formal constrains cfl number has been shown to work reasonably with significant less computational effort wang et al 2011 recently jahanbazi et al 2017 attempted to reduce the stability constrains of the zi approach drawing from the ca philosophy and implementing variations on the flux formulation to control the issues again making obvious for a need for efforts from both communities to converge arguably the trend to favour explicit solutions is also supported by a simpler implementation more intuitive interpretation of the scheme and the easiness of parallelization dottori and todini 2011 this observation is also supported by the fact that most ca fv zi solvers have been implemented for cartesian meshes again favouring simplicity of implementation interpretation and parallelization most of the reported models solving the zi inertia equation in particular those reported as ca have been implemented for cartesian square meshes and make use of the von neumann neighborhood two relevant points arise on this issue the first is that few models allow for triangular unstructured meshes cea et al 2010 costabile et al 2017 fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 lal 1998 whose use may be relevant to keep a low computational cost while ensuring accuracy caviedes voulli√®me et al 2012 the second is that none of the models reported as ca zi solvers use the moore neighborhood which can otherwise be found in ca models not based on zi this can be easily explained once ca zi solvers are seen as fv zi solvers since the moore neighborhood brings in an inconsistency it calls to compute a flux across a vertex a point an entity with zero length instead of across an edge other ca models which do not necessarily compute physical fluxes can and do use the moore neighborhood 5 conclusions this paper reviews the existing cellular automata and finite volume models reported in the past 25 years for the solution of surface flows such review leads to three key points i fv solvers developed to solve the zero inertia approximation to the shallow water equations are widely used and understood ii there is a variety of ca solvers to address shallow surface flows all of which rely on similar definitions of state variables but differ in the formulation of the fluxes and iii there is a subset of ca solvers which are in fact identical to fv zi solver given a particular choice of flux although originating from a different reasoning these facts which have seldom been pointed out in the literature should lead to some convergence from the contributions coming from different approaches indeed converging to a single widespread modelling approach acknowledging this convergence allows for some generalization in terms of the properties of the numerical schemes the meaning of the models and applicability of the approaches in particular it becomes clear that of the approaches reported here those which effectively solve the zi equation can be interpreted with well known numerical analysis their stability properties can be formally established although in practice such formal stability can be inefficient and have a clear physical base and physical meaning notably all zi solvers may they be termed ca or fv make use of neumann neighborhoods since the moore neighborhood lacks meaning when solving the zi equation as it provides no length over which to integrate the flux across two cells this allows to clearly distinguish cell based models based on the zi approach and those not based on it or the swe equations for that matter complementary those models which do not share the properties of ca zi fv zi solvers must be analyzed differently since they are not in the same category with other tools formal or not and their stability meaning and applicability must be critically assessed for each particular case since it cannot be extrapolated from the behaviour of alternative models furthermore it becomes clear that even considering contributions from the different scientific communities involved there are still open questions on how to efficiently and robustly solve the zero inertia equation to name a few the range of applicability of the zi equation is still under discussion as very recent publications show the choice of the temporal integration has relevant implications in the simplicity of the methodology arguably its most desirable property in the case of explicit solvers the issue of stability seems not completely solved although tested approaches have been mathematically rigorous and have provided insights finally the advantages of choosing zi solvers over shallow water solvers still remain debatable as contradictory experiences and arguments have been recently reported 
7147,surface flows of hydrological interest including overland flow runoff river and channel flow and flooding have received significant attention from modellers in the past 30 years a growing effort to address these complex environmental problems is in place in the scientific community researchers have studied and favoured a plethora of techniques to approach this issue ranging from very simple empirically based mathematical models to physically based deductive and very formal numerical integration of systems of partial differential equations in this work we review two families of methods cell based simulators later called cellular automata and finite volume solvers for the zero inertia equation which we show to converge into a single methodology given appropriate choices furthermore this convergence mathematically shown in this work can also be identified by critically reviewing the existing literature which leads to the conclusion that two methods originating from different reasoning and fundamental philosophy fundamentally converge into the same method moreover acknowledging such convergence allows for some generalisation of properties of numerical schemes such as error behaviour and stability which importantly is the same for the converging methodology a fact with practical implications both the review of existing literature and reasoning in this work attempts to aid in the effort of synchronising and cross fertilizing efforts to improve the understanding and the outlook of zero inertia solvers for surface flows as well as to help in clarifying the possible confusion and parallel developments that may arise from the use of different terminology originating from historical reasons moreover synchronising and unifying this knowledge base can help clarify model capabilities applicability and modelling issues for hydrological modellers specially for those not deeply familiar with the mathematical and numerical details keywords surface runoff zero inertia equation shallow water equations cellular automata finite volume diffusive wave equation 1 introduction the simulation of spatially distributed and time dependant surface flow processes with interests on flood modelling runoff modelling and geomorphology has been approached with different levels of complexity one of the simplest and general approaches are cell based methods often but not always termed the cellular automata ca approach originally proposed by von neumann 1966 in the context of computationally mimicking biological behaviours in this approach an individual automaton a discrete entity with properties communicates with its neighboring automata through some prescribed rules of interaction fonstad 2006 which may be argued to be fluxes clearly this requires to define what is meant by neighborhood and what are such rules which in turn obviously depends on the intended application within the plethora of applications for ca models only those on runoff and surface flow phenomena are of interest to this work one of the earliest works in this context is that of murray and paola 1994 who attempted to model braided rivers using ca in their approach ca was used to discretise space and interaction rules were implemented for both water and sediment flows such rules depended basically on bed slope and were rather convenient conceptual formulations other authors have chosen different intercell fluxes depending on their interest for example cai et al 2014 chose a broad crested weir rating curve to describe the intercell flux ghimire et al 2013 proposed fluxes based on a cascade volume transfer strategy among pre determined cell sets including a relaxation parameter to aggressively damp numerical oscillations on the other side models spawning from simplified shallow water dynamics have also been present solving the full shallow water equations swe can be challenging and computationally costly in particular for large domains typical of hydrological problems garc√≠a navarro 2016 although this issue is currently being addressed through the development of advanced numerical strategies and the use parallel and gpu graphical processing unit computing kesserwani et al 2016 alternative approaches which are mathematically numerically and computationally simpler have also been historically adopted to make simulation of these types of problems feasible and accessible various studies have explored the zero inertia zi also often inaccurately termed diffusive wave yen and tsai 2001 model with different numerical strategies costabile et al 2017 dottori and todini 2011 fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 julien et al 1995 panday et al 2004 e g the growing and very recent literature on both cellular automata ca and finite volumes fv based solvers clearly indicates that this remains an active field and that an effort is required so that several communities and methods may effectively converge most importantly the growing use of these models for sophisticated spatially distributed large scale hydrological simulation prompts the need to robustly identify key advantages and disadvantages of the underlying numerical approaches and requires for modellers to be deeply aware of the applicability and assumptions of the models available to them and a working understanding of the underlying numerics of their computational tools this needs motivate this review in particular we set out to draw attention and clearly show how some so called cellular automata solvers are exactly the same as the explicit finite volume solvers of the zi equation this is the main contribution of this work which has the significant implication that a vast knowledge base can be brought together thus aiding hydrological modellers to better understand the available computational tools in particular it is noteworthy that stability and error properties of the two solvers are the same and well known and that they differ from the less studied stability properties of other perhaps less formal cell based routing models in order to advocate that effort it is our goal to review and summarize the contributions from both communities to what is in fact the same numerical approach to the same mathematical approximation of the shallow water equations to do so we derive both a ca simulator from fundamental discrete principles in section 2 we derive the mathematical and numerical expressions for a fv zi solver in section 3 and we finally show and discuss the equivalence between methods review and classify a plethora of existing models reported as ca and fv in the literature and compare and contrast them in section 4 5 briefly summarises key insights and outlook 2 the cellular automata approach for surface flows a general form for the ca state evolution rule cai et al 2014 for a state variable s is 1 s i n 1 f s i n s j n where j denotes all the neighboring cells surrounding cell i superindex n denotes the current time level and n 1 the future time eq 1 simply states that the future state of a cell depends on the current state of that cell and the states of its neighbors how each neighbor influences the cell of interest is determined by the function f such function can be very simple and may only require to evaluate the states of the cells without the need for a rate of information exchange on the other hand in the context of fluid motion the state variables are indeed exchanged between cells at particular rates called fluxes f by assuming that the interaction function f depends on such fluxes and that information is exchanged during a time interval Œ¥ t it is possible to write eq 1 as 2 s i n 1 s i n Œ¥ t i i n j 1 n j f ij n where i indicates a cell which is connected to n j other cells in a prescribed neighborhood or stencil any neighboring cell j will exchange information with cell i through the local flux f ij which may depend on the states of both cell i and j in eq 2 information can also change due to sources and sinks through i which is a rate of change of the quantity s in general the source term i and the flux f may or may not depend on the state variables eq 2 is the evolution equation at the core of ca based models in particular those concerned with flood problems from a discretisation point of view it is relevant to point out that eq 2 can be posed with no inherent knowledge of what information is being exchanged nor how i e what exactly s or f are this is a generic concept in the ca method moreover the reader should note that eq 2 is an explicit time discretisation since the state at time n 1 is computed based exclusively on states at time n moreover if dealing with a spatial problem as surface flow modelling is cells represent regions in space typically in two dimensional ca models square cells are chosen for convenience to discretise space although there is no particular requirement for this ortigoza 2015 particular ca methods such as those listed in table 1 can be obtained by choosing a suitable state variable s and formulating f accordingly and conveniently thus defining the rules for information exchange herein the interest is on surface flow modelling in particular models dealing with runoff and floods to proceed in such direction let the state variable be water volume v l 3 in a cell 3 v i n 1 v i n Œ¥ t i i n j 1 n j f ij n at this point f and i must be volumetric fluxes rates of change of volume l 3 t for the equation to be consistent let the problem be two dimensional therefore cells can be characterized by their area a l 2 dividing eq 4 by the area 4 h i n 1 h i n Œ¥ t a i i n j 1 n j f ij n where h v a l is the piece wise constant water depth in a cell observe that the meaning of i and f remains unchanged they are still volumetric fluxes at this point the choice of f creates a divergence between methods a simple possibility is to select f f z x y i e the volumetric flux depends only on surface elevation z x y or more precisely on the slopes z baartman et al 2012 in such case the fluxes depend only on the topography itself and the definition of the neighborhood which sometimes contains only four cells direct neighbors in both cartesian directions referred to as the von neumann neighborhood and in other cases it contains eight cells the moore neighborhood which expands on the von neumann neighborhood to also include the direct neighbor cells at a 45 degree angle from cartesian directions herein only the von neumann neighborhood is considered since it is the most common in overland flow models it is also possible to formulate the flux as f f h x y z x y meaning that both topography and water depth play a role this in turn allows for different levels of complexity in the representation of the physical processes leading to different reliability and applicability of models it is at this point in the mathematical modelling process where many of the surface flow oriented ca models diverge broadly two sets of models can be distinguished firstly those attempting to capture physically the competing forces which drive the flow gravity friction inertia and those which neglect explicitly recalling the driving forces but prefer simpler proxies and in the process assuming particular flow conditions for which such proxies are valid in the first group notably many authors developing ca models have chosen to keep gravity and friction forces but have neglected inertia thus assuming pseudo steady flow conditions in which friction and gravity balance each other thus the flow rates can be represented with well known friction laws such as chezy darcy weisbach and most frequently manning s equation in general terms such friction laws yield a flux in the form of 5 f Œ± h l Œ¥ h z d where Œ± depends on the selected friction formulation most ca models are based on manning s equation which imposes 6 Œ± h h 5 3 n allowing to write the flux as 7 f lh 5 3 n Œ¥ h z d which substituted in 4 results in 8 h i n 1 h i n Œ¥ t a i i i n j 1 n j lh 5 3 n Œ¥ h z d by defining the water surface gradient between two cells as 9 z œâ n h j h i z j z i d œâ and manipulating together with eq 8 slightly yields 10 h i n 1 h i n Œ¥ ti i n Œ¥ t a i j 1 n j h 5 3 n z œâ n z œâ n l œâ defining the surface gradient vector z œâ across an edge œâ with normal vector n œâ so that 11 z œâ n n œâ z œâ allows to rewrite eq 10 into vector form 12 h i n 1 h i n Œ¥ ti i n Œ¥ t a i j 1 n j h 5 3 n z œâ n z œâ n n œâ l œâ where i i a are source term contributions per unit area l t which can account for rain rate r l t and infiltration exfiltration rate i l t so that i r i for example eq 12 has been termed often in the literature as cellular automata solver of the diffusive wave equation ca dw it should be noted that the accurate terminology for eq 12 should be a ca solver for the zero inertia equation ca zi as was pointed out by yen and tsai 2001 issue on which more details are discussed later on 3 a finite volume approach for surface flows 3 1 zero inertia approximation the zero inertia zi assumption to simplify the shallow water equations requires to neglect acceleration terms in the momentum equation fern√°ndez pato and garc√≠a navarro 2016 thus resulting in a steady momentum equation in which only hydrostatic bed and friction terms appear 13 z œÉ where z h z is the surface gradient h l is depth z l is bed elevation and œÉ is the friction slope eq 13 accompanies the mass conservation equation 14 h t h q i where q qx qy l 2 t is the unit discharge momentum i l t is a source term which can account for example for rain r l t and infiltration i l t rates the friction slope œÉ œÉ x œÉ y and its equality to the water surface slope eq 13 allow to express unit discharge q generically in terms of the water surface gradient z 15 q Œ± h z z where Œ± h is a non linear coefficient which depends on the friction formulation of choice for manning s friction with a manning s roughness coefficient n tl 1 3 the coefficient Œ± is 16 Œ± h h 5 3 n for the darcy weisbach friction law with friction coefficient f 17 Œ± h h 3 2 8 g f 1 2 and for the chezy equation with chezy roughness coefficient c l 1 2 t 18 Œ± h ch 3 2 the standard approach in the literature for the zi equation relies on manning s formulation thus substituting eqs 16 and 15 in the mass conservation eq 14 yields the classical 2d zi equation based on manning s friction 19 h t h 5 3 n z z i 3 2 finite volume discretisation the zi can be solved by means of the finite volume fv method to do so eq 19 is first integrated in a finite control volume a 20 a h t da a h 5 3 n z z da a ida invoking gauss theorem yields 21 a h t da s h 5 3 n z z n dl a ida where s is the surface enclosing volume a and n is the outer pointing vector normal to s finally choosing polygonal cells comprised of n œâ sides as control volumes and choosing a piece wise constant representation of functions in the cells the semi discretisation for any cell i is achieved 22 h t i i 1 a i œâ 1 n œâ h œâ 5 3 n œâ z œâ z œâ n œâ l œâ where œâ denotes the edge between cells i and j h œâ is the estimated depth at the cell edge œâ a is the cell area l œâ is the length of the edge œâ z œâ is the water surface gradient across the edge with normal vector n œâ the gradient across an edge z œâ is defined as 23 z œâ z œâ h z x h z y œâ so that effectively 24 z œâ n œâ h j z j h i z i d œâ with d œâ the distance between cell centers perpendicular to edge œâ note that z œâ is well defined at the edge but h œâ is not and must be estimated to cope with its bi valuated nature at such edge approximating the value at the edge has implications in both the accuracy and efficiency of the method dottori and todini 2011 hunter et al 2005 mendicino et al 2015 the semi discretisation in eq 22 still requires to integrate in time adopting an explicit time discretisation approach a standard forward euler approximation the complete numerical scheme reads 25 h i n 1 h i n Œ¥ ti i n Œ¥ t a i œâ 1 n œâ h œâ n 5 3 n œâ z œâ n z œâ n n œâ l œâ eq 25 is the explicit finite volume solution to the zi approximation thus this is termed the fv zi solver as reported in the literature cea et al 2010 fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 leandro et al 2014 wang et al 2011 note again that this solver is often also inaccurately termed fv dw solver yen and tsai 2001 furthermore eq 25 does not require any particular shape or arrangement for the computational cells it allows for fully unstructured meshes with convex polygonal cells a particular case of this is of course a structured mesh of squared cells 4 review and discussion a key interest of this paper is to strongly point out that the fv zi solver in eq 25 cea et al 2010 fern√°ndez pato and garc√≠a navarro 2016 leandro et al 2014 wang et al 2011 is identical to the cellular automata approach described by eq 12 dottori and todini 2011 mendicino et al 2015 parsons and fonstad 2007 which is henceforth denoted ca zi and also identical to the so called raster based solvers bates and roo 2000 hunter et al 2005 or cell based solvers julien et al 1995 in other words ca zi solvers are at the core no different from fv zi solvers although obtained by reasoning which originates from a discrete system somewhat different technical approximations to different components may be the sole differences but this is also the case of different fv zi approaches by various authors this identity has been seldom pointed out which together with the wide variety of ca approaches see table 1 have lead to parallel literature from researchers in hydrology and geology and researchers in fluid dynamics and computational hydraulics this issue of terminology is also entangled with the misuse of the diffusive wave term for what the zero inertia equation although the zi equation is a dw equation not all dw equations are zi sivapalan et al 1997 yen and tsai 2001 it is relevant to point out that the definition of flux f is critical to the meaning and capabilities of ca solvers ca zi solvers identical to fv zi solvers are obtained when the flux f corresponds to the unit discharge momentum q i e eq 7 is equivalent to 15 evaluated with 16 another relevant choice in the numerical formulation common to models termed ca zi or fv zi is that depth must be estimated at the edge between two cells where it is bi valuated several studies from the ca literature dottori and todini 2011 mendicino et al 2015 hunter et al 2005 have shown showed that the na√Øve arithmetic mean between neighboring cells is computationally inefficient due to numerical stability issues in particular in the presence of complex topography dottori and todini 2011 and have proposed a more stable estimation hunter et al 2005 26 h œâ max h i z i h j z j max z i z j which has been also adopted in fv models identified as fv zi hinting the relevance of finding a common ground between the research communities similar to the fv zi solver in eq 19 is also that of lopez barrera et al 2012 which attempts to incorporate elements of the hyperbolicity present in the swe requiring a redefinition of the fluxes on the other hand the fv zi solver in eq 25 differs obviously from implicit approaches relying either on fv fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 or fe panday et al 2004 weill et al 2009 since it requires no matrix inversion and allows for direct parallelization the fv zi solver also differs clearly from other ca based approaches which input convenient yet not necessarily formal or physical expressions in the flux terms i e choosing a flux f different than the one spawning from manning s equation eq 7 or alternative friction laws which do not really account for the physics as described in the swe d ambrosio et al 2001 ghimire et al 2013 parsons and fonstad 2007 rinaldi et al 2007 shao et al 2015 e g or are not really dw zi simplifications bates et al 2010 the rather loose use of terminology in different communities seems to have encouraged parallel developments with researchers not benefiting from the knowledge base from related fields many studies in geological and hydrological related fields are based on the fv ca zi approach mainly because of the convenient simplicity of the equation and its numerical solution and some pointing out stability as a relevant issue mendicino et al 2015 however it has been pointed out that the price for simplicity is computational efficiency i e the ca zi approach can often be computationally more expensive than swe solvers cea et al 2010 fern√°ndez pato and garc√≠a navarro 2016 lopez barrera et al 2012 wang et al 2011 although studies have found the opposite dottori and todini 2011 martins et al 2017 the cost of the explicit zi solvers is related to stability issues thus justifying implicit approaches fern√°ndez pato and garc√≠a navarro 2016 panday et al 2004 weill et al 2009 which are not equivalent to ca zi solvers in terms of time discretisation although they solve the same partial differential equation pde it has been suggested that the high cost of solving zi explicitly is inherent to the equation wang et al 2011 and various researchers have independently proposed and studied ways to reduce the computational cost of the zi approximation by addressing the underlying stability issues some of the reasoning is obtained by following ideas from the stability of hyperbolic systems i e the courant friedrich lewy cfl condition lopez barrera et al 2012 wang et al 2011 dottori and todini 2011 and von neumann stability analysis hunter et al 2005 which is similar and consistent to stability analysis of parabolic elliptic equations such as the richards equation caviedes voulli√®me et al 2013 mendicino et al 2015 which shows a similar non linear behaviour as the zi approach interestingly it has also been pointed out that adding an inertial term to the zi equation without reverting to the full swe also reduces stability constrains bates et al 2010 dottori and todini 2011 an idea which should be further pursued table 1 presents a non exhaustive chronological review of many ca models reported in the literature for different types of surface flow simulation these ca models have smartly and conveniently selected fluxes which might represent the physics to some extent under certain conditions the table also includes a chronological review of many cfd based models most of which were developed for flood modelling in the table it can be seen that some models referred to as ca models are in fact fv solvers of a pde based reasoning which leads to zi equation the reported models are classified in terms of how they were termed by their authors how in fact they are spatially and temporally discretised how the flux f is formulated the definition of the neighborhood and the application intended by the authors some additional comments are included for clarifications and particular highlights authors might term their models ca but the model may in fact be a fv discretisation similarly authors might term their model to solve de dw equation but the flux formulation is stated as zi in the table in an effort to generate a consistent terminology one of the interesting observations to be drawn from table 1 is that there has been a continuous development of ca ca zi and fv zi solvers in the past 25 years nonetheless a number of recent publications have indeed tackled some of the complex issues such as stability mendicino et al 2015 or computational efficiency through local time stepping dottori and todini 2011 very recent publications have also provided new observations on the performance of the methods in contrast to swe solvers costabile et al 2017 fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 jahanbazi et al 2017 interestingly as a group these very recent papers still carry with them the mix of terminology pointed out in this paper even though some of them dottori and todini 2011 jahanbazi et al 2017 actually do realise and comment on the equivalent nature of the methodologies other very recent publications do still approach the problem from a strictly ca non fv zi approach exploring ad hoc flux formulations and algorithms liu et al 2015 ghimire et al 2013 shao et al 2015 table 1 also allows to visualize the range of modelling choices within the models most models reported in table 1 are explicit in time with the notable exceptions of panday et al 2004 2006 and weill et al 2009 all of which were intended to solve the zi equation coupled to richards equation which is commonly solved implicitly caviedes voulli√®me et al 2013 mendicino et al 2015 notable as well are the studies by lal 1998 who found that explicit solvers are less efficient than implicit solvers and by fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 who compared explicit and implicit fv zi solvers finding that implicit solvers may be more efficient than explicit solvers under certain conditions but not always it is striking that most of the zi solvers take an explicit approach since the parabolic nature of the zi equation classically calls for implicit solvers following von neumann stability analysis and to the significant problems that arise from the stability constrains of the explicit solution of zi mendicino et al 2015 this may be due to a combination the at times ca driven developments bates and roo 2000 hunter et al 2005 e g in which the ansatz is always based on an explicit update scheme contrary to what is classical and well established in numerical analysis nonetheless there is still an open debate on how to ensure the stability of the solver while keeping performance and efficiency with most authors favouring formal stability constrains a peclet like number depending on the square of the spatial resolution cea et al 2010 leandro et al 2014 mendicino et al 2015 hunter et al 2005 and others suggesting a less formal alternative approach lopez barrera et al 2012 jahanbazi et al 2017 wang et al 2011 of choosing a hyperbolic like stability constrain the courant friedrich lewy cfl condition proportional to the spatial resolution there is merit to this idea since the formal approach has been shown to both over restrict the time step dottori and todini 2011 and not strictly guarantee stability giving rise to the issue known as checkerboarding hunter et al 2005 hunter et al 2007 lopez barrera et al 2012 whereas keeping non formal constrains cfl number has been shown to work reasonably with significant less computational effort wang et al 2011 recently jahanbazi et al 2017 attempted to reduce the stability constrains of the zi approach drawing from the ca philosophy and implementing variations on the flux formulation to control the issues again making obvious for a need for efforts from both communities to converge arguably the trend to favour explicit solutions is also supported by a simpler implementation more intuitive interpretation of the scheme and the easiness of parallelization dottori and todini 2011 this observation is also supported by the fact that most ca fv zi solvers have been implemented for cartesian meshes again favouring simplicity of implementation interpretation and parallelization most of the reported models solving the zi inertia equation in particular those reported as ca have been implemented for cartesian square meshes and make use of the von neumann neighborhood two relevant points arise on this issue the first is that few models allow for triangular unstructured meshes cea et al 2010 costabile et al 2017 fern√°ndez pato et al 2016 lal 1998 whose use may be relevant to keep a low computational cost while ensuring accuracy caviedes voulli√®me et al 2012 the second is that none of the models reported as ca zi solvers use the moore neighborhood which can otherwise be found in ca models not based on zi this can be easily explained once ca zi solvers are seen as fv zi solvers since the moore neighborhood brings in an inconsistency it calls to compute a flux across a vertex a point an entity with zero length instead of across an edge other ca models which do not necessarily compute physical fluxes can and do use the moore neighborhood 5 conclusions this paper reviews the existing cellular automata and finite volume models reported in the past 25 years for the solution of surface flows such review leads to three key points i fv solvers developed to solve the zero inertia approximation to the shallow water equations are widely used and understood ii there is a variety of ca solvers to address shallow surface flows all of which rely on similar definitions of state variables but differ in the formulation of the fluxes and iii there is a subset of ca solvers which are in fact identical to fv zi solver given a particular choice of flux although originating from a different reasoning these facts which have seldom been pointed

7148,river bank erosion is controlled by a complex combination of factors and processes that play a main role in fluvial dynamics however the role played by lateral erosion in small low energy rivers functioning still needs to be better understood this study deals with the characterization and the quantification of the bank erosion of a small low energy river of the seine basin france in periurban catchment where urbanization had led to an incision and widening of the bed in the past decades using adapted monitoring surveys erosion pins and structure from motion photogrammetry the paper provides an opportunity to compare reach scale flux estimates using both techniques spatial and temporal variations in river bank rates were quantified over 16 months and the causes and controls of riverbank erosion were identified the estimated morphological activity rate ranges from 117 cm yr to 1 cm yr illustrating the very heterogeneous spatio temporal pattern of bank erosion observed on the merantaise river whereas a number of studies consider subaerial processes as the dominant processes fluvial erosion was found to be the most significant causal process and in particular the mean discharge of floods however the high local variability of the bank erosion of the studied river appears to be controlled by very local factors such as the bank angle the presence of a berm at the bank

kinds of alterations to the river bed and floodplain hooke 1979 grospr√™tre 2011 henshaw et al 2012 hamel et al 2013 marteau et al 2016 it is also a necessary ecological process conditioning many aspects of ecosystem diversity pi√©gay et al 1997 laubel et al 2003 river bank retreat is a complex process of geomorphological dynamics occurring through a combination of three primary mechanisms

couper et al 2002 wynn et al 2008 wallemacq et al 2011 hamel et al 2013 furthermore subsurface processes as seepage erosion fox and felice 2014 fox et al 2007 masoodi et al 2018 samadi et al 2013 can be associated to the later the first two types of processes are considered as the dominant processes whereas the third type involving subaerial and subsurface processes is often viewed as a preparatory process lawler 1993 prosser et al 2000 couper and maddock 2001 luppi et al 2009 these three bank erosion mechanisms operate at different levels of magnitude and frequency occurring over different time and spatial scales bank erosion has been extensively studied on large rivers and on torrential streams because they are quite dynamic and are subject to frequent and significant hydromorphological adjustments surian 1999 dapporto et al 2003 rinaldi 2003 lespez et al 2015 small low energy rivers are much less energetic and though still relatively unknown are commonly considered as immobile and subject to only minor hydromorphological adjustments corbonnois et al 2016 these types of rivers however are a key area of concern from an ecological and river management perspective and the role played by lateral erosion in their functioning still needs to be better understood this is especially true in a periurban context where catchments are often subject to recent land use changes related to rapid urbanisation leading to noticeable hydromorphological changes in the channel chin 2006 navratil et al 2012 braud et al 2013 one of the reasons why bank erosion of low energy rivers has still been largely neglected is probably related to the difficulty of assessing weak and spatially discontinuous lateral erosion however a range of new remote sensing techniques allow weak topographical adjustments that were hardly noticeable using traditional techniques to be measured and quantified tarolli 2014 among these new methods are techniques based on photo electronic erosion pin peep sensors lawler 1993 1991 2008 laser scanners tls picco et al 2013 aerial light detection and ranging lidar cavalli and tarolli 2011 high resolution gps and structure from motion photogrammetry carbonneau et al 2003 heritage and hetherington 2007 alho et al 2009 notebaert et al 2009 brasington 2010 h√∂fle and rutzinger 2011 hohenthal et al 2011 westoby et al 2012 fonstad et al 2013 dietrich 2014 however some of these high functioning techniques are still difficult to apply in small lowland rivers because of the limited locations rough topography and afforestation in the bottoms of valleys bird et al 2010 nevertheless two methods seem better adapted to this particular topographical context i erosion pin surveys a well known technique and ii structure from motion photogrammetry a method developed over recent decades the principal aims of this paper are i to hydromorphologically characterize and quantify the bank erosion of a small periurban river i e measure the bank erosion and identify the determining factors that control bank erosion in this kind of low energy river bank protection hydrological conditions and geological context other local factors ii to technically assess two viable methods that are well adapted to the difficult field conditions and are user friendly inexpensive and easy to use erosion pins and structure from motion photogrammetry finally this paper will be an opportunity to compare reach scale flux estimates based on these two complementary techniques and validate them 2 study site 2 1 location and description of the merantaise river the merantaise river is a small stream 13 km long draining a catchment area of 36 km2 in the southern suburbs of the french city of paris fig 1 the hydro climatic context relies on a rather constant rainfall distribution throughout the year mean annual precipitation of 700 mm yr and a mainly pluvial and seasonal contrasted hydrological regime high flows occur in winter and flood flushes related to heavy rains or thunderstorms may occur from the autumn to spring seasons and occasionally in summer the inter annual mean discharge 2011 2014 registered at the gauging station 21 km2 fig 1 is around 0 05 m3 s with a significant distinction between the winter mean discharge of 0 07 m3 s and the summer mean discharge of 0 03 m3 s the maximum peak discharge measured since 2012 is 2 85 m3 s table 1 summarizes the hydrological and morphological characteristics of the river it is a river with a moderate slope 0 7 though rather high for the region and the grain size of its bed ranges from sand to gravel mean d50 19 mm the merantaise catchment is situated in the center of the paris basin meso cenozoic sedimentary basin and its valley is incised in the fontainebleau sands middle oligocene which constitute an important part of the geological underground of the region and provide the sandy fraction of the river bed material gravels stem from the montmorency cavernous silicified limestone upper oligocene layer that stands directly above the thick fontainebleau sand layer the merantaise river channel has been artificialized through historical engineering following several centuries of industrial and agricultural uses mills dams diversion gates wash houses and channelization of the river course have modified the stream morphodynamics and its hydrological regime for centuries more recently the merantaise catchment has been subject to a new type of disturbance through the modification of its catchment s land use recent decades have indeed been marked by a rapid and massive urbanisation of the catchment as shown in numerous studies in france bravard and petit 2000 grospr√™tre 2011 navratil et al 2013 urban impervious surfaces have been multiplied by more than 10 in the last decades e g from 3 to 32 on the merantaise catchment between 1947 and 2015 decreasing the rain interception and infiltration rate and increasing flood occurrence and magnitude the consequences of these changes on the river correspond to a general incision and a widening of the channel comparison of cross sectional and longitudinal profiles from the 80 s show an average incision of 50 cm and a widening up to 2 m over the past three decades vertical erosion is now limited either because the bedrock outcrops compact clay have been cleared by incision and or because the bed has been locally armoured lateral erosion seems on the contrary to be still quite active especially since vertical adjustments are impossible assani and petit 2004 2 2 location and characterization of the study reaches bank erosion was assessed at six reaches distributed along the 13 km of the river course fig 1 and table 2 they were selected in order to have a wide range of erosion situations in terms of bank stability state of erosion height and slope of the banks and potential dynamics of the erosion processes wallemacq et al 2011 table 2 and fig 2 summarize the characteristics of the six studied reaches single thread channels with alluvial gravel sand material 1 20 2 40 m high and 2 5 8 m in width depending of the reaches with different local hydromorphological contexts such as riffles or pools linear or concave banks and large or straight channels small but representative sections 4 5 10 m long were generally considered because of the relative homogeneity of the local hydromorphological context at each study reach a larger window of observation 25 m long was considered for reach 4 because of the importance of the active and differential erosion observed the river banks are mainly composed of sand and silt 90 with clay making up only ten percent of the bank the banks may be considered as homogenous over their vertical profiles as only very few stratigraphical variations were observed the merantaise banks are either entirely or partially covered by vegetation grass scrub or tree roots or completely bare from the bottom to the top of the bank 48 5 of the 13 km studied may be considered as having vegetated banks and 46 2 of banks are free of vegetation and potentially erodible the remaining 5 3 consists of riverbank protections preventing bank erosion as an initial approach the vegetated reaches were considered as stable and the bare reaches were considered as potentially erodible and thus dynamic moreover some features such as failed bank materials or overhanging vegetation cover gave indications of the lateral erosion intensity four out of the six selected reaches 1 4 5 and 6 were almost entirely free of vegetation and thus potentially dynamic only reaches 2 and 3 were highly vegetated with respectively 60 and 40 vegetation cover suggesting a weaker erodibility of the bank we chose to equip two sites with many recent erosion scars reaches 1 and 4 two moderately scarred reaches 5 and 6 one poorly marked reach 3 and one reach with no visible erosion marks reach 2 3 materials and methods the aim of this paper is to characterise and quantify the bank erosion of a small low energy river the river in question is generally subject to weak and discontinuous erosion that is difficult to assess corbonnois et al 2016 two main categories of methods to measure bank erosion at the front of the bank are usually identified on the one hand methods which record punctual information such as erosion pins surveys and peep photo electric erosion pins lawler 1992 1991 2008 on the other hand methods which continuously record data such as structure from motion photogrammetry westoby et al 2012 fonstad et al 2013 dietrich 2014 or terrestrial laser scans tls picco et al 2013 3 1 erosion pin surveys the lateral mobility of the bank on the merantaise river was monitored with the widely used erosion pins technique e g wolman 1959 slaymaker 1972 hill 1973 thorne and lewin 1979 thorne and tovey 1981 hooke 1979 1980 gardiner 1983 hagerty et al 1983 murgatroyd and ternan 1983 lawler 1986 lawler et al 1997 1999 ashbridge 1995 stott 1997 1999 couper and maddock 2001 luppi et al 2009 wallemacq et al 2011 henshaw et al 2012 though lawler 1993 recommended the use of 0 25 or 0 5 m long pins in his comprehensive review of the advantages and disadvantages of the method we chose to insert metal rods of 1 m long and 8 mm in diameter into the bank couper and maddock 2001 stated that short pins could be lost through erosion when longer ones may contribute to the stabilization of soil blocks but in our case knowing the erosion potential of the merantaise river through prior field observations using 1 m long metal rods seemed to be the most suitable option hooke 1979 depending on the length of the reach between 9 and 12 pins were set down on each site along 3 or 4 vertical profiles placed 2 to 3 m apart the pins were benchmarks against which bank erosion could be measured haigh 1977 lawler 1978 couper et al 2002 each vertical profile contained 3 pins in order to monitor the top tb the middle mb and the bottom bb of the bank as demonstrated by numerous authors these three parts of the bank do not necessarily evolve simultaneously and may respond to different erosion processes darby et al 2007 hamel et al 2013 luppi et al 2009 for instance the roots of floodplain vegetation generally ensure protection against erosion of the top of the bank laubel et al 2003 wallemacq et al 2011 the top and the middle parts of the bank are subject to greater weathering weakening and mass wasting and the bottom part is the one that is directly concerned by fluvial erosion bank retreat was assessed by measuring the length of the pins exposed beyond the bank at frequent intervals and after every flood event lawler et al 1997 the measurements were considered as morphological activity from 1 cm in order to exclude a potential error due to the readings of the pins in the most dynamic banks the pins had to be pushed back into the bank when it was exposed by more than 50 cm stott 1997 it should be noted that when the bank retreat measurement was very small we observed that it did not always correspond to effective erosion but rather to slight and very local scouring in the immediate vicinity of the erosion pins already identified as pin craters by lawler 1993 stott 1997 the survey of the erosion pins lasted 15 months from september 2013 to december 2014 for reaches 1 2 3 5 and 6 and 18 months from june 2013 to december 2014 for reach 4 all pins were surveyed on 31 occasions 35 for r4 which represented more than 2000 individual pin readings 3 2 structure from motion photogrammetry survey sfm the second method used for the bank erosion study is structure from motion photogrammetry sfm this survey technique permits a continuous and greater surface observation and quantification of riverbank erosion according to the local context it has only been used for the modelling survey of reach 4 as a complementary method to erosion pins bank erosion in reach 4 by sfm was monitored over 18 months from june 2013 to december 2014 the structure from motion photogrammetry method is a photogrammetric methodology for collecting low cost high spatial resolution three dimensional data for topographic or surface modelling allowing the generation of 3d point clouds from randomly acquired photosets f√∂rstner 1986 harris and stephens 1988 lowe 1999 2004 javernick et al 2014 considering the number of sfm papers that have been published westoby et al 2012 dietrich 2014 2016 micheletti et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015a marteau et al 2017 this technique seems to be becoming more popular for image acquisition the bank was cleared of non fixed vegetation dead leaves and hanging roots approximately ten ground control points gcps survey marking nails were then randomly positioned on the bank and surveyed with a trimble s6 total station operated on a local coordinate system fig 3 a due to the bank instability mass failure and fluvial erosion the survey nails were systematically removed after each sfm campaign and repositioned for the next one the total station was always repositioned at the exact same place and its location was verified before and after each fieldwork measurement using control points placed on fixed features in the studied area total station error was systematically 1 cm at each sfm campaign finally a large set of overlapping oblique photographs around one hundred taken with a canon eos 1000d was collected they provided images with a 70 80 side overlap the photographs were taken approximately 2 6 m from the bank predominantly opposite and at an angle to the target the set of images was then processed using the visualsfm free software wu 2007 2011 wu et al 2011 that gathers photographs from features present in multiple images despite the changes in viewpoints scales or settings by running the scale invariant feature transform sift algorithm from lowe 1999 2004 snavely 2008 westoby et al 2012 fig 3b the point cloud obtained is then downloaded from visualsfm and run on cloudcompare v 2 5 5 2 software girardeau montaut 2014 given the small study area extraneous points that were clearly errors were manually removed from the point cloud for example the top vegetated part of the bank or the bottom part of the bank in the water i e 10 to 20 cm depending on the reaches prosdocimi et al 2015a the point cloud was then georeferenced in our local coordinate system with the gcps previously surveyed on the field we verified the georeferencing of the point clouds in cloudcompare comparing the positioning of the gcps to the values of gcp surveying with the total station rmse errors of the different sfm campaigns are compiled in table 3 they never exceeded 8 mm at the end of the process we obtained a series of point clouds corresponding to the 3d image of the bank showing the bank situation at different dates to quantify the changes between two dates we used the multiscale model to model cloud comparison m3c2 method from lague et al 2013 implemented on cloudcompare v 2 5 5 2 software girardeau montaut 2014 fig 3c m3c2 is an algorithm that measures the distance between two point clouds assuming that they correspond to successive surveys of the same object m3c2 generates a new point cloud with these point cloud to point cloud distances and provides a confidence interval for each distance measurement depending on the point cloud roughness and registration error lague et al 2013 after m3c2 transformation the new point cloud is processed in arcgis 10 2 to generate a dem in order to measure erosion and deposition volumes fonstad et al 2013 javernick et al 2014 rumsby et al 2008 wheaton et al 2009 3 3 discrepancy between erosion pins and sfm photogrammetry this paper presents an opportunity to compare the two techniques used and verify the relevance of the widely used erosion pins method numerous studies try to validate and compare the sfm photogrammetry technique to other high resolution techniques used to characterised geomorphical changes such as tls prosdocimi et al 2015b smith and vericat 2015 marteau et al 2016 or lidar corbonnois et al 2016 but there is not yet a comparison and validation of sfm photogrammetry and erosion pin monitoring we chose therefore to test our results on reach 4 where pins and sfm were both used to assess the accuracy of the pins to the high resolution results from sfm photogrammetry and the proper georeferencing of the sfm point clouds in a first approach we compared the bank retreat values for a maximum of available common points about fifty identifiable erosion pins on sfm point clouds for the nine monitoring campaigns the average deviation was always lower than 3 cm with an average discrepancy was 0 5 cm fig 4 the eroded volume calculated from erosion pins interpolated from bank retreat at each pin location were then compared to that calculated with sfm photogrammetry in a common window and for each period the sfm layer was then considered as the reference as a reminder 12 pins were installed on an empirical basis on reach 4 on a grid of 0 50 m of vertical spacing and 2 m of horizontal spacing simulations of erosion pin grids were generated from the sfm m3c2 point clouds in order to estimate the pins density that best represent bank erosion retreat two types of grids were tested symmetrical and random ones in order to verify the potential interest of one or the other fig 5 the grids were generated from the semivariogram established on arcgis 10 2 associated with the interpolation kriging semivariogram shows indeed the maximum of variance of point clouds and allows to identify the maximum spacing between the erosion pins needed to take account the bank erosion variability this spacing and half of this spacing were then used to generate the pins grids that where compared to the reference sfm points cloud 3 4 hydrological survey during the 18 months of the survey the hydrological and climatic conditions were monitored fig 6 the meteorological conditions rainfall and temperature were registered using the meteorological station at toussus le noble located 2 5 km away from the study reach fig 1 the water level was recorded at 15 min intervals using a water pressure sensor mini diver di501 sensor by schlumberger installed between reaches 3 and 4 fig 1 due to the relatively small size of the river we consider the hydrological data at the gauging station to be representative of the entire length of the river course mean daily discharge was 0 04 0 05 m3 s while the maximum peak discharge measured during the period of investigation was 2 85 m3 s fourteen peak discharges higher than 0 115 m3 s occurred during the study period mainly during autumn and winter 2013 2014 the water level never exceeded 60 cm during high flow covering only the lower part of the banks in every study site the bank full stage is indeed no longer attained due to the extent of incision three descriptors frequently used in the literature were considered in characterizing the hydrological context peak discharge the number of flood events and their duration wolman 1959 hooke 1979 knighton 1973 d√©pret et al 2015 in this study flood events were defined as events that exceeded the smallest peak discharge recorded i e 0 115 m3 s 4 results 4 1 differential erosion in bank removal assessed with the erosion pins erosion pin surveys allowed the morphological activity of the bank during each measurement period to be identified and measured in terms of erosion and deposition as well as spatial and temporal variations 8 7 of the erosion pins recorded a morphological activity however this is a conservative estimate due to the lack of data on buried erosion pins the majority of the values were positive and corresponded to bank retreat 91 of the moving pins but during the 16 months of monitoring 9 of the morphological activity corresponded to deposition negative values i e a decrease in the length of pin exposed at 3 out of the 6 reaches these negative recordings interfere with the estimation and interpretation of the bank retreat couper et al 2002 stott 1999 recognized the implications of negative readings for subsequent data analysis and identified three potential methods of dealing with this data 1 include all negative readings in the calculation of mean erosion 2 ignore all negatives and treat them as missing data 3 replace all negatives with zero we chose to quantify the bank retreat in two different ways i by ignoring the negative data missing data thus strictly considering the bank retreat total retreat expressed in cm in table 4 and ii by considering both positive and negative values for the characterisation of the morphological activity rate expressed in cm yr in table 4 hooke 1979 lawler 1986 stott 1997 couper and maddock 2001 henshaw et al 2012 during our field investigation the negative readings generally occurred on the lower erosion pins when soil from the upper parts of the bank fell down but it also happened sparingly in the upper part of the bank probably caused by the expansion of the soil mass due to increased moisture henshaw et al 2012 seepage porcesses samadi et al 2013 masoodi et al 2018 or due to compaction of the soil by walkers along the bank spatial variation in morphological activity shows a great heterogeneity when considering the cumulative activity over the 16 months of the survey fig 7 effective erosion of the bank occurred in relation to 63 of the erosion pins 33 of the 21 vertical profiles were subject to morphological activity on the 3 layers of the bank bottom of the bed bb middle of the bed mb and top of the bed tb whereas 67 were subject to partial mobilisation of the bank six profiles 29 had two active layers and seven profiles 33 had only one active layer mostly bb only one profile was completely inactive in terms of bank retreat profile 2 at reach 2 the highest recorded morphological activity rate at an individual erosion pin location was 117 cm yr r4 p3 bb while the minimum recorded morphological activity rate was below 1 cm yr mostly at tb and mb three reaches r1 r4 and r5 experienced a significant retreat of their banks with the rate of retreat ranging from 25 to more than 100 cm yr fig 7 every vertical profile was eroded in these reaches and the entire height of the bank retreated the three other reaches r2 r3 and r6 were less dynamic with low bank erosion and even the absence of erosion at the location of some erosion pins furthermore fieldwork observations suggest that bank erosion recorded at the bottom layer at r2 r3 and r6 could result from the disruptive role of the metal rods hammered into the bank for the erosion pins survey barker et al 1997 henshaw et al 2012 on these less dynamic reaches one may moreover note the vertical heterogeneity of the erosion rate the erosion occurred mainly at bb and tb when mb recorded no bank retreat on the six reaches activity of the medium and upper part of the bank evolves rather conjointly since a stepwise regression made between bank retreat at tb and mb shows a 90 correlation conversely the upper part of the bank is rather independent of the evolution of tb and mb the bottom of the bank bb was clearly the most dynamic part in terms of the percentage of pins that recorded erosion the great heterogeneity of the bank erosion may also be examined through the total bank retreat and the morphological activity registered at the most active profiles of the 6 reaches r1 p3 r2 p1 r3 p2 r4 p3 r5 p3 and r6 p3 table 4 three out of six profiles registered significant bank erosion activity r1 p3 23 r4 p3 34 and r5 p3 14 the three others r2 p1 r3 p2 and r6 p3 experienced very weak morphological activity with a maxima of 5 of the readings recording erosion a mean bank retreat below 0 8 cm and no activity on the middle and top of the bank the maximums of bank retreat may be considered as relatively important for this small low energy stream with 35 40 cm of material lost between two surveys of the pins corresponding to a few weeks however when considering the mean values of bank retreat this high erosion rate has to be weighted when considering all reaches the mean morphological activity between two surveys was indeed between 0 05 cm yr r2 p1 and 3 0 cm yr r4 p3 the most dynamic profile was r4 p3 with 34 of readings recording bank evolution erosion and or deposition this high rate of morphological activity is still a conservative estimate because proper readings of the evolution of the bank along the pins were often complicated due to frequent depositions at the bank toe i e buried pins though very active r4 p3 did not register the most important bank retreat absolute values which occurred at the top of the bank tb on r5 p3 there 40 cm of bank were eroded in one go however this was the only movement of the bank observed during the entire survey 3 of morphological activity 4 2 the causal mechanisms of bank erosion the causal mechanisms and hydrometeorological parameters potentially responsible for the bank erosion were examined through statistical analysis regression and correlation tests all pins at all reaches were considered in a first stage the particularities of the different reaches were then examined reach by reach finally regarding the small morphological activity at certain sites analyses were focused on the two most dynamic reaches three bank erosion variables were compared with independent variables by spearman or pearson correlation analysis and simple regressions the effective bank retreat measured for each period and each reach at tb etb and bb ebb and the maximum effective bank retreat registered at the profiles all levels combined emax mb was not considered because it was too correlated with tb the erosion bank values were loge transformed prior to statistical analysis when the corresponding data set distributions were not normal pearson correlation coefficients were then calculated if the data distribution did not remain normal after the transformation the spearman correlation coefficients were calculated simple and multiple regressions were also made in order to propose causal relationships between the variables the latter was established only on the data set gathering r1 and r4 data and using only significant variables i e p value 0 05 laubel et al 2003 as depositions were not included in the quantitative analysis the results presented consider only effective erosion data a selection of factors likely to control erosion are listed in table 5 and have been chosen on the basis of those commonly used in literature wolman 1959 knighton 1973 hooke 1979 couper and maddock 2001 couper 2003 julian and torres 2006 henshaw et al 2012 d√©pret et al 2015 though commonly considered as erosion factors seepage freeze thaw and moisture of the soil have not been considered in this study wolman 1959 twidale 1964 hooke 1979 prosser et al 2000 couper and maddock 2001 hamel et al 2013 masoodi et al 2018 one may indeed consider that no significant freezing conditions occurred during the study wallemacq et al 2011 suggested that the action of freezing on erosion as a preparatory factor requires temperatures below 5 c over several consecutive nights to be effective during the 16 months of the survey only 20 freezing days and nights were recorded corresponding to 130 effective hours of freeze rarely below 5 c fig 6 besides no evidence of needle ice on the banks as described by wallemacq et al 2011 was noticed considering soil moisture and seepage erosion it was unfortunately not possible to carry out direct measurements on the merantaise river this parameter was consequently approached through the precipitation descriptors rsum rmax rmoy rint table 5 the morphological parameters silt and clay index and vegetation cover were treated independently they were measured for all of the profiles at each of the reaches but only once at the beginning of the study they were therefore the same for each period the spearman for all reaches and pearson for r1 and r4 correlation coefficients between the bank retreat and the hydrometeorological control parameters are presented in tables 6a and b respectively i while considering all the reaches the first table table 6a shows the predominance of the fluvial parameters in controlling bank erosion this is the mean discharge of floods registered during the considered period qmoy fl that is most correlated to bank erosion variables it is particularly true for the top of the bank tb where r 0 81 p value 0 0001 was reached the peak discharge qmax also seems significantly correlated to bank erosion for the tb and the maximum erosion in contrast the subaerial processes illustrated by the meteorological parameters are poorly correlated to bank erosion the spearman correlation coefficients are very low and the p values show no significant correlations ii while considering r1 and r4 i e most active reaches the same independent variables are highlighted and no additional correlations may be identified table 6b the analysis of erosion processes reach by reach also showed the same trends for example for r1 qmoy fl was the only significant variable with an r value of 0 72 with emax n 23 and 0 57 with ebb n 21 it should however be noted that some good correlations appear at r4 between emax and all hydrological parameters qmax r 0 62 p value 0 0002 qvol r 0 7 p value 0 0001 qmoy fl r 0 64 p value 0 0002 and d fl r 0 67 p value 0 0001 with a maximum of r 0 82 p value 0 0001 observed for qmoy fl at the top of the bank finally simple regression analysis was used considering all reaches combined r1 to r6 and the two most dynamic reaches r1 and r4 fig 8 even if the coefficients of determination r2 are low some of them show relatively good relationships between the two identified variables it is once again qmoy fl that best explains the bank erosion and it is at the top of the bank that the model best fits the data r2 0 6 for all the reaches as well as r1 and r4 all these statistical analyses converge and indicate that for all reaches only two correlated independent variables clearly play a key role in bank erosion mean discharge of floods qmoy fl and peak discharges qmax meteorological variables seem very poorly correlated to bank retreat some of the other hydrological parameters are more or less correlated to erosion but if considered alone the role they play is weak the statistical analysis finally shows that theses correlations exist for the top and bottom of the bank but are clearly stronger when considering the upper part of the bank furthermore the correlation pearson with the morphological parameters sci and bank vegetation cover and the bank erosion were made considering the amount of the bank retreat tb mb and bb and the same sci and bank vegetation cover for the 15 months of survey it then appeared that the sci and the bank erosion were poorly correlated r2 0 21 0 03 and 0 12 when the bank vegetation cover was better correlated to erosion bank on tb and mb r2 0 46 and 0 47 respectively the bb was less concerned by vegetation cover and more intensively scoured by fluvial erosion thus the silt and clay index i e the ratio between the volume of particles smaller than 74 ¬µm and the amount of the bank sample schumm 1977 which determined the cohesiveness of the bank and the potential vulnerability to the freeze thaw processes couper 2003 grab 2004 wallemacq et al 2011 is included between 34 and 89 table 2 the high level of the sci and the vegetation cover can explain the low vulnerability to the subaerial processes of the merantaise banks all this suggests that if predictably peak discharge is key the duration of high flow is at least as important in other words this indicates that bank retreat on the merantaise does not usually work in sudden pulses but rather as a semi continuous process during high flow 4 3 differential erosion in bank removal assessed with sfm photogrammetry sfm photogrammetry allows a finer description of bank retreat and was thus used at reach 4 in order to better understand the processes involved in the morphological dynamic of the bank fig 9 the evolution of this reach has been divided into 9 periods that correspond to the dates between sfm surveys fig 9a presents the evolution of the bank for each of the nine periods and fig 9b shows the cross sectional evolution in the central location of the bank rectangle on fig 9a where the dynamic was maximal the largest peak flow recorded during this study occurred during the first period on the 19th of june 2013 with a discharge of 2 84 m3 s fig 6 it generated severe erosion on bb in zones ii and iii 150 cm of bank retreat and on tb in zones i and iv 20 50 cm of collapsed sediment from the top of the bank was deposited at the bottom of the bank in zones i and iv the bank material eroded in bb was evacuated by the flow mostly during the peak flow the greatest episode of bank erosion occurred during the second period that may be related to the second highest flood event 2 08 m3 s that occurred on the 9th and 10th of november 2013 erosion occurred mainly in zones ii and iii with 35 80 cm of sediment eroded from the middle and the top of the bank the failed bank materials were deposited at the bank toe forming a berm wider than 140 cm fig 10 provides complementary observations based on the erosion pins survey one may see that bb actually experienced a continuous retreat throughout period 2 increasing the height and slope of the bank just before the flood event on the 9 10th of november the bank had a sub vertical face allowing undercutting that played the role of triggering cantilever bank failure the collapsed bank material was mostly deposited on bb and to a lesser extent on mb as observed by nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 the berm formed by riverbank failure in sections 2 and 3 then constituted a defence for the upper layers mb and tb by decreasing the bank slope and stabilizing the bank during period 3 erosion was therefore very limited despite several significant peak flows 0 98 m3 s and 1 43 m3 s only the bottom layer bb in zones iii and iv was slightly eroded the flows slowly undercut the unconsolidated material collapsed during period 2 on average over period 3 the bank toe retreated by 10 to 25 cm with a maximum of 50 cm during the following periods 4 and 5 the hydrograph shows very weak water level rises only slight bank face changes occurred then the bank toe and the entire surface of the bank were eroded the hydrograph fig 6 suggests that fluvial processes played a minor role during this period and that aerial processes rain frost etc are more likely to have been responsible for those slight morphological adjustments the most significant changes appeared on the middle layer mb this corresponds to mass failures such as slides and slumps of the material towards the bottom layer it mainly occurred in zones ii iii and iv with 20 35 cm of material sliding to the bottom layer and a maximum of 50 cm on section 4 period 6 and period 7 are marked by a return of high flows 0 90 m3 s 1 55 m3 s 2 08 m3 s and a significant retreat of the bottom of the bank especially in the downstream part of the reach zones iii and iv a cumulative erosion of more than 150 cm was recorded most of which concerned mb and bb the top of the bank essentially remained stable from february 2014 period 3 this evolution continued until november 2014 period 8 an erosion retreat of 40 50 cm was calculated in zones iiib and ivb leaving a cutting zone at the bottom of the bank for the first time since the summer of 2013 significant erosion also occurred on the most downstream part of the reach zone iv despite the lack of significant peak flow 0 5 m3 s but due to the erosion of the berm protecting the bank immediately upstream zones ii and iii this section was more exposed to fluvial erosion moreover the bank here was steeper and thus more sensitive to erosion an average 30 cm retreat was measured the last period 9 from november to december 2014 corresponds to a new cycle of mobilisation of the bank material as observed in november 2013 period 2 but with lower intensity the top and middle layers were eroded especially on zones ii and iii and on the downstream section of zone iv on one hand a maximum of 45 cm was eroded for an average retreat of 30 cm on the other hand a maximum accumulation of 75 cm occurred for an average deposition of 50 cm in zone iv the deposits at the bottom layer were quickly evacuated as they faced the direction of flow finally one may say that bank erosion on reach 4 may be described as a cycle mainly correlated to the hydrograph fig 11 at first the base of the bank is destabilized by high flows generating the removal of a large amount of material from the bottom and middle part of the bank the top of the bank is then exposed and weakened and may drop off or slump the failed material deposits at the bank toe and forms a berm of unconsolidated sediment that prevents any bank retreat it is then progressively evacuated by moderate water rises concomitantly bank adjustments occur at the top and middle part of the bank mostly due to subaerial processes once the berm has been evacuated and the bank has recovered a subvertical posture exposing its entire height to high flow the cycle restarts and the bank retreats once again 4 4 comparison between erosion pins and sfm photogrammetry one aim of this paper is to propose a review of the discrepancy in resolution of the two methods used if the pins allow several reaches to be easily studied due to the simplicity of implementation and surveying sfm photogrammetry allows a finer analysis and reduces the amount of bias even if the erosion pins are a proven means of bank retreat measurement their use is limited when eroded volumes or sediment budget have to be calculated the number of pins and their positioning have been discussed in the literature lawler 1993 couper et al 2002 laubel et al 2003 but recommendations rely on an empirical approach and no papers have yet proposed any quantification of the accuracy of the technique first fig 12 shows that the density of pins we chose to install gave a relatively good appreciation of the effective volume of eroded sediment but only when the bank retreat was low i e for period 4 Œ¥ 0 16 m3 and period 5 Œ¥ 0 12 m3 when morphological activity was high i e during period 1 and 2 the number of pins and their location were much less efficient in correctly quantifying the volume of eroded bank pins underestimated the eroded volume by up to twice the actual eroded volume for period 1 the erosion pins for instance provided an estimation of 1 04 m3 of bank erosion while sfm estimated 2 38 m3 of eroded material as a reminder the reach 4 measured 25 5 m in length table 2 secondly fig 12 shows that on reach 4 a rather good estimation of the eroded volume may be reached with about thirty pins placed 1 5 m apart horizontally and 0 8 m apart vertically this result is valid for the nine periods studied and is thus independent of the magnitude of erosion activity moreover it appears that the symmetrical implantation scheme is more efficient than the random one the minimum distance of 1 5 m between the rods symmetrically inserted allowed a perfect correlation between the volume of bank retreat estimated by sfm and that estimated by a simulated erosion pin grid meanwhile for the same minimum distance of 1 5 m between the rods with a random grid there is a ratio of 1 4 5 discussion 5 1 the accuracy of erosion pins the results of these simple tests of comparison between the two methods of erosion assessment implemented on reach 4 clearly show that if erosion pins provide accurate results on bank retreat the pins have to be considered with caution with regard to the quantification of the eroded surface or volume some complementary tests made on different types of river banks with different erosion patterns is still needed to increase the precision of our results but it may already be stated that in these small energy streams if pins provide a rather good erosion rate at the exact location of the pins extrapolations between them are hazardous our results suggest moreover that the implementation of the pins following a symmetric grid is the most efficient and that the multiplication of the erosion pins does not seem to improve the representativeness of the network this goes against what may be seen in most of the studies using erosion pins up to now existing literature was indeed unable to show an ideal model of number and distribution of erosion pins for all river systems lawler 1993 couper et al 2002 in most studies a large number of pins and a mean distance between pins below 1 m horizontally and below 30 cm vertically have been favoured table 7 on a rather dynamic bank such as reach 4 of the merantaise river reducing the space below 1 5 m horizontally with a fixed spacing of 0 8 m vertically did not improve the quality of the data if a symmetrical implementation of the pins is chosen however one of the advantages of the erosion pins survey over the sfm photogrammetry is that this method may be used under water level this comparison between the results from a spatially almost continuous technique sfm and a discrete one pins applied on a same study site emphasises the great variability of erosion that occurs within a bank reach of a few meters long where bank erosion is limited fig 9 shows moreover that this variability is lateral but also and perhaps above all vertical similarly to what had been seen in numerous previous studies the bottom bb middle mb and top tb of the bank appear to evolve at different time scales because of the different erosion processes involved hooke 1979 couper and maddock 2001 nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 henshaw et al 2012 while subaerial and subsurface processes are commonly consider as preparatory processes which weakening the surface of the bank fluvial erosion and mass failure are two processes linked through the concept of basal endpoint control described by carson and kirkby 1972 and later by thorne 1978 1982 couper and maddock 2001 wood et al 2001 this concept of basal endpoint control highlights the complexity and the interconnection of the bank retreat and the explanatory processes indeed as reported by thorne and osman 1988 continued retreat through mass failure requires basal clean out of slumped debris as this depends entirely on fluvial entrainment rates of retreat by mass failure are fluvially controlled even though the mass stability of the bank is not directly related to flow forces this was the same pattern of erosion occurring on a low energy streams such as the merantaise where the erosion and transport capacity are very limited indeed because of the relative small size of the catchment and the recent incision of the bed following from urbanization the bankfull level is never reached and water level at high flow never exceeds one third of the bank height the collapsed material is consequently never fully submerged and floods are usually not energetic enough to fully generate erosion i e scour and transport shear stress has proven to be high enough to scour the bank but this was often too low to evacuate all of the eroded material as it was produced several high flow events were therefore necessary to clear the bank toe this is the main reason why the correlations between bank retreat and fluvial descriptors are not as good as expected correlation coefficient ranging between 0 4 and 0 8 though they highlight the dominance of the fluvial erosion variables especially through mean flood discharge qmoy fl and peak discharge qmax these correlations are weaker than those presented in the literature hooke 1979 julian and torres 2006 henshaw et al 2012 henshaw et al 2012 have for instance shown that fluvial erosion accounts for bank erosion at 89 of erosion pin locations in several british upland catchments it is worth repeating that the subaerial processes may not be considered in this study as weakening the correlation to fluvial factors as it has been shown in numerous studies on small headwater catchments lawler 1986 1993 stott 1997 prosser et al 2000 couper and maddock 2001 wallemacq et al 2011 hamel et al 2013 on the merantaise as also shown by henshaw et al 2012 precipitation and frost do not significantly influence bank retreat tables 6a and b this is probably because most of the study reaches are located in a forested area that intercepts a significant part of the rainfall and clearly because no significant conditions of frost were recorded during the study julian and torres 2006 studied an urban stream sand river which like the merantaise was incising they demonstrated for their part that hydraulic erosion was mainly dictated by the peak flow intensities our results are slightly divergent as we show that peak flow alone may not fully explain bank erosion in our case it is the mean flood discharge that is best correlated to bank retreat this suggests that the intensity of the flood water level and flow velocity is key but also that the duration of the event is important though peak flows generated by summer storms can be highly morphogenous i e the june 2013 storm event was responsible for a loss of 4 06 m3 of bank material at r4 it is rather the addition of medium events that will allow bank scour or evacuation of collapsed materials these different findings between our two studies may be explained by the cohesiveness of the bank that is largely acknowledged among the key factors controlling bank erosion hooke 1980 baker 1988 lawler et al 1997 1999 huang and nanson 1998 couper 2003 laubel et al 2003 viel 2012 from a literature review julian and torres 2006 proposed a conceptual model for erosion rates of cohesive riverbanks based on the bank composition i e silt clay contents sci according to their model the magnitude the variability and the maximum of the hydraulic peaks best predict erosion of banks with sci content inferior to 20 40 for more cohesive banks sci 40 the best predictor is the duration of high flows the banks of all merantaise river reaches may be considered as rather moderately to highly cohesive sci ranging between 34 and 89 table 2 and fig 12 and in accordance with what their model predicted it is indeed a combination of peak flow and duration of high flow in our case mean discharge during floods that best explain bank erosion in their case sci of the sand river is much lower 2 8 12 4 and bank erosion is thus best explained by peak intensities they justify their model however by the fact that below 20 of sci only hydrological scouring may be considered as responsible for bank erosion above 40 aerial processes would be dominant and between 20 and 40 it would be a combination of both factors this is contrary to what we observe on the merantaise river where aerial processes seem not playing a key role on bank retreat solely hydraulic erosion is involved despite the cohesiveness of the banks indeed we have clearly shown that the river has enough energy to scour the bank but not to transport the collapsed sediment that usually stays compact even after their collapse fig 13 shows moreover that silt clay contents are not correlated to the spatial variability of bank erosion and clearly do not explain the discrepancy between reaches despite the fact that they experienced the same hydrological variations contrary to expectations the highest erosion rates do not necessarily match the sites with the lowest silt concentration and vice versa likewise the average energy recorded at each study reach does not explain the differences indeed table 2 shows that in this case reaches with the highest stream power are not those that saw the highest bank erosions rates in such an environment such as the merantaise river where excess stream power or shear stress is so low it is rather the site specific characteristics that will allow the occurrence of bank retreat in a similar way to the study by laubel et al 2003 on 15 danish first and second order streams the bank erosion rate is indeed directly related to the bank angle in other words bank retreat is at its maximum where a bend or a local obstacle embankment vegetation large particle etc reflects the river flow towards the bank one may indeed notice that r2 r3 r5 and r6 are quite straight bank angle close to 0 and have very limited bank erosion while r1 and r4 have a bank angle rating between 30 and 35 figs 2 and 9 and consequently experience very active bank retreat this is particularly clear on r4 where an old ruined embankment and a tree located on the right bank directly upstream of the vertical profile p1 direct the flow towards the left bank generating bank erosion 5 2 the long term river width evolution as already mentioned in the introductory section 20th century sporadic cross profiles collected in local administration archives indicate that consecutively to the urbanization of the catchment the bed of the merantaise river experienced a widening of roughly 200 since the 1980 s the mean width of the bed increased from 2 m up to 4 m corresponding to a bank erosion rate of 5 6 cm yr the six reaches studied in this paper have been chosen because they are considered as representative of the entire course of the river they show an average erosion rate of 14 8 cm yr that is twice the erosion rate recorded over the last 35 years our results show that bank erosion is locally very heterogeneous and ranges from 1 cm yr to almost 40 cm yr yet the recent widening occurred over the entire course of the merantaise river this indicates that if the erosion rate is variable from one location to another depending of the site specific characteristics the erosion rate also changes over time indeed local lateral evolutions of the bed induce progressive modifications of flow directions that eventually displace the location of high erosion rates in this way lateral evolution may propagate to the entire bed this is what we observe on reach 4 where the downstream part of the reach was relatively preserved from erosion at the beginning of the study and the most dynamic during the final periods fig 9 6 conclusion as suggested by the vegetation cover of the merantaise studied reaches a gradient of bank retreat has been observed the two sites almost bare of vegetation experience an erosion rate of several tens of centimetres year while the two sites covered by more than 40 of vegetation were very stable this illustrates the very heterogeneous pattern of bank erosion observed on the merantaise our results indicate that bank retreat may occur in lowland low energy streams but that erosion results from complex processes operating on various spatial and temporal scales bank erosion rates and processes recorded in the merantaise catchment during this investigation were comparable with those observed and measured in similar catchments and confirmed the major role played by the mean discharge of flood events hooke 1979 lawler 1986 lawler et al 1999 stott 1997 couper and maddock 2001 couper et al 2002 laubel et al 2003 wallemacq et al 2011 henshaw et al 2012 d√©pret et al 2015 corbonnois et al 2016 however contrary to what other studies have shown the low energy of the merantaise river induces a relatively bad correlation with peak flow intensity we showed that the river has enough energy to scour the bank but not to transport the collapsed sediment it takes therefore a certain amount of time several flood events to clear the bank toe allowing a new phase of erosion to occur furthermore the high local variability of the bank erosion of the merantaise river is linked more to the properties of the small low energy slope rivers than to the composition of the bank the very local context of the reaches such as the streamflow direction the embankment the vegetation cover or the lateral input play a major role in bank erosion

7148,river bank erosion is controlled by a complex combination of factors and processes that play a main role in fluvial dynamics however the role played by lateral erosion in small low energy rivers functioning still needs to be better understood this study deals with the characterization and the quantification of the bank erosion of a small low energy river of the seine basin france in periurban catchment where urbanization had led to an incision and widening of the bed in the past decades using adapted monitoring surveys erosion pins and structure from motion photogrammetry the paper provides an opportunity to compare reach scale flux estimates using both techniques spatial and temporal variations in river bank rates were quantified over 16 months and the causes and controls of riverbank erosion were identified the estimated morphological activity rate ranges from 117 cm yr to 1 cm yr illustrating the very heterogeneous spatio temporal pattern of bank erosion observed on the merantaise river whereas a number of studies consider subaerial processes as the dominant processes fluvial erosion was found to be the most significant causal process and in particular the mean discharge of floods however the high local variability of the bank erosion of the studied river appears to be controlled by very local factors such as the bank angle the presence of a berm at the bank toe providing protection against fluvial erosion lateral supply outlet of rainwater pipes and deflected flow in the direction of the bank keywords riverbank erosion erosion pins structure from motion photogrammetry low energy river periurban river 1 introduction bank erosion plays a main role in the fluvial dynamics of alluvial rivers it controls the formation and migration of meander bends the

henshaw et al 2012 d√©pret et al 2015 bank erosion should be considered in river management because it may be responsible for land loss damage to structures adjacent to the river channel and many kinds of alterations to the river bed and floodplain hooke 1979 grospr√™tre 2011 henshaw et al 2012 hamel et al 2013 marteau et al 2016 it is also a necessary ecological process conditioning many aspects of ecosystem diversity pi√©gay et al 1997 laubel et al 2003 river bank retreat is a complex process of geomorphological dynamics occurring through a combination of three primary mechanisms

couper et al 2002 wynn et al 2008 wallemacq et al 2011 hamel et al 2013 furthermore subsurface processes as seepage erosion fox and felice 2014 fox et al 2007 masoodi et al 2018 samadi et al 2013 can be associated to the later the first two types of processes are considered as the dominant processes whereas the third type involving subaerial and subsurface processes is often viewed as a preparatory process lawler 1993 prosser et al 2000 couper and maddock 2001 luppi et al 2009 these three bank erosion mechanisms operate at different levels of magnitude and frequency occurring over different time and spatial scales bank erosion has been extensively studied on large rivers and on torrential streams because they are quite dynamic and are subject to frequent and significant hydromorphological adjustments surian 1999 dapporto et al 2003 rinaldi 2003 lespez et al 2015 small low energy rivers are much less energetic and though still relatively unknown are commonly considered as immobile and subject to only minor hydromorphological adjustments corbonnois et al 2016 these types of rivers however are a key area of concern from an ecological and river management perspective and the role played by lateral erosion in their functioning still needs to be better understood this is especially true in a periurban context where catchments are often subject to recent land use changes related to rapid urbanisation leading to noticeable hydromorphological changes in the channel chin 2006 navratil et al 2012 braud et al 2013 one of the reasons why bank erosion of low energy rivers has still been largely neglected is probably related to the difficulty of assessing weak and spatially discontinuous lateral erosion however a range of new remote sensing techniques allow weak topographical adjustments that were hardly noticeable using traditional techniques to be measured and quantified tarolli 2014 among these new methods are techniques based on photo electronic erosion pin peep sensors lawler 1993 1991 2008 laser scanners tls picco et al 2013 aerial light detection and ranging lidar cavalli and tarolli 2011 high resolution gps and structure from motion photogrammetry carbonneau et al 2003 heritage and hetherington 2007 alho et al 2009 notebaert et al 2009 brasington 2010 h√∂fle and rutzinger 2011 hohenthal et al 2011 westoby et al 2012 fonstad et al 2013 dietrich 2014 however some of these high functioning techniques are still difficult to apply in small lowland rivers because of the limited locations rough topography and afforestation in the bottoms of valleys bird et al 2010 nevertheless two methods seem better adapted to this particular topographical context i erosion pin surveys a well known technique and ii structure from motion photogrammetry a method developed over recent decades the principal aims of this paper are i to hydromorphologically characterize and quantify the bank erosion of a small periurban river i e measure the bank erosion and identify the determining factors that control bank erosion in this kind of low energy river bank protection hydrological conditions and geological context other local factors ii to technically assess two viable methods that are well adapted to the difficult field conditions and are user friendly inexpensive and easy to use erosion pins and structure from motion photogrammetry finally this paper will be an opportunity to compare reach scale flux estimates based on these two complementary techniques and validate them 2 study site 2 1 location and description of the merantaise river the merantaise river is a small stream 13 km long draining a catchment area of 36 km2 in the southern suburbs of the french city of paris fig 1 the hydro climatic context relies on a rather constant rainfall distribution throughout the year mean annual precipitation of 700 mm yr and a mainly pluvial and seasonal contrasted hydrological regime high flows occur in winter and flood flushes related to heavy rains or thunderstorms may occur from the autumn to spring seasons and occasionally in summer the inter annual mean discharge 2011 2014 registered at the gauging station 21 km2 fig 1 is around 0 05 m3 s with a significant distinction between the winter mean discharge of 0 07 m3 s and the summer mean discharge of 0 03 m3 s the maximum peak discharge measured since 2012 is 2 85 m3 s table 1 summarizes the hydrological and morphological characteristics of the river it is a river with a moderate slope 0 7 though rather high for the region and the grain size of its bed ranges from sand to gravel mean d50 19 mm the merantaise catchment is situated in the center of the paris basin meso cenozoic sedimentary basin and its valley is incised in the fontainebleau sands middle oligocene which constitute an important part of the geological underground of the region and provide the sandy fraction of the river bed material gravels stem from the montmorency cavernous silicified limestone upper oligocene layer that stands directly above the thick fontainebleau sand layer the merantaise river channel has been artificialized through historical engineering following several centuries of industrial and agricultural uses mills dams diversion gates wash houses and channelization of the river course have modified the stream morphodynamics and its hydrological regime for centuries more recently the merantaise catchment has been subject to a new type of disturbance through the modification of its catchment s land use recent decades have indeed been marked by a rapid and massive urbanisation of the catchment as shown in numerous studies in france bravard and petit 2000 grospr√™tre 2011 navratil et al 2013 urban impervious surfaces have been multiplied by more than 10 in the last decades e g from 3 to 32 on the merantaise catchment between 1947 and 2015 decreasing the rain interception and infiltration rate and increasing flood occurrence and magnitude the consequences of these changes on the river correspond to a general incision and a widening of the channel comparison of cross sectional and longitudinal profiles from the 80 s show an average incision of 50 cm and a widening up to 2 m over the past three decades vertical erosion is now limited either because the bedrock outcrops compact clay have been cleared by incision and or because the bed has been locally armoured lateral erosion seems on the contrary to be still quite active especially since vertical adjustments are impossible assani and petit 2004 2 2 location and characterization of the study reaches bank erosion was assessed at six reaches distributed along the 13 km of the river course fig 1 and table 2 they were selected in order to have a wide range of erosion situations in terms of bank stability state of erosion height and slope of the banks and potential dynamics of the erosion processes wallemacq et al 2011 table 2 and fig 2 summarize the characteristics of the six studied reaches single thread channels with alluvial gravel sand material 1 20 2 40 m high and 2 5 8 m in width depending of the reaches with different local hydromorphological contexts such as riffles or pools linear or concave banks and large or straight channels small but representative sections 4 5 10 m long were generally considered because of the relative homogeneity of the local hydromorphological context at each study reach a larger window of observation 25 m long was considered for reach 4 because of the importance of the active and differential erosion observed the river banks are mainly composed of sand and silt 90 with clay making up only ten percent of the bank the banks may be considered as homogenous over their vertical profiles as only very few stratigraphical variations were observed the merantaise banks are either entirely or partially covered by vegetation grass scrub or tree roots or completely bare from the bottom to the top of the bank 48 5 of the 13 km studied may be considered as having vegetated banks and 46 2 of banks are free of vegetation and potentially erodible the remaining 5 3 consists of riverbank protections preventing bank erosion as an initial approach the vegetated reaches were considered as stable and the bare reaches were considered as potentially erodible and thus dynamic moreover some features such as failed bank materials or overhanging vegetation cover gave indications of the lateral erosion intensity four out of the six selected reaches 1 4 5 and 6 were almost entirely free of vegetation and thus potentially dynamic only reaches 2 and 3 were highly vegetated with respectively 60 and 40 vegetation cover suggesting a weaker erodibility of the bank we chose to equip two sites with many recent erosion scars reaches 1 and 4 two moderately scarred reaches 5 and 6 one poorly marked reach 3 and one reach with no visible erosion marks reach 2 3 materials and methods the aim of this paper is to characterise and quantify the bank erosion of a small low energy river the river in question is generally subject to weak and discontinuous erosion that is difficult to assess corbonnois et al 2016 two main categories of methods to measure bank erosion at the front of the bank are usually identified on the one hand methods which record punctual information such as erosion pins surveys and peep photo electric erosion pins lawler 1992 1991 2008 on the other hand methods which continuously record data such as structure from motion photogrammetry westoby et al 2012 fonstad et al 2013 dietrich 2014 or terrestrial laser scans tls picco et al 2013 3 1 erosion pin surveys the lateral mobility of the bank on the merantaise river was monitored with the widely used erosion pins technique e g wolman 1959 slaymaker 1972 hill 1973 thorne and lewin 1979 thorne and tovey 1981 hooke 1979 1980 gardiner 1983 hagerty et al 1983 murgatroyd and ternan 1983 lawler 1986 lawler et al 1997 1999 ashbridge 1995 stott 1997 1999 couper and maddock 2001 luppi et al 2009 wallemacq et al 2011 henshaw et al 2012 though lawler 1993 recommended the use of 0 25 or 0 5 m long pins in his comprehensive review of the advantages and disadvantages of the method we chose to insert metal rods of 1 m long and 8 mm in diameter into the bank couper and maddock 2001 stated that short pins could be lost through erosion when longer ones may contribute to the stabilization of soil blocks but in our case knowing the erosion potential of the merantaise river through prior field observations using 1 m long metal rods seemed to be the most suitable option hooke 1979 depending on the length of the reach between 9 and 12 pins were set down on each site along 3 or 4 vertical profiles placed 2 to 3 m apart the pins were benchmarks against which bank erosion could be measured haigh 1977 lawler 1978 couper et al 2002 each vertical profile contained 3 pins in order to monitor the top tb the middle mb and the bottom bb of the bank as demonstrated by numerous authors these three parts of the bank do not necessarily evolve simultaneously and may respond to different erosion processes darby et al 2007 hamel et al 2013 luppi et al 2009 for instance the roots of floodplain vegetation generally ensure protection against erosion of the top of the bank laubel et al 2003 wallemacq et al 2011 the top and the middle parts of the bank are subject to greater weathering weakening and mass wasting and the bottom part is the one that is directly concerned by fluvial erosion bank retreat was assessed by measuring the length of the pins exposed beyond the bank at frequent intervals and after every flood event lawler et al 1997 the measurements were considered as morphological activity from 1 cm in order to exclude a potential error due to the readings of the pins in the most dynamic banks the pins had to be pushed back into the bank when it was exposed by more than 50 cm stott 1997 it should be noted that when the bank retreat measurement was very small we observed that it did not always correspond to effective erosion but rather to slight and very local scouring in the immediate vicinity of the erosion pins already identified as pin craters by lawler 1993 stott 1997 the survey of the erosion pins lasted 15 months from september 2013 to december 2014 for reaches 1 2 3 5 and 6 and 18 months from june 2013 to december 2014 for reach 4 all pins were surveyed on 31 occasions 35 for r4 which represented more than 2000 individual pin readings 3 2 structure from motion photogrammetry survey sfm the second method used for the bank erosion study is structure from motion photogrammetry sfm this survey technique permits a continuous and greater surface observation and quantification of riverbank erosion according to the local context it has only been used for the modelling survey of reach 4 as a complementary method to erosion pins bank erosion in reach 4 by sfm was monitored over 18 months from june 2013 to december 2014 the structure from motion photogrammetry method is a photogrammetric methodology for collecting low cost high spatial resolution three dimensional data for topographic or surface modelling allowing the generation of 3d point clouds from randomly acquired photosets f√∂rstner 1986 harris and stephens 1988 lowe 1999 2004 javernick et al 2014 considering the number of sfm papers that have been published westoby et al 2012 dietrich 2014 2016 micheletti et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015a marteau et al 2017 this technique seems to be becoming more popular for image acquisition the bank was cleared of non fixed vegetation dead leaves and hanging roots approximately ten ground control points gcps survey marking nails were then randomly positioned on the bank and surveyed with a trimble s6 total station operated on a local coordinate system fig 3 a due to the bank instability mass failure and fluvial erosion the survey nails were systematically removed after each sfm campaign and repositioned for the next one the total station was always repositioned at the exact same place and its location was verified before and after each fieldwork measurement using control points placed on fixed features in the studied area total station error was systematically 1 cm at each sfm campaign finally a large set of overlapping oblique photographs around one hundred taken with a canon eos 1000d was collected they provided images with a 70 80 side overlap the photographs were taken approximately 2 6 m from the bank predominantly opposite and at an angle to the target the set of images was then processed using the visualsfm free software wu 2007 2011 wu et al 2011 that gathers photographs from features present in multiple images despite the changes in viewpoints scales or settings by running the scale invariant feature transform sift algorithm from lowe 1999 2004 snavely 2008 westoby et al 2012 fig 3b the point cloud obtained is then downloaded from visualsfm and run on cloudcompare v 2 5 5 2 software girardeau montaut 2014 given the small study area extraneous points that were clearly errors were manually removed from the point cloud for example the top vegetated part of the bank or the bottom part of the bank in the water i e 10 to 20 cm depending on the reaches prosdocimi et al 2015a the point cloud was then georeferenced in our local coordinate system with the gcps previously surveyed on the field we verified the georeferencing of the point clouds in cloudcompare comparing the positioning of the gcps to the values of gcp surveying with the total station rmse errors of the different sfm campaigns are compiled in table 3 they never exceeded 8 mm at the end of the process we obtained a series of point clouds corresponding to the 3d image of the bank showing the bank situation at different dates to quantify the changes between two dates we used the multiscale model to model cloud comparison m3c2 method from lague et al 2013 implemented on cloudcompare v 2 5 5 2 software girardeau montaut 2014 fig 3c m3c2 is an algorithm that measures the distance between two point clouds assuming that they correspond to successive surveys of the same object m3c2 generates a new point cloud with these point cloud to point cloud distances and provides a confidence interval for each distance measurement depending on the point cloud roughness and registration error lague et al 2013 after m3c2 transformation the new point cloud is processed in arcgis 10 2 to generate a dem in order to measure erosion and deposition volumes fonstad et al 2013 javernick et al 2014 rumsby et al 2008 wheaton et al 2009 3 3 discrepancy between erosion pins and sfm photogrammetry this paper presents an opportunity to compare the two techniques used and verify the relevance of the widely used erosion pins method numerous studies try to validate and compare the sfm photogrammetry technique to other high resolution techniques used to characterised geomorphical changes such as tls prosdocimi et al 2015b smith and vericat 2015 marteau et al 2016 or lidar corbonnois et al 2016 but there is not yet a comparison and validation of sfm photogrammetry and erosion pin monitoring we chose therefore to test our results on reach 4 where pins and sfm were both used to assess the accuracy of the pins to the high resolution results from sfm photogrammetry and the proper georeferencing of the sfm point clouds in a first approach we compared the bank retreat values for a maximum of available common points about fifty identifiable erosion pins on sfm point clouds for the nine monitoring campaigns the average deviation was always lower than 3 cm with an average discrepancy was 0 5 cm fig 4 the eroded volume calculated from erosion pins interpolated from bank retreat at each pin location were then compared to that calculated with sfm photogrammetry in a common window and for each period the sfm layer was then considered as the reference as a reminder 12 pins were installed on an empirical basis on reach 4 on a grid of 0 50 m of vertical spacing and 2 m of horizontal spacing simulations of erosion pin grids were generated from the sfm m3c2 point clouds in order to estimate the pins density that best represent bank erosion retreat two types of grids were tested symmetrical and random ones in order to verify the potential interest of one or the other fig 5 the grids were generated from the semivariogram established on arcgis 10 2 associated with the interpolation kriging semivariogram shows indeed the maximum of variance of point clouds and allows to identify the maximum spacing between the erosion pins needed to take account the bank erosion variability this spacing and half of this spacing were then used to generate the pins grids that where compared to the reference sfm points cloud 3 4 hydrological survey during the 18 months of the survey the hydrological and climatic conditions were monitored fig 6 the meteorological conditions rainfall and temperature were registered using the meteorological station at toussus le noble located 2 5 km away from the study reach fig 1 the water level was recorded at 15 min intervals using a water pressure sensor mini diver di501 sensor by schlumberger installed between reaches 3 and 4 fig 1 due to the relatively small size of the river we consider the hydrological data at the gauging station to be representative of the entire length of the river course mean daily discharge was 0 04 0 05 m3 s while the maximum peak discharge measured during the period of investigation was 2 85 m3 s fourteen peak discharges higher than 0 115 m3 s occurred during the study period mainly during autumn and winter 2013 2014 the water level never exceeded 60 cm during high flow covering only the lower part of the banks in every study site the bank full stage is indeed no longer attained due to the extent of incision three descriptors frequently used in the literature were considered in characterizing the hydrological context peak discharge the number of flood events and their duration wolman 1959 hooke 1979 knighton 1973 d√©pret et al 2015 in this study flood events were defined as events that exceeded the smallest peak discharge recorded i e 0 115 m3 s 4 results 4 1 differential erosion in bank removal assessed with the erosion pins erosion pin surveys allowed the morphological activity of the bank during each measurement period to be identified and measured in terms of erosion and deposition as well as spatial and temporal variations 8 7 of the erosion pins recorded a morphological activity however this is a conservative estimate due to the lack of data on buried erosion pins the majority of the values were positive and corresponded to bank retreat 91 of the moving pins but during the 16 months of monitoring 9 of the morphological activity corresponded to deposition negative values i e a decrease in the length of pin exposed at 3 out of the 6 reaches these negative recordings interfere with the estimation and interpretation of the bank retreat couper et al 2002 stott 1999 recognized the implications of negative readings for subsequent data analysis and identified three potential methods of dealing with this data 1 include all negative readings in the calculation of mean erosion 2 ignore all negatives and treat them as missing data 3 replace all negatives with zero we chose to quantify the bank retreat in two different ways i by ignoring the negative data missing data thus strictly considering the bank retreat total retreat expressed in cm in table 4 and ii by considering both positive and negative values for the characterisation of the morphological activity rate expressed in cm yr in table 4 hooke 1979 lawler 1986 stott 1997 couper and maddock 2001 henshaw et al 2012 during our field investigation the negative readings generally occurred on the lower erosion pins when soil from the upper parts of the bank fell down but it also happened sparingly in the upper part of the bank probably caused by the expansion of the soil mass due to increased moisture henshaw et al 2012 seepage porcesses samadi et al 2013 masoodi et al 2018 or due to compaction of the soil by walkers along the bank spatial variation in morphological activity shows a great heterogeneity when considering the cumulative activity over the 16 months of the survey fig 7 effective erosion of the bank occurred in relation to 63 of the erosion pins 33 of the 21 vertical profiles were subject to morphological activity on the 3 layers of the bank bottom of the bed bb middle of the bed mb and top of the bed tb whereas 67 were subject to partial mobilisation of the bank six profiles 29 had two active layers and seven profiles 33 had only one active layer mostly bb only one profile was completely inactive in terms of bank retreat profile 2 at reach 2 the highest recorded morphological activity rate at an individual erosion pin location was 117 cm yr r4 p3 bb while the minimum recorded morphological activity rate was below 1 cm yr mostly at tb and mb three reaches r1 r4 and r5 experienced a significant retreat of their banks with the rate of retreat ranging from 25 to more than 100 cm yr fig 7 every vertical profile was eroded in these reaches and the entire height of the bank retreated the three other reaches r2 r3 and r6 were less dynamic with low bank erosion and even the absence of erosion at the location of some erosion pins furthermore fieldwork observations suggest that bank erosion recorded at the bottom layer at r2 r3 and r6 could result from the disruptive role of the metal rods hammered into the bank for the erosion pins survey barker et al 1997 henshaw et al 2012 on these less dynamic reaches one may moreover note the vertical heterogeneity of the erosion rate the erosion occurred mainly at bb and tb when mb recorded no bank retreat on the six reaches activity of the medium and upper part of the bank evolves rather conjointly since a stepwise regression made between bank retreat at tb and mb shows a 90 correlation conversely the upper part of the bank is rather independent of the evolution of tb and mb the bottom of the bank bb was clearly the most dynamic part in terms of the percentage of pins that recorded erosion the great heterogeneity of the bank erosion may also be examined through the total bank retreat and the morphological activity registered at the most active profiles of the 6 reaches r1 p3 r2 p1 r3 p2 r4 p3 r5 p3 and r6 p3 table 4 three out of six profiles registered significant bank erosion activity r1 p3 23 r4 p3 34 and r5 p3 14 the three others r2 p1 r3 p2 and r6 p3 experienced very weak morphological activity with a maxima of 5 of the readings recording erosion a mean bank retreat below 0 8 cm and no activity on the middle and top of the bank the maximums of bank retreat may be considered as relatively important for this small low energy stream with 35 40 cm of material lost between two surveys of the pins corresponding to a few weeks however when considering the mean values of bank retreat this high erosion rate has to be weighted when considering all reaches the mean morphological activity between two surveys was indeed between 0 05 cm yr r2 p1 and 3 0 cm yr r4 p3 the most dynamic profile was r4 p3 with 34 of readings recording bank evolution erosion and or deposition this high rate of morphological activity is still a conservative estimate because proper readings of the evolution of the bank along the pins were often complicated due to frequent depositions at the bank toe i e buried pins though very active r4 p3 did not register the most important bank retreat absolute values which occurred at the top of the bank tb on r5 p3 there 40 cm of bank were eroded in one go however this was the only movement of the bank observed during the entire survey 3 of morphological activity 4 2 the causal mechanisms of bank erosion the causal mechanisms and hydrometeorological parameters potentially responsible for the bank erosion were examined through statistical analysis regression and correlation tests all pins at all reaches were considered in a first stage the particularities of the different reaches were then examined reach by reach finally regarding the small morphological activity at certain sites analyses were focused on the two most dynamic reaches three bank erosion variables were compared with independent variables by spearman or pearson correlation analysis and simple regressions the effective bank retreat measured for each period and each reach at tb etb and bb ebb and the maximum effective bank retreat registered at the profiles all levels combined emax mb was not considered because it was too correlated with tb the erosion bank values were loge transformed prior to statistical analysis when the corresponding data set distributions were not normal pearson correlation coefficients were then calculated if the data distribution did not remain normal after the transformation the spearman correlation coefficients were calculated simple and multiple regressions were also made in order to propose causal relationships between the variables the latter was established only on the data set gathering r1 and r4 data and using only significant variables i e p value 0 05 laubel et al 2003 as depositions were not included in the quantitative analysis the results presented consider only effective erosion data a selection of factors likely to control erosion are listed in table 5 and have been chosen on the basis of those commonly used in literature wolman 1959 knighton 1973 hooke 1979 couper and maddock 2001 couper 2003 julian and torres 2006 henshaw et al 2012 d√©pret et al 2015 though commonly considered as erosion factors seepage freeze thaw and moisture of the soil have not been considered in this study wolman 1959 twidale 1964 hooke 1979 prosser et al 2000 couper and maddock 2001 hamel et al 2013 masoodi et al 2018 one may indeed consider that no significant freezing conditions occurred during the study wallemacq et al 2011 suggested that the action of freezing on erosion as a preparatory factor requires temperatures below 5 c over several consecutive nights to be effective during the 16 months of the survey only 20 freezing days and nights were recorded corresponding to 130 effective hours of freeze rarely below 5 c fig 6 besides no evidence of needle ice on the banks as described by wallemacq et al 2011 was noticed considering soil moisture and seepage erosion it was unfortunately not possible to carry out direct measurements on the merantaise river this parameter was consequently approached through the precipitation descriptors rsum rmax rmoy rint table 5 the morphological parameters silt and clay index and vegetation cover were treated independently they were measured for all of the profiles at each of the reaches but only once at the beginning of the study they were therefore the same for each period the spearman for all reaches and pearson for r1 and r4 correlation coefficients between the bank retreat and the hydrometeorological control parameters are presented in tables 6a and b respectively i while considering all the reaches the first table table 6a shows the predominance of the fluvial parameters in controlling bank erosion this is the mean discharge of floods registered during the considered period qmoy fl that is most correlated to bank erosion variables it is particularly true for the top of the bank tb where r 0 81 p value 0 0001 was reached the peak discharge qmax also seems significantly correlated to bank erosion for the tb and the maximum erosion in contrast the subaerial processes illustrated by the meteorological parameters are poorly correlated to bank erosion the spearman correlation coefficients are very low and the p values show no significant correlations ii while considering r1 and r4 i e most active reaches the same independent variables are highlighted and no additional correlations may be identified table 6b the analysis of erosion processes reach by reach also showed the same trends for example for r1 qmoy fl was the only significant variable with an r value of 0 72 with emax n 23 and 0 57 with ebb n 21 it should however be noted that some good correlations appear at r4 between emax and all hydrological parameters qmax r 0 62 p value 0 0002 qvol r 0 7 p value 0 0001 qmoy fl r 0 64 p value 0 0002 and d fl r 0 67 p value 0 0001 with a maximum of r 0 82 p value 0 0001 observed for qmoy fl at the top of the bank finally simple regression analysis was used considering all reaches combined r1 to r6 and the two most dynamic reaches r1 and r4 fig 8 even if the coefficients of determination r2 are low some of them show relatively good relationships between the two identified variables it is once again qmoy fl that best explains the bank erosion and it is at the top of the bank that the model best fits the data r2 0 6 for all the reaches as well as r1 and r4 all these statistical analyses converge and indicate that for all reaches only two correlated independent variables clearly play a key role in bank erosion mean discharge of floods qmoy fl and peak discharges qmax meteorological variables seem very poorly correlated to bank retreat some of the other hydrological parameters are more or less correlated to erosion but if considered alone the role they play is weak the statistical analysis finally shows that theses correlations exist for the top and bottom of the bank but are clearly stronger when considering the upper part of the bank furthermore the correlation pearson with the morphological parameters sci and bank vegetation cover and the bank erosion were made considering the amount of the bank retreat tb mb and bb and the same sci and bank vegetation cover for the 15 months of survey it then appeared that the sci and the bank erosion were poorly correlated r2 0 21 0 03 and 0 12 when the bank vegetation cover was better correlated to erosion bank on tb and mb r2 0 46 and 0 47 respectively the bb was less concerned by vegetation cover and more intensively scoured by fluvial erosion thus the silt and clay index i e the ratio between the volume of particles smaller than 74 ¬µm and the amount of the bank sample schumm 1977 which determined the cohesiveness of the bank and the potential vulnerability to the freeze thaw processes couper 2003 grab 2004 wallemacq et al 2011 is included between 34 and 89 table 2 the high level of the sci and the vegetation cover can explain the low vulnerability to the subaerial processes of the merantaise banks all this suggests that if predictably peak discharge is key the duration of high flow is at least as important in other words this indicates that bank retreat on the merantaise does not usually work in sudden pulses but rather as a semi continuous process during high flow 4 3 differential erosion in bank removal assessed with sfm photogrammetry sfm photogrammetry allows a finer description of bank retreat and was thus used at reach 4 in order to better understand the processes involved in the morphological dynamic of the bank fig 9 the evolution of this reach has been divided into 9 periods that correspond to the dates between sfm surveys fig 9a presents the evolution of the bank for each of the nine periods and fig 9b shows the cross sectional evolution in the central location of the bank rectangle on fig 9a where the dynamic was maximal the largest peak flow recorded during this study occurred during the first period on the 19th of june 2013 with a discharge of 2 84 m3 s fig 6 it generated severe erosion on bb in zones ii and iii 150 cm of bank retreat and on tb in zones i and iv 20 50 cm of collapsed sediment from the top of the bank was deposited at the bottom of the bank in zones i and iv the bank material eroded in bb was evacuated by the flow mostly during the peak flow the greatest episode of bank erosion occurred during the second period that may be related to the second highest flood event 2 08 m3 s that occurred on the 9th and 10th of november 2013 erosion occurred mainly in zones ii and iii with 35 80 cm of sediment eroded from the middle and the top of the bank the failed bank materials were deposited at the bank toe forming a berm wider than 140 cm fig 10 provides complementary observations based on the erosion pins survey one may see that bb actually experienced a continuous retreat throughout period 2 increasing the height and slope of the bank just before the flood event on the 9 10th of november the bank had a sub vertical face allowing undercutting that played the role of triggering cantilever bank failure the collapsed bank material was mostly deposited on bb and to a lesser extent on mb as observed by nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 the berm formed by riverbank failure in sections 2 and 3 then constituted a defence for the upper layers mb and tb by decreasing the bank slope and stabilizing the bank during period 3 erosion was therefore very limited despite several significant peak flows 0 98 m3 s and 1 43 m3 s only the bottom layer bb in zones iii and iv was slightly eroded the flows slowly undercut the unconsolidated material collapsed during period 2 on average over period 3 the bank toe retreated by 10 to 25 cm with a maximum of 50 cm during the following periods 4 and 5 the hydrograph shows very weak water level rises only slight bank face changes occurred then the bank toe and the entire surface of the bank were eroded the hydrograph fig 6 suggests that fluvial processes played a minor role during this period and that aerial processes rain frost etc are more likely to have been responsible for those slight morphological adjustments the most significant changes appeared on the middle layer mb this corresponds to mass failures such as slides and slumps of the material towards the bottom layer it mainly occurred in zones ii iii and iv with 20 35 cm of material sliding to the bottom layer and a maximum of 50 cm on section 4 period 6 and period 7 are marked by a return of high flows 0 90 m3 s 1 55 m3 s 2 08 m3 s and a significant retreat of the bottom of the bank especially in the downstream part of the reach zones iii and iv a cumulative erosion of more than 150 cm was recorded most of which concerned mb and bb the top of the bank essentially remained stable from february 2014 period 3 this evolution continued until november 2014 period 8 an erosion retreat of 40 50 cm was calculated in zones iiib and ivb leaving a cutting zone at the bottom of the bank for the first time since the summer of 2013 significant erosion also occurred on the most downstream part of the reach zone iv despite the lack of significant peak flow 0 5 m3 s but due to the erosion of the berm protecting the bank immediately upstream zones ii and iii this section was more exposed to fluvial erosion moreover the bank here was steeper and thus more sensitive to erosion an average 30 cm retreat was measured the last period 9 from november to december 2014 corresponds to a new cycle of mobilisation of the bank material as observed in november 2013 period 2 but with lower intensity the top and middle layers were eroded especially on zones ii and iii and on the downstream section of zone iv on one hand a maximum of 45 cm was eroded for an average retreat of 30 cm on the other hand a maximum accumulation of 75 cm occurred for an average deposition of 50 cm in zone iv the deposits at the bottom layer were quickly evacuated as they faced the direction of flow finally one may say that bank erosion on reach 4 may be described as a cycle mainly correlated to the hydrograph fig 11 at first the base of the bank is destabilized by high flows generating the removal of a large amount of material from the bottom and middle part of the bank the top of the bank is then exposed and weakened and may drop off or slump the failed material deposits at the bank toe and forms a berm of unconsolidated sediment that prevents any bank retreat it is then progressively evacuated by moderate water rises concomitantly bank adjustments occur at the top and middle part of the bank mostly due to subaerial processes once the berm has been evacuated and the bank has recovered a subvertical posture exposing its entire height to high flow the cycle restarts and the bank retreats once again 4 4 comparison between erosion pins and sfm photogrammetry one aim of this paper is to propose a review of the discrepancy in resolution of the two methods used if the pins allow several reaches to be easily studied due to the simplicity of implementation and surveying sfm photogrammetry allows a finer analysis and reduces the amount of bias even if the erosion pins are a proven means of bank retreat measurement their use is limited when eroded volumes or sediment budget have to be calculated the number of pins and their positioning have been discussed in the literature lawler 1993 couper et al 2002 laubel et al 2003 but recommendations rely on an empirical approach and no papers have yet proposed any quantification of the accuracy of the technique first fig 12 shows that the density of pins we chose to install gave a relatively good appreciation of the effective volume of eroded sediment but only when the bank retreat was low i e for period 4 Œ¥ 0 16 m3 and period 5 Œ¥ 0 12 m3 when morphological activity was high i e during period 1 and 2 the number of pins and their location were much less efficient in correctly quantifying the volume of eroded bank pins underestimated the eroded volume by up to twice the actual eroded volume for period 1 the erosion pins for instance provided an estimation of 1 04 m3 of bank erosion while sfm estimated 2 38 m3 of eroded material as a reminder the reach 4 measured 25 5 m in length table 2 secondly fig 12 shows that on reach 4 a rather good estimation of the eroded volume may be reached with about thirty pins placed 1 5 m apart horizontally and 0 8 m apart vertically this result is valid for the nine periods studied and is thus independent of the magnitude of erosion activity moreover it appears that the symmetrical implantation scheme is more efficient than the random one the minimum distance of 1 5 m between the rods symmetrically inserted allowed a perfect correlation between the volume of bank retreat estimated by sfm and that estimated by a simulated erosion pin grid meanwhile for the same minimum distance of 1 5 m between the rods with a random grid there is a ratio of 1 4 5 discussion 5 1 the accuracy of erosion pins the results of these simple tests of comparison between the two methods of erosion assessment implemented on reach 4 clearly show that if erosion pins provide accurate results on bank retreat the pins have to be considered with caution with regard to the quantification of the eroded surface or volume some complementary tests made on different types of river banks with different erosion patterns is still needed to increase the precision of our results but it may already be stated that in these small energy streams if pins provide a rather good erosion rate at the exact location of the pins extrapolations between them are hazardous our results suggest moreover that the implementation of the pins following a symmetric grid is the most efficient and that the multiplication of the erosion pins does not seem to improve the representativeness of the network this goes against what may be seen in most of the studies using erosion pins up to now existing literature was indeed unable to show an ideal model of number and distribution of erosion pins for all river systems lawler 1993 couper et al 2002 in most studies a large number of pins and a mean distance between pins below 1 m horizontally and below 30 cm vertically have been favoured table 7 on a rather dynamic bank such as reach 4 of the merantaise river reducing the space below 1 5 m horizontally with a fixed spacing of 0 8 m vertically did not improve the quality of the data if a symmetrical implementation of the pins is chosen however one of the advantages of the erosion pins survey over the sfm photogrammetry is that this method may be used under water level this comparison between the results from a spatially almost continuous technique sfm and a discrete one pins applied on a same study site emphasises the great variability of erosion that occurs within a bank reach of a few meters long where bank erosion is limited fig 9 shows moreover that this variability is lateral but also and perhaps above all vertical similarly to what had been seen in numerous previous studies the bottom bb middle mb and top tb of the bank appear to evolve at different time scales because of the different erosion processes involved hooke 1979 couper and maddock 2001 nasermoaddeli and pasche 2008 henshaw et al 2012 while subaerial and subsurface processes are commonly consider as preparatory processes which weakening the surface of the bank fluvial erosion and mass failure are two processes linked through the concept of basal endpoint control described by carson and kirkby 1972 and later by thorne 1978 1982 couper and maddock 2001 wood et al 2001 this concept of basal endpoint control highlights the complexity and the interconnection of the bank retreat and the explanatory processes indeed as reported by thorne and osman 1988 continued retreat through mass failure requires basal clean out of slumped debris as this depends entirely on fluvial entrainment rates of retreat by mass failure are fluvially controlled even though the mass stability of the bank is not directly related to flow forces this was the same pattern of erosion occurring on a low energy streams such as the merantaise where the erosion and transport capacity are very limited indeed because of the relative small size of the catchment and the recent incision of the bed following from urbanization the bankfull level is never reached and water level at high flow never exceeds one third of the bank height the collapsed material is consequently never fully submerged and floods are usually not energetic enough to fully generate erosion i e scour and transport shear stress has proven to be high enough to scour the bank but this was often too low to evacuate all of the eroded material as it was produced several high flow events were therefore necessary to clear the bank toe this is the main reason why the correlations between bank retreat and fluvial descriptors are not as good as expected correlation coefficient ranging between 0 4 and 0 8 though they highlight the dominance of the fluvial erosion variables especially through mean flood discharge qmoy fl and peak discharge qmax these correlations are weaker than those presented in the literature hooke 1979 julian and torres 2006 henshaw et al 2012 henshaw et al 2012 have for instance shown that fluvial erosion accounts for bank erosion at 89 of erosion pin locations in several british upland catchments it is worth repeating that the subaerial processes may not be considered in this study as weakening the correlation to fluvial factors as it has been shown in numerous studies on small headwater catchments lawler 1986 1993 stott 1997 prosser et al 2000 couper and maddock 2001 wallemacq et al 2011 hamel et al 2013 on the merantaise as also shown by henshaw et al 2012 precipitation and frost do not significantly influence bank retreat tables 6a and b this is probably because most of the study reaches are located in a forested area that intercepts a significant part of the rainfall and clearly because no significant conditions of frost were recorded during the study julian and torres 2006 studied an urban stream sand river which like the merantaise was incising they demonstrated for their part that hydraulic erosion was mainly dictated by the peak flow intensities our results are slightly divergent as we show that peak flow alone may not fully explain bank erosion in our case it is the mean flood discharge that is best correlated to bank retreat this suggests that the intensity of the flood water level and flow velocity is key but also that the duration of the event is important though peak flows generated by summer storms can be highly morphogenous i e the june 2013 storm event was responsible for a loss of 4 06 m3 of bank material at r4 it is rather the addition of medium events that will allow bank scour or evacuation of collapsed materials these different findings between our two studies may be explained by the cohesiveness of the bank that is largely acknowledged among the key factors controlling bank erosion hooke 1980 baker 1988 lawler et al 1997 1999 huang and nanson 1998 couper 2003 laubel et al 2003 viel 2012 from a literature review julian and torres 2006 proposed a conceptual model for erosion rates of cohesive riverbanks based on the bank composition i e silt clay contents sci according to their model the magnitude the variability and the maximum of the hydraulic peaks best predict erosion of banks with sci content inferior to 20 40 for more cohesive banks sci 40 the best predictor is the duration of high flows the banks of all merantaise river reaches may be considered as rather moderately to highly cohesive sci ranging between 34 and 89 table 2 and fig 12 and in accordance with what their model predicted it is indeed a combination of peak flow and duration of high flow in our case mean discharge during floods that best explain bank erosion in their case sci of the sand river is much lower 2 8 12 4 and bank erosion is thus best explained by peak intensities they justify their model however by the fact that below 20 of sci only hydrological scouring may be considered as responsible for bank erosion above 40 aerial processes would be dominant and between 20 and 40 it would be a combination of both factors this is contrary to what we observe on the merantaise river where aerial processes seem not playing a key role on bank retreat solely hydraulic erosion is involved despite the cohesiveness of the banks indeed we have clearly shown that the river has enough energy to scour the bank but not to transport the collapsed sediment that usually stays compact even after their collapse fig 13 shows moreover that silt clay contents are not correlated to the spatial variability of bank erosion and clearly do not explain the discrepancy between reaches despite the fact that they experienced the same hydrological variations contrary to expectations the highest erosion rates do not necessarily match the sites with the lowest silt concentration and vice versa likewise the average energy recorded at each study reach does not explain the differences indeed table 2 shows that in this case reaches with the highest stream power are not those that saw the highest bank erosions rates in such an environment such as the merantaise river where excess stream power or shear stress is so low it is rather the site specific characteristics that will allow the occurrence of bank retreat in a similar way to the study by laubel et al 2003 on 15 danish first and second order streams the bank erosion rate is indeed directly related to the bank angle in other words bank retreat is at its maximum where a bend or a local obstacle embankment vegetation large particle etc reflects the river flow towards the bank one may indeed notice that r2 r3 r5 and r6 are quite straight bank angle close to 0 and have very limited bank erosion while r1 and r4 have a bank angle rating between 30 and 35 figs 2 and 9 and consequently experience very active bank retreat this is particularly clear on r4 where an old ruined embankment and a tree located on the right bank directly upstream of the vertical profile p1 direct the flow towards the left bank generating bank erosion 5 2 the long term river width evolution as already mentioned in the introductory section 20th century sporadic cross profiles collected in local administration archives indicate that consecutively to the urbanization of the catchment the bed of the merantaise river experienced a widening of roughly 200 since the 1980 s the mean width of the bed increased from 2 m up to 4 m corresponding to a bank erosion rate of 5 6 cm yr the six reaches studied in this paper have been chosen because they are considered as representative of the entire course of the river they show an average erosion rate of 14 8 cm yr that is twice the erosion rate recorded over the last 35 years our results show that bank erosion is locally very heterogeneous and ranges from 1 cm yr to almost 40 cm yr yet the recent widening occurred over the entire course of the merantaise river this indicates that if the erosion rate is variable from one location to another depending of the site specific characteristics the erosion rate also changes over time indeed local lateral evolutions of the bed induce progressive modifications of flow directions that eventually displace the location of high erosion rates in this way lateral evolution may propagate to the entire bed this is what we observe on reach 4 where the downstream part of the reach was relatively preserved from erosion at the beginning of the study and the most dynamic during the final periods fig 9 6 conclusion as suggested by the vegetation cover of the merantaise studied reaches a gradient of bank retreat has been observed the two sites almost bare of vegetation experience an erosion rate of several tens of centimetres year while the two sites covered by more than 40 of vegetation were very stable this illustrates the very heterogeneous pattern of bank erosion observed on the merantaise our results indicate that bank retreat may occur in lowland low energy streams but that erosion results from complex processes operating on various spatial and temporal scales bank erosion rates and processes recorded in the merantaise catchment during this investigation were comparable with those observed and measured in similar catchments and confirmed the major role played by the mean discharge of flood events hooke 1979 lawler 1986 lawler et al 1999 stott 1997 couper and maddock 2001 couper et al 2002 laubel et al 2003 wallemacq et al 2011 henshaw et al 2012 d√©pret et al 2015 corbonnois et al 2016 however contrary to what other studies have shown the low energy of the merantaise river induces a relatively bad correlation with peak flow intensity we showed that the river has enough energy to scour the bank but not to transport the collapsed sediment it takes therefore a certain amount of time several flood events to clear the bank toe allowing a new phase of erosion to occur furthermore the high local variability of the bank erosion of the merantaise river is linked more to the properties of the small low energy slope rivers than to the composition of the bank the very local context of the reaches such as the streamflow direction the embankment the vegetation cover or the lateral input play a major role in bank erosion

7149,a novel form of the lattice boltzmann method for the saint venant equations labsve is formulated and implemented to eliminate equidistant property of the lattice structure being the major drawback of the lbm and thus establish the lb model as tool for practical application natural water bodies fully competitive compared to the presently available computational models new form of equilibrium distribution function edf based on geometrically transformed saint venant equations sve is derived introducing the metric relation function between the physical and computational system the non uniform spatial discretization is managed by solving the transformed sve rather than altering the symmetrical properties of lattice structure since the geometrical correlation between the two corresponding systems is introduced into the transformed sve the very basic structure of the lbm in terms of simplicity in implementing the boundary conditions and computational efficiency owing to the parallel structure is maintained and further improved by removing the limitations imposed by the equidistant lattice condition furthermore the discharge water level definition of the sve as more applicable form when natural watercourses are considered is applied in this way the bed slope term is completely eliminated from the equations establishing therefore a model more suitable for natural systems characterized by arbitrary cross sectional geometry in order to test the proposed non equidistant labsve model steady flow in prismatic channel unsteady flow in non prismatic channel of simple cross section geometry and unsteady flow along a danube section is modelled additional simulations by using the hec ras modelling tool are conducted in order to produce comparison basis for both unsteady simulations while in case of the danube river section actual water level and discharge measurements are additionally used for calibration and verification of the model very good agreement between compared results is obtained showing that the proposed non equidistant form of the labsve is capable of solving complex environmental problems maintaining the order of accuracy simplicity and efficiency of the basic lbm keywords lattice boltzmann method saint venant equations natural watercourses non uniform grid danube river 1 introduction the hydrodynamic process of open channel unsteady flow in complex network of natural watercourses rivers canals are modelled using a set of non linear partial derivative saint venant equations cunge et al 1980 in order to develop a robust mathematical tool for practical application which can efficiently manage variety of complex hydraulic states imposed by natural watercourses including shock waves changes between regimes several numerical methods from the domain of conventional computational fluid dynamics cfd have been used in past the bidiagonal four point implicit finite difference preissman scheme preissmann 1961 and the method integrated with the hermite cubic interpolation known as holly preissmann method holly and preissmann 1977 are robust and unconditionally stable numerical schemes thus they are the most widely used methods in free surface one dimensional subcritical numerical modelling in order to find a particular cell face value leonard 1979 has introduced quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick which uses a quadratic function passing through the face of the control volume based on the higher order differencing scheme for a three point upstream weighted quadratic interpolation additionally characteristic form of the sve by applying the method of characteristics mc and the hartree method is solved by abbott 1979 however since the solution of the hartree scheme is artificially smoothed by interpolation errors to estimate flow conditions in the corresponding computational point the above mentioned finite difference methods offer significant improvement in accuracy therefore they are preferred when practical application is considered in order to further extend and consequentially improve the efficiency and robustness of the presently available one dimensional flow models the novel form of the lattice boltzmann method for solving the spatially transformed sve is presented in this paper being relatively new approach in numerical mathematics the lattice boltzmann method rivet and boon 2001 rothman and zaleski 1997 wolf gladrow 2001 is intensively studied and applied by many authors on variety of flow and flow related processes by many authors in the past two decades a multi component lbm based on the two component rothman keller lattice gas model was developed by gunstensen and rothman 1991 while chen and shan 1993 successfully implemented a lbm model with mean field interactions for multiphase and multi component fluid flows flow in porous media was investigated by groups of authors succi et al 1989 pan et al 2006 and degruyter et al 2010 while utilization of the lattice boltzmann model in case of isotropic groundwater flows is examined by zhou 2007 and budinski et al 2015 in order to solve anisotropy when advection and anisotropic dispersion equations aade are considered ginzburg 2005 and yoshida and nagaoka 2010 applied two relaxation time trt and the multiple relaxation time mrt approaches lallemand and luo 2000 d humieres et al 2002 respectively while single phase transient flow in pipes by using adaptive grid approach is examined by budinski 2016 utilization of the lbm on depth averaged flow equations labswe using the nine velocity d2q9 model was initially introduced by salmon 1999 further improvement in terms of stability and turbulence by introducing centred scheme for the force term and deriving a lattice boltzmann model for the shallow water equations with turbulence modelling labswetm for the subgrid scale stress model was achieved by zhou 2004 2011 furthermore to manage flow domains characterized by complex geometry ginzburg 2005 introduces grid transformation for modeling of the stretched rectangular computational domain while zhou 2010 developed the rectangular lattice boltzmann model applying the mesh manipulation techniques used in the traditional cfd methods budinski 2014 introduced the mrt lbm for shallow water equations swe transformed in curvilinear coordinates utilization of the lbm to model one dimensional shallow water equations is done by frandsen 2008 dellar and salmon 2005 and th√∂mmes et al 2007 while the first application of the lbm on open air canals using the simpler prismatic form of the saint venant equations has been preformed by van thang et al 2010 further improvement by introducing non prismatic terms into the model has been achieved by liu et al 2015 additional stability improvement by combining two approaches presented in frandsen 2008 and ginzburg 2005 is done by ginzburg 2013 the parallel nature of the lbm method have been extensively exploited using state of the art gpu graphics processing units based architectures and coprocessors janen and krafczyk 2011 tubbs and tsai 2011 sch√∂nherr et al 2011 further improvement of the presently available lbsve models is presented in this paper as it was stated earlier the lbsve models investigated by van thang et al 2010 and liu et al 2015 exploit a simpler form of the sve application of the lattice boltzmann approach to the sve is to the authors knowledge investigated only by the mentioned two groups of authors which is by its formulation impractical when one dimensional modelling of natural watercourses is considered additional drawback of the lattice boltzmann method is the required uniformity of the lattice structure imposed by the symmetry of the predefined lattice velocities consequently the non uniformity between the computational points is prevented and features crucial for managing domains with arbitrary geometry like flexibility and efficiency are therefore limited to completely eliminate uniformity of the 1d lattice pattern from the lb model corresponding geometrical transformation between the physical and computational domain is introduced and flexibility in managing physical distances between the computational points in case of cross sections is therefore forwarded furthermore the new discharge water level formulation of the sve is used resulting in removal of the bed slope term and efficient management of arbitrary geometry of the cross section the proposed model is tested and verified against the case of steady flow in prismatic channel an example of unsteady flow in non prismatic channel having simple cross section geometry and unsteady flow along a section of the danube river additional comparison data are obtained by using the hec ras us army corps of engineers 2016 modelling tool and utilizing actual water level and discharge measurements 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 the saint venant equations introducing simplifications in terms of uniform velocity distribution in the cross sections assumption of hydrostatical pressure distribution and gradually sloped bed into the navier stokes equations nse the one dimensional saint venant equations are derived with the main purpose of establishing a modelling tool for large scale flow systems network of canals and natural watercourses four basic formulations of the sve depending on the dependent variables involved can be distinguished which particular form of the sve will be used is determined by practical limitations like geometry or complexity of the examined flow cases hence when flow systems with simple cross sectional geometry and straightforward presentation of bed slope are considered discharge sectional area form of the sve is used liu et al 2015 however when natural watercourses characterised by complex cross sectional and longitudinal geometry are modelled this particular form becomes impractical and inadequate to overcome these limitations the hybrid discharge water surface elevation form of the sve is adopted 1 a t q x q 2 q t x œâ q 2 a ga z x gas f where a x t is cross section area q x t is discharge z x t is free surface elevation q x t is lateral inflow per unit length g is the gravitational acceleration t is time x is the cartesian coordinate and œâ is the coefficient velocity non uniformity it should be noted that the discharge sectional area form of the sve can be obtained simply by replacing the free surface elevation z x t in the rhs of eq 2 with the term a x t z b x assumption a x h x is used where h x t is water depth and z b x is bed elevation s f represents the friction slope defined as 3 s f n 2 q 2 a 2 r 4 3 where n is manning s roughness coefficient and r is hydraulic radius formulated as r a o where o is wetted perimeter it can be seen that insertion of water surface elevation z x t instead of cross section area a x t in eq 2 completely eliminates the bed slope term from the system of equations therefore leading to a more flexible and practical form of the sve 2 2 transformation of the sve using the adaptive grid technique uniformity of the lattice structure is the major limitation of the lb models in general which significantly decreases the efficiency and the applicability of the lattice models especially when domains of arbitrary geometry are modelled in order to eliminate this restriction and at the same time maintain the basic features of the labsve geometric transformation based on metric mapping between the physical and computational domain is introduced by applying the basic rules of coordinate transformation between the two systems simmonds 1994 eqs 1 and 2 are further transformed to the alternative coordinate system 4 t ga q Œæ qg 5 q t Œæ œâ q 2 ga ga g z Œæ gas f œâ q 2 a g 1 Œæ where Œæ represents the new coordinate while term g x Œæ denotes the corresponding basis applying geometrical transformation procedure between the two coordinate systems technique often used in traditional cfd for managing complex geometries enables calculation of terms defined in the non equidistant physical space in the equidistant Œæ grid computational frame in this way spatial non uniformity is managed by the transformed sv equations rather than with the numerical model itself allowing utilization of the standard uniform lattice based models 2 3 the lattice boltzmann model in this paper a d1q3 lattice boltzmann bhatnagar gross krook model lbgk bhatnagar et al 1954 is utilized the evolution equation is defined as 6 f Œ± Œæ e Œ± Œ¥ t

be noted that the fourth term on the rhs actually denotes the second order velocity derivative diffusion therefore œÑ parameter acts like an artificial viscosity parameter which can be used for dispersion oscillations control in the vicinity of the shocks 2 5 boundary conditions to derive a fully operational mathematical model for solving one dimensional flow in natural watercourses which is often characterised by arbitrary cross section geometry and variable longitudinal profile river bifurcation meandering contraction and expansion set of appropriate inner and outer boundary conditions needs to be defined hence four types of most frequently applied boundary conditions will be derived in this paper 2 5 1 discharge and water level as outer boundary condition prescribing discharge hydrograph and water level stage hydrograph on the upstream and downstream boundary respectively is common practice in river modelling when specification of outer boundary conditions is considered therefore if the standard d1q3 lattice agreement is applied according to the first statistical moment eq 11 the unknown distribution function f 1 i 1 j on the upstream boundary is defined as 24 q up f 1 i 1 j e 1 f 2 i 1 j e 2 which further yields the final form 25 f 1 i 1 j f 2 i 1 j q up e where index i 1 n denotes computational node cross section along the section j 1 m while q up denotes the discharge set in the upstream boundary cross section the unknown distribution function f 2 i n j on the downstream boundary is derived applying the same simple strategy using the zeroth statistical moment eq 11 in form 26 f 2 i n j ag f 0 f 1 i n j where a i n j denotes the cross section area obtained from the corresponding water level cross section area curve for a particular water level value while the corresponding basis g is calculated using the first and second order approximation for the boundary cross section and the rest of the domain respectively 2 5 2 tributary flow to incorporate tributary flow into the one dimensional lb model appropriate formulation of the inner boundary condition based on the lattice disposition shown in fig 1 is formulated hence the unknown distribution functions f 2 i n j and f 1 i 1 j 1 corresponding to the end and beginning of sections j and j 1 respectively are derived using the continuity equation and water level equality between cross sections a i n j and a i 1 j 1 in form 27 q i 1 j 1 q i n j q t 28 z i n j z i 1 j 1 inserting expression of the first statistical moment into eq 27 using condition of cross section equality instead of eq 28 along with the zeroth statistical moment formulation following by some elementary algebra yield relation for the two unknown distribution functions in form 29 f 2 i n j 1 g i n j g i 1 j 1 1 f 0 2 f 2 i 1 j 1 f 1 i n j q t e g i n j g i 1 j 1 f 0 f 1 i n j 30 f 1 i 1 j 1 f 1 f 2 i n j f 2 i 1 j 1 q t e where q t denotes the tributary flow 2 5 3 bifurcation river bifurcation occurs when a river flowing in a single stream separates into two or more separate downstream streams if they merge again downstream the bifurcation creates a river island while in hydraulic sense a closed system consisting of two or more river branches is formed requiring additional conditions in the separation and merging locations in order to implement this type of inner boundary conditions into the lb method formulation of appropriate distribution function corresponding to splitting and merging flow is required to derive the unknown distribution functions for the merging location fig 2 the condition of water level equality and the continuity equation between merging the branches in form 31 q i 1 j 2 q i n j 1 q i n j 32 z i 1 j 2 z i n j 1 z i n j is used expressing water levels in eq 32 in terms of the corresponding cross section area by the means of linear interpolation of the z a curve and zeroth statistical moment defined by eq 11 equality relation z i 1 j 2 z i n j can be derived in form 33 f 1 s g i 1 j 2 f 2 s g i n j f 0 f 1 s g as i n j f 0 f 2 s g as i 1 j 2 where s denotes slope between two points on the z a curve defined as s z k 1 z k a k 1 a k similar expression can be obtained for the second equality relation z i 1 j 2 z i n j 1 as well to close the system of equations the first statistical moment is implemented in eq 31 which produces 34 f 1 i 1 j 2 f 2 i n j f 2 i n j 1 f 2 i 1 j 2 f 1 i n j f 1 i n j 1 finally if matrix notation is used in form ax b where 35 a s g i 1 j 2 s g i n j 0 s g i 1 j 2 0 s g i n j 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 36 x f 1 i 1 j 2 f 2 i n j f 2 i n j 1 37 b f 0 f 1 s g as i n j f 0 f 2 s g as i 1 j 2 f 0 f 1 s g as i n j 1 f 0 f 2 s g as i 1 j 2 f 2 i 1 j 2 f 1 i n j f 1 i n j 1 solution can be obtained by solving matrix equation x a 1 b evidently the presented approach can be used for flow separation location as well as for arbitrary number of channel river reaches merging or separating at the corresponding location 3 validation in order to test the proposed model steady flow in prismatic channel a case of unsteady flow in non prismatic channel of simple cross section geometry and unsteady flow along a chosen section of the danube river is simulated in the first and second flow case comparison between the corresponding equidistant and non equidistant physical mesh is provided using the proposed lb model and the commercial hec ras us army corps of engineers 2016 software for the danube river example cross section geometry along the river is obtained by standard geodetic survey as defined by the republic hydro meteorological service of serbia the verification of the lb model was carried out by applying the actual measured flow and water level data as well as the results obtained by the hec ras us army corps of engineers 2016 software 3 1 a steady non uniform flow in prismatic channel for the first test case a simple prismatic channel having total length l 1000 0 m width b 100 0 m manning s roughness coefficients n 0 025 m 1 3 s and constant bed slope s 0 0 001 has been explored in order to provide non uniform flow along the channel water surface elevation z d 1 20 m and discharge q 100 00 m3 s have been set as downstream and upstream boundary conditions respectively the corresponding froude number is fr 0 39 while the reynolds number takes value of re 9 918 10 5 in order to test behaviour of the proposed lb model in non uniform conditions both equidistant and non equidistant grid distribution are applied standard uniform lattice pattern with computational lattice size Œ¥ Œæ 1 0 and physical distance between cross sections Œ¥ x 50 0 m have been imposed in the first case while non equidistant physical grid with minimum cross section distance of Œ¥ x min 20 0 m and maximum distance of Œ¥ x max 81 72 m positioned in the middle and on both ends of the channel respectively have been used in the second case as a result grid with 21computational points has been defined the stability of the model was achieved by setting œÑ 0 505 for both models while Œ¥ t 1 0 s and Œ¥ t 0 7 s have been used for the equidistant and non equidistant grid respectively to ensure consistency between the lb model and the hec ras software identical boundary and initial conditions are applied in both models q init 100 0 m3 s and h init 1 2 m comparison of free surface elevation along the channel for t 50 min is shown in fig 3 while time evolution of the water level and of the discharge at three different cross sections cross section stations are measured from the upstream boundary are given in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively furthermore to quantitatively validate the lbm in terms of relative difference with the reference to the hec ras solution corresponding l 2 norm error analysis is utilized hence for the steady state fig 3 the l 2 norm errors have taken values of l 2 1 3 10 3 and 1 1 10 3 for the equidistant and non equidistant configuration respectively while for the time evolution data fig 4 values of l 2 7 0 10 4 and 4 0 10 5 for the equidistant and non equidistant grid respectively are obtained very good agreement between the compared results is therefore confirmed 3 2 an unsteady flow in non prismatic channel unsteady flow in non prismatic channel is modelled in the second example for total length bed slope and manning s roughness coefficient values of l 24000 0 m s 0 0 0005 and n 0 0667 m 1 3 s have been adopted respectively while non prismatic character to the channel is set by adopting relation for channel width b 8 0 12 0 x l where x represents the corresponding cross section station fig 6 a using the same approach as in the previous example two grids an equidistant and a non equidistant are generated in case of the equidistant grid constant physical distance between the cross sections Œ¥ x 1000 0 m is used while in case of non equidistant grid rather random pattern shown in fig 6a is applied lattice size of Œ¥ Œæ 1 0 is used for both grids as a result grid consisting of 25computational points have been defined in both cases where for the non equidistant grid values of Œ¥ x min 500 0 m and Œ¥ x max 1700 0 m have been set as minimum and maximum cross section distances respectively the non uniform feature of the proposed lbm is tested in this case by imposing hydrograph shown in fig 6b as upstream boundary condition while for the downstream boundary condition depth according to the chezy manning equation is applied the non dimensionless froude and reynolds numbers corresponding to the maximal flow and water surface level values are fr 0 12 and re 5 848 10 6 respectively to evaluate the unknown distribution functions on the open boundaries by using these physical variables eqs 25 and 26 are further exploited the stability of the lb model is achieved setting œÑ 0 501 and Œ¥ t 2 0 s for both grids producing therefore 12600computational steps for flow simulation of duration 420 0 min as validation methodology the hec ras based approach used in the previous example has been applied here as well the comparison of results obtained by the lbm and the hec ras tool bidiagonal four point implicit finite difference preissman scheme preissmann 1961 are given in form of a stage and flow hydrograph shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively four cross sections equally distributed along the channel are used as comparison check points where cross sections stations for the non equidistant grid are marked in fig 6a the historical record of water surface elevation both for the equidistant and non equidistant grid is shown in fig 7a and b respectively while the corresponding flow hydrographs are shown in fig 8a and b for the historical record of water surface elevation fig 7 the l 2 norm errors take values of l 2 4 2 10 4 and 1 2 10 3 for the equidistant and non equidistant configuration respectively while values of l 2 1 1 10 4 and 7 6 10 5 for the equidistant and non equidistant configuration respectively are calculated in case of resulting hydrographs fig 8 high level of agreement between the results obtained by the two conceptually different numerical models is achieved confirming therefore the capacity of the proposed lb model to manage unsteady flows accurately and efficiently on computational grids characterized by non uniform configuration 3 3 the danube river case study for the third case study the danube river experimental reach is adopted as europe s second longest river the danube originates in germany then flows southeast 2860 km touching the border or passing through austria slovakia hungary croatia serbia romania bulgaria moldova and ukraine before discharging into the black sea its drainage basin extends into nine more countries to test the proposed one dimensional lbm the serbian section of the danube river stretching between the iron gate i hydroelectric power station rkm 970 35 and the smederevo gauging station in serbia rkm 1116 23 is used fig 9 along this experimental reach having total length of 145 88 km four tributaries velika morava nera pek and poreƒçka and two closed bifurcation systems river islands are located fig 10 typical cross section is presented in fig 11 alongside with two hydrological stations located at the upstream and downstream boundary of the reach where corresponding discharge water level measurements are preformed two additional gauging stations gs golubac and gs donji milanovac can be find at rkm 1042 00 and rkm 995 00 respectively in contrast to the upstream and downstream hydrological stations only water level measurements are conducted at these two locations the schematic presentation of the experimental reach shown in fig 10 is used for making up the model accordingly the corresponding experimental reach is divided into nine sections each of them separated by four tributaries and two river islands each section is defined by the corresponding cross sections fig 11 arbitrarily distributed along each particular section where the total number of exploited cross sections per reach section is given in table 1 it should be noted that the corresponding cross section survey along the serbian section of the danube river is done by the republic hydro meteorological service of serbia in accordance with the standardized procedure for this type of measurements where the distance between two cross sections is maintained in the range of 800 0 1300 0 m for this experimental reach discharge and water level measurements at gauging stations smederevo and iron gate i obtained during august 2006 have been used as upstream and downstream boundary condition respectively fig 12 significant unsteadiness of flow can be observed as inner boundary conditions corresponding to the bifurcation and merging locations relations eqs 35 37 are imposed at the beginning and at the end of sections s5 and s7 for tributary flow coming from velika morava value of q 90 0 m3 s is applied fig 10 for manning s roughness coefficient value of n 0 0318 m 1 3 s has been assigned along the whole experimental reach while for time step and relaxation time values Œ¥ t 10 0 s and œÑ 0 57 have been adopted respectively it should be noted that the accuracy of the model for all examples is according to eq 23 controlled by keeping the relaxation time œÑ close to value of 0 5 where for values œÑ 0 5001 model exhibits unstable behaviour prior to unsteady flow simulations steady state is first achieved by imposing constant flow q 2570 00 m3 s and constant water surface level z 69 44 m at the upstream and downstream boundary respectively following stabilization of the model unsteady simulation is performed by applying boundary conditions shown in fig 12 which consecutively produce the froude number along the reach in range of 0 01 0 07 accordingly accomplishment of the 31 day simulation is achieved after 267840 time steps i e after 12 34 min to validate the model adequate comparison of obtained results with the corresponding measurements in form of hourly based stage and flow hydrographs are conducted the comparison of water surface levels for two gauging stations donji milanovac and golubac is shown in fig 13 a and b respectively while the discharge comparison for the iron gate i location is given in fig 14 excellent agreement is achieved for both data sets in case of water surface elevations deviations between the obtained results and the measured ones are in range of 10 0 cm which can be considered as satisfactory level of accuracy for the unsteadiness characteristic to the modelled case significant difference having maximum value of 18 0 cm is observed only at gs golubac between august 16th and august 21th fig 13b on the other hand in terms of discharge deviations between the compared results are in the range of 200 00 m3 s where the most significant difference of 840 00 m3 s is observed only once on august 10th 4 conclusion a novel form of the lattice boltzmann method for solving the sve is presented and validated in this paper in order to establish the lbm as tool for solving practical problems when one dimensional modeling of flow in natural watercourses is considered two major improvements of the standard lbm have been successfully introduced and validated the first one is the formulation of the water surface the second is the non uniformity of the computational grid the former eliminates the bed slope term while the later introduces flexibility in spatial distribution of cross sections which in turn opens opportunity for optional arrangement of computational points along the modeled reach as well as for local grid refinement coarsening procedure often used for managing stability issues furthermore the concept of arbitrary cross section geometry is introduced and the bifurcation boundary condition is derived and successfully implemented in the model simulation of unsteady flow in the experimental danube river reach and in two channels having simpler geometry is utilized for validation of the model where results of appropriate flow measurement and results obtained by an alternative model are used as base of comparison excellent agreement between the compared results is obtained confirming the capacity of the proposed model to serve as a fully competitive practical tool comparable to the standard modelling software s forthcoming research will be directed to computational optimization especially in terms of computer code parallelization in terms of physical processes modelled sediment transport seems to be promising 
7149,a novel form of the lattice boltzmann method for the saint venant equations labsve is formulated and implemented to eliminate equidistant property of the lattice structure being the major drawback of the lbm and thus establish the lb model as tool for practical application natural water bodies fully competitive compared to the presently available computational models new form of equilibrium distribution function edf based on geometrically transformed saint venant equations sve is derived introducing the metric relation function between the physical and computational system the non uniform spatial discretization is managed by solving the transformed sve rather than altering the symmetrical properties of lattice structure since the geometrical correlation between the two corresponding systems is introduced into the transformed sve the very basic structure of the lbm in terms of simplicity in implementing the boundary conditions and computational efficiency owing to the parallel structure is maintained and further improved by removing the limitations imposed by the equidistant lattice condition furthermore the discharge water level definition of the sve as more applicable form when natural watercourses are considered is applied in this way the bed slope term is completely eliminated from the equations establishing therefore a model more suitable for natural systems characterized by arbitrary cross sectional geometry in order to test the proposed non equidistant labsve model steady flow in prismatic channel unsteady flow in non prismatic channel of simple cross section geometry and unsteady flow along a danube section is modelled additional simulations by using the hec ras modelling tool are conducted in order to produce comparison basis for both unsteady simulations while in case of the danube river section actual water level and discharge measurements are additionally used for calibration and verification of the model very good agreement between compared results is obtained showing that the proposed non equidistant form of the labsve is capable of solving complex environmental problems maintaining the order of accuracy simplicity and efficiency of the basic lbm keywords lattice boltzmann method saint venant equations natural watercourses non uniform grid danube river 1 introduction the hydrodynamic process of open channel unsteady flow in complex network of natural watercourses rivers canals are modelled using a set of non linear partial derivative saint venant equations cunge et al 1980 in order to develop a robust mathematical tool for practical application which can efficiently manage variety of complex hydraulic states imposed by natural watercourses including shock waves changes between regimes several numerical methods from the domain of conventional computational fluid dynamics cfd have been used in past the bidiagonal four point implicit finite difference preissman scheme preissmann 1961 and the method integrated with the hermite cubic interpolation known as holly preissmann method holly and preissmann 1977 are robust and unconditionally stable numerical schemes thus they are the most widely used methods in free surface one dimensional subcritical numerical modelling in order to find a particular cell face value leonard 1979 has introduced quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick which uses a quadratic function passing through the face of the control volume based on the higher order differencing scheme for a three point upstream weighted quadratic interpolation additionally characteristic form of the sve by applying the method of characteristics mc and the hartree method is solved by abbott 1979 however since the solution of the hartree scheme is artificially smoothed by interpolation errors to estimate flow conditions in the corresponding computational point the above mentioned finite difference methods offer significant improvement in accuracy therefore they are preferred when practical application is considered in order to further extend and consequentially improve the efficiency and robustness of the presently available one dimensional flow models the novel form of the lattice boltzmann method for solving the spatially transformed sve is presented in this paper being relatively new approach in numerical mathematics the lattice boltzmann method rivet and boon 2001 rothman and zaleski 1997 wolf gladrow 2001 is intensively studied and applied by many authors on variety of flow and flow related processes by many authors in the past two decades a multi component lbm based on the two component rothman keller lattice gas model was developed by gunstensen and rothman 1991 while chen and shan 1993 successfully implemented a lbm model with mean field interactions for multiphase and multi component fluid flows flow in porous media was investigated by groups of authors succi et al 1989 pan et al 2006 and degruyter et al 2010 while utilization of the lattice boltzmann model in case of isotropic groundwater flows is examined by zhou 2007 and budinski et al 2015 in order to solve anisotropy when advection and anisotropic dispersion equations aade are considered ginzburg 2005 and yoshida and nagaoka 2010 applied two relaxation time trt and the multiple relaxation time mrt approaches lallemand and luo 2000 d humieres et al 2002 respectively while single phase transient flow in pipes by using adaptive grid approach is examined by budinski 2016 utilization of the lbm on depth averaged flow equations labswe using the nine velocity d2q9 model was initially introduced by salmon 1999 further improvement in terms of stability and turbulence by introducing centred scheme for the force term and deriving a lattice boltzmann model for the shallow water equations with turbulence modelling labswetm for the subgrid scale stress model was achieved by zhou 2004 2011 furthermore to manage flow domains characterized by complex geometry ginzburg 2005 introduces grid transformation for modeling of the stretched rectangular computational domain while zhou 2010 developed the rectangular lattice boltzmann model applying the mesh manipulation techniques used in the traditional cfd methods budinski 2014 introduced the mrt lbm for shallow water equations swe transformed in curvilinear coordinates utilization of the lbm to model one dimensional shallow water equations is done by frandsen 2008 dellar and salmon 2005 and th√∂mmes et al 2007 while the first application of the lbm on open air canals using the simpler prismatic form of the saint venant equations has been preformed by van thang et al 2010 further improvement by introducing non prismatic terms into the model has been achieved by liu et al 2015 additional stability improvement by combining two approaches presented in frandsen 2008 and ginzburg 2005 is done by ginzburg 2013 the parallel nature of the lbm method have been extensively exploited using state of the art gpu graphics processing units based architectures and coprocessors janen and krafczyk 2011 tubbs and tsai 2011 sch√∂nherr et al 2011 further improvement of the presently available lbsve models is presented in this paper as it was stated earlier the lbsve models investigated by van thang et al 2010 and liu et al 2015 exploit a simpler form of the sve application of the lattice boltzmann approach to the sve is to the authors knowledge investigated only by the mentioned two groups of authors which is by its formulation impractical when one dimensional modelling of natural watercourses is considered additional drawback of the lattice boltzmann method is the required uniformity of the lattice structure imposed by the symmetry of the predefined lattice velocities consequently the non uniformity between the computational points is prevented and features crucial for managing domains with arbitrary geometry like flexibility and efficiency are therefore limited to completely eliminate uniformity of the 1d lattice pattern from the lb model corresponding geometrical transformation between the physical and computational domain is introduced and flexibility in managing physical distances between the computational points in case of cross sections is therefore forwarded furthermore the new discharge water level formulation of the sve is used resulting in removal of the bed slope term and efficient management of arbitrary geometry of the cross section the proposed model is tested and verified against the case of steady flow in prismatic channel an example of unsteady flow in non prismatic channel having simple cross section geometry and unsteady flow along a section of the danube river additional comparison data are obtained by using the hec ras us army corps of engineers 2016 modelling tool and utilizing actual water level and discharge measurements 2 mathematical formulation 2 1 the saint venant equations introducing simplifications in terms of uniform velocity distribution in the cross sections assumption of hydrostatical pressure distribution and gradually sloped bed into the navier stokes equations nse the one dimensional saint venant equations are derived with the main purpose of establishing a modelling tool for large scale flow systems network of canals and natural watercourses four basic formulations of the sve depending on the dependent variables involved can be distinguished which particular form of the sve will be used is determined by practical limitations like geometry or complexity of the examined flow cases hence when flow systems with simple cross sectional geometry and straightforward presentation of bed slope are considered discharge sectional area form of the sve is used liu et al 2015 however when natural watercourses characterised by complex cross sectional and longitudinal geometry are modelled this particular form becomes impractical and inadequate to overcome these limitations the hybrid discharge water surface elevation form of the sve is adopted 1 a t q x q 2 q t x œâ q 2 a ga z x gas f where a x t is cross section area q x t is discharge z x t is free surface elevation q x t is lateral inflow per unit length g is the gravitational acceleration t is time x is the cartesian coordinate and œâ is the coefficient velocity non uniformity it should be noted that the discharge sectional area form of the sve can be obtained simply by replacing the free surface elevation z x t in the rhs of eq 2 with the term a x t z b x assumption a x h x is used where h x t is water depth and z b x is bed elevation s f represents the friction slope defined as 3 s f n 2 q 2 a 2 r 4 3 where n is manning s roughness coefficient and r is hydraulic radius formulated as r a o where o is wetted perimeter it can be seen that insertion of water surface elevation z x t instead of cross section area a x t in eq 2 completely eliminates the bed slope term from the system of equations therefore leading to a more flexible and practical form of the sve 2 2 transformation of the sve using the adaptive grid technique uniformity of the lattice structure is the major limitation of the lb models in general which significantly decreases the efficiency and the applicability of the lattice models especially when domains of arbitrary geometry are modelled in order to eliminate this restriction and at the same time maintain the basic features of the labsve geometric transformation based on metric mapping between the physical and computational domain is introduced by applying the basic rules of coordinate transformation between the two systems simmonds 1994 eqs 1 and 2 are further transformed to the alternative coordinate system 4 t ga q Œæ qg 5 q t Œæ œâ q 2 ga ga g z Œæ gas f œâ q 2 a g 1 Œæ where Œæ represents the new coordinate while term g x Œæ denotes the corresponding basis applying geometrical transformation procedure between the two coordinate systems technique often used in traditional cfd for managing complex geometries enables calculation of terms defined in the non equidistant physical space in the equidistant Œæ grid computational frame in this way spatial non uniformity is managed by the transformed sv equations rather than with the numerical model itself allowing utilization of the standard uniform lattice based models 2 3 the lattice boltzmann model in this paper a d1q3 lattice boltzmann bhatnagar gross krook model lbgk bhatnagar et al 1954 is utilized the evolution equation is defined as 6 f Œ± Œæ e Œ± Œ¥ t

be noted that the fourth term on the rhs actually denotes the second order velocity derivative diffusion therefore œÑ parameter acts like an artificial viscosity parameter which can be used for dispersion oscillations control in the vicinity of the shocks 2 5 boundary conditions to derive a fully operational mathematical model for solving one dimensional flow in natural watercourses which is often characterised by arbitrary cross section geometry and variable longitudinal profile river bifurcation meandering contraction and expansion set of appropriate inner and outer boundary conditions needs to be defined hence four types of most frequently applied boundary conditions will be derived in this paper 2 5 1 discharge and water level as outer boundary condition prescribing discharge hydrograph and water level stage hydrograph on the upstream and downstream boundary respectively is common practice in river modelling when specification of outer boundary conditions is considered therefore if the standard d1q3 lattice agreement is applied according to the first statistical moment eq 11 the unknown distribution function f 1 i 1 j on the upstream boundary is defined as 24 q up f 1 i 1 j e 1 f 2 i 1 j e 2 which further yields the final form 25 f 1 i 1 j f 2 i 1 j q up e where index i 1 n denotes computational node cross section along the section j 1 m while q up denotes the discharge set in the upstream boundary cross section the unknown distribution function f 2 i n j on the downstream boundary is derived applying the same simple strategy using the zeroth statistical moment eq 11 in form 26 f 2 i n j ag f 0 f 1 i n j where a i n j denotes the cross section area obtained from the corresponding water level cross section area curve for a particular water level value while the corresponding basis g is calculated using the first and second order approximation for the boundary cross section and the rest of the domain respectively 2 5 2 tributary flow to incorporate tributary flow into the one dimensional lb model appropriate formulation of the inner boundary condition based on the lattice disposition shown in fig 1 is formulated hence the unknown distribution functions f 2 i n j and f 1 i 1 j 1 corresponding to the end and beginning of sections j and j 1 respectively are derived using the continuity equation and water level equality between cross sections a i n j and a i 1 j 1 in form 27 q i 1 j 1 q i n j q t 28 z i n j z i 1 j 1 inserting expression of the first statistical moment into eq 27 using condition of cross section equality instead of eq 28 along with the zeroth statistical moment formulation following by some elementary algebra yield relation for the two unknown distribution functions in form 29 f 2 i n j 1 g i n j g i 1 j 1 1 f 0 2 f 2 i 1 j 1 f 1 i n j q t e g i n j g i 1 j 1 f 0 f 1 i n j 30 f 1 i 1 j 1 f 1 f 2 i n j f 2 i 1 j 1 q t e where q t denotes the tributary flow 2 5 3 bifurcation river bifurcation occurs when a river flowing in a single stream separates into two or more separate downstream streams if they merge again downstream the bifurcation creates a river island while in hydraulic sense a closed system consisting of two or more river branches is formed requiring additional conditions in the separation and merging locations in order to implement this type of inner boundary conditions into the lb method formulation of appropriate distribution function corresponding to splitting and merging flow is required to derive the unknown distribution functions for the merging location fig 2 the condition of water level equality and the continuity equation between merging the branches in form 31 q i 1 j 2 q i n j 1 q i n j 32 z i 1 j 2 z i n j 1 z i n j is used expressing water levels in eq 32 in terms of the corresponding cross section area by the means of linear interpolation of the z a curve and zeroth statistical moment defined by eq 11 equality relation z i 1 j 2 z i n j can be derived in form 33 f 1 s g i 1 j 2 f 2 s g i n j f 0 f 1 s g as i n j f 0 f 2 s g as i 1 j 2 where s denotes slope between two points on the z a curve defined as s z k 1 z k a k 1 a k similar expression can be obtained for the second equality relation z i 1 j 2 z i n j 1 as well to close the system of equations the first statistical moment is implemented in eq 31 which produces 34 f 1 i 1 j 2 f 2 i n j f 2 i n j 1 f 2 i 1 j 2 f 1 i n j f 1 i n j 1 finally if matrix notation is used in form ax b where 35 a s g i 1 j 2 s g i n j 0 s g i 1 j 2 0 s g i n j 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 36 x f 1 i 1 j 2 f

x a 1 b evidently the presented approach can be used for flow separation location as well as for arbitrary number of channel river reaches merging or separating at the corresponding location 3 validation in order to test the proposed model steady flow in prismatic channel a case of unsteady flow in non prismatic channel of simple cross section geometry and unsteady flow along a chosen section of the danube river is simulated in the first and second flow case comparison between the corresponding equidistant and non equidistant physical mesh is provided using the proposed lb model and the commercial hec ras us army corps of engineers 2016 software for the danube river example cross section geometry along the river is obtained by standard geodetic survey as defined by the republic hydro meteorological service of serbia the verification of the lb model was carried out by applying the actual measured flow and water level data as well as the results obtained by the hec ras us army corps of engineers 2016 software 3 1 a steady non uniform flow in prismatic channel for the first test case a simple prismatic channel having total length l 1000 0 m width b 100 0 m manning s roughness coefficients n 0 025 m 1 3 s and constant bed slope s 0 0 001 has been explored in order to provide non uniform flow along the channel water surface elevation z d 1 20 m and discharge q 100 00 m3 s have been set as downstream and upstream boundary conditions respectively the corresponding froude number is fr 0 39 while the reynolds number takes value of re 9 918 10 5 in order to test behaviour of the proposed lb model in non uniform conditions both equidistant and non equidistant grid distribution are applied standard uniform lattice pattern with computational lattice size Œ¥ Œæ 1 0 and physical distance between cross sections Œ¥ x 50 0 m have been imposed in the first case while non equidistant physical grid with minimum cross section distance of Œ¥ x min 20 0 m and maximum distance of Œ¥ x max 81 72 m positioned in the middle and on both ends of the channel respectively have been used in the second case as a result grid with 21computational points has been defined the stability of the model was achieved by setting œÑ 0 505 for both models while Œ¥ t 1 0 s and Œ¥ t 0 7 s have been used for the equidistant and non equidistant grid respectively to ensure consistency between the lb model and the hec ras software identical boundary and initial conditions are applied in both models q init 100 0 m3 s and h init 1 2 m comparison of free surface elevation along the channel for t 50 min is shown in fig 3 while time evolution of the water level and of the discharge at three different cross sections cross section stations are measured from the upstream boundary are given in fig 4 and fig 5 respectively furthermore to quantitatively validate the lbm in terms of relative difference with the reference to the hec ras solution corresponding l 2 norm error analysis is utilized hence for the steady state fig 3 the l 2 norm errors have taken values of l 2 1 3 10 3 and 1 1 10 3 for the equidistant and non equidistant configuration respectively while for the time evolution data fig 4 values of l 2 7 0 10 4 and 4 0 10 5 for the equidistant and non equidistant grid respectively are obtained very good agreement between the compared results is therefore confirmed 3 2 an unsteady flow in non prismatic channel unsteady flow in non prismatic channel is modelled in the second example for total length bed slope and manning s roughness coefficient values of l 24000 0 m s 0 0 0005 and n 0 0667 m 1 3 s have been adopted respectively while non prismatic character to the channel is set by adopting relation for channel width b 8 0 12 0 x l where x represents the corresponding cross section station fig 6 a using the same approach as in the previous example two grids an equidistant and a non equidistant are generated in case of the equidistant grid constant physical distance between the cross sections Œ¥ x 1000 0 m is used while in case of non equidistant grid rather random pattern shown in fig 6a is applied lattice size of Œ¥ Œæ 1 0 is used for both grids as a result grid consisting of 25computational points have been defined in both cases where for the non equidistant grid values of Œ¥ x min 500 0 m and Œ¥ x max 1700 0 m have been set as minimum and maximum cross section distances respectively the non uniform feature of the proposed lbm is tested in this case by imposing hydrograph shown in fig 6b as upstream boundary condition while for the downstream boundary condition depth according to the chezy manning equation is applied the non dimensionless froude and reynolds numbers corresponding to the maximal flow and water surface level values are fr 0 12 and re 5 848 10 6 respectively to evaluate the unknown distribution functions on the open boundaries by using these physical variables eqs 25 and 26 are further exploited the stability of the lb model is achieved setting œÑ 0 501 and Œ¥ t 2 0 s for both grids producing therefore 12600computational steps for flow simulation of duration 420 0 min as validation methodology the hec ras based approach used in the previous example has been applied here as well the comparison of results obtained by the lbm and the hec ras tool bidiagonal four point implicit finite difference preissman scheme preissmann 1961 are given in form of a stage and flow hydrograph shown in fig 7 and fig 8 respectively four cross sections equally distributed along the channel are used as comparison check points where cross sections stations for the non equidistant grid are marked in fig 6a the historical record of water surface elevation both for the equidistant and non equidistant grid is shown in fig 7a and b respectively while the corresponding flow hydrographs are shown in fig 8a and b for the historical record of water surface elevation fig 7 the l 2 norm errors take values of l 2 4 2 10 4 and 1 2 10 3 for the equidistant and non equidistant configuration respectively while values of l 2 1 1 10 4 and 7 6 10 5 for the equidistant and non equidistant configuration respectively are calculated in case of resulting hydrographs fig 8 high level of agreement between the results obtained by the two conceptually different numerical models is achieved confirming therefore the capacity of the proposed lb model to manage unsteady flows accurately and efficiently on computational grids characterized by non uniform configuration 3 3 the danube river case study for the third case study the danube river experimental reach is adopted as europe s second longest river the danube originates in germany then flows southeast 2860 km touching the border or passing through austria slovakia hungary croatia serbia romania bulgaria moldova and ukraine before discharging into the black sea its drainage basin extends into nine more countries to test the proposed one dimensional lbm the serbian section of the danube river stretching between the iron gate i hydroelectric power station rkm 970 35 and the smederevo gauging station in serbia rkm 1116 23 is used fig 9 along this experimental reach having total length of 145 88 km four tributaries velika morava nera pek and poreƒçka and two closed bifurcation systems river islands are located fig 10 typical cross section is presented in fig 11 alongside with two hydrological stations located at the upstream and downstream boundary of the reach where corresponding discharge water level measurements are preformed two additional gauging stations gs golubac and gs donji milanovac can be find at rkm 1042 00 and rkm 995 00 respectively in contrast to the upstream and downstream hydrological stations only water level measurements are conducted at these two locations the schematic presentation of the experimental reach shown in fig 10 is used for making up the model accordingly the corresponding experimental reach is divided into nine sections each of them separated by four tributaries and two river islands each section is defined by the corresponding cross sections fig 11 arbitrarily distributed along each particular section where the total number of exploited cross sections per reach section is given in table 1 it should be noted that the corresponding cross section survey along the serbian section of the danube river is done by the republic hydro meteorological service of serbia in accordance with the standardized procedure for this type of measurements where the distance between two cross sections is maintained in the range of 800 0 1300 0 m for this experimental reach discharge and water level measurements at gauging stations smederevo and iron gate i obtained during august 2006 have been used as upstream and downstream boundary condition respectively fig 12 significant unsteadiness of flow can be observed as inner boundary conditions corresponding to the bifurcation and merging locations relations eqs 35 37 are imposed at the beginning and at the end of sections s5 and s7 for tributary flow coming from velika morava value of q 90 0 m3 s is applied fig 10 for manning s roughness coefficient value of n 0 0318 m 1 3 s has been assigned along the whole experimental reach while for time step and relaxation time values Œ¥ t 10 0 s and œÑ 0 57 have been adopted respectively it should be noted that the accuracy of the model for all examples is according to eq 23 controlled by keeping the relaxation time œÑ close to value of 0 5 where for values œÑ 0 5001 model exhibits unstable behaviour prior to unsteady flow simulations steady state is first achieved by imposing constant flow q 2570 00 m3 s and constant water surface level z 69 44 m at the upstream and downstream boundary respectively following stabilization of the model unsteady simulation is performed by applying boundary conditions shown in fig 12 which consecutively produce the froude number along the reach in range of 0 01 0 07 accordingly accomplishment of the 31 day simulation is achieved after 267840 time steps i e after 12 34 min to validate the model adequate comparison of obtained results with the corresponding measurements in form of hourly based stage and flow hydrographs are conducted the comparison of water surface levels for two gauging stations donji milanovac and golubac is shown in fig 13 a and b respectively while the discharge comparison for the iron gate i location is given in fig 14 excellent agreement is achieved for both data sets in case of water surface elevations deviations between the obtained results and the measured ones are in range of 10 0 cm which can be considered as satisfactory level of accuracy for the unsteadiness characteristic to the modelled case significant difference having maximum value of 18 0 cm is observed only at gs golubac between august 16th and august 21th fig 13b on the other hand in terms of discharge deviations between the compared results are in the range of 200 00 m3 s where the most significant difference of 840 00 m3 s is observed only once on august 10th 4 conclusion a novel form of the lattice boltzmann method for solving the sve is presented and validated in this paper in order to establish the lbm as tool for solving practical problems when one dimensional modeling of flow in natural watercourses is considered two major improvements of the standard lbm have been successfully introduced and validated the first one is the formulation of the water surface the second is the non uniformity of the computational grid the former eliminates the bed slope term while the later introduces flexibility in spatial distribution of cross sections which in turn opens opportunity for optional arrangement of computational points along the modeled reach as well as for local grid refinement coarsening procedure often used for managing stability issues furthermore the concept of arbitrary cross section geometry is introduced and the bifurcation boundary condition is derived and successfully implemented in the model simulation of unsteady flow in the experimental danube river reach and in two channels having simpler geometry is utilized for validation of the model where results of appropriate flow measurement and results obtained by an alternative model are used as base of comparison excellent agreement between the compared results is obtained confirming the capacity of the proposed model to serve as a fully competitive practical tool comparable to the standard modelling software s forthcoming research will be directed to computational optimization especially in terms of computer code parallelization in terms of physical processes modelled sediment transport seems to be promising
