8970,there is an increasing interest in the cultivation of wild edible plants wep in consideration of their quality attributes and salt tolerance which makes these species good candidates for cascade cropping systems ccs in these systems saline effluents from a salt sensitive donor crop are used to irrigate a receiving crop with greater salt tolerance the objective of this study was to evaluate two wep species picris hieracioides ph and plantago coronopus pc as candidate crops for ccs both species were grown hydroponically with saline effluent from a semi closed substrate culture of tomato the donor crop both ph and pc were grown in floating system for 36 days during spring using one of the following nutrient solutions i standard nutrient solution cns control ii nacl enriched 50 mmol l 1 standard nutrient solution sns iii effluent from tomato substrate culture te iv artificial effluent ate i e a nutrient with ion concentrations and salinity level approximately 50 mmol l 1 nacl very close to those of te compared with cns leaf production was significantly reduced in both te 33 6 and ate 33 6 plants of ph and only in te 23 3 plants of pc in both species leaf na content increased in sns 858 1 in ph 279 4 in pc te 704 7 in ph 226 3 in pc and ate 697 7 in ph 229 4 in pc plants compared with the controls leaf antioxidant capacity was positively correlated with total phenol content and in pc increased in sns 74 3 te 53 9 and ate plants 37 7 compared with the controls in conclusion both ph and pc could be grown in ccs with saline greenhouse hydroponic effluents since the moderate reduction of leaf production could be partially compensated by reduced production costs because of zero costs for fertilisers the growth inhibition observed in both weps species cultivated with the hydroponic effluent was primarily due to its high salinity with minor or no effects due to the suboptimal nutrient levels and or the presence of phytotoxic root exudates or microbial metabolites

introduction in greenhouse soilless culture the waste of water and nutrients with drainage water and the consequent environmental impact can be strongly reduced by the adoption of closed loop systems massa et al 2020 in these systems the recirculating nutrient solution is normally discharged at least partially when the electrical conductivity ec and or the concentration of some potential toxic ion e g sodium reaches a maximum acceptable threshold semi closed systems massa et al 2010 instead of conventional wastewater treatments before discharge in the environment there are several strategies for sustainable management of the effluents from open and semi closed soilless cultures such as phytoremediation using constructed wetlands and the re use for algae culture richa et al 2020 or cascade cropping systems ccs massa et al 2020 in ccs the effluent from a donor crop is used for the fertigation of one or more receiving crops with higher tolerance to salinity the first studies on greenhouse ccs date back to 20 years ago incrocci et al 2003 but a renewed interest has recently arisen for these systems applied to greenhouse soilless e g avdouli et al 2021 garcía caparrós et al 2021a katsoulas et al 2020 santos et al 2022 or soil bound crops santos et al 2022 or in open field muñoz et al 2017 the goal of ccs is to take advantage of the residual water and nutrients of hydroponic effluents and to make them safer for the environment thus reducing the costs of fertilisers and water depuration in addition the relatively high salinity of effluents may improve the quality attributes of receiving crops for instance increasing the fruit dry matter incrocci et al 2003 or the content of several compounds that are associated with the organoleptic nutritional and nutraceutical quality of many fruit and leafy vegetables avdouli et al 2021 the re use of hydroponic effluents has several drawbacks however since they may have high salinity and abnormal nutrient mutual ratios samiotis et al 2022 and or contain phytotoxic roots exudates avdouli et al 2021 hosseinzadeh et al 2017 microbial metabolites salazar et al 2021 and residues of plant protection products santos et al 2022 moreover long term fertigation of soil grown crops with drainage water from soilless culture can result in soil degradation and environmental pollution santos et al 2022 many wild edible plant wep species are halophyte or salt tolerant glycophyte isayenkov 2019 lombardi et al 2022 and therefore are good candidates for the role of receiving crops in ccs there is a growing interest in the cultivation of weps in consideration of their nutritional and nutraceutical properties due to their high content of phytochemicals ceccanti et al 2020 picris hieracioides l ph hawkneed oxtongue and plantago coronopus l pc buck s horn are two weps that could be grown in ccs picris hieracioides is a biennial or short lived perennial weed belonging to the family of asteraceae gillbank 2014 this species has been rediscovered thanks to the renewed interest in traditional food ceccanti et al 2018 and the nutraceuticals and medicinal properties of its leaves ceccanti et al 2020 due for instance to the content of numerous terpenoid glycosides that can be used against fever and inflammation uchiyama et al 1990 plantago coronopus is a perennial herb that belongs to the family of plantaginaceae and is considered a facultative halophyte bueno et al 2020 2021 ltaeif et al 2021 its leaves are commonly consumed fresh in mixed salads and appreciated for its salty taste and high nutritional value due to a high content of phenolic compounds essential amino acids and minerals jdey et al 2017 koyro 2006 very few papers have been published on the hydroponic cultivation of pc e g bueno et al 2020 bueno et al 2021 ceccanti et al 2022 chu and brown 2021 and to the best of our knowledge no work has been conducted on ph apart from the study conducted by ceccanti et al 2020 the goal of the present work was to investigate the performance of ph and pc grown hydroponically with the drainage water from a greenhouse substrate culture of tomato an important greenhouse crop that is widely cultivated in soilless systems in separate and parallel experiments both ph and pc were grown in floating systems under the typical climate conditions that occur in spring in mediterranean greenhouses using the following nutrient solutions a genuine or artificial effluent from a semi closed tomato substrate culture and a standard solution containing negligible 1 0 mmol l 1 or high 50 mmol l 1 nacl concentration in a preliminary experiment this high nacl concentration had induced a limited reduction of plant growth in both pc and ph and no symptom of salt toxicity was detected in either species based on the results reported in the literature on ccs or found in the preliminary experiment we hypothesized that i both species can be grown with saline effluents from greenhouse hydroponics with limited reduction of leaf production ii the growth inhibition induced by saline hydroponic effluents is mainly due to high salinity with no or minor effects due to the abnormal ion composition and or the putative presence of root and or microbial exudates iii the use of saline nutrient solution improves leaf quality in both species 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growing conditions the trials were conducted in an experimental glasshouse at the university of pisa italy lat 43 42 42 48 n long 10 24 52 92 e in spring 2021 under natural light air temperature and relative humidity and solar radiation were monitored by a weather station located inside the greenhouse basic information on the experiment is reported in table 1 seeds of ph and pc were purchased from gargini sementi lucca italy and sown in 240 cell polystyrene trays with rockwool plugs the trays were placed in a growth chamber at 25 c for five days and seedlings of pc and ph were planted respectively 26 and 40 days after sowing in polystyrene raft boards floating in 50 l plastic tanks water depth 25 cm with stagnant nutrient solution each tank hosted 24 plants and there were four tanks per m2 therefore the crop density was approximately 96 plants m 2 of ground area in all the tanks the nutrient solution was continuously aerated and dissolved oxygen was above 6 mg l 1 during the whole experiment in both species leaves were harvested twice 22 and 36 days after transplanting dat table 1 by cutting the shoot approximately 2 cm above the collar level at each harvest leaf samples were collected for growth analysis and the laboratory determinations of minerals pigments flavonoids and phenols and the total antioxidant capacity at the end of the experiment samples were also collected for the determination of root biomass and mineral content 2 2 experimental design and nutrient solutions the intention of this study was to separate the effects of salinity from those of other defects see introduction of highly saline hydroponic wastewater therefore four different nutrient solutions were compared in a randomized design with three replicates each consisting of one hydroponic tank the nutrient solutions were the following i standard nutrient solution cns control ii nacl enriched 50 mmol l 1 standard nutrient solution sns iii effluent from tomato substrate culture te iv artificial effluent ate i e a nutrient with ion concentrations and salinity level approximately 50 mmol l 1 nacl very close to those of te the solutions cns sns and ate were prepared by dissolving appropriate amount of technical grade inorganic salts in tap water which contained approximately 0 78 mmol l 1 na and 0 68 mmol l 1 of cl the salinity of hydroponic effluent which contained 29 0 mmol l 1 na and 23 0 mmol l 1 cl was deliberately increased to a level similar to that of sns by adding 21 0 mmol l 1 nacl the mineral composition electrical conductivity ec and ph of the four nutrient solutions are shown in table 2 all nutrient solutions were prepared at the beginning of the experiment and stored at 8 c in the dark the composition of each solution was regularly checked and did not significantly change during the experiment which lasted 36 days before use the ph of all nutrient solutions was adjusted to 5 6 with dilute sulphuric acid the te was collected in an independent experiment on the effects of different salinity levels 10 40 and 70 mmol l 1 nacl on tomato growth and fruit quality this experiment was left out of this study which focused on ph and pc the experiment with tomato was conducted using grafted plants the scion was pisanello a landrace variety quite popular in tuscany italy and the rootstock was maxifort the closed loop hydroponic unit consisted of eight rockwool slabs grodan rockwool b v roermond the netherlands each hosting three plants with a crop density of 3 2 plant m 2 the volume of the nutrient solution in the mixing tank and the total volume of the recirculating solution were 130 l 17 3 l m 2 and 250 l 33 3 l m 2 respectively the mineral composition of the starter and refill nutrient solutions used in the first stage of the experiment are reported in table 3 during the first phase of the experiment the crop was protected against pests whiteflies fungus gnats thrips and leafminers using beneficials and bacillus thuringiensis one distribution and against diseases grey mould and late blight using two fungicides containing cyprodinil and fludioxonil or dimetomorf and copper sulphate two applications the te consisted of a blend of the nutrient solutions discharged from six separate hydroponic units after 24 days of recirculation on occasion of the first discharge before the salinity treatments were applied when tomato plants were 73 days old from the sowing date and the second truss was in bloom 2 3 determinations 2 3 1 crop yield and growth crop yield was determined by recording the fresh weight fw of all the leaves collected at first and second harvest in each hydroponic tank leaf dry weight dw was determined after drying fresh leaves in a ventilated oven at 70 c till constant weight at each harvest a sub sample of fresh leaves was collected from each tank to determine leaf area and then succulence each sample consisted of three individual plants leaf area was measured using a digital planimeter dt area meter mk2 delta t devices cambridge uk and leaf succulence was calculated as the ratio between leaf fw and la root dw was also determined at the end of the experiment 2 3 2 mineral content of plant organs and nutrient solutions dry samples of leaves or roots were digested with a mixture 5 2 of nitric acid 65 and perchloric acid 35 at 240 c for 1 h minerals were determined in mineralized samples as follows k ca mg na cu fe mn and zn by atomic absorption spectroscopy p by uv vis spectrometry the no3 content was also measured spectrophotometrically in dry leaf samples extracted with distilled water 100 mg dw in 20 ml at room temperature for 2 h using the salicylic sulphuric method these methods were also used to measure the concentration of nutritive elements and na in the filtered samples of nutrient solutions collected during the experiments dry plant samples were also used for the determination of organic n by the kjeldahl method 2 3 3 water and mineral uptake plant water uptake was determined by measuring the volume of the nutrient solutions used to refill the hydroponic tanks at first harvest time and of the tap water used for the replenishment at the end of the experiment second harvest water added to each hydroponic unit was assumed to be equal to the plant water uptake because the tank was completely covered by the polystyrene tray and therefore direct evaporation was negligible plant mineral uptake was determined based on the dry biomass and mineral content of leaves collected at each harvest and in the roots at the end of the experiment the apparent mineral uptake was calculated based on the volume and the mineral composition of the nutrient solutions used to refill the hydroponic tanks table 1 and of the residual solutions at the end of the experiments table s1 the use efficiency of water wue and nutrients was calculated as the ratio between crop yield and total crop uptake of water and each nutrient 2 3 4 leaf quality attributes sampled fresh leaves were rapidly cut in small discs and 5 ml of methanol 99 v v were added to each sample 100 mg which was extracted by sonication for 60 min and then maintained for 24 h at 4 c the methanol extract was used to determine spectrophotometrically the concentrations of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoids according to wellburn and lichtenthaler 1984 to determine the flavonoid content 0 1 ml of the methanol extract was added to 0 06 ml of nano2 5 0 04 ml of alcl3 10 and after five minutes to 0 4 ml of naoh and 0 2 ml of h2o afterwards the absorbance was read at 510 nm and the results were expressed as mg catechin g 1 fw kim et al 2003 the same methanol extracts were used to determine the content of total phenols using the folin ciocalteau reagent kang and saltveit 2002 the total phenol content was calculated using the calibration curve containing 0 50 100 150 and 250 mg gallic acid l 1 and expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent gae kg 1 fw the total antioxidant capacity was measured in the methanol extracts with the ferric reducing ability of plasma frap assay benzie and strain 1996 and expressed as mmol l 1 fe ii kg 1 fw 2 4 statistical analysis data were tested for homogeneity of variances using levene s test and then subjected to 1 or 2 way anova with harvest date and nutrient solution as variables mean values were separated by tukey s post hoc test p 0 05 statistical analysis was performed using jmp statistical software 3 results 3 1 picris hieracioides 3 1 1 crop yield the leaves harvested at the

fw ratio and were less succulent a significant positive correlation r2 0 893 p 0 0001 n 24 was found between leaf antioxidant capacity and total phenol content fig s2 right 4 discussion 4 1 effect of salinity in the present work both ph and pc showed good adaptation to the cultivation in floating raft system with standard nutrient solution or greenhouse hydroponic effluents and gave satisfactory leaf production on average 2 42 0 14 kg m 2 in ph table 4 4 22 0 15 kg m 2 in pc table 9 in consideration of the short growing period 36 days all the plants grew well and healthy and the cultivation could probably have been prolonged for another two or three weeks thus allowing for another harvest or two the addition of nacl 50 mmol l 1 to the standard nutrient solution did not significantly impact either total plant dry biomass or crop yield in both species a slight but significant reduction of leaf area index and root dw in sns plants was observed only in ph which in general showed less salt tolerance than pc as expected in consideration of the halophytic nature of pc ltaeif et al 2021 in pc plants grown in pots or in a gravel hydroponic system and irrigated with nacl enriched nutrient solution growth inhibition was observed at much higher concentrations 100 mmol l 1 bueno et al 2020 250 mmol l 1 koyro 2006 600 mmol l 1 ltaeif et al 2021 than those tested in the present work to the best of our knowledge no study has been conducted to investigate the salinity response of ph in soilless culture our findings may be the results of the growing system adopted in the experiments hydroponic systems such as deep culture and floating raft system can alleviate the stress induced by nacl salinity in hydroponics indeed the root uptake of both water and nutrients is facilitated and appropriate management of the nutrient solution can prevent the salinity build up in the root zone that may occur in soil or substrate grown plants atzori et al 2019 in basil for instance salt tolerance was much greater in nutrient film technique than in rockwool cubes faliagka et al 2021 in contrast to crop yield the salinity of the nutrient solution influenced both water and mineral relations although during the experiment no plant of either species showed clear symptoms of nutrient deficiency e g leaf chlorosis and the level of nutritive elements in leaf tissues were consistently within the adequate ranges reported for leafy vegetables hochmuth et al 2012 the higher leaf zn content detected in te and ate plants of both species than in those grown with cns or sns could be explained by the higher zn level in the hydroponic effluents table 2 water uptake was reduced by the use of the saline nutrient solution only in ph table 6 due to an inhibition of both root and leaf growth table 4 and the effect of nacl depended on the nutrient considered tables 5 6 10 and 11 the lower mg content in sns plants is in agreement with previous findings for instance leaf mg content was drastically reduced by nacl salinity in sorghum kausar and gull 2019 the limited effects of salinity on mineral nutrition were likely the results of the supply of a culture solution rich in all the essential nutrients and the better root water uptake which are typical of hydroponic cultivation plant mineral nutrition is barely affected by salinity when the concentration of nutritive element in the root zone is optimal hu and schmidhalter 2005 as expected the most important effect of nacl salinity was on leaf content of k and na in fact leaf k content markedly decreased while na noticeably accumulated in both leaf and root tissues of sns plants of both species as a consequence the k na molar ratio significantly decreased in sns plants compared with the controls to a much larger extent in ph than in pc fig s2 many molecular and physiological processes including the control of the flux of k na and cl for osmotic adjustment and ion homeostasis are involved in the plant response to nacl salinity assaha et al 2017 the reduction of leaf k content in both species induced by nacl can be ascribed to the na induced inhibition of k uptake marschner 2011 in this work the halophyte pc showed a greater affinity for na than ph as leaf na content was invariably higher in pc than in ph growing plants with sns also affected leaf quality which was assessed by determining the succulence and the content of dry matter and some nutraceutical substances due its influence of leaf texture succulence affects sensory quality rana 2015 and leaf dry matter content is often positively correlated with the shelf life of leafy vegetables clarkson et al 2003 leaf na content was much higher in sns plants than in the controls however a serving dose of 100 g of fresh leaves of ph or pc grown with sns would provide 321 and 365 mg of na respectively which is in both cases is much lower than the safe and adequate daily intake of na 2000 mg day 1 european food safety authority 2019 in contrast leaf nitrate content was not affected by salinity in either species and was invariably lower than the maximum level established for instance by the european parliament and council of the european union 2011 for lettuce and spinach grown in greenhouse in spring and summer 4000 and 3500 mg kg 1 fw respectively high nitrate accumulation in plant leaves is due to a disproportion between its uptake and assimilation and depends on both plant species and growing conditions colla et al 2018 sodium chloride salinity generally impairs the root uptake and leaf accumulation of nitrate due to the antagonistic inhibition of chloride rouphael et al 2018 in several species grown hydroponically leaf nitrate level was lower in plants grown with nutrient solution containing 40 or 60 mmol l 1 nacl in comparison with nacl free solution takahama et al 2020 however leaf nitrate content was greater in salinized plants of swiss chard and sea beet than in non salinized plants because of higher dw fw puccinelli et al 2022 in both pc and ph the dw fw ratio and the content of leaf pigments were not significantly affected by nacl salinity which in contrast increased the antioxidant capacity in both ph and pc the antioxidant capacity was closely correlated with the content of total phenols fig s2 which indeed increased in sns plants with respect to the controls albeit this increase was not significant in ph a strong positive correlation between the total antioxidant capacity and the content of total phenols was found in many studies conducted with plants grown under saline e g hossain et al 2022 tareq et al 2021 or non saline conditions e g piluzza and bullitta 2011 puccinelli et al 2021 salinity stress is known to activate the antioxidant defence system that protects the plant against the salt induced oxidative damage and depends on both enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants such as phenols and flavonoids hasanuzzaman et al 2021 salinity stress increases the leaf content of phenols and flavonoids in many plant species e g hossain et al 2022 taârit et al 2012 tareq et al 2021 including pc boestfleisch et al 2014 bueno et al 2020 2021 leaf succulence significantly increased in sns plants compared with the controls only in ph table 8 leaf succulence is a typical trait of halophytes grown under saline conditions hernández 2019 as it allows efficient water storage and the dilution of accumulated salts munns and tester 2008 schiattone et al 2017 in our work however leaf succulence was not affected by the composition of the nutrient solution in the halophyte pc and significantly augmented only in ph plants grown with sns compared with the controls table 13 4 2 agronomic economic and environmental implications of cascade cropping systems the experiment design adopted in this work allowed the separation of the effects of nacl salinity from those due to the other defects of hydroponic drainage water such as the reduced level of several nutrients n fe b mn and in particular p table 3 and the possible presence of root and microbial metabolites originated in the donor crop there were no or minor differences between sns plants and those grown with hydroponic effluents for all the measured quantities moreover a significant difference between te and ate plants was found in both species only for leaf mn content in the roots of ph as well which was significantly higher in ate than in te therefore the reduction of crop yield in te and ate plants was primarily due to the high effluent salinity as found in a previous work on ccs in which the drainage solution from a round tomato crop was used for the cultivation of cherry tomato plants incrocci et al 2003 our findings also suggest that both wep species in particular pc could be grown hydroponically with n and p concentration of the nutrient solution much lower than those recommended for soilless culture raviv et al 2019 the main advantages of ccs are saving both water and fertilisers and reducing of the pollution caused by the nutrients dissolved in the effluents from the donor crop in greenhouse crops fertilisers are reported to account for up to 9 of the total production costs martínez alvarez et al 2020 martínez granados et al 2022 which are more or less equal to the total revenue martínez granados et al 2022 torrellas et al 2012 the incidence of fertilisation on running cost has recently augmented because the price of fertilisers has markedly increased in the last few years eardley 2022 for example in 2022 the price of ammonia nitrate potassium chloride and phosphate fertilisers was higher respectively by 152 165 and 124 than the price in 2021 ahdb 2022 therefore the moderate yield reduction observed in this 33 in ph and 23 in pc and other studies on ccs e g avdouli et al 2021 elvanidi et al 2020 garcía caparrós et al 2021b santos et al 2022 grown with hydroponic effluents could be compensated at least partially by the zero cost for fertilisation and water depuration moreover the application of ccs reduces the water garcía caparrós et al 2018b and carbon muñoz et al 2010 footprint of products thus improving farm sustainability and green marketing implementing the ccs concept on a commercial scale is not simple and straightforward however in addition to the difficulties already mentioned in the introduction the design of a ccs requires an appropriate sizing of the cultures carried out in sequence specifically a precise definition of the area cultivated for the donor crops and the recipient crop s the dimensioning of a ccs can consider the water garcía caparrós et al 2018a or nutritional rufí salís et al 2020 demand of the crops garcía caparrós et al 2018a proposed a simple equation for appropriate dimensioning of ccs with two or three soilless cultures in sequence the equation considers the water absorbed by each crop and the leaching requirement namely the drainage fraction which is generally determined by the salinity of the irrigation water and is very seldom lower than 20 30 massa et al 2020 using this approach and the volume of drainage water from a semi closed substrate culture of tomato with a ceiling ec of 4 5 ds m 1 for partial discharge of the recirculating nutrient solution massa et al 2010 it would be necessary 0 96 or 0 87 m2 of ph or pc respectively for each m2 of the donor crop to completely reuse its effluents rufí salís et al 2020 extensively discussed the possible options for optimal ccs dimensioning taking into account the amount of nitrogen leached by the primary crop tomato and the one absorbed by the secondary crop lettuce these authors concluded that the best strategy depends on the grower s priorities and the availability of water for both the primary and secondary crops models exist for predicting water and nutrient requirements of greenhouse crops e g carmassi et al 2007 gallardo et al 2016 2009 and the volume and ion composition of the drainage water from soilless culture e g katsoulas et al 2015 massa et al 2011 neocleous and savvas 2022 and could be used for optimal design of ccs how the drainage water from the primary crop is used must also be considered when the ccs is scaled up in this regards two main options exist the effluent from the donor crop is collected and stored before the distribution to the secondary crops likewise in this and other studies choi et al 2011 incrocci et al 2003 santos et al 2022 or is used directly as proposed by other authors e g garcía caparrós et al 2021a 2018b katsoulas et al 2020 muñoz et al 2010 rufí salís et al 2020 the first option is suitable for a ccs consisting of a semi closed culture of the donor crop i e with periodical discharge say every one or more weeks and a receiving crop with short cycle as in this study this system would require large tanks to store the effluent but facilitates the control and adjustment of its composition incrocci et al 2003 when the donor crop is cultivated in free drain systems the best option is to irrigate the receiving crop with the effluents produced daily in this system the adjustment of the mineral composition and salinity of the drainage water which change during the growing season would be more difficult there are also regulatory issues regarding the use of hydroponic effluents for fertigation of secondary crops in the european union for instance greenhouse effluents are considered industrial wastewater and their use for crop irrigation needs specific authorization eec 1991 santos et al 2022 hydroponic wastewater may also contain active principles of plant protection products boye et al 2022 santos et al 2022 vermeulen et al 2017 that are not registered for use on the secondary crops 5 conclusions picris hieracioides and plantago coronopus could be hydroponically grown on saline effluents from greenhouse soilless cultures with a moderate reduction of crop yield which could be compensated for by the better leaf quality induced by high salinity and the zero cost for fertilisers and the treatment of the donor crop s wastewater both species could be grown with nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of the nutrient solution lower than those recommended for soilless culture therefore these two wild edible species are good candidates as receiving crops in cascade cropping systems

8970,there is an increasing interest in the cultivation of wild edible plants wep in consideration of their quality attributes and salt tolerance which makes these species good candidates for cascade cropping systems ccs in these systems saline effluents from a salt sensitive donor crop are used to irrigate a receiving crop with greater salt tolerance the objective of this study was to evaluate two wep species picris hieracioides ph and plantago coronopus pc as candidate crops for ccs both species were grown hydroponically with saline effluent from a semi closed substrate culture of tomato the donor crop both ph and pc were grown in floating system for 36 days during spring using one of the following nutrient solutions i standard nutrient solution cns control ii nacl enriched 50 mmol l 1 standard nutrient solution sns iii effluent from tomato substrate culture te iv artificial effluent ate i e a nutrient with ion concentrations and salinity level approximately 50 mmol l 1 nacl very close to those of te compared with cns leaf production was significantly reduced in both te 33 6 and ate 33 6 plants of ph and only in te 23 3 plants of pc in both species leaf na content increased in sns 858 1 in ph 279 4 in pc te 704 7 in ph 226 3 in pc and ate 697 7 in ph 229 4 in pc plants compared with the controls leaf antioxidant capacity was positively correlated with total phenol content and in pc increased in sns 74 3 te 53 9 and ate plants 37 7 compared with the controls in conclusion both ph and pc could be grown in ccs with saline greenhouse hydroponic effluents since the moderate reduction of leaf production could be partially compensated by reduced production costs because of zero costs for fertilisers the growth inhibition observed in both weps species cultivated with the hydroponic effluent was primarily due to its high salinity with minor or no effects due to the suboptimal nutrient levels and or the presence of phytotoxic root exudates or microbial metabolites

introduction in greenhouse soilless culture the waste of water and nutrients with drainage water and the consequent environmental impact can be strongly reduced by the adoption of closed loop systems massa et al 2020 in these systems the recirculating nutrient solution is normally discharged at least partially when the electrical conductivity ec and or the concentration of some potential toxic ion e g sodium reaches a maximum acceptable threshold semi closed systems massa et al 2010 instead of conventional wastewater treatments before discharge in the environment there are several strategies for sustainable management of the effluents from open and semi closed soilless cultures such as phytoremediation using constructed wetlands and the re use for algae culture richa et al 2020 or cascade cropping systems ccs massa et al 2020 in ccs the effluent from a donor crop is used for the fertigation of one or more receiving crops with higher tolerance to salinity the first studies on greenhouse ccs date back to 20 years ago incrocci et al 2003 but a renewed interest has recently arisen for these systems applied to greenhouse soilless e g avdouli et al 2021 garcía caparrós et al 2021a katsoulas et al 2020 santos et al 2022 or soil bound crops santos et al 2022 or in open field muñoz et al 2017 the goal of ccs is to take advantage of the residual water and nutrients of hydroponic effluents and to make them safer for the environment thus reducing the costs of fertilisers and water depuration in addition the relatively high salinity of effluents may improve the quality attributes of receiving crops for instance increasing the fruit dry matter incrocci et al 2003 or the content of several compounds that are associated with the organoleptic nutritional and nutraceutical quality of many fruit and leafy vegetables avdouli et al 2021 the re use of hydroponic effluents has several drawbacks however since they may have high salinity and abnormal nutrient mutual ratios samiotis et al 2022 and or contain phytotoxic roots exudates avdouli et al 2021 hosseinzadeh et al 2017 microbial metabolites salazar et al 2021 and residues of plant protection products santos et al 2022 moreover long term fertigation of soil grown crops with drainage water from soilless culture can result in soil degradation and environmental pollution santos et al 2022 many wild edible plant wep species are halophyte or salt tolerant glycophyte isayenkov 2019 lombardi et al 2022 and therefore are good candidates for the role of receiving crops in ccs there is a growing

instance to the content of numerous terpenoid glycosides that can be used against fever and inflammation uchiyama et al 1990 plantago coronopus is a perennial herb that belongs to the family of plantaginaceae and is considered a facultative halophyte bueno et al 2020 2021 ltaeif et al 2021 its leaves are commonly consumed fresh in mixed salads and appreciated for its salty taste and high

bueno et al 2020 bueno et al 2021 ceccanti et al 2022 chu and brown 2021 and to the best of our knowledge no work has been conducted on ph apart from the study conducted by ceccanti et al 2020 the goal of the present work was to investigate the performance of ph and pc grown hydroponically with the drainage water from a greenhouse substrate culture of tomato an important greenhouse crop that is widely cultivated in soilless systems in separate and parallel experiments both ph and pc were grown in floating systems under the typical climate conditions that occur in spring in mediterranean greenhouses using the following nutrient solutions a genuine or artificial effluent from a semi closed tomato substrate culture and a standard solution containing negligible 1 0 mmol l 1 or high 50 mmol l 1 nacl concentration in a preliminary experiment this high nacl concentration had induced a limited reduction of plant growth in both pc and ph and no symptom of salt toxicity was detected in either species based on the results reported in the literature on ccs or found in the preliminary experiment we hypothesized that i both species can be grown with saline effluents from greenhouse hydroponics with limited reduction of leaf production ii the growth inhibition induced by saline hydroponic effluents is mainly due to high salinity with no or minor effects due to the abnormal ion composition and or the putative presence of root and or microbial exudates iii the use of saline nutrient solution improves leaf quality in both species 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growing conditions the trials were conducted in an experimental glasshouse at the university of pisa italy lat 43 42 42 48 n long 10 24 52 92 e in spring 2021 under natural light air temperature and relative humidity and solar radiation were monitored by a weather station located inside the greenhouse basic information on the experiment is reported in table 1 seeds of ph and pc were purchased from gargini sementi lucca italy and sown in 240 cell polystyrene trays with rockwool plugs the trays were placed in a growth chamber at 25 c for five days and seedlings of pc and ph were planted respectively 26 and 40 days after sowing in polystyrene raft boards floating in 50 l plastic tanks water depth 25 cm with stagnant nutrient solution each tank hosted 24 plants and there were four tanks per m2 therefore the crop density was approximately 96 plants m 2 of ground area in all the tanks the nutrient solution was continuously aerated and dissolved oxygen was above 6 mg l 1 during the whole experiment in both species leaves were harvested twice 22 and 36 days after transplanting dat table 1 by cutting the shoot approximately 2 cm above the collar level at each harvest leaf samples were collected for growth analysis and the laboratory determinations of minerals pigments flavonoids and phenols and the total antioxidant capacity at the end of the experiment samples were also collected for the determination of root biomass and mineral content 2 2 experimental design and nutrient solutions the intention of this study was to separate the effects of salinity from those of other defects see introduction of highly saline hydroponic wastewater therefore four different nutrient solutions were compared in a randomized design with three replicates each consisting of one hydroponic tank the nutrient solutions were the following i standard nutrient solution cns control ii nacl enriched 50 mmol l 1 standard nutrient solution sns iii effluent from tomato substrate culture te iv artificial effluent ate i e a nutrient with ion concentrations and salinity level approximately 50 mmol l 1 nacl very close to those of te the solutions cns sns and ate were prepared by dissolving appropriate amount of technical grade inorganic salts in tap water which contained approximately 0 78 mmol l 1 na and 0 68 mmol l 1 of cl the salinity of hydroponic effluent which contained 29 0 mmol l 1 na and 23 0 mmol l 1 cl was deliberately increased to a level similar to that of sns by adding 21 0 mmol l 1 nacl the mineral composition electrical conductivity ec and ph of the four nutrient solutions are shown in table 2 all nutrient solutions were prepared at the beginning of the experiment and stored at 8 c in the dark the composition of each solution was regularly checked and did not significantly change during the experiment which lasted 36 days before use the ph of all nutrient solutions was adjusted to 5 6 with dilute sulphuric acid the te was collected in an independent experiment on the effects of different salinity levels 10 40 and 70 mmol l 1 nacl on tomato growth and fruit quality this experiment was left out of this study which focused on ph and pc the experiment with tomato was conducted using grafted plants the scion was pisanello a landrace variety quite popular in tuscany italy and the rootstock was maxifort the closed loop hydroponic unit consisted of eight rockwool slabs grodan rockwool b v roermond the netherlands each hosting three plants with a crop density of 3 2 plant m 2 the volume of the nutrient solution in the mixing tank and the total volume of the recirculating solution were 130 l 17 3 l m 2 and 250 l 33 3 l m 2 respectively the mineral composition of the starter and refill nutrient solutions used in the first stage of the experiment are reported in table 3 during the first phase of the experiment the crop was protected against pests whiteflies fungus gnats thrips and leafminers using beneficials and bacillus thuringiensis one distribution and against diseases grey mould and late blight using two fungicides containing cyprodinil and fludioxonil or dimetomorf and copper sulphate two applications the te consisted of a blend of the nutrient solutions discharged from six separate hydroponic units after 24 days of recirculation on occasion of the first discharge before the salinity treatments were applied when tomato plants were 73 days old from the sowing date and the second truss was in bloom 2 3 determinations 2 3 1 crop yield and growth crop yield was determined by recording the fresh weight fw of all the leaves collected at first and second harvest in each hydroponic tank leaf dry weight dw was determined after drying fresh leaves in a ventilated oven at 70 c till constant weight at each harvest a sub sample of fresh leaves was collected from each tank to determine leaf area and then succulence each sample consisted of three individual plants leaf area was measured using a digital planimeter dt area meter mk2 delta t devices cambridge uk and leaf succulence was calculated as the ratio between leaf fw and la root dw was also determined at the end of the experiment 2 3 2 mineral content of plant organs and nutrient solutions dry samples of leaves or roots were digested with a mixture 5 2 of nitric acid 65 and perchloric acid 35 at 240 c for 1 h minerals were determined in mineralized samples as follows k ca mg na cu fe mn and zn by atomic absorption spectroscopy p by uv vis spectrometry the no3 content was also measured spectrophotometrically in dry leaf samples extracted with distilled water 100 mg dw in 20 ml at room temperature for 2 h using the salicylic sulphuric method these methods were also used to measure the concentration of nutritive elements and na in the filtered samples of nutrient solutions collected during the experiments dry plant samples were also used for the determination of organic n by the kjeldahl method 2 3 3 water and mineral uptake plant water uptake was determined by measuring the volume of the nutrient solutions used to refill the hydroponic tanks at first harvest time and of the tap water used for the replenishment at the end of the experiment second harvest water added to each hydroponic unit was assumed to be equal to the plant water uptake because the tank was completely covered by the polystyrene tray and therefore direct evaporation was negligible plant mineral uptake was determined based on the dry biomass and mineral content of leaves collected at each harvest and in the roots at the end of the experiment the apparent mineral uptake was calculated based on the volume and the mineral composition of the nutrient solutions used to refill the hydroponic tanks table 1 and of the residual solutions at the end of the experiments table s1 the use efficiency of water wue and nutrients was calculated as the ratio between crop yield and total crop uptake of water and each nutrient 2 3 4 leaf quality attributes sampled fresh leaves were rapidly cut in small discs and 5 ml of methanol 99 v v were added to each sample 100 mg which was extracted by sonication for 60 min and then maintained for 24 h at 4 c the methanol extract was used to determine spectrophotometrically the concentrations of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b and carotenoids according to wellburn and lichtenthaler 1984 to determine the flavonoid content 0 1 ml of the methanol extract was added to 0 06 ml of nano2 5 0 04 ml of alcl3 10 and after five minutes to 0 4 ml of naoh and 0 2 ml of h2o afterwards the absorbance was read at 510 nm and the results were expressed as mg catechin g 1 fw kim et al 2003 the same methanol extracts were used to determine the content of total phenols using the folin ciocalteau reagent kang and saltveit 2002 the total phenol content was calculated using the calibration curve containing 0 50 100 150 and 250 mg gallic acid l 1 and expressed as mg of gallic acid equivalent gae kg 1 fw the total antioxidant capacity was measured in the methanol extracts with the ferric reducing ability of plasma frap assay benzie and strain 1996 and expressed as mmol l 1 fe ii kg 1 fw 2 4 statistical analysis data were tested for homogeneity of variances using levene s test and then subjected to 1 or 2 way anova with harvest date and nutrient solution as variables mean values were separated by tukey s post hoc test p 0 05 statistical analysis was performed using jmp statistical software 3 results 3 1 picris hieracioides 3 1 1 crop yield the leaves harvested at the

salinity in the present work both ph and pc showed good adaptation to the cultivation in floating raft system with standard nutrient solution or greenhouse hydroponic effluents and gave satisfactory leaf production on average 2 42 0 14 kg m 2 in ph table 4 4 22 0 15 kg m 2 in pc table 9 in consideration of the short growing period 36 days all the plants grew well and healthy and the cultivation could probably have been prolonged for another two or three weeks thus allowing for another harvest or two the addition of nacl 50 mmol l 1 to the standard nutrient solution did not significantly impact either total plant dry biomass or crop yield in both species a slight but significant reduction of leaf area index and root dw in sns plants was observed only in ph which in general showed less salt tolerance than pc as expected in consideration of the halophytic nature of pc ltaeif et al 2021 in pc plants grown in pots or in a gravel hydroponic system and irrigated with nacl enriched nutrient solution growth inhibition was observed at much higher concentrations 100 mmol l 1 bueno et al 2020 250 mmol l 1 koyro 2006 600 mmol l 1 ltaeif et al 2021 than those tested in the present work to the best of our knowledge no study has been conducted to investigate the salinity response of ph in soilless culture our findings may be the results of the growing system adopted in the experiments hydroponic systems such as deep culture and floating raft system can alleviate the stress induced by nacl salinity in hydroponics indeed the root uptake of both water and nutrients is facilitated and appropriate management of the nutrient solution can prevent the salinity build up in the root zone that may occur in soil or substrate grown plants atzori et al 2019 in basil for instance salt tolerance was much greater in nutrient film technique than in rockwool cubes faliagka et al 2021 in contrast to crop yield the salinity of the nutrient solution influenced both water and mineral relations although during the experiment no plant of either species showed clear symptoms of nutrient deficiency e g leaf chlorosis and the level of nutritive elements in leaf tissues were consistently within the adequate ranges reported for leafy vegetables hochmuth et al 2012 the higher leaf zn content detected in te and ate plants of both species than in those grown with cns or sns could be explained by the higher zn level in the hydroponic effluents table 2 water uptake was reduced by the use of the saline nutrient solution only in ph table 6 due to an inhibition of both root and leaf growth table 4 and the effect of nacl depended on the nutrient considered tables 5 6 10 and 11 the lower mg content in sns plants is in agreement with previous findings for instance leaf mg content was drastically reduced by nacl salinity in sorghum kausar and gull 2019 the limited effects of salinity on mineral nutrition were likely the results of the supply of a culture solution rich in all the essential nutrients and the better root water uptake which are typical of hydroponic cultivation plant mineral nutrition is barely affected by salinity when the concentration of nutritive element in the root zone is optimal hu and schmidhalter 2005 as expected the most important effect of nacl salinity was on leaf content of k and na in fact leaf k content markedly decreased while na noticeably accumulated in both leaf and root tissues of sns plants of both species as a consequence the k na molar ratio significantly decreased in sns plants compared with the controls to a much larger extent in ph than in pc fig s2 many molecular and physiological processes including the control of the flux of k na and cl for osmotic adjustment and ion homeostasis are involved in the plant response to nacl salinity assaha et al 2017 the reduction of leaf k content in both species induced by nacl can be ascribed to the na induced inhibition of k uptake marschner 2011 in this work the halophyte pc showed a greater affinity for na than ph as leaf na content was invariably higher in pc than in ph growing plants with sns also affected leaf quality which was assessed by determining the succulence and the content of dry matter and some nutraceutical substances due its influence of leaf texture succulence affects sensory quality rana 2015 and leaf dry matter content is often positively correlated with the shelf life of leafy vegetables clarkson et al 2003 leaf na content was much higher in sns plants than in the controls however a serving dose of 100 g of fresh leaves of ph or pc grown with sns would provide 321 and 365 mg of na respectively which is in both cases is much lower than the safe and adequate daily intake of na 2000 mg day 1 european food safety authority 2019 in contrast leaf nitrate content was not affected by salinity in either species and was invariably lower than the maximum level established for instance by the european parliament and council of the european union 2011 for lettuce and spinach grown in greenhouse in spring and summer 4000 and 3500 mg kg 1 fw respectively high nitrate accumulation in plant leaves is due to a disproportion between its uptake and assimilation and depends on both plant species and growing conditions colla et al 2018 sodium chloride salinity generally impairs the root uptake and leaf accumulation of nitrate due to the antagonistic inhibition of chloride rouphael et al 2018 in several species grown hydroponically leaf nitrate level was lower in plants grown with nutrient solution containing 40 or 60 mmol l 1 nacl in comparison with nacl free solution takahama et al 2020 however leaf nitrate content was greater in salinized plants of swiss chard and sea beet than in non salinized plants because of higher dw fw puccinelli et al 2022 in both pc and ph the dw fw ratio and the content of leaf pigments were not significantly affected by nacl salinity which in contrast increased the antioxidant capacity in both ph and pc the antioxidant capacity was closely correlated with the content of total phenols fig s2 which indeed increased in sns plants with respect to the controls albeit this increase was not significant in ph a strong positive correlation between the total antioxidant capacity and the content of total phenols was found in many studies conducted with plants grown under saline e g hossain et al 2022 tareq et al 2021 or non saline conditions e g piluzza and bullitta 2011 puccinelli et al 2021 salinity stress is known to activate the antioxidant defence system that protects the plant against the salt induced oxidative damage and depends on both enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants such as phenols and flavonoids hasanuzzaman et al 2021 salinity stress increases the leaf content of phenols and flavonoids in many plant species e g hossain et al 2022 taârit et al 2012 tareq et al 2021 including pc boestfleisch et al 2014 bueno et al 2020 2021 leaf succulence significantly increased in sns plants compared with the controls only in ph table 8 leaf succulence is a typical trait of halophytes grown under saline conditions hernández 2019 as it allows efficient water storage and the dilution of accumulated salts munns and tester 2008 schiattone et al 2017 in our work however leaf succulence was not affected by the composition of the nutrient solution in the halophyte pc and significantly augmented only in ph plants grown with sns compared with the controls table 13 4 2 agronomic economic and environmental implications of cascade cropping systems the experiment design adopted in this work allowed the separation of the effects of nacl salinity from those due to the other defects of hydroponic drainage water such as the reduced level of several nutrients n fe b mn and in particular p table 3 and the possible presence of root and microbial metabolites originated in the donor crop there were no or minor differences between sns plants and those grown with hydroponic effluents for all the measured quantities moreover a significant difference between te and ate plants was found in both species only for leaf mn content in the roots of ph as well which was significantly higher in ate than in te therefore the reduction of crop yield in te and ate plants was primarily due to the high effluent salinity as found in a previous work on ccs in which the drainage solution from a round tomato crop was used for the cultivation of cherry tomato plants incrocci et al 2003 our findings also suggest that both wep species in particular pc could be grown hydroponically with n and p concentration of the nutrient solution much lower than those recommended for soilless culture raviv et al 2019 the main advantages of ccs are saving both water and fertilisers and reducing of the pollution caused by the nutrients dissolved in the effluents from the donor crop in greenhouse crops fertilisers are reported to account for up to 9 of the total production costs martínez alvarez et al 2020 martínez granados et al 2022 which are more or less equal to the total revenue martínez granados et al 2022 torrellas et al 2012 the incidence of fertilisation on running cost has recently augmented because the price of fertilisers has markedly increased in the last few years eardley 2022 for example in 2022 the price of ammonia nitrate potassium chloride and phosphate fertilisers was higher respectively by 152 165 and 124 than the price in 2021 ahdb 2022 therefore the moderate yield reduction observed in this 33 in ph and 23 in pc and other studies on ccs e g avdouli et al 2021 elvanidi et al 2020 garcía caparrós et al 2021b santos et al 2022 grown with hydroponic effluents could be compensated at least partially by the zero cost for fertilisation and water depuration moreover the application of ccs reduces the water garcía caparrós et al 2018b and carbon muñoz et al 2010 footprint of products thus improving farm sustainability and green marketing implementing the ccs concept on a commercial scale is not simple and straightforward however in addition to the difficulties already mentioned in the introduction the design of a ccs requires an appropriate sizing of the cultures carried out in sequence specifically a precise definition of the area cultivated for the donor crops and the recipient crop s the dimensioning of a ccs can consider the water garcía caparrós et al 2018a or nutritional rufí salís et al 2020 demand of the crops garcía caparrós et al 2018a proposed a simple equation for appropriate dimensioning of ccs with two or three soilless cultures in sequence the equation considers the water absorbed by each crop and the leaching requirement namely the drainage fraction which is generally determined by the salinity of the irrigation water and is very seldom lower than 20 30 massa et al 2020 using this approach and the volume of drainage water from a semi closed substrate culture of tomato with a ceiling ec of 4 5 ds m 1 for partial discharge of the recirculating nutrient solution massa et al 2010 it would be necessary 0 96 or 0 87 m2 of ph or pc respectively for each m2 of the donor crop to completely reuse its effluents rufí salís et al 2020 extensively discussed the possible options for optimal ccs dimensioning taking into account the amount of nitrogen leached by the primary crop tomato and the one absorbed by the secondary crop lettuce these authors concluded that the best strategy depends on the grower s priorities and the availability of water for both the primary and secondary crops models exist for predicting water and nutrient requirements of greenhouse crops e g carmassi et al 2007 gallardo et al 2016 2009 and the volume and ion composition of the drainage water from soilless culture e g katsoulas et al 2015 massa et al 2011 neocleous and savvas 2022 and could be used for optimal design of ccs how the drainage water from the primary crop is used must also be considered when the ccs is scaled up in this regards two main options exist the effluent from the donor crop is collected and stored before the distribution to the secondary crops likewise in this and other studies choi et al 2011 incrocci et al 2003 santos et al 2022 or is used directly as proposed by other authors e g garcía caparrós et al 2021a 2018b katsoulas et al 2020 muñoz et al 2010 rufí salís et al 2020 the first option is suitable for a ccs consisting of a semi closed culture of the donor crop i e with periodical discharge say every one or more weeks and a receiving crop with short cycle as in this study this system would require large tanks to store the effluent but facilitates the control and adjustment of its composition incrocci et al 2003 when the donor crop is cultivated in free drain systems the best option is to irrigate the receiving crop with the effluents produced daily in this system the adjustment of the mineral composition and salinity of the drainage water which change during the growing season would be more difficult there are also regulatory issues regarding the use of hydroponic effluents for fertigation of secondary crops in the european union for instance greenhouse effluents are considered industrial wastewater and their use for crop irrigation needs specific authorization eec 1991 santos et al 2022 hydroponic wastewater may also contain active principles of plant protection products boye et al 2022 santos et al 2022 vermeulen et al 2017 that are not registered for use on the secondary crops 5 conclusions picris hieracioides and plantago coronopus could be hydroponically grown on saline effluents from greenhouse soilless cultures with a moderate reduction of crop yield which could be compensated for by the better leaf quality induced by high salinity and the zero cost for fertilisers and the treatment of the donor crop s wastewater both species could be grown with nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations of the nutrient solution lower than those recommended for soilless culture therefore these two wild edible species are good candidates as receiving crops in cascade cropping systems

8971,emitter clogging is a major challenge for phosphorus drip irrigation systems pdis calcium ions ca2 play an important role in pdis clogging however the effects of ca2 and phosphorus fertilizer interactions on emitter clogging are largely unknown this study investigated the emitter clogging behaviors with four ca2 concentrations 25 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 and three phosphorus application strategies no fertilization urea phosphate and mono ammonium phosphate results show that ca2 concentrations phosphorous fertilizer and their interaction significantly affected emitter clogging at low concentrations of ca2 phosphorus fertilizer applications reduced emitter clogging when compared to no fertilization when ca2 concentration was 25 mg l 1 phosphate fertilizer reduced the dry weight of clogging substances by 25 45 because the phosphate ions po4 3 hydrolyzed from phosphate fertilizer competed for ca2 with carbonate ions co3 2 which reduced the formation of calcium carbonates in contrast phosphorus fertilizer applications increased emitter clogging at high ca2 concentrations when ca2 concentration was 200 mg l 1 phosphate fertilizer increased the dry weight of clogging substances by 18 36 because abundant ca2 interacted with po4 3 to form phosphate precipitations furthermore urea phosphate posed fewer clogging risks than mono ammonium phosphate and the demarcation ca2 concentrations i e no increase or decrease in emitter clogging after fertigation for urea phosphate and mono ammonium phosphate were approximately 150 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively lastly phosphate fertilizer application and a rise in ca2 concentration significantly increased the deposition of water particles to mitigate emitter clogging of pdis it is suggested that phosphorus fertilizer types and suitable ca2 concentrations be adapted as well as water filtration should be enhanced this study clarified the effects of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 coupling on emitter clogging with implications for resolving the pdis clogging issue and promoting the application of phosphorus drip irrigation technology keywords phosphorus fertigation calcium concentration precipitation particle deposition emitter clogging data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus is one of the most important nutrients for crop growth and productivity malhotra et al 2018 however soils easily adsorb and fix phosphorus weihrauch and opp 2018 resulting in a phosphorus transport distance of less than 15 cm in the soil takahashi and anwar 2007 and a utilization rate of less than 25 in a single season zhao et al 2021 thus excessive phosphorus fertilizer is commonly used in agricultural fertilization xiao et al 2020 to date nearly 21 million tons of phosphorus are imported into terrestrial systems each year primarily through agricultural fertilization sheldrick et al 2003 however phosphate rock the raw material for phosphate fertilizer is a nonrenewable resource that can only be mined for 50 years at the current consumption rate natasha 2009 as a result it is critical to reduce phosphorus fertilizer consumption and increase its use efficiency drip irrigation a water saving technology offers a potential opportunity for increasing the use efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer muhammad et al 2021 this is because drip irrigation dissolves phosphorus fertilizer in water and delivers phosphorus fertilizer and water directly to the root zone of crops which significantly improves the movement distance application uniformity and utilization efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer fan et al 2020 wang and chu 2015 despite the promising advantages of drip irrigation phosphorus drip irrigation system pdis currently is not popular farmer is more willing to inject phosphorus fertilizer directly into the soil enciso medina et al 2007 this is due to the drip irrigation emitters flow channel is quite narrow 0 5 1 2 mm shen et al 2022 and improper application of phosphate fertilizer can easily cause emitter clogging muhammad et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 it will significantly reduce the fertigation uniformity and shorten the service life of pdis thus emitter clogging has become a critical concern in the application and promotion of pdis pdis emitter clogging is highly related to the application strategies of phosphorus fertilizer such as the types frequency and concentrations of fertilization ma et al 2020 wang et al 2021 2020 zhou et al 2019 however the effects of phosphorus application on emitter clogging behavior have been reported in inconsistent or contradictory outcomes in the literature some studies showed that phosphorus fertilizer application increased emitter clogging xiao et al 2020 found that applying urea phosphate monopotassium phosphate and ammonium polyphosphate reduced the discharge of pdis by 4 1 43 9 muhammad et al 2021 discovered that the use of urea phosphate and monopotassium phosphate exacerbated the blockage of emitters in contrast ma et al 2020 found that while monopotassium phosphate increased emitter clogging urea phosphate and ammonium polyphosphate effectively controlled emitter clogging similarly phosphorus fertigation with acidic fertilizers such as monoammonium phosphate and urea phosphate has been demonstrated can reduce emitter clogging wang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 the varying responses of phosphorus fertilizer application to emitter clogging highlight the need for further research calcium ions ca2 play an important role in pdis clogging according to literature phosphorus fertilizer increased emitter clogging because phosphorus fertilizer can interact with ca2 to form phosphate precipitations e g calcium phosphate haynes 1985 liu et al 2022 wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 in contrast some studies have shown that phosphorus fertilizer application does not result in the formation of phosphate precipitations muhammad et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 furthermore ma et al 2020 and yang et al 2019 reported that phosphorus fertilizer mitigated emitter clogging primarily by reducing calcium carbonate formation because both carbonate ions co3 2 and phosphate ions po4 3 can interact with ca2 to form chemical precipitations ezekiel et al 2018 it can be inferred that the competition for ca2 between co3 2 and po4 3 had a significant impact on emitter clogging behavior of pdis this study hypothesizes that ca2 concentration influences the formation of carbonate and phosphate precipitation in pdis i e ca2 preferentially combines co3 2 and abundant ca2 can interact with po4 3 resulting in pdis clogging behaviors that vary greatly with ca2 concentrations however it is still unknown how the interaction of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentration affects emitter clogging the aims of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 interaction on emitter performance 2 clarify the mechanism of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 coupling on emitter clogging 3 propose practical strategies to prevent emitter clogging of pdis here emitter clogging behaviors for pdis were investigated using four ca2 concentrations 25 200 mg l 1 and three phosphorus fertilizer application strategies no fertilization urea phosphate and mono ammonium phosphate x ray diffraction was used to determine mineral precipitations and particles in clogging substances 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was carried out in beijing tongzhou china the water used in the experiment was imported from the local groundwater the groundwater quality parameters were shown in table 1 the average ca2 concentration of the groundwater was 68 5 mg l 1 the ca2 of the groundwater was reduced by an ion exchange resin water softener manufacturer youmi china type rs 4000 l to prepare the water used in the experiment with different ca2 concentrations the functional groups of ion exchange resin can use sodium ions na to replace ca2 in water following that the ca2 concentration in the groundwater was reduced to less than 25 mg l 1 and water with varying ca2 concentrations was obtained by adding calcium chloride cacl2 the experiment investigated four calcium ion concentrations 25 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 and three phosphorus application strategies no fertilizer ck urea phosphate up monoammonium phosphate map up is an acid fertilizer previous studies have reported that up can effectively mitigate emitter clogging than other types of phosphorous fertilizer ma et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 yang et al 2019 map is regarded as the most commonly used phosphorus resource in large scale field plantations kafkafi and tarchitzky 2011 thus up and map were selected as the phosphorus fertilizers in the experiment the phosphorus fertilizer application concentration was set at 300 mg l 1 p2o5 concentration see details of phosphorus fertilizer preparation in supplementary information part i a total of 12 treatments were established based on the ca2 concentration and fertilization strategies which are named as ck 25 ck represents fertilization strategy 25 represents ca2 concentration ck 50 ck 100 ck 200 up 25 up 50 up 100 up 200 map 25 map 50 map 100 map 200 the emitter clogging test platform of the drip irrigation system was shown in fig 1 the drip irrigation system s head contained a fertilization tank and a clean water tank which were used to store water containing and not containing phosphorus fertilizer respectively the water was filtered by a screen filter 106 µm filtration level before entering the drip line the test platform was divided into three layers and each layer had one type of emitter each kind of emitter was set to 8 repetitions for samples taken during different operating periods three commonly used non pressure compensating emitters named e1 e2 e3 were used in the experiment with the specific geometric parameters listed in table s1 the table or figure in the supplementary information is denoted by the letter s the three types of emitters represent a repetition of the experiment to enhance the reliability of the results one drip line was 18 m long with 60 identical emitters and the space between the emitters was 0 3 m the experiment system ran every day for a total of 64 days ck treatments irrigated clean water every day not using fertilization tanks whereas fertilization treatments were fertilized every two days the fertilization was at the heart of the entire operation in addition the operation of the system in one day represented the actual irrigation and fertilization once specifically the fertilizer concentration was 0 3 g l 1 the fertilization amount in each drip line was 33 75 g d 1 and the irrigation amount in each drip line was 0 45 m3 d 1 which was equivalent to 6 75 kg acre 1 and 90 m3 acre 1 respectively when 3600 m drip irrigation lateral was laid per acre see details of irrigation and feralization process for fertilization and no fertilization in fig s1 moreover the head pressure of the test platform was kept at 0 1 mpa and the drip lines were washed with clean water every 4 days at a flow rate of 0 5 m s 1 2 2 emitter performance evaluation index in drip irrigation system every 8 days the drip irrigation test platform checked the emitter flow rate and the method proposed by pei et al 2014 was used to correct the emitter flow rate after correcting the emitter s flow rate the relative flow rate dra xiao et al 2020 and christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1942 were applied to assess emitter performances the relative average flow dra of the emitter was represented by the following equation 1 d r a i n q i t q i 0 n 100 where q i 0 represents the corrected flow rate of the emitter i at the initial time l h q i t represents the corrected flow rate of the emitter i at time t l h n is the total number of emitters on the drip line the uniformity of a drip irrigation system was evaluated by cu which can reflect the randomness of each emitter and evaluate the spatial uniformity of a drip irrigation system the calculation equation is as follows 2 c u 100 1 i 1 n q i t q t n q t where q t represents the average corrected flow rate of each emitter on the drip line at time t l h the meanings of other parameters are the same as those in eq 1 2 3 emitter clogging substance sampling and testing methods every 8 days a drip line from the drip irrigation test platform was chosen for sampling in each experimental treatment during each sampling 10 emitter samples were destructively selected from the drip line s first middle and tail positions the samples were cut into pieces and placed in ziplock bags and 20 ml deionized water was added to the ultrasonic cleaner manufacturer kunshan shumei type kq5200de for clogging substance removal the treatment time for shedding clogging substances was 60 min the treated suspension was poured into a centrifuge tube and centrifuged the solid at the bottom of the centrifuge tube was then dried to a constant weight at a constant temperature of 60 c finally the dry weight of the clogging substance was measured by a high precision electronic balance to obtain a polycrystalline diffraction pattern the dry clogging substance was ground evenly and scanned on the operating platform of a d8 advance x ray diffractometer xrd the scanning process s basic test conditions were that voltage 40 kv current 40 ma cu target and wavelength 1 5406 å topas software was used to analyze the obtained map in order to determine the mineral composition and content of the clogging substance see details of xrd testing in supplementary information part ii simultaneously the general structure and analysis system was applied to further determine the mineral compositions in order to get the final map of clogging substance mineral components toby dreele r b 2013 in addition the minerals in the emitter clogging substance were classified as chemical precipitation fouling e g calcium carbonate and particle fouling e g quartz with the chemical precipitation caused by the crystallization of chemical ions and the particle caused by the deposition of water suspended particles 2 4 statistical analysis the correlations between different treatments of the dry weight of clogging substance dra cu and various mineral contents were determined by the pearson analysis to determine whether fertilization ca2 concentration and their interaction have a significant influence on dra cu and various mineral contents linear regression and analysis of variance were used structural equation modelling performed by amos v22 0 ibm usa was used to evaluate the direct and indirect pathways of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 concentration on emitter clogging 3 results 3 1 clogging substance content and emitter performance the dynamic changes in clogging substances dw dra and cu fig 2 fig s2 and fig s3 for e1 e2 and e3 respectively indicate that phosphorus fertilizer application and ca2 concentrations significantly p 0 05 table s2 affected emitter clogging behavior furthermore the coupling of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentrations also significantly p 0 05 affected the dw dra and cu in addition ca2 concentrations appear to have a greater influence on emitter clogging than phosphorus fertilizer as evidenced by the dw increasing and emitter performance decreasing dramatically as ca2 concentrations increased whereas the differences of dw dra and cu between three types of fertilization strategies were comparatively smaller the correlations of dw dra and cu between the three types of fertigation strategies are shown in fig s4 and their relative slopes k are summarized in fig 3 ca2 concentrations had a significant impact on the emitter clogging risks of pdis when compared to ck i e no fertilization urea phosphate up and mono ammonium phosphate map applications significantly reduced emitter clogging at low ca2 concentrations for example when ca2 concentration was 25 mg l 1 up 25 and map 25 reduced dw by 25 45 compared to ck 25 k 1 while increasing dra and cu by 27 54 and 29 39 respectively in contrast at high ca2 concentrations phosphorus fertilizer applications significantly increased emitter clogging for instance when ca2 concentration was 200 mg l 1 up and map applications increased dw by 18 36 overall the pdis clogging risks increased with increasing ca2 concentrations phosphorus fertilizer types also had a significant impact on emitter clogging in all ca2 concentrations up posed fewer clogging risks than map up application reduced emitter clogging in the up 25 up 50 and up 100 treatments when compared to ck whereas map appeared to reduce emitter clogging when the ca2 concentration was less than 50 mg l 1 the demarcation ca2 concentrations i e no increase or decrease in emitter clogging after fertigation for up and map were approximately 150 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively 3 2 clogging substance components in phosphate drip irrigation systems the rietveld refinement patterns of clogging substances in pdis were obtained by the xrd rietveld refinement technique fig 4a the results showed that the clogging substances mainly include chemical precipitation and particle scaling chemical precipitation contained aragonite calcite dolomite and brushite and particles contained quartz muscovite feldspar and chlorite fertilization and ca2 concentration obviously affected the diffraction pattern the mass ratio of each mineral component is shown in fig 4b aragonite calcite brushite and quartz were the dominant mineral across all the treatments which account for 0 35 6 2 1 40 3 0 55 1 9 6 49 3 of the total minerals the mineral composition was significantly different between ck and fertilization treatments the proportions of calcium carbonate calcite and aragonite in ck up and map treatments were 44 7 74 1 8 6 29 4 and 2 2 12 1 respectively indicating that the proportions of calcium carbonate were significantly reduced after the application of phosphate fertilizer meanwhile the ratio of particles and phosphate brushite was increased after the application of phosphorus fertilizer among them the proportion of particle scaling in ck up and map treatment were 23 7 50 6 49 4 73 1 and 39 3 82 5 respectively the proportion of phosphate brushite in ck up and map treatment were 0 5 2 40 1 5 5 55 1 respectively moreover at low ca2 concentration i e 25 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 brushite at up and map treatments was only 2 5 29 5 however under the condition of high ca2 concentration i e 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 the proportion of brushite increased significantly reaching 8 8 55 1 3 3 dynamic change of chemical precipitations in phosphate drip irrigation systems the dynamic changes of various chemical precipitation in the phosphate drip irrigation system are shown in fig 5 phosphorus fertilizer ca2 concentration and their coupling had significant p 0 05 table s2 impacts on the content of various chemical precipitations the total content of precipitations fig 5a increased drastically as ca2 concentrations increased when ca2 concentrations were at 25 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 up and map applications significantly p 0 05 reduced total precipitation by 46 70 table s3 however when ca2 concentration was at 200 mg l 1 the total precipitations increased significantly p 0 05 by 17 69 with up and map applications the dynamic changes of aragonite calcite dolomite and brushite are shown in fig 5b e in general the content of the four precipitations obviously with increasing ca2 concentrations when compared to ck up reduced aragonite content by 64 77 while no aragonite was detected with the map application up and map also effectively reduced the content of calcite and dolomite by 70 93 and 18 61 respectively brushite was not detected in ck treatments similarly when ca2 concentrations were 25 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 almost no brushite was found in the up and map treatments whereas up and map applications significantly increased the content of brushite when ca2 concentrations were 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 this is the main reason that phosphorus fertilizer application increased emitter clogging 3 4 dynamic change of particles in phosphate drip irrigation systems the dynamic changes of various particles in the phosphate drip irrigation system are shown in fig 6 phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentration had significant p 0 05 table s2 impacts on the contents of various particles whereas their coupling had no significantly p 0 05 effect on particle content the total particle content fig 6a increased drastically as ca2 concentrations increased furthermore up and map applications significantly p 0 05 increased particle content by 23 97 table s3 the dynamic changes of quartz muscovite feldspar and chloritee are shown in fig 6b e in general the content of the four particles increased as ca2 concentrations increased additionally the up and map applications also increased the content of the four particles with up and map applications the quartz muscovite feldspar and chlorite increased by 11 0 133 0 9 0 81 0 10 9 46 0 and 17 0 168 0 respectively in addition map had higher particle contents than up the results indicated that another major clogging risk of pdis was phosphorus fertilizer application and increasing ca2 concentration significantly promoted the deposition of water particles 3 5 phosphorus fertilizer and calcium ion acting pathways on emitter clogging fig 7a depicts the relationships between various clogging substances and emitter performance ca2 concentration and various clogging substances were found to have significant p 0 05 correlations for instance the dry weight of clogging substances showed a significant positive relationship with ca2 concentration furthermore various foulants were significantly p 0 05 correlated with one another for example significant interactions were discovered between total precipitation content and four types of particles the findings suggest that interactions between different clogging substances may be another important way to influence pdis emitter clogging the structural equation model sem fig 7b further revealed the direct and indirect effect of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentration on the formation of various precipitations and particles and emitter performance sem showed that phosphorus fertilizer directly and significantly affected precipitations and particles as indicated by the standardized path coefficient spc values were 0 55 and 0 34 respectively while the spc of ca2 concentration for precipitations and particles were 0 77 and 0 57 the results indicate that ca2 appeared to have a greater influence on emitter clogging than phosphorus fertilizer moreover the precipitates spc 0 75 exhibited stronger impacts on dra than particles spc 0 46 in addition sem suggested that precipitates and particles had significant correlations spc 0 63 indicating the interactions among precipitates and particles could be another factor influencing dra 4 discussion 4 1 phosphorus fertilizer and calcium ion interaction on emitter clogging behavior emitter clogging has emerged as a major issue in pdis and ca2 plays an important role in pdis clogging the results of this study show that phosphorus fertilizer ca2 concentration and their interactions had significant impacts on emitter clogging behavior in pdis the clogging risk caused by phosphorus fertilizer increased obviously as the ca2 concentration increased fig 2 and fig 3 when the ca2 concentration was low phosphorus fertilizer application reduced emitter clogging whereas phosphorus fertilizer application at high ca2 concentrations significantly increased emitter clogging changes in chemical precipitation significantly affected the emitter clogging behavior of pdis fig 4 and fig 7 at low ca2 concentrations up and map reduced emitter clogging primarily by significantly reducing the formation of calcium carbonate i e calcite and aragonite and dolomite especially calcium carbonate fig 5 firstly this is because the use of up and map reduced the ph of the irrigation water fig s5 and co3 2 in irrigation water was more easily converted to hco3 potentially slowing the formation of various chemical precipitates moreover the use of up and map increased the presence of po4 3 in the irrigation water and po4 3 could competitively adsorb ca2 with co3 2 in the irrigation water ma et al 2020 greatly reducing the formation of carbonates and dolomites surprisingly almost no phosphate precipitates were found at low ca2 concentrations the reason was that the solubility of carbonate was lower than that phosphate so carbonate had an advantage in the competitive adsorption of ca2 and then crystallized first chow and eanes 2001 gal et al 1996 the application of up and map increased the risk of emitter clogging as ca2 concentrations increased indeed up and map significantly reduced carbonate precipitation at high ca2 concentrations whereas increased phosphate precipitation was the primary cause of pdis emitter clogging because there was not enough ca2 to bind po4 3 when the ca2 concentration was low when the ca2 concentration was high the carbonate in the solution was exhausted and the excess ca2 would combine with po4 3 to form a large amount of calcium phosphorite precipitation štulajterová and medvecký 2008 in conclusion at low ca2 concentrations fertilization treatment primarily reduced emitter clogging by reducing calcium carbonate precipitation whereas at high ca2 concentrations fertilization treatment significantly increased the crystallization of brushite resulting in clogging aggravation up and map treatments significantly increased particle fouling inside the emitter compared to ck treatment fig 6 in general particle scaling was extremely stable in nature and persists in water it is extremely difficult to form independently and quickly at room temperature liu et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 as a result the particle scaling inside the emitter was primarily caused by the flocculation and deposition of particle matter in the water ma et al 2020 the decrease in ph in irrigation water was one of the reasons for accelerating particle flocculation and sedimentation after phosphate application because the decrease in ph can promote silanol structure condensation and accelerate silicate gel polymerization neofotistou and demadis 2004 umar and saaid 2013 which can enhance the deposition of particles furthermore particle surfaces were generally negatively charged han et al 2019 and a large number of cations would be ionized in water following phosphate application positive ions such as ammonium ions in map would act as a bridge between particles with negatively charged surfaces guan et al 2018 allowing smaller particles in the water to aggregate into larger particles resulting in easier particle deposition inside the emitter finally after the application of phosphorus fertilizer the content of all types of particle scaling increased it was worth noting that the decrease in chemical precipitation was significantly greater than the increase in particle fouling caused by phosphorus application at low ca2 concentrations resulting in mitigation in emitter clogging it was discovered that the higher the ca2 concentration in each treatment the greater the total amount of chemical precipitation and particle scaling because that when ca2 concentrations were high it was easier to form various carbonate and phosphate precipitations which greatly intensifies particle precipitation formation furthermore the addition of ca2 as a cation would create a bridge between particles resulting in easier flocculation and particle deposition in the emitter the findings of this experiment were consistent with previous research in a study of the scaling and aggregation kinetics of calcium carbonate al nasser w n al salhi 2013 discovered that the formation rate of deposited fouling was faster and the amount of fouling was greater at higher ca2 concentrations meanwhile in the study of the effect of ca2 concentration on fouling permeability reduction in porous media naseri et al 2015 discovered that the higher the ca2 concentration the intensity of the scale precipitation and the flooding reduction of porous media occurs more rapidly the phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 have significant interaction effects on pdis emitter clogging which may aggravate the accumulation of clogging substances previous research showed that when a high concentration of ca2 coexists with hydrogen phosphate the calcium and hydrogen phosphate combine to become a negatively charged cluster that grows by ion attachment and the interaction between particles malini et al 2019 as a result a significant interaction effect was created hastening the formation and accumulation of clogging substances the minimum free energy occupied by the nanoparticles in solution is lower than that of free ions or ion pairs in solution implying that brushite nucleation and growth may occur via the aggregation of small negatively charged clusters malini et al 2019 the precipitated material began as sub stable amorphous calcium phosphate in solution habraken et al 2013 xie et al 2014 then densifies and crystallizes calcium phosphates meanwhile the negative electric effect of particle fouling particularly quartz could adsorb a certain amount of calcium ions resulting in crystallization fouling and particle fouling coagulation iler 1975 with increasing ca2 concentration this type of coagulation effect increased resulting in a significant increase in the total amount of precipitated substances naseri et al 2015 4 2 control strategies of emitter clogging for pdis some measures to slow pdis clogging were proposed based on the influence of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 coupling on emitter clogging behavior the first step was to choose an appropriate ca2 concentration the ca2 concentrations of up and map found in this experiment to slow down or aggravate the risk of emitter clogging are 150 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively as a result ca2 concentrations of approximately 150 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 were recommended for the up and map pdis in the experiment respectively the type of phosphate fertilizer was also an important consideration for pdis and the risk of clogging after up application was significantly lower than that after map application this finding was consistent with previous research xiao et al 2020 yang et al 2019 which indicated that the risk of irrigation clog after the application was significantly lower than that of other phosphate fertilizers such as potassium dihydrogen phosphate and mono ammonium phosphate as a result it was recommended that up and other acidic phosphate fertilizers be used to slow the clogging of the emitter another concern was the content of particles in the clogging substances because the use of up and map and increasing in ca2 concentration would greatly aggravate particle deposition as a result this paper suggested that when phosphorus fertilizer was applied and ca2 concentrations in water are high pdis filtration should be strengthened to reduce particle concentrations in water and thus mitigate emitter clogging it was important to note that the ca2 concentration in pdis should be chosen based on the actual situation because pdis emitter clogging was affected not only by ca2 concentration but also by co3 2 hco3 po4 3 and the ph of irrigation water for example the critical ca2 concentration for exacerbating emitter clogging after up application was significantly higher than that after map application fig 3 which could be attributed to the lower ph of irrigation water after up application fig s5 generally the lower ph of the water after fertilization represents the lower risk of emitter clogging which could lead to higher demarcation ca2 concentrations i e no increase or decrease in emitter clogging after fertigation furthermore the competitive adsorption of ca2 by co3 2 and po4 3 would be broken if the concentrations of phosphorus fertilizer carbonates and bicarbonates were adjusted which would affect the influence of ca2 concentration on pdis clogging for example ma et al 2020 discovered that when two types of phosphorus fertilizer were applied the higher concentration of phosphorus fertilizer significantly increased the content of particle scaling while decreasing the content of chemical precipitation the phosphorus fertilizer concentration in this experiment was 0 3 g l 1 increasing phosphorus concentration may increase the competitive adsorption of ca2 by po4 3 which may lead to phosphate precipitation being easier to form and carbonate precipitation being more difficult to form furthermore higher co3 2 concentration may cause phosphate precipitation to be difficult to form because co3 2 has an advantage over po4 3 in the competitive adsorption of ca2 chow and eanes 2001 gal et al 1996 therefore this study suggested that phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentration should be adjusted to reduce emitter clogging and various factors such as phosphate fertilizer type and concentration co3 2 and hco3 concentration water ph and water particles may influence the adaptation between phosphate fertilizer and ca2 however this study only considered the concentration of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 more water parameters such as ph co3 2 and hco3 should be considered because they play important roles in the formation of precipitates and solid particles further research should be conducted to investigate the effects of the aforementioned factors coupling on pdis clogging lastly it is worth noting that management of ca2 concentration in water is challenging for growers phosphorus fertilizer application strategies such as concentration type and duration may be more manageable as a result it is suggested that in practice the application of phosphate fertilizer should be adjusted by the concentration of ca2 furthermore only considering the interaction and adaptation of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 could not completely resolve the issue of emitter clogging to reduce emitter clogging traditional methods such as acidification during or after a fertigation should be combined 5 conclusions in summary this study demonstrates that emitter clogging risks of phosphorus drip irrigation system pdis was highly related to the ca2 concentrations at low ca2 concentrations phosphorus fertilizer applications significantly reduced emitter clogging when compared to no fertilization for instance when ca2 concentration was 25 mg l 1 phosphorus fertilizer reduced fouling dry weights by 25 45 while increasing dra and cu by 27 54 and 29 39 however phosphorus fertilizer increased emitter clogging at high ca2 concentrations for instance when ca2 concentration was 200 mg l 1 phosphorus fertilizer applications increased fouling dry weights by 18 36 thus this study suggests the phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentrations should be adapted to mitigate emitter clogging for pdis the investigations presented herein resolve the controversies and conflicting results in past literature reports moreover by an in depth analysis of clogging substance compositions this study clarified the mechanisms of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 coupling on emitter clogging in addition this study also provided some strategies to mitigate emitter clogging of pdis these findings will facilitate the application and promotion of phosphorus drip irrigation technology further studies should investigate the effect of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 coupling on emitter clogging at more application conditions including different

8971,emitter clogging is a major challenge for phosphorus drip irrigation systems pdis calcium ions ca2 play an important role in pdis clogging however the effects of ca2 and phosphorus fertilizer interactions on emitter clogging are largely unknown this study investigated the emitter clogging behaviors with four ca2 concentrations 25 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 and three phosphorus application strategies no fertilization urea phosphate and mono ammonium phosphate results show that ca2 concentrations phosphorous fertilizer and their interaction significantly affected emitter clogging at low concentrations of ca2 phosphorus fertilizer applications reduced emitter clogging when compared to no fertilization when ca2 concentration was 25 mg l 1 phosphate fertilizer reduced the dry weight of clogging substances by 25 45 because the phosphate ions po4 3 hydrolyzed from phosphate fertilizer competed for ca2 with carbonate ions co3 2 which reduced the formation of calcium carbonates in contrast phosphorus fertilizer applications increased emitter clogging at high ca2 concentrations when ca2 concentration was 200 mg l 1 phosphate fertilizer increased the dry weight of clogging substances by 18 36 because abundant ca2 interacted with po4 3 to form phosphate precipitations furthermore urea phosphate posed fewer clogging risks than mono ammonium phosphate and the demarcation ca2 concentrations i e no increase or decrease in emitter clogging after fertigation for urea phosphate and mono ammonium phosphate were approximately 150 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively lastly phosphate fertilizer application and a rise in ca2 concentration significantly increased the deposition of water particles to mitigate emitter clogging of pdis it is suggested that phosphorus fertilizer types and suitable ca2 concentrations be adapted as well as water filtration should be enhanced this study clarified the effects of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 coupling on emitter clogging with implications for resolving the pdis clogging issue and promoting the application of phosphorus drip irrigation technology keywords phosphorus fertigation calcium concentration precipitation particle deposition emitter clogging data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction phosphorus is one of the most important nutrients for crop growth and productivity malhotra et al 2018 however soils easily adsorb and fix phosphorus weihrauch and opp 2018 resulting in a phosphorus transport distance of less than 15 cm in the soil takahashi and anwar 2007 and a utilization rate of less than 25 in a single season zhao et al 2021 thus excessive phosphorus fertilizer is commonly used in agricultural fertilization xiao et al 2020 to date nearly 21 million tons of phosphorus are imported into terrestrial systems each year primarily through agricultural fertilization sheldrick et al 2003 however phosphate rock the raw material for phosphate fertilizer is a nonrenewable resource that can only be mined for 50 years at the current consumption rate natasha 2009 as a result it is critical to reduce phosphorus fertilizer consumption and increase its use efficiency drip irrigation a water saving technology offers a potential opportunity for increasing the use efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer muhammad et al 2021 this is because drip irrigation dissolves phosphorus fertilizer in water and delivers phosphorus fertilizer and water directly to the root zone of crops which significantly improves the movement distance application uniformity and utilization efficiency of phosphorus fertilizer fan et al 2020 wang and chu 2015 despite the promising advantages of drip irrigation phosphorus drip irrigation system pdis currently is not popular farmer is more willing to inject phosphorus fertilizer directly into the soil enciso medina et al 2007 this is due to the drip irrigation emitters flow channel is quite narrow 0 5 1 2 mm shen et al 2022 and improper application of phosphate fertilizer can easily cause emitter clogging muhammad et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 it will significantly reduce the fertigation uniformity and shorten the service life of pdis thus emitter clogging has become a critical concern in the application and promotion of pdis pdis emitter clogging is highly related to the application strategies of phosphorus fertilizer such as the types frequency and concentrations of fertilization ma et al 2020 wang et al 2021 2020 zhou et al 2019 however the effects of phosphorus application on emitter clogging behavior have been reported in inconsistent or contradictory outcomes in the literature some studies showed that phosphorus fertilizer application increased emitter clogging xiao et al 2020 found that applying urea phosphate monopotassium phosphate and ammonium polyphosphate reduced the discharge of pdis by 4 1 43 9 muhammad et al 2021 discovered that the use of urea phosphate and monopotassium phosphate exacerbated the blockage of emitters in contrast ma et al 2020 found that while monopotassium phosphate increased emitter clogging urea phosphate and ammonium polyphosphate effectively controlled emitter clogging similarly phosphorus fertigation with acidic fertilizers such as monoammonium phosphate and urea phosphate has been demonstrated can reduce emitter clogging wang et al 2020 yang et al 2019 the varying responses of phosphorus fertilizer application to emitter clogging highlight the need for further research calcium ions ca2 play an important role in pdis clogging according to literature phosphorus fertilizer increased emitter clogging because phosphorus fertilizer can interact with ca2 to form phosphate precipitations e g calcium phosphate haynes 1985 liu et al 2022 wang et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 in contrast some studies have shown that phosphorus fertilizer application does not result in the formation of phosphate precipitations muhammad et al 2021 xiao et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 furthermore ma et al 2020 and yang et al 2019 reported that phosphorus fertilizer mitigated emitter clogging primarily by reducing calcium carbonate formation because both carbonate ions co3 2 and phosphate ions po4 3 can interact with ca2 to form chemical precipitations ezekiel et al 2018 it can be inferred that the competition for ca2 between co3 2 and po4 3 had a significant impact on emitter clogging behavior of pdis this study hypothesizes that ca2 concentration influences the formation of carbonate and phosphate precipitation in pdis i e ca2 preferentially combines co3 2 and abundant ca2 can interact with po4 3 resulting in pdis clogging behaviors that vary greatly with ca2 concentrations however it is still unknown how the interaction of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentration affects emitter clogging the aims of this study were to 1 investigate the effects of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 interaction on emitter performance 2 clarify the mechanism of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 coupling on emitter clogging 3 propose practical strategies to prevent emitter clogging of pdis here emitter clogging behaviors for pdis were investigated using four ca2 concentrations 25 200 mg l 1 and three phosphorus fertilizer application strategies no fertilization urea phosphate and mono ammonium phosphate x ray diffraction was used to determine mineral precipitations and particles in clogging substances 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup the experiment was carried out in beijing tongzhou china the water used in the experiment was imported from the local groundwater the groundwater quality parameters were shown in table 1 the average ca2 concentration of the groundwater was 68 5 mg l 1 the ca2 of the groundwater was reduced by an ion exchange resin water softener manufacturer youmi china type rs 4000 l to prepare the water used in the experiment with different ca2 concentrations the functional groups of ion exchange resin can use sodium ions na to replace ca2 in water following that the ca2 concentration in the groundwater was reduced to less than 25 mg l 1 and water with varying ca2 concentrations was obtained by adding calcium chloride cacl2 the experiment investigated four calcium ion concentrations 25 50 100 and 200 mg l 1 and three phosphorus application strategies no fertilizer ck urea phosphate up monoammonium phosphate map up is an acid fertilizer previous studies have reported that up can effectively mitigate emitter clogging than other types of phosphorous fertilizer ma et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 yang et al 2019 map is regarded as the most commonly used phosphorus resource in large scale field plantations kafkafi and tarchitzky 2011 thus up and map were selected as the phosphorus fertilizers in the experiment the phosphorus fertilizer application concentration was set at 300 mg l 1 p2o5 concentration see details of phosphorus fertilizer preparation in supplementary information part i a total of 12 treatments were established based on the ca2 concentration and fertilization strategies which are named as ck 25 ck represents fertilization strategy 25 represents ca2 concentration ck 50 ck 100 ck 200 up 25 up 50 up 100 up 200 map 25 map 50 map 100 map 200 the emitter clogging test platform of the drip irrigation system was shown in fig 1 the drip irrigation system s head contained a fertilization tank and a clean water tank which were used to store water containing and not containing phosphorus fertilizer respectively the water was filtered by a screen filter 106 µm filtration level before entering the drip line the test platform was divided into three layers and each layer had one type of emitter each kind of emitter was set to 8 repetitions for samples taken during different operating periods three commonly used non pressure compensating emitters named e1 e2 e3 were used in the experiment with the specific geometric parameters listed in table s1 the table or figure in the supplementary information is denoted by the letter s the three types of emitters represent a repetition of the experiment to enhance the reliability of the results one drip line was 18 m long with 60 identical emitters and the space between the emitters was 0 3 m the experiment system ran every day for a total of 64 days ck treatments irrigated clean water every day not using fertilization tanks whereas fertilization treatments were fertilized every two days the fertilization was at the heart of the entire operation in addition the operation of the system in one day represented the actual irrigation and fertilization once specifically the fertilizer concentration was 0 3 g l 1 the fertilization amount in each drip line was 33 75 g d 1 and the irrigation amount in each drip line was 0 45 m3 d 1 which was equivalent to 6 75 kg acre 1 and 90 m3 acre 1 respectively when 3600 m drip irrigation lateral was laid per acre see details of irrigation and feralization process for fertilization and no fertilization in fig s1 moreover the head pressure of the test platform was kept at 0 1 mpa and the drip lines were washed with clean water every 4 days at a flow rate of 0 5 m s 1 2 2 emitter performance evaluation index in drip irrigation system every 8 days the drip irrigation test platform checked the emitter flow rate and the method proposed by pei et al 2014 was used to correct the emitter flow rate after correcting the emitter s flow rate the relative flow rate dra xiao et al 2020 and christiansen uniformity coefficient cu christiansen 1942 were applied to assess emitter performances the relative average flow dra of the emitter was represented by the following equation 1 d r a i n q i t q i 0 n 100 where q i 0 represents the corrected flow rate of the emitter i at the initial time l h q i t represents the corrected flow rate of the emitter i at time t l h n is the total number of emitters on the drip line the uniformity of a drip irrigation system was evaluated by cu which can reflect the randomness of each emitter and evaluate the spatial uniformity of a drip irrigation system the calculation equation is as follows 2 c u 100 1 i 1 n q i t q t n q t where q t represents the average corrected flow rate of each emitter on the drip line at time t l h the meanings of other parameters are the same as those in eq 1 2 3 emitter clogging substance sampling and testing methods every 8 days a drip line from the drip irrigation test platform was chosen for sampling in each experimental treatment during each sampling 10 emitter samples were destructively selected from the drip line s first middle and tail positions the samples were cut into pieces and placed in ziplock bags and 20 ml deionized water was added to the ultrasonic cleaner manufacturer kunshan shumei type kq5200de for clogging substance removal the treatment time for shedding clogging substances was 60 min the treated suspension was poured into a centrifuge tube and centrifuged the solid at the bottom of the centrifuge tube was then dried to a constant weight at a constant temperature of 60 c finally the dry weight of the clogging substance was measured by a high precision electronic balance to obtain a polycrystalline diffraction pattern the dry clogging substance was ground evenly and scanned on the operating platform of a d8 advance x ray diffractometer xrd the scanning process s basic test conditions were that voltage 40 kv current 40 ma cu target and wavelength 1 5406 å topas software was used to analyze the obtained map in order to determine the mineral composition and content of the clogging substance see details of xrd testing in supplementary information part ii simultaneously the general structure and analysis system was applied to further determine the mineral compositions in order to get the final map of clogging substance mineral components toby dreele r b 2013 in addition the minerals in the emitter clogging substance were classified as chemical precipitation fouling e g calcium carbonate and particle fouling e g quartz with the chemical precipitation caused by the crystallization of chemical ions and the particle caused by the deposition of water suspended particles 2 4 statistical analysis the correlations between different treatments of the dry weight of clogging substance dra cu and various mineral contents were determined by the pearson analysis to determine whether fertilization ca2 concentration and their interaction have a significant influence on dra cu and various mineral contents linear regression and analysis of variance were used structural equation modelling performed by amos v22 0 ibm usa was used to evaluate the direct and indirect pathways of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 concentration on emitter clogging 3 results 3 1 clogging substance content and emitter performance the dynamic changes in clogging substances dw dra and cu fig 2 fig s2 and fig s3 for e1 e2 and e3 respectively indicate that phosphorus fertilizer application and ca2 concentrations significantly p 0 05 table s2 affected emitter clogging behavior furthermore the coupling of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentrations also significantly p 0 05 affected the dw dra and cu in addition ca2 concentrations appear to have a greater influence on emitter clogging than phosphorus fertilizer as evidenced by the dw increasing and emitter performance decreasing dramatically as ca2 concentrations increased whereas the differences of dw dra and cu between three types of fertilization strategies were comparatively smaller the correlations of dw dra and cu between the three types of fertigation strategies are shown in fig s4 and their relative slopes k are summarized in fig 3 ca2 concentrations had a significant impact on the emitter clogging risks of pdis when compared to ck i e no fertilization urea phosphate up and mono ammonium phosphate map applications significantly reduced emitter clogging at low ca2 concentrations for example when ca2 concentration was 25 mg l 1 up 25 and map 25 reduced dw by 25 45 compared to ck 25 k 1 while increasing dra and cu by 27 54 and 29 39 respectively in contrast at high ca2 concentrations phosphorus fertilizer applications significantly increased emitter clogging for instance when ca2 concentration was 200 mg l 1 up and map applications increased dw by 18 36 overall the pdis clogging risks increased with increasing ca2 concentrations phosphorus fertilizer types also had a significant impact on emitter clogging in all ca2 concentrations up posed fewer clogging risks than map up application reduced emitter clogging in the up 25 up 50 and up 100 treatments when compared to ck whereas map appeared to reduce emitter clogging when the ca2 concentration was less than 50 mg l 1 the demarcation ca2 concentrations i e no increase or decrease in emitter clogging after fertigation for up and map were approximately 150 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively 3 2 clogging substance components in phosphate drip irrigation systems the rietveld refinement patterns of clogging substances in pdis were obtained by the xrd rietveld refinement technique fig 4a the results showed that the clogging substances mainly include chemical precipitation and particle scaling chemical precipitation contained aragonite calcite dolomite and brushite and particles contained quartz muscovite feldspar and chlorite fertilization and ca2 concentration obviously affected the diffraction pattern the mass ratio of each mineral component is shown in fig 4b aragonite calcite brushite and quartz were the dominant mineral across all the treatments which account for 0 35 6 2 1 40 3 0 55 1 9 6 49 3 of the total minerals the mineral composition was significantly different between ck and fertilization treatments the proportions of calcium carbonate calcite and aragonite in ck up and map treatments were 44 7 74 1 8 6 29 4 and 2 2 12 1 respectively indicating that the proportions of calcium carbonate were significantly reduced after the application of phosphate fertilizer meanwhile the ratio of particles and phosphate brushite was increased after the application of phosphorus fertilizer among them the proportion of particle scaling in ck up and map treatment were 23 7 50 6 49 4 73 1 and 39 3 82 5 respectively the proportion of phosphate brushite in ck up and map treatment were 0 5 2 40 1 5 5 55 1 respectively moreover at low ca2 concentration i e 25 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 brushite at up and map treatments was only 2 5 29 5 however under the condition of high ca2 concentration i e 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 the proportion of brushite increased significantly reaching 8 8 55 1 3 3 dynamic change of chemical precipitations in phosphate drip irrigation systems the dynamic changes of various chemical precipitation in the phosphate drip irrigation system are shown in fig 5 phosphorus fertilizer ca2 concentration and their coupling had significant p 0 05 table s2 impacts on the content of various chemical precipitations the total content of precipitations fig 5a increased drastically as ca2 concentrations increased when ca2 concentrations were at 25 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 up and map applications significantly p 0 05 reduced total precipitation by 46 70 table s3 however when ca2 concentration was at 200 mg l 1 the total precipitations increased significantly p 0 05 by 17 69 with up and map applications the dynamic changes of aragonite calcite dolomite and brushite are shown in fig 5b e in general the content of the four precipitations obviously with increasing ca2 concentrations when compared to ck up reduced aragonite content by 64 77 while no aragonite was detected with the map application up and map also effectively reduced the content of calcite and dolomite by 70 93 and 18 61 respectively brushite was not detected in ck treatments similarly when ca2 concentrations were 25 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 almost no brushite was found in the up and map treatments whereas up and map applications significantly increased the content of brushite when ca2 concentrations were 100 mg l 1 and 200 mg l 1 this is the main reason that phosphorus fertilizer application increased emitter clogging 3 4 dynamic change of particles in phosphate drip irrigation systems the dynamic changes of various particles in the phosphate drip irrigation system are shown in fig 6 phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentration had significant p 0 05 table s2 impacts on the contents of various particles whereas their coupling had no significantly p 0 05 effect on particle content the total particle content fig 6a increased drastically as ca2 concentrations increased furthermore up and map applications significantly p 0 05 increased particle content by 23 97 table s3 the dynamic changes of quartz muscovite feldspar and chloritee are shown in fig 6b e in general the content of the four particles increased as ca2 concentrations increased additionally the up and map applications also increased the content of the four particles with up and map applications the quartz muscovite feldspar and chlorite increased by 11 0 133 0 9 0 81 0 10 9 46 0 and 17 0 168 0 respectively in addition map had higher particle contents than up the results indicated that another major clogging risk of pdis was phosphorus fertilizer application and increasing ca2 concentration significantly promoted the deposition of water particles 3 5 phosphorus fertilizer and calcium ion acting pathways on emitter clogging fig 7a depicts the relationships between various clogging substances and emitter performance ca2 concentration and various clogging substances were found to have significant p 0 05 correlations for instance the dry weight of clogging substances showed a significant positive relationship with ca2 concentration furthermore various foulants were significantly p 0 05 correlated with one another for example significant interactions were discovered between total precipitation content and four types of particles the findings suggest that interactions between different clogging substances may be another important way to influence pdis emitter clogging the structural equation model sem fig 7b further revealed the direct and indirect effect of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentration on the formation of various precipitations and particles and emitter performance sem showed that phosphorus fertilizer directly and significantly affected precipitations and particles as indicated by the standardized path coefficient spc values were 0 55 and 0 34 respectively while the spc of ca2 concentration for precipitations and particles were 0 77 and 0 57 the results indicate that ca2 appeared to have a greater influence on emitter clogging than phosphorus fertilizer moreover the precipitates spc 0 75 exhibited stronger impacts on dra than particles spc 0 46 in addition sem suggested that precipitates and particles had significant correlations spc 0 63 indicating the interactions among precipitates and particles could be another factor influencing dra 4 discussion 4 1 phosphorus fertilizer and calcium ion interaction on emitter clogging behavior emitter clogging has emerged as a major issue in pdis and ca2 plays an important role in pdis clogging the results of this study show that phosphorus fertilizer ca2 concentration and their interactions had significant impacts on emitter clogging behavior in pdis the clogging risk caused by phosphorus fertilizer increased obviously as the ca2 concentration increased fig 2 and fig 3 when the ca2 concentration was low phosphorus fertilizer application reduced emitter clogging whereas phosphorus fertilizer application at high ca2 concentrations significantly increased emitter clogging changes in chemical precipitation significantly affected the emitter clogging behavior of pdis fig 4 and fig 7 at low ca2 concentrations up and map reduced emitter clogging primarily by significantly reducing the formation of calcium carbonate i e calcite and aragonite and dolomite especially calcium carbonate fig 5 firstly this is because the use of up and map reduced the ph of the irrigation water fig s5 and co3 2 in irrigation water was more easily converted to hco3 potentially slowing the formation of various chemical precipitates moreover the use of up and map increased the presence of po4 3 in the irrigation water and po4 3 could competitively adsorb ca2 with co3 2 in the irrigation water ma et al 2020 greatly reducing the formation of carbonates and dolomites surprisingly almost no phosphate precipitates were found at low ca2 concentrations the reason was that the solubility of carbonate was lower than that phosphate so carbonate had an advantage in the competitive adsorption of ca2 and then crystallized first chow and eanes 2001 gal et al 1996 the application of up and map increased the risk of emitter clogging as ca2 concentrations increased indeed up and map significantly reduced carbonate precipitation at high ca2 concentrations whereas increased phosphate precipitation was the primary cause of pdis emitter clogging because there was not enough ca2 to bind po4 3 when the ca2 concentration was low when the ca2 concentration was high the carbonate in the solution was exhausted and the excess ca2 would combine with po4 3 to form a large amount of calcium phosphorite precipitation štulajterová and medvecký 2008 in conclusion at low ca2 concentrations fertilization treatment primarily reduced emitter clogging by reducing calcium carbonate precipitation whereas at high ca2 concentrations fertilization treatment significantly increased the crystallization of brushite resulting in clogging aggravation up and map treatments significantly increased particle fouling inside the emitter compared to ck treatment fig 6 in general particle scaling was extremely stable in nature and persists in water it is extremely difficult to form independently and quickly at room temperature liu et al 2021 zhou et al 2018 as a result the particle scaling inside the emitter was primarily caused by the flocculation and deposition of particle matter in the water ma et al 2020 the decrease in ph in irrigation water was one of the reasons for accelerating particle flocculation and sedimentation after phosphate application because the decrease in ph can promote silanol structure condensation and accelerate silicate gel polymerization neofotistou and demadis 2004 umar and saaid 2013 which can enhance the deposition of particles furthermore particle surfaces were generally negatively charged han et al 2019 and a large number of cations would be ionized in water following phosphate application positive ions such as ammonium ions in map would act as a bridge between particles with negatively charged surfaces guan et al 2018 allowing smaller particles in the water to aggregate into larger particles resulting in easier particle deposition inside the emitter finally after the application of phosphorus fertilizer the content of all types of particle scaling increased it was worth noting that the decrease in chemical precipitation was significantly greater than the increase in particle fouling caused by phosphorus application at low ca2 concentrations resulting in mitigation in emitter clogging it was discovered that the higher the ca2 concentration in each treatment the greater the total amount of chemical precipitation and particle scaling because that when ca2 concentrations were high it was easier to form various carbonate and phosphate precipitations which greatly intensifies particle precipitation formation furthermore the addition of ca2 as a cation would create a bridge between particles resulting in easier flocculation and particle deposition in the emitter the findings of this experiment were consistent with previous research in a study of the scaling and aggregation kinetics of calcium carbonate al nasser w n al salhi 2013 discovered that the formation rate of deposited fouling was faster and the amount of fouling was greater at higher ca2 concentrations meanwhile in the study of the effect of ca2 concentration on fouling permeability reduction in porous media naseri et al 2015 discovered that the higher the ca2 concentration the intensity of the scale precipitation and the flooding reduction of porous media occurs more rapidly the phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 have significant interaction effects on pdis emitter clogging which may aggravate the accumulation of clogging substances previous research showed that when a high concentration of ca2 coexists with hydrogen phosphate the calcium and hydrogen phosphate combine to become a negatively charged cluster that grows by ion attachment and the interaction between particles malini et al 2019 as a result a significant interaction effect was created hastening the formation and accumulation of clogging substances the minimum free energy occupied by the nanoparticles in solution is lower than that of free ions or ion pairs in solution implying that brushite nucleation and growth may occur via the aggregation of small negatively charged clusters malini et al 2019 the precipitated material began as sub stable amorphous calcium phosphate in solution habraken et al 2013 xie et al 2014 then densifies and crystallizes calcium phosphates meanwhile the negative electric effect of particle fouling particularly quartz could adsorb a certain amount of calcium ions resulting in crystallization fouling and particle fouling coagulation iler 1975 with increasing ca2 concentration this type of coagulation effect increased resulting in a significant increase in the total amount of precipitated substances naseri et al 2015 4 2 control strategies of emitter clogging for pdis some measures to slow pdis clogging were proposed based on the influence of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 coupling on emitter clogging behavior the first step was to choose an appropriate ca2 concentration the ca2 concentrations of up and map found in this experiment to slow down or aggravate the risk of emitter clogging are 150 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 respectively as a result ca2 concentrations of approximately 150 mg l 1 and 50 mg l 1 were recommended for the up and map pdis in the experiment respectively the type of phosphate fertilizer was also an important consideration for pdis and the risk of clogging after up application was significantly lower than that after map application this finding was consistent with previous research xiao et al 2020 yang et al 2019 which indicated that the risk of irrigation clog after the application was significantly lower than that of other phosphate fertilizers such as potassium dihydrogen phosphate and mono ammonium phosphate as a result it was recommended that up and other acidic phosphate fertilizers be used to slow the clogging of the emitter another concern was the content of particles in the clogging substances because the use of up and map and increasing in ca2 concentration would greatly aggravate particle deposition as a result this paper suggested that when phosphorus fertilizer was applied and ca2 concentrations in water are high pdis filtration should be strengthened to reduce particle concentrations in water and thus mitigate emitter clogging it was important to note that the ca2 concentration in pdis should be chosen based on the actual situation because pdis emitter clogging was affected not only by ca2 concentration but also by co3 2 hco3 po4 3 and the ph of irrigation water for example the critical ca2 concentration for exacerbating emitter clogging after up application was significantly higher than that after map application fig 3 which could be attributed to the lower ph of irrigation water after up application fig s5 generally the lower ph of the water after fertilization represents the lower risk of emitter clogging which could lead to higher demarcation ca2 concentrations i e no increase or decrease in emitter clogging after fertigation furthermore the competitive adsorption of ca2 by co3 2 and po4 3 would be broken if the concentrations of phosphorus fertilizer carbonates and bicarbonates were adjusted which would affect the influence of ca2 concentration on pdis clogging for example ma et al 2020 discovered that when two types of phosphorus fertilizer were applied the higher concentration of phosphorus fertilizer significantly increased the content of particle scaling while decreasing the content of chemical precipitation the phosphorus fertilizer concentration in this experiment was 0 3 g l 1 increasing phosphorus concentration may increase the competitive adsorption of ca2 by po4 3 which may lead to phosphate precipitation being easier to form and carbonate precipitation being more difficult to form furthermore higher co3 2 concentration may cause phosphate precipitation to be difficult to form because co3 2 has an advantage over po4 3 in the competitive adsorption of ca2 chow and eanes 2001 gal et al 1996 therefore this study suggested that phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentration should be adjusted to reduce emitter clogging and various factors such as phosphate fertilizer type and concentration co3 2 and hco3 concentration water ph and water particles may influence the adaptation between phosphate fertilizer and ca2 however this study only considered the concentration of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 more water parameters such as ph co3 2 and hco3 should be considered because they play important roles in the formation of precipitates and solid particles further research should be conducted to investigate the effects of the aforementioned factors coupling on pdis clogging lastly it is worth noting that management of ca2 concentration in water is challenging for growers phosphorus fertilizer application strategies such as concentration type and duration may be more manageable as a result it is suggested that in practice the application of phosphate fertilizer should be adjusted by the concentration of ca2 furthermore only considering the interaction and adaptation of phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 could not completely resolve the issue of emitter clogging to reduce emitter clogging traditional methods such as acidification during or after a fertigation should be combined 5 conclusions in summary this study demonstrates that emitter clogging risks of phosphorus drip irrigation system pdis was highly related to the ca2 concentrations at low ca2 concentrations phosphorus fertilizer applications significantly reduced emitter clogging when compared to no fertilization for instance when ca2 concentration was 25 mg l 1 phosphorus fertilizer reduced fouling dry weights by 25 45 while increasing dra and cu by 27 54 and 29 39 however phosphorus fertilizer increased emitter clogging at high ca2 concentrations for instance when ca2 concentration was 200 mg l 1 phosphorus fertilizer applications increased fouling dry weights by 18 36 thus this study suggests the phosphorus fertilizer and ca2 concentrations should be adapted to mitigate emitter clogging for pdis the investigations presented herein resolve the controversies and conflicting results in past literature reports moreover by an in depth analysis of clogging substance compositions this study clarified the mechanisms of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 coupling on emitter clogging in addition this study also provided some strategies to mitigate emitter clogging of pdis these findings will facilitate the application and promotion of phosphorus drip irrigation technology further studies should investigate the effect of phosphate fertilizer and ca2 coupling on emitter clogging at more application conditions including different

8972,sweet cherry is mainly cultivated in arid and semi arid areas in the last decade these areas have experienced a dramatic reduction in rainfall which has resulted in water shortage for sweet cherry the use of specific rootstock and scion combinations could help improve the tolerance of plants to water shortage events this study reports on the influence of rootstocks on whole plant performance under water deficit as detected by hydraulic sensitivity root hydraulic conductivity lp water use efficiency and sugar content four prunus rootstocks scion combinations bing colt lapins colt bing mx60 lapins mx60 and two self rooted rootstocks colt and maxma 60 were acclimated for 30 days and then exposed to well watered ww and water deficit wd conditions for 36 days whole plant transpiration and growth were both influenced by wd and two groups were identified based on responses bing colt bing mx60 and mx60 had an early reduction conservative strategy whereas lapins mx60 lapins colt and colt had late reduction productive strategy in transpiration as wd increased among the combinations lapins colt and colt showed a remarkable growth response to the wd being less affected in shoot and root biomass the colt rootstock maintained a higher ψgs50 near isohydric behavior than combinations using the mx60 rootstock near anisohydric behavior the relationship between lp and the variation of ψpre dawn ψmidday showed differences among rootstock scion combinations and under wd condition the reduction in lp induced by wd affected the whole plant wue of combinations differently sucrose and sorbitol content in leaves and roots of wd tolerant combinations such as colt and lapins colt showed a remarkable increase under wd condition our finding highlights the importance of the specific interaction between rootstock and scion suggesting that combinations characterized by a higher water uptake capacity under conditions of lower water availability would be

introduction water deficit is an adverse component of climate change that threatens the productivity of different ecosystems pareek et al 2020 with the reduction of rainfall and the increase in temperature over the past few decades the magnitude and severity of the drought events have increasingly affected irrigated crops hussain et al 2019 representing one of the major causes of agricultural production loss worldwide campbell et al 2016 lesk et al 2016 in the last 10 years the annual precipitation in central chile has decreased by 55 75 resulting in a period of megadrought garreaud et al 2017 while in arid and semi arid regions an increased water shortage is expected as intensity and frequency of rainfall decrease edenhofer 2015 núñez et al 2011 sweet cherry prunus avium l has become one of the most appealing and economically prolific fruit crops around the world gonçalves et al 2021 in general sweet cherry is grown under controlled and scheduled irrigation systems blanco et al 2018 and water limitation is therefore expected to negatively affect the productivity and yield blanco et al 2020 the use of rootstocks has been widely adopted around the world due to benefits related to resistance to soil diseases and abiotic stresses such as water limitations pedroso et al 2014 the ability to cope with water stress in grafted sweet cherry plants depends on the integration of the communication mechanisms between the scion and the rootstock serra et al 2014 species within the prunus genus have been widely distributed throughout the world gonçalves et al 2021 and exhibit a variety of physiological strategies when confronting water deficit making it possible to identify and select genotypes with high tolerance to water limitation jiménez et al 2013 opazo et al 2020 water deficit leads to a decrease in plant water content and turgor and consequently causes a decrease in cellular expansion and alters various vital physiological biochemical and molecular processes shakeel et al 2011 under water deficit the most critical response is the decline in stomata conductance because of its negative effect on photosynthesis stomatal closure decrease the availability of co2 at the carboxylation sites reducing both shoot and root growth and ultimately affecting productivity lovisolo et al 2010 mashilo et al 2017 a study previously reported a strong reduction in gas exchange in grafted prunus induced by water shortage but also found a high water use efficiency wue associated with the most vigorous rootstocks jiménez et al 2013 the importance of the rootstock how grafted plants tolerate a water deficit has been reported for several species opazo et al 2020 silva et al 2021 wright et al 2019 and the influence of rootstocks on the hydraulic strategies are key focal points in the response to water limitations contrasting information has been reported on hydraulic strategies that would define water deficit tolerance among species gambetta et al 2020 classically plants have been classified on the iso to anisohydric trait continuum according to their stomatal behavior as the water deficit increases martínez vilalta et al 2014 there are at least three metrics to evaluate hydraulic strategies according the stomatal control of water loss based on the plant water potential during water deficit i the slope σ of the relationship between pre dawn ψpre dawn and ψmidday martínez vilalta et al 2014 ii the region bounded by ψpre dawn ψmidday regression and 1 1 line namely the hydroscape area li et al 2019 and iii the relationship between stomatal conductance gs and ψmidday carminati and javaux 2020 the use of different metrics could provide a wide perspective of the response of different species cultivars and even between rootstock and scion to water deficit conditions for instance species with stringent stomatal control and a small hydroscape area tend to be more vulnerable to embolism and less likely to protect stem hydraulic integrity li et al 2019 recently this metric has been used to distinguish stomatal behavior among almond cultivars álvarez maldini et al 2021 from the agronomic point of view sade et al 2012 under minimal or moderate water deficit a near anisohydric behavior may have a productive advantage over the more isohydric behavior by keeping the stomata open at lower water potentials pou et al 2012 in trees it is often observed that isohydric species are not necessarily limited by carbon starvation compared to anisohydric species during extreme water deficit because of higher carbon reserves garcia forner et al 2017 plant productivity under water limitations depends on the sensitivity of the plant and its stomatal responsiveness to water deficit early stomatal closure caused by water depletion is useful in conserving water conservative strategy but inconvenient for co2 assimilation forcing the plant to rely on stored carbohydrates mainly in woody species hartmann et al 2021 moshelion 2020 on the other hand in late stomatal closure plants the sugar production is maintained by keeping stomata open longer during water deficit productive strategy with the risk of hydraulic failure hartmann et al 2021 moshelion 2020 sade et al 2012 zacarias rafael et al 2020 delayed or early stomatal closure productive or conservative strategies respectively can be considered one of the most important traits in maintaining the productivity of plants under water limitation there is evidence that under water deficit the tolerant prunus rootstock induces a late decline in transpiration and an increased wue affecting the biomass accumulation less than in water deficit sensitive rootstocks opazo et al 2020 recently it has been reported that the first cause of stomatal closure is associated with hydraulic restrictions in roots rather than other factors related to cavitation carminati and javaux 2020 rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 root hydraulic conductance is sensitive to water limitations likely controlling the whole plant hydraulic conductance rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 as well as the plant vigor gonçalves et al 2007 jiménez et al 2013 evidence suggests that the differences in number size or frequency of the xylem vessels between prunus rootstocks and scion could strongly impact on the root hydraulic conductance olmstead et al 2006b peschiutta et al 2013 furthermore root hydraulic conductance can substantially affect the gas exchange rodríguez gamir et al 2016 although root hydraulic conductance is poorly correlated with a direct effect on the wue under water deficit wue refers to the relationship between carbon gain and its associated cost in water medrano et al 2018 in prunus the carbon gain is mainly related to the formation of two types of sugars sorbitol and sucrose lo bianco et al 2000 the dynamic accumulation and role of sorbitol and sucrose in leaves and roots is considerably affected by water deficit noiraud et al 2001 sorbitol is one of the main sugar alcohols that has a key role in osmotic adjustment jiménez et al 2013 lo bianco et al 2000 ranney et al 1991 in fact most vigorous prunus rootstock under water deficit had a high wue which was explained by the osmotic adjustment due to high accumulation of sorbitol in the leaves jiménez et al 2013 a similar result was reported for grapevine where osmotic adjustment promoted the maintenance of open stomata at lower water potential pou et al 2012 on the other hand the role of sucrose in plant responses to water deficit is related to maintaining the energy level in growing tissues for instance preserving root respiration to sustain root growth and then water uptake capacity silva et al 2021 chile ranks fourth among the countries with the largest production and second with highest exportation of sweet cherries around the world gonçalves et al 2021 the main sweet cherry producing regions are located in central chile areas which is currently suffering severe water scarcity which is predicted to worsen in the near future garreaud et al 2020 therefore the development and assessment of new sweet cherry rootstocks adapted to local climate conditions is urgent as is the physiological characterization of different rootstock scion combinations to better understand the effects of water stress in grafted plants here we hypothesized that in grafted sweet cherry plants the stomatal regulation is controlled by the rootstock through root hydraulic conductivity in turn affecting water uptake capacity and wue we aimed to determine the influence of rootstocks on whole plant performance under water deficit through hydraulic sensitivity root hydraulic conductivity and water use efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions the experiment was conducted in the summer season using 2 years old rootstocks scion combinations of sweet cherry in vegetative stage two genotypes of prunus avium l were used as scion bing black republican x op and lapins van x stella fernandez i marti et al 2012 selected on the based on the commercial relevance in chile the scions were grafted onto two vigorous commercial genotypes of prunus rootstocks colt prunus avium l l p pseudocerasus lindl and maxma 60 mx60 prunus mahaleb x p avium generating the following combinations bing colt lapins colt bing mx60 lapins mx60 and self rooted colt and mx60 for descriptive convenience we will refer also self rooted as plants or rootstock scion combination the rootstock scion combinations generated in this study correspond to those most used in sweet cherry fields in central zone of chile agv 2022 plants were potted in 20 l container filled with a substrate mixture of 1 1 perlite peat supplemented with basacote plus 9 m 16 8 12 basf limburgerhof germany at 6 g l 1 slow release fertilizer before the experiment began all plants were maintained during 30 days for acclimation under greenhouse conditions with polycarbonate panels and watered daily during the experiment the night day temperature was 17 30 ºc and the relative humidity fluctuated between 40 and 50 and with a photoperiod of 16 8 day night and a maximum light intensity of 1000 55 μmol par m 2 s 1 on the top of the plants at midday 2 2 treatments of water availability after acclimation the rootstock scion combinations were grown under two water availability conditions well watered ww and water deficit wd one day before starting the substrate dry down all pots both ww and wd conditions were saturated with water and left to drain overnight to constant weight in the next morning the pots were covered with a black plastic film to avoid the water evaporation from the substrate after the weight of each pot at maximum substrate water holding capacity the field capacity fc was determined each pot was weighted daily pwd at the same time each morning to calculate the water to be added to setting ww condition five plants of each rootstock scion combination were daily weighted and manually irrigated when the water content of the substrate is less than 80 of the fc keeping the water content in each pot as constant as possible close to 75 85 of the fc the amount of water to add under ww condition was calculated as follows fc pwd fc 0 8 fc to setting the wd condition to five plants of each combination the substrate was allowed to gradually dry down hand watering an 80 of the water transpired on the previous day this allows to avoid a drastic physiological impact due to water deficit the progressive water deficit was maintained for 36 days until the plants reached the permanent wilting point 2 3 normalized transpiration rate and fraction of transpirable soil water threshold all pots were weighed daily in the evening and the daily transpiration rate dtr was calculated as the difference in weight of each pot on successive days at the end of the experiment the total transpirable substrate water ttsw to each pot was calculated as the difference between the initial weight iw and final weight fw the fw of pots was established near to permanent wilting point of each plant the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw was calculated by equation proposed by sinclair and ludlow 1986 as follows ftsw dw fw ttsw where dw correspond to daily weight of each pot the plant transpiration under wd and ww conditions were used to calculate the transpiration rate tr by the equation as follows tr dtr dtr a where dtra is the mean of dtr of the five pots under ww conditions to each plant combination to normalize the tr ntr and centred around 1 0 since plants under water deficit may vary the size the dtr of each plant was divided by the mean dtr of four days while the plants were under ww condition sinclair and ludlow 1986 the fraction of transpirable soil water threshold ftswthreshold was calculated at the point when the ntr began to decline in an 80 2 4 plant growth at the beginning of the experiment one plant per each rootstock scion combination under each water availability condition were taken from an extra batch of plants at the end of the experiment one plant per each rootstock scion combination under each water availability condition from the same batch of plants of the experiment were carefully extracted from substrate mixture and roots were gently cleaned and separated from shoot plant root and shoot dry biomass was determined after drying in an oven at 70 c for 72 h 2 5 stomatal conductance and leaf water potential stomatal conductance gs was measured in one fully expanded and photosynthetically active leaf per each rootstock scion combination under each water availability condition by using a ciras 2 portable irga photosynthesis system ppsystem hitchin uk with a controlled environment ciras plc cuvette broad windows 2 5 cm2 the co2 concentration inside the cuvette was adjusted to 400 µmol mol 1 air temperature and relative humidity inside the chamber were recorder ranging 30 35 ºc and 35 45 respectively gs was measured from 10 00 13 30 h on clear days leaf water potential was measured in pre dawn ψpre dawn before sunrise 4 30 6 30 h and midday ψmidday nearby to solar noon 12 30 14 30 h on fully sun exposed leaves different of stomatal condition per each rootstock scion combination under each water availability condition using a schölander pressure chamber pms instrument company corvallis or usa each leaf was carefully cut and quickly placed inside the schölander chamber with the petiole protruding from the lid and the xylem sap emerging from the cut end was observed with an amplifier glass the daily variation of leaf water potential was calculated by ψpre dawn ψmidday klein 2014 to know the stomatal sensitivity of the different rootstock scion combinations to water deficit the relationship between ψpre dawn and ψmidday was performed according to fu and meinzer 2019 the slope of the entire trajectory of the linear regression σ between ψpre dawn and ψmidday was used to know the relative sensitivity of the transpiration rate and hydraulic conductance then the plant behavior to water deficit was determined as follow σ 1 as partial isohydric σ 1 as strict anisohydric and σ 1 as extreme anisohydric to calculate the hydroscape area ha the stomatal regulation of ψmidday prior to complete stomatal closure ψpre dawn ψmidday was considered then the ha was calculated according to fu and meinzer 2019 as follows ha α 2 2 1 β where α is the estimate ψmidday when ψpre dawn 0 and β correspond to the slope of the linear regression between α and the point where ψpre dawn ψmidday in order to analyze the relationship between gs and ψmidday we performed a logistic function gs ψmidday according to klein 2014 and guyot et al 2012 as follow g s g s max 1 ψ midday ψ gs 50 s where gs max is the maximum gs reached ψmidday is the midday leaf water potential ψgs50 is the midday leaf water potential when gs decline in a 50 respect to gs max and s correspond to the rate of gs declining as a function to ψmidday 2 6 root hydraulic conductivity the root hydraulic conductance in intact root system was determined at the end of the experiment using a high pressure flow meter hpfm dynamax usa as described by tyree et al 1995 briefly the method consists of measuring the water flow of whole root system applying different pressure levels before measurements five whole and intact root systems of each rootstock scion combination per water availability condition were separated from the aerial part by cutting the stem about 10 cm above the substrate surface the hpfm was connected to each whole root system by pressure couplings and setting as transient mode tyree et al 1995 the pressure applied into the root system was increased 5 kpa s 1 and both pressure and flow were recorded every 2 s the root hydraulic conductance was calculated as the slope of the curve between pressure and flow applied root hydraulic conductivity lp was determined dividing root hydraulic conductance by total root dry biomass and expressed as mmol h2o s 1 mpa 1 g 1 dw 2 7 whole plant water use efficiency five whole plants of each combination and treatment were harvested at the start and the end of the experiment to quantify the initial dwi and final dwf dry biomass of the whole plant the total water consumed during the experiment was calculated as the sum of the daily water consumption the whole plant water use efficiency wue was determined according to tomás et al 2012 as follows wue dw f dw i total water consumed 2 8 determination of sorbitol and sucrose concentration at the end of the experiment one gram of leaf and root tissue were collected from per rootstock scion combination under each water availability condition after gas exchange measurement the complete procedure to take samples and sugar analysis were performed according to pastenes et al 2014 briefly samples were carefully cut from the petiole and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 ºc until the analysis both tissues were ground with liquid nitrogen to a fine powder for soluble solids 0 5 1 g were transferred to tubes containing 10 ml of milli q water and incubated at 60 ºc for 30 min the extracts were clarified by centrifugation for at 4000 g and 4 ºc by 10 min 600 µl of supernatant were mixed with 600 µl of acetonitrile centrifuged for at 12000 g and 4 ºc by 10 min and filtered through a 0 22 mm membrane the sugars sorbitol and sucrose were analyzed using an agilent 1200 series hplc system finally 20 µl of each sample were injected the sugars were detected by a refractive index detector with the reference cell maintained at 45 ºc a zorbax carbohydrate column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 µm was used with a zorbax nh2 guard column cartridge 4 6 mm 12 5 mm 5 µm the column was kept at 35 c the samples were separated with acetonitrile water 75 25 and a flow rate of 1 5 ml min 1 sorbitol and sucrose were detected for their retention time and quantifications were performed using the external standard method with commercial standards sigma chemical co sorbitol and sucrose concentration were expressed in mg g 1 fw 2 9 experimental design and statistical analysis the experiment was performed using a completely randomized design with five replications six levels of rootstock scion combinations were used bing colt lapins colt bing mx60 lapins mx60 colt and mx60 and two levels of water availability well watered ww and water deficit wd a two way analysis of variance anova was conducted on the influence of two independent factors rootstock scion combinations water availability on all parameters and tukey s range multiple comparison test was performed when differences were identified the r software was used for statistical analysis and graphics team 2013 all data from linear or non linear regression were analyzed and performed using r software team 2013 3 results 3 1 plant transpiration and growth responses to water deficit fig 1 shows the response of the transpiration rate of each rootstock scion combination to water reductions at the root level the ntr of the rootstock scion combinations started declining at ftsw values with ftswthreshold ranging between 0 58 and 0 27 fig 1 two groups of behaviors were identified in the different rootstock scion combinations which exhibit a contrasting ntr response to ftsw the first group is represented by combinations with early reduction of ntr as the ftsw decreases thus with higher values of ftswthreshold such as bing colt bing mx60 and mx60 0 58 0 46 and 0 43 respectively fig 1a d and f by contrast the second group is represented by combinations with a late reduction of ntr as the ftsw decreases i e low ftswthreshhold values as in lapins colt colt and lapins mx60 0 37 0 34 and 0 27 respectively fig 1b c and e the impact of wd on shoot root and plant biomass on the rootstock scion combinations is shown in fig 2 under ww condition the shoot biomass weight was similar in all rootstock scion combinations but wd negatively affected the shoot biomass of bing colt decreasing between 50 and 75 and bing mx60 lapins mx60 and mx60 with reductions of nearly 50 fig 2a by contrast both lapins colt and colt were less affected by wd reducing the shoot biomass in around 25 fig 2a under ww condition there were no difference between the rootstocks scion combinations fig 2b however the wd negatively affected the root biomass accumulation of bing mx60 lapins mx60 and mx60 in 25 and to bing colt in a 50 while that of lapins colt and colt were not affected by wd fig 2b under wd condition the most affected combinations in plant biomass were those using mx60 as rootstock and the bing colt combination while the best performance was observed in lapins colt and colt which maintained the plant biomass productivity similar to the ww condition fig 2c 3 2 response of stomatal conductance to changes in leaf water potential to determine the different behaviors to water deficit the response of gs to the changes in the ψmidday was studied in the different rootstock scion combinations fig 3 shows a strong logistic relationship between ψmidday and gs of the rootstock scion combinations the gs max values fig 3 table 1 ranged between 0 521 and 0 369 where lapins colt and bing mx60 reached the highest gs max and colt the lowest colt rootstock induced higher ψgs50 values nearly 1 28 mpa on average fig 3a table 1 while scions using mx60 reached lower ψgs50 values 1 70 mpa on average fig 3b table 1 the rate of gs reduction to ψmidday decline is shown as the slope of the linear portion of the logistic regression s and no differences were found among the rootstock scion combinations table 1 3 3 sensitivity to water deficit of rootstock scion combinations the ψmidday vs ψpre dawn relationship of the different rootstock scion combinations showed a clear variability in plant sensitivity to water deficit fig 4 bing colt and lapins mx60 had the highest sensitivity of the transpiration rate and hydraulic conductance σ to the decrease in water availability behaving as partially isohydric with σ values of 0 73 and 0 75 respectively fig 4a table 2 lapins colt colt and bing mx60 showed a behavior close to strict anisohydric with σ of 0 99 0 98 and 0 93 respectively fig 4a table 2 while mx60 showed a lower plant sensitivity to wd indicating an extreme anisohydric behavior with a σ values of 1 23 fig 4a table 2 the hydroscape area ha showed a wide variability ranging from 0 9 to 5 2 mpa2 among rootstock scion combinations fig 4b colt and mx60 rootstocks showed no significant differences in the ha averaging 3 4 mpa2 fig 4b and table 2 mx60 rootstock induced similar ha for bing mx60 and lapins mx60 with 2 5 and 2 2 mpa2 of ha respectively fig 4b and table 2 on the other hand colt rootstock induced a higher ha in lapins colt but not in bing colt fig 4b and table 2 lapins colt showed the largest p 0 001 ha of the rootstock scion combinations which was 108 and 130 higher than bing mx60 and lapins mx60 respectively and 5 fold higher than bing colt p 0 05 fig 4b and table 2 3 4 relationship between root hydraulic conductivity on the daily variation of leaf water potential and whole plant water use efficiency the positive exponential relationship between lp and the variation of ψpre dawn ψmidday showed differences among rootstock scion combinations fig 5a after 36 days of experiment sensitivity to wd condition that determined a slight variation in ψpre dawn ψmidday could be due to the reduction in lp fig 5a and table 3 lapins colt bing mx60 and mx60 slightly reduced the variation of ψpre dawn ψmidday compared to the reduction in the lp while lapins mx60 and colt experienced a reduction of ψpre dawn ψmidday induced by a drastic reduction in lp moreover bing colt showed an extreme reduction in ψpre dawn ψmidday compared to lp fig 5a and table 3 in the same vein the reduction in lp induced by water deficit affected the whole plant wue fig 5b and table 3 under ww condition high whole plant wue was found in colt with high lp but the variability in lp had no effect on whole plant wue in the other rootstock scion combinations fig 5b and table 3 however we found that the wd condition generated changes in the whole plant wue associated with changes in the lp fig 5b and table 3 we observed that under wd condition colt lapins colt mx60 and bing mx60 reduced on average 35 of lp compared to the ww condition while lapins mx60 and bing colt reduced lp by 60 and 80 compared to the ww condition fig 5b and table 3 3 5 sucrose and sorbitol and content in roots and leaves there was a significant effect of water deficit on the sucrose and sorbitol contents in both the leaves and roots of the different rootstock scion combinations fig 6 shows the relationship between the ww and wd conditions with the sucrose and sorbitol content in leaves and roots at the end of the experiment the wd reduced the sucrose content of the leaves of bing colt bing mx60 and lapins mx60 by 25 compared to the ww condition fig 6a in roots the sucrose content of colt was significantly lower between 50 and 75 followed by lapins colt and bing mx60 almost 50 while lapins mx60 bing colt and mx60 tended to increase compared to the ww condition fig 6b to the leaf sorbitol content a significant increase was found in lapins colt colt and mx60 induced by the wd condition while bing colt and lapins mx60 decreased the sorbitol content by 25 and bing mx60 showed no change fig 6c the sorbitol content in the roots showed significant differences in most combinations however the wd induced a remarkable increase in the sorbitol content of colt and lapins mx60 fig 6d 4 discussion in this study we investigated whether the relationship between rootstock and scion plays a role in the response to water deficit associated with an improved performance of water uptake capacity variability of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential as well as root hydraulic conductivity and whole plant water use efficiency we found that prunus rootstocks with a higher water uptake capacity increased the productivity biomass and water use efficiency g dw l 1 h2o of a specific rootstock scion combination under water deficit then in grafted prunus under water deficit the rootstock greatly affects the scion stomatal regulation controlling the transpiration through hydraulic mechanisms at the root the water movement across the plant depends on the sum of resistances from root to shoot venturas et al 2017 the transpiratory stream may be negatively affected by several environmental conditions but water deficit is one of the most detrimental affecting plant growth and crop yield lovisolo et al 2010 mashilo et al 2017 in grafted crops such as prunus rootstock is key to the regulation of the water uptake capacity as the water deficit increases opazo et al 2020 in general there is a wide variability in the hydric balance of crops in response to water deficit which are in a trade off between carbon gain and the risk of deleterious soil water depletion sade et al 2012 tardieu et al 2018 in prunus some species can take advantage of low soil water content even below a threshold where transpiration is reduced by more than 80 and thus maximize carbon gain opazo et al 2020 2019 in our study we found that rootstocks regulate the plant transpiratory stream in response to a decrease in the ftsw fig 1 our results highlight two contrasting responses in which colt rootstock maintains transpiration as the water deficit increases while mx60 reacts early to low water availability reducing transpiration when ftsw is still close to maximum fig 1 the maintenance of high gs under water deficit sustaining plant growth may be related to a productive strategy by the crops which could result in a better agronomic performance sade et al 2012 by contrast more conservative stomatal response convenient for maintaining the soil water availability adiredjo et al 2018 casadebaig et al 2008 sinclair and muchow 2001 these opposite behaviors found in colt and mx60 rootstocks are transferred partially to scion because colt affects lapins but did not on bing while mx60 transfers the conservative trait both to the lapins and bing scions in grafted citrus santana vieira et al 2016 found that the transfer of behavior from rootstock to variety was linked mainly to hormonal a mechanism determining either the productive or conservative strategies in response to dehydration the strategy for transpiratory regulation that a crop may adopt will directly affect both crop growth and productivity opazo et al 2020 sade et al 2012 our results show that the productivity of rootstock scion combinations under water deficit as whole plant biomass accumulation was partially less reduced with colt as rootstock bing colt but the rootstock scion combinations using mx60 rootstock exhibited a higher reduction of plant growth under water deficit fig 2c in addition the strategy observed in colt was associated with root growth by favoring carbon allocation to this organ fig 2b this could suggest a possible link between the productive strategy and the allocation of resources to the specific respiratory components of growth and ion uptake over the maintenance component although this has not been previously reported for water deficit it has been reported for stresses such as saline and hypoxia del saz et al 2017 toro et al 2018 since the success of sweet cherry crops depends on an optimum water supply orchards are equipped with controlled drip irrigation systems however it is possible to reduce irrigation in sweet cherry orchards without a negative effect on productivity with significant potential water savings in this context the use of rootstock scion combinations with a productive strategy could be more convenient than combinations with conservative responses sade et al 2012 stomatal regulation is the most important mechanism for the control of water losses from leaf to atmosphere buckley 2019 typically two kinds of plant sensitivity have been described to explain the stomata behavior under water deficit near isohydric behavior indicates a narrow range of experienced leaf water potential due to a high gs sensitivity to water deficit while near anisohydric behavior indicates a wider range of leaf water potential resulting from a lower stomatal sensitivity carminati and javaux 2020 hochberg et al 2018 martínez vilalta et al 2014 tardieu et al 2018 stomatal regulation may be affected by environmental conditions leaf or root hormone signaling and hydraulic response or both and even in grafted plants the rootstock could be directly involved in stomatal control hochberg et al 2013 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 peccoux et al 2018 we found that colt rootstock maintained a higher ψgs50 near isohydric behavior than combinations using the mx60 rootstock near anisohydric behavior even with similar gs of 0 230 µmol m 2 s 1 fig 3 this result supports the idea that rootstock could control the stomatal response mainly through hydraulic responses rather than hormonal signaling mainly aba according to peccoux et al 2018 the grapevine rootstock controls the transpiration rate gs and ψmidday of shoot mainly through hydraulic responses rather than through aba signaling and the ψmidday could be purely related to a hydraulic response of the rootstock closely related to the root soil interface carminati and javaux 2020 in fact recent findings introduce the parameter ψgs50 as a support to synthesize belowground interactions between soil drying and stomata regulation because ψgs50 is not only a function of leaf traits but also dependent on the soil root hydraulic condition carminati and javaux 2020 then this would suggest that colt rootstock exhibit mechanisms associated with the root hydraulics which maintain hydraulic safety higher ψmidday despite a reduction in gs down to a 50 of gsmax it should be noted that in order to have a broader perspective and knowledge about plant behavior under water deficit it could be desirable to use several metrics for an accurate analysis martínez vilalta et al 2014 and use caution in comparing the response mechanisms for stomatal control and the concomitant leaf water potential garcia forner et al 2017 plant response to water deficit has commonly been determined as follows σ 1 as partial isohydric σ 1 as strict anisohydric and σ 1 as extreme anisohydric fu and meinzer 2019 we found differences between rootstocks in stomatal behavior through gs ψmidday curves fig 3 but no differences were found in the relationship between ψpre dawn and ψmidday fig 4 in this regard our results on the stomatal sensitivity deducted from the ψmidday to ψpre dawn relationship showed three categories of stomatal regulation partial isohydric σ 1 in bing colt and lapins mx60 strict anisohydric σ 1 in lapins colt colt and bing mx60 and extreme anisohydric σ 1 in mx60 fig 4 and table 2 the differences between may be due in part to the complexity between the stomatal response and leaf water potential since the water potential gradient under low water availability would not be determined directly by stomatal sensitivity but by the sensitivity of the plant hydraulic system as a whole as reported by martínez vilalta et al 2014 these authors also argue that highly stomatal sensitive plants could still show a strict anisohydric behavior provided that their hydraulic transport system is even more sensitive than the stomata to reductions in water availability thus lapins colt and colt and pertinent to lapins mx60 will show a critically high leaf water potential isohydric and low sensitivity of the transpiration rate and plant hydraulic conductance running the risk of hydraulic failure strict anisohydric as the water availability declines by contrast bing colt consistently showed an isohydric behavior σ 1 and was highly and negatively affected by water deficit these criteria for stomatal behavior are consistent with the hydroscape area which according to meinzer et al 2016 integrates more accurate information on the degree of iso or anisohydrism than other metrics in prunus álvarez maldini et al 2021 found that cultivars more tolerant to water deficit showed a large hydroscape area which was related to anisohydric behavior and maintenance of photosynthetic capacity compared to the cultivars with lower hydroscape area our results showed that bing colt has the most stringent stomatal control and small hydroscape area which could explain its lower biomass accumulation due to carbon limitations carbon starvation due to early stomatal closure could explain the low biomass accumulation exhibited by the bing colt combination fig 2 however it has been previously reported that isohydric plants will not necessarily be carbon starved by making use of the reserves present in stems and roots garcia forner et al 2017 root hydraulic conductance is a physiological trait sensitive to water deficit rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 and in most cases it has been reported that hydraulic conductivity loss is closely associated with gain in hydraulic safety gonçalves et al 2007 in addition it has recently been demonstrated that the decrease in root hydraulic conductance and even in the hydraulic of the root soil interface is the primary cause of hydraulic limitation leading to stomatal closure prior to cavitation carminati and javaux 2020 rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 in this regard we found at the end of the experiment that the most conservative combination in water use bing colt loses functionality of the root hydraulic conductivity at lower water potential gradients ψpre dawn ψmidday while more productive combinations do not reduce the root hydraulic conductivity as colt favoring the dynamics of the soil to leaf water potential gradient fig 5a recently rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 reported that in olive plants under moderate water stress ψstem 2 5 mpa at least 95 of the whole plant hydraulic resistance is controlled by root hydraulic resistance i e a radial pathway from the xylem to the soil root interface in this regard one limitation of our study was the lack of continuous measurements of root hydraulic conductance and its correlation with data obtained from root cross sections however our results suggest that the differences found in root hydraulic conductance are associated with specific resistances resulting from differences in the diameter of xylem vessels between rootstock and scion from each combination in our study we found that despite lapins and bing scions being grafted onto the same rootstocks colt or mx60 both expressed differences arguably associated with genetic background for instance the remarkable differences in hydraulic conductivity were exhibited between lapins colt and bing colt under water deficit fig 5 in this regard a study by peschiutta et al 2013 anatomically compared the lapins and bing scions grafted onto p domestica rootstock under well watered condition found genetic differences associated with stem hydraulic traits xylem vessel frequency and diameter the authors showed that lapins scion had lower density and smaller xylem vessels 120 vessels mm 2 and 18 µm respectively compared to the bing scion 190 vessels mm 2 and 21 µm respectively concluding that lapins could be less vulnerable to stem cavitation than bing the higher stem vulnerability to cavitation reported in bing suggests that is mainly affected by the high tension in the xylem caused by the water deficit in the soil while lapins could avoid the embolism in vessels nevertheless it is possible that the differences observed between combinations may also be due to the variations in the anatomical configuration of rootstock xylem vessels olmstead et al 2006a regarding the xylem vessels of rootstocks in general colt has been reported with 35 vessels mm 2 and 40 µm olmstead 2006 olmstead et al 2006a whereas for mx60 we found no information about xylem vessels however if we use maxma14 p mahaleb x p avium as a reference showing similar vigor gonçalves et al 2007 we may assume that mx60 could have around 300 vessels mm 2 and 25 µm gonçalves et al 2007 hajagos and végvári 2013 for a close hydraulic connection between the scion and the rootstock the scion should have smaller xylem vessels than the rootstock olmstead et al 2006a therefore we can hypothesize that the losses in hydraulic functionality of bing colt in water deficit could be associated with large vessels of both bing and colt which could increase the vulnerability of the plant xylem to cavitation peschiutta et al 2013 while the other combinations have a better hydraulic connection either for having fewer and or smaller xylem vessels olmstead et al 2006b the effect of the rootstock on scion vigor through the water relationships related to root hydraulic conductance is well known jones 2012 tombesi et al 2010 despite both colt and mx60 having been classified as vigorous rootstocks csihon et al 2018 olmstead et al 2010 sotirov 2020 we found a slight difference in water use strategy between colt productive and mx60 intermediate which could redefine the classification of vigor according to the strategy colt maintains its vigorous trait due to its high capacity to extract water fig 1 and to maintain lapins colt or increase biomass as in root fig 2 but mx60 maintains a semi vigorous trait through the intermediate capacity of water uptake fig 1 and intermediate growth fig 2 we believe that the vigor of the rootstocks should be rigorously reviewed under the new climate scenarios interestingly we found evidence of a correlation between root hydraulic conductance and whole plant wue revealing that rootstock scion combinations with low root hydraulic conductance exhibited low whole plant wue fig 5b the finding related to whole plant wue suggests that root hydraulic conductivity may not only be controlling the water flow in roots and the plant but also that it can maintain the vigor of the whole plant the whole plant wue referes to the analysis of the balance between two components the biomass accumulation given by new growth and the water consumption during a period of time jiménez et al 2013 found that the most vigorous rootstock induced higher wue concomitant to the accumulation of osmoregulators mainly leaf sorbitol our results show that rootstocks with high whole plant wue under water deficit increased sorbitol content in leaf fig 6c sorbitol is considered the major end product of photosynthesis and the main form of translocated and storage carbon in many fruit tree species of the prunus genus centritto 2005 loescher 1987 it has also been found that sorbitol transport both via xylem and phloem increases under water deficit condition noiraud et al 2001 to perform osmotic adjustment functions in both roots and leaves jiménez et al 2013 lo bianco et al 2000 an early work showed a high capacity to adjust osmolarity of colt rootstock under water deficit mainly associated with accumulation of sorbitol in roots and leaves ranney et al 1991 in colt and lapins colt osmotic adjustments induced by sorbitol accumulation in leaves may contribute to the maintenance of open stomata at lower water potentials by sustaining turgor in response to an imposed water depletion pou et al 2012 thus our results would suggest that the relationship between rootstock and scion should consider an interaction that maximizes water uptake capacity even as water deficit increases since this will favor the mobility of sugars either to increase osmolarity or as a source of energy for growing organs therefore maintaining relatively high non structural sugar levels during water deficit stress and keeping them available i e during the recovery phase may be crucial to tree vigor and survival tomasella et al 2019 as for sucrose lo bianco et al 2000 found no influence in osmotic adjustment in peach plants this could be due to sucrose having energy rather than osmotic functions in our study the increase in sucrose in roots under water deficit suggests that this sugar may support energy mainly for root respiration and the maintenance of root growth as observed in the colt and lapins colt combinations fig 2 although it has been reported that tolerance to water deficit may be associated with low root respiration durand et al 2016 in citrus silva et al 2021 revealed that rootstock with tolerance to water deficit was able to use photoassimilates as an energy source to increase root respiration under water deficit and then to maintain root growth and improve drought tolerance 5 conclusion it is important to consider that rootstocks with a great influence of productive strategy on whole plant performance should be considered an opportunistic risk taker because this behavior characterized by a water uptake capacity under conditions of low water availability is only sustainable under minimal to moderate water stress and in the short term sade et al 2012 in our study we report that the water deficit sensitive combination bing colt exhibited an early reduction in its water uptake capacity higher ftsw values a concomitant lower hydroscape area and a remarkable reduction in its whole plant wue moreover this was the combination most negatively affected in its biomass accumulation conversely combinations with late reductions in their water uptake capacities lower ftsw values or risk taker combinations lapins colt and colt presented a greater hydroscape area with barely affected shoot biomass and even with an increase in biomass at root level under water deficit our study shows that there should not be a strict rule on whether it is the rootstock or scion that controls the behavior of the whole plant rather an integrative view of the physiology of both grafted components should be taken according to the above considerations the choice of which rootstock to take the risk in order to maintain a sustained water uptake capacity from the soil will be fundamental to maintaining high productivity this research highlights the importance of studying the physiological response of grafted plants in order to select better rootstock

8972,sweet cherry is mainly cultivated in arid and semi arid areas in the last decade these areas have experienced a dramatic reduction in rainfall which has resulted in water shortage for sweet

performance under water deficit as detected by hydraulic sensitivity root hydraulic conductivity lp water use efficiency and sugar content four prunus rootstocks scion combinations bing colt lapins colt bing mx60 lapins mx60 and two self rooted rootstocks colt and maxma 60 were acclimated for 30 days and then exposed to well watered ww and water deficit wd conditions for 36 days whole plant transpiration and growth were both influenced by wd and two groups were identified based on responses bing colt bing mx60 and mx60 had an early reduction conservative strategy whereas lapins mx60 lapins colt and colt had late reduction productive strategy in transpiration as wd increased among the combinations lapins colt and colt showed a remarkable growth response to the wd being less

differently sucrose and sorbitol content in leaves and roots of wd tolerant combinations such as colt and lapins colt showed a remarkable increase under wd condition our finding highlights the importance of the specific interaction between rootstock and scion suggesting that combinations characterized by a higher water uptake capacity under conditions of lower water availability would be

introduction water deficit is an adverse component of climate change that threatens the productivity of different ecosystems pareek et al 2020 with the reduction of rainfall and the increase in temperature over the past few decades the magnitude and severity of the drought events have increasingly affected irrigated crops hussain et al 2019 representing one of the major causes of agricultural production loss worldwide campbell et al 2016 lesk et al 2016 in the last 10 years the annual precipitation in central chile has decreased by 55 75 resulting in a period of megadrought garreaud et al 2017 while in arid and semi arid regions an increased water shortage is expected as intensity and frequency of rainfall decrease edenhofer 2015 núñez et al 2011 sweet cherry prunus avium l has become one of the most appealing and economically prolific fruit crops around the world gonçalves et al 2021 in general sweet cherry is grown under controlled and scheduled irrigation systems blanco et al 2018 and water limitation is therefore expected to negatively affect the productivity and yield blanco et al 2020 the use of rootstocks has been widely adopted around the world due to benefits related to resistance to soil diseases and abiotic stresses such as water limitations pedroso et al 2014 the ability to cope with water stress in grafted sweet cherry plants depends on the integration of the communication mechanisms between the scion and the rootstock serra et al 2014 species within the prunus genus have been widely distributed throughout the world gonçalves et al 2021 and exhibit a variety of physiological strategies when confronting water deficit making it possible to identify and select genotypes with high tolerance to water limitation jiménez et al 2013 opazo et al 2020 water deficit leads to a decrease in plant water content and turgor and consequently causes a decrease in cellular expansion and alters various vital physiological biochemical and molecular processes shakeel et al 2011 under water deficit the most critical response is the decline in stomata conductance because of its negative effect on photosynthesis stomatal closure decrease the availability of co2 at the carboxylation sites reducing both shoot and root growth and ultimately affecting productivity lovisolo et al 2010 mashilo et al 2017 a study previously reported a strong reduction in gas exchange in grafted prunus induced by water shortage but also found a high water use efficiency wue associated with the most vigorous rootstocks jiménez et al 2013 the importance of the rootstock how grafted plants tolerate a water deficit has been reported for several species opazo et al 2020 silva et al 2021 wright et al 2019 and the influence of rootstocks on the hydraulic strategies are key focal points in the response to water limitations contrasting information has been reported on hydraulic strategies that would define water deficit tolerance among species gambetta et al 2020 classically plants have been classified on the iso to anisohydric trait continuum according to their stomatal behavior as the water deficit increases martínez vilalta et al 2014 there are at least three metrics to evaluate hydraulic strategies according the stomatal control of water loss based on the plant water potential during water deficit i the slope σ of the relationship between pre dawn ψpre dawn and ψmidday martínez vilalta et al 2014 ii the region bounded by ψpre dawn ψmidday regression and 1 1 line namely the hydroscape area li et al 2019 and iii the relationship between stomatal conductance gs and ψmidday carminati and javaux 2020 the use of different metrics could provide a wide perspective of the response of different species cultivars and even between rootstock and scion to water deficit conditions for instance species with stringent stomatal control and a small hydroscape area tend to be more vulnerable to embolism and less likely to protect stem hydraulic integrity li et al 2019 recently this metric has been used to distinguish stomatal behavior among almond cultivars álvarez maldini et al 2021 from the agronomic point of view sade et al 2012 under minimal or moderate water deficit a near anisohydric behavior may have a productive advantage over the more isohydric behavior by keeping the stomata open at lower water potentials pou et al 2012 in trees it is often observed that isohydric species are not necessarily limited by carbon starvation compared to anisohydric species during extreme water deficit because of higher carbon reserves garcia forner et al 2017 plant productivity under water limitations depends on the sensitivity of the plant and its stomatal responsiveness to water deficit early stomatal closure caused by water depletion is useful in conserving water conservative strategy but inconvenient for co2 assimilation forcing the plant to rely on stored carbohydrates mainly in woody species hartmann et al 2021 moshelion 2020 on the other hand in late stomatal closure plants the sugar production is maintained by keeping stomata open longer during water deficit productive strategy with the risk of hydraulic failure hartmann et al 2021 moshelion 2020 sade et al 2012 zacarias rafael et al 2020 delayed or early stomatal closure productive or conservative strategies respectively can be considered one of the most important traits in maintaining the productivity of plants under water limitation there is evidence that under water deficit the tolerant prunus rootstock induces a late decline in transpiration and an increased wue affecting the biomass accumulation less than in water deficit sensitive rootstocks opazo et al 2020 recently it has been reported that the first cause of stomatal closure is associated with hydraulic restrictions in roots rather than other factors related to cavitation carminati and javaux 2020 rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 root hydraulic conductance is sensitive to water limitations likely controlling the whole plant hydraulic conductance rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 as well as the plant vigor gonçalves et al 2007 jiménez et al 2013 evidence suggests that the differences in number size or frequency of the xylem vessels between prunus rootstocks and scion could strongly impact on the root hydraulic conductance olmstead et al 2006b peschiutta et al 2013 furthermore root hydraulic conductance can substantially affect the gas exchange rodríguez gamir et al 2016 although root hydraulic conductance is poorly correlated with a direct effect on the wue under water deficit wue refers to the relationship between carbon gain and its associated cost in water medrano et al 2018 in prunus the carbon gain is mainly related to the formation of two types of sugars sorbitol and sucrose lo bianco et al 2000 the dynamic accumulation and role of sorbitol and sucrose in leaves and roots is considerably affected by water deficit noiraud et al 2001 sorbitol is one of the main sugar alcohols that has a key role in osmotic adjustment jiménez et al 2013 lo bianco et al 2000 ranney et al 1991 in fact most vigorous prunus rootstock under water deficit had a high wue which was explained by the osmotic adjustment due to high accumulation of sorbitol in the leaves jiménez et al 2013 a similar result was reported for grapevine where osmotic adjustment promoted the maintenance of open stomata at lower water potential pou et al 2012 on the other hand the role of sucrose in plant responses to water deficit is related to maintaining the energy level in growing tissues for instance preserving root respiration to sustain root growth and then water uptake capacity silva et al 2021 chile ranks fourth among the countries with the largest production and second with highest exportation of sweet cherries around the world gonçalves et al 2021 the main sweet cherry producing regions are located in central chile areas which is currently suffering severe water scarcity which is predicted to worsen in the near future garreaud et al 2020 therefore the development and assessment of new sweet cherry rootstocks adapted to local climate conditions is urgent as is the physiological characterization of different rootstock scion combinations to better understand the effects of water stress in grafted plants here we hypothesized that in grafted sweet cherry plants the stomatal regulation is controlled by the rootstock through root hydraulic conductivity in turn affecting water uptake capacity and wue we aimed to determine the influence of rootstocks on whole plant performance under water deficit through hydraulic sensitivity root hydraulic conductivity and water use efficiency 2 materials and methods 2 1 plant material and growth conditions the experiment was conducted in the summer season using 2 years old rootstocks scion combinations of sweet cherry in vegetative stage two genotypes of prunus avium l were used as scion bing black republican x op and lapins van x stella fernandez i marti et al 2012 selected on the based on the commercial relevance in chile the scions were grafted onto two vigorous commercial genotypes of prunus rootstocks colt prunus avium l l p pseudocerasus lindl and maxma 60 mx60 prunus mahaleb x p avium generating the following combinations bing colt lapins colt bing mx60 lapins mx60 and self rooted colt and mx60 for descriptive convenience we will refer also self rooted as plants or rootstock scion combination the rootstock scion combinations generated in this study correspond to those most used in sweet cherry fields in central zone of chile agv 2022 plants were potted in 20 l container filled with a substrate mixture of 1 1 perlite peat supplemented with basacote plus 9 m 16 8 12 basf limburgerhof germany at 6 g l 1 slow release fertilizer before the experiment began all plants were maintained during 30 days for acclimation under greenhouse conditions with polycarbonate panels and watered daily during the experiment the night day temperature was 17 30 ºc and the relative humidity fluctuated between 40 and 50 and with a photoperiod of 16 8 day night and a maximum light intensity of 1000 55 μmol par m 2 s 1 on the top of the plants at midday 2 2 treatments of water availability after acclimation the rootstock scion combinations were grown under two water availability conditions well watered ww and water deficit wd one day before starting the substrate dry down all pots both ww and wd conditions were saturated with water and left to drain overnight to constant weight in the next morning the pots were covered with a black plastic film to avoid the water evaporation from the substrate after the weight of each pot at maximum substrate water holding capacity the field capacity fc was determined each pot was weighted daily pwd at the same time each morning to calculate the water to be added to setting ww condition five plants of each rootstock scion combination were daily weighted and manually irrigated when the water content of the substrate is less than 80 of the fc keeping the water content in each pot as constant as possible close to 75 85 of the fc the amount of water to add under ww condition was calculated as follows fc pwd fc 0 8 fc to setting the wd condition to five plants of each combination the substrate was allowed to gradually dry down hand watering an 80 of the water transpired on the previous day this allows to avoid a drastic physiological impact due to water deficit the progressive water deficit was maintained for 36 days until the plants reached the permanent wilting point 2 3 normalized transpiration rate and fraction of transpirable soil water threshold all pots were weighed daily in the evening and the daily transpiration rate dtr was calculated as the difference in weight of each pot on successive days at the end of the experiment the total transpirable substrate water ttsw to each pot was calculated as the difference between the initial weight iw and final weight fw the fw of pots was established near to permanent wilting point of each plant the fraction of transpirable soil water ftsw was calculated by equation proposed by sinclair and ludlow 1986 as follows ftsw dw fw ttsw where dw correspond to daily weight of each pot the plant transpiration under wd and ww conditions were used to calculate the transpiration rate tr by the equation as follows tr dtr dtr a where dtra is the mean of dtr of the five pots under ww conditions to each plant combination to normalize the tr ntr and centred around 1 0 since plants under water deficit may vary the size the dtr of each plant was divided by the mean dtr of four days while the plants were under ww condition sinclair and ludlow 1986 the fraction of transpirable soil water threshold ftswthreshold was calculated at the point when the ntr began to decline in an 80 2 4 plant growth at the beginning of the experiment one plant per each rootstock scion combination under each water availability condition were taken from an extra batch of plants at the end of the experiment one plant per each rootstock scion combination under each water availability condition from the same batch of plants of the experiment were carefully extracted from substrate mixture and roots were gently cleaned and separated from shoot plant root and shoot dry biomass was determined after drying in an oven at 70 c for 72 h 2 5 stomatal conductance and leaf water potential stomatal conductance gs was measured in one fully expanded and photosynthetically active leaf per each rootstock scion combination under each water availability condition by using a ciras 2 portable irga photosynthesis system ppsystem hitchin uk with a controlled environment ciras plc cuvette broad windows 2 5 cm2 the co2 concentration inside the cuvette was adjusted to 400 µmol mol 1 air temperature and relative humidity inside the chamber were recorder ranging 30 35 ºc and 35 45 respectively gs was measured from 10 00 13 30 h on clear days leaf water potential was measured in pre dawn ψpre dawn before sunrise 4 30 6 30 h and midday ψmidday nearby to solar noon 12 30 14 30 h on fully sun exposed leaves different of stomatal condition per each rootstock scion combination under each water availability condition using a schölander pressure chamber pms instrument company corvallis or usa each leaf was carefully cut and quickly placed inside the schölander chamber with the petiole protruding from the lid and the xylem sap emerging from the cut end was observed with an amplifier glass the daily variation of leaf water potential was calculated by ψpre dawn ψmidday klein 2014 to know the stomatal sensitivity of the different rootstock scion combinations to water deficit the relationship between ψpre dawn and ψmidday was performed according to fu and meinzer 2019 the slope of the entire trajectory of the linear regression σ between ψpre dawn and ψmidday was used to know the relative sensitivity of the transpiration rate and hydraulic conductance then the plant behavior to water deficit was determined as follow σ 1 as partial isohydric σ 1 as strict anisohydric and σ 1 as extreme anisohydric to calculate the hydroscape area ha the stomatal regulation of ψmidday prior to complete stomatal closure ψpre dawn ψmidday was considered then the ha was calculated according to fu and meinzer 2019 as follows ha α 2 2 1 β where α is the estimate ψmidday when ψpre dawn 0 and β correspond to the slope of the linear regression between α and the point where ψpre dawn ψmidday in order to analyze the relationship between gs and ψmidday we performed a logistic function gs ψmidday according to klein 2014 and guyot et al 2012 as follow g s g s max 1 ψ midday ψ gs 50 s where gs max is the maximum gs reached ψmidday is the midday leaf water potential ψgs50 is the midday leaf water potential when gs decline in a 50 respect to gs max and s correspond to the rate of gs declining as a function to ψmidday 2 6 root hydraulic conductivity the root hydraulic conductance in intact root system was determined at the end of the experiment using a high pressure flow meter hpfm dynamax usa as described by tyree et al 1995 briefly the method consists of measuring the water flow of whole root system applying different pressure levels before measurements five whole and intact root systems of each rootstock scion combination per water availability condition were separated from the aerial part by cutting the stem about 10 cm above the substrate surface the hpfm was connected to each whole root system by pressure couplings and setting as transient mode tyree et al 1995 the pressure applied into the root system was increased 5 kpa s 1 and both pressure and flow were recorded every 2 s the root hydraulic conductance was calculated as the slope of the curve between pressure and flow applied root hydraulic conductivity lp was determined dividing root hydraulic conductance by total root dry biomass and expressed as mmol h2o s 1 mpa 1 g 1 dw 2 7 whole plant water use efficiency five whole plants of each combination and treatment were harvested at the start and the end of the experiment to quantify the initial dwi and final dwf dry biomass of the whole plant the total water consumed during the experiment was calculated as the sum of the daily water consumption the whole plant water use efficiency wue was determined according to tomás et al 2012 as follows wue dw f dw i total water consumed 2 8 determination of sorbitol and sucrose concentration at the end of the experiment one gram of leaf and root tissue were collected from per rootstock scion combination under each water availability condition after gas exchange measurement the complete procedure to take samples and sugar analysis were performed according to pastenes et al 2014 briefly samples were carefully cut from the petiole and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 ºc until the analysis both tissues were ground with liquid nitrogen to a fine powder for soluble solids 0 5 1 g were transferred to tubes containing 10 ml of milli q water and incubated at 60 ºc for 30 min the extracts were clarified by centrifugation for at 4000 g and 4 ºc by 10 min 600 µl of supernatant were mixed with 600 µl of acetonitrile centrifuged for at 12000 g and 4 ºc by 10 min and filtered through a 0 22 mm membrane the sugars sorbitol and sucrose were analyzed using an agilent 1200 series hplc system finally 20 µl of each sample were injected the sugars were detected by a refractive index detector with the reference cell maintained at 45 ºc a zorbax carbohydrate column 4 6 mm 150 mm 5 µm was used with a zorbax nh2 guard column cartridge 4 6 mm 12 5 mm 5 µm the column was kept at 35 c the samples were separated with acetonitrile water 75 25 and a flow rate of 1 5 ml min 1 sorbitol and sucrose were detected for their retention time and quantifications were performed using the external standard method with commercial standards sigma chemical co sorbitol and sucrose concentration were expressed in mg g 1 fw 2 9 experimental design and statistical analysis the experiment was performed using a completely randomized design with five replications six levels of rootstock scion combinations were used bing colt lapins colt bing mx60 lapins mx60 colt and mx60 and two levels of

on all parameters and tukey s range multiple comparison test was performed when differences were identified the r software was used for statistical analysis and graphics team 2013 all data from linear or non linear regression were analyzed and performed using r software team 2013 3 results 3 1 plant transpiration and growth responses to water deficit fig 1 shows the response of the transpiration rate of each rootstock scion combination to water reductions at the root level the ntr of the rootstock scion combinations started declining at ftsw values with ftswthreshold ranging between 0 58 and 0 27 fig 1 two groups of behaviors were identified in the different rootstock scion combinations which exhibit a contrasting ntr response to ftsw the first group is represented by combinations with early reduction of ntr as the ftsw decreases thus with higher values of ftswthreshold such as bing colt bing mx60 and mx60 0 58 0 46 and 0 43 respectively fig 1a d and f by contrast the second group is represented by combinations with a late reduction of ntr as the ftsw decreases i e low ftswthreshhold values as in lapins colt colt and lapins mx60 0 37 0 34 and 0 27 respectively fig 1b c and e the impact of wd on shoot root and plant biomass on the rootstock scion combinations is shown in fig 2 under ww condition the shoot biomass weight was similar in all rootstock scion combinations but wd negatively affected the shoot biomass of bing colt decreasing between 50 and 75 and bing mx60 lapins mx60 and mx60 with reductions of nearly 50 fig 2a by contrast both lapins colt and colt were less affected by wd reducing the shoot biomass in around 25 fig 2a under ww condition there were no difference between the rootstocks scion combinations fig 2b however the wd negatively affected the root biomass accumulation of bing mx60 lapins mx60 and mx60 in 25 and to bing colt in a 50 while that of lapins colt and colt were not affected by wd fig 2b under wd condition the most affected combinations in plant biomass were those using mx60 as rootstock and the bing colt combination while the best performance was observed in lapins colt and colt which maintained the plant biomass productivity similar to the ww condition fig 2c 3 2 response of stomatal conductance to changes in leaf water potential to determine the different behaviors to water deficit the response of gs to the changes in the ψmidday was studied in the different rootstock scion combinations fig 3 shows a strong logistic relationship between ψmidday and gs of the rootstock scion combinations the gs max values fig 3 table 1 ranged between 0 521 and 0 369 where lapins colt and bing mx60 reached the highest gs max and colt the lowest colt rootstock induced higher ψgs50 values nearly 1 28 mpa on average fig 3a table 1 while scions using mx60 reached lower ψgs50 values 1 70 mpa on average fig 3b table 1 the rate of gs reduction to ψmidday decline is shown as the slope of the linear portion of the logistic regression s and no differences were found among the rootstock scion combinations table 1 3 3 sensitivity to water deficit of rootstock scion combinations the ψmidday vs ψpre dawn relationship of the different rootstock scion combinations showed a clear variability in plant sensitivity to water deficit fig 4 bing colt and lapins mx60 had the highest sensitivity of the transpiration rate and hydraulic conductance σ to the decrease in water availability behaving as partially isohydric with σ values of 0 73 and 0 75 respectively fig 4a table 2 lapins colt colt and bing mx60 showed a behavior close to strict anisohydric with σ of 0 99 0 98 and 0 93 respectively fig 4a table 2 while mx60 showed a lower plant sensitivity to wd indicating an extreme anisohydric behavior with a σ values of 1 23 fig 4a table 2 the hydroscape area ha showed a wide variability ranging from 0 9 to 5 2 mpa2 among rootstock scion combinations fig 4b colt and mx60 rootstocks showed no significant differences in the ha averaging 3 4 mpa2 fig 4b and table 2 mx60 rootstock induced similar ha for bing mx60 and lapins mx60 with 2 5 and 2 2 mpa2 of ha respectively fig 4b and table 2 on the other hand colt rootstock induced a higher ha in lapins colt but not in bing colt fig 4b and table 2 lapins colt showed the largest p 0 001 ha of the rootstock scion combinations which was 108 and 130 higher than bing mx60 and lapins mx60 respectively and 5 fold higher than bing colt p 0 05 fig 4b and table 2 3 4 relationship between root hydraulic conductivity on the daily variation of leaf water potential and whole plant water use efficiency the positive exponential relationship between lp and the variation of ψpre dawn ψmidday showed differences among rootstock scion combinations fig 5a after 36 days of experiment sensitivity to wd condition that determined a slight variation in ψpre dawn ψmidday could be due to the reduction in lp fig 5a and table 3 lapins colt bing mx60 and mx60 slightly reduced the variation of ψpre dawn ψmidday compared to the reduction in the lp while lapins mx60 and colt experienced a reduction of ψpre dawn ψmidday induced by a drastic reduction in lp moreover bing colt showed an extreme reduction in ψpre dawn ψmidday compared to lp fig 5a and table 3 in the same vein the reduction in lp induced by water deficit affected the whole plant wue fig 5b and table 3 under ww condition high whole plant wue was found in colt with high lp but the variability in lp had no effect on whole plant wue in the other rootstock scion combinations fig 5b and table 3 however we found that the wd condition generated changes in the whole plant wue associated with changes in the lp fig 5b and table 3 we observed that under wd condition colt lapins colt mx60 and bing mx60 reduced on average 35 of lp compared to the ww condition while lapins mx60 and bing colt reduced lp by 60 and 80 compared to the ww condition fig 5b and table 3 3 5 sucrose and sorbitol and content in roots and leaves there was a significant effect of water deficit on the sucrose and sorbitol contents in both the leaves and roots of the different rootstock scion combinations fig 6 shows the relationship between the ww and wd conditions with the sucrose and sorbitol content in leaves and roots at the end of the experiment the wd reduced the sucrose content of the leaves of bing colt bing mx60 and lapins mx60 by 25 compared to the ww condition fig 6a in roots the sucrose content of colt was significantly lower between 50 and 75 followed by lapins colt and bing mx60 almost 50 while lapins mx60 bing colt and mx60 tended to increase compared to the ww condition fig 6b to the leaf sorbitol content a significant increase was found in lapins colt colt and mx60 induced by the wd condition while bing colt and lapins mx60 decreased the sorbitol content by 25 and bing mx60 showed no change fig 6c the sorbitol content in the roots showed significant differences in most combinations however the wd induced a remarkable increase in the sorbitol content of colt and lapins mx60 fig 6d 4 discussion in this study we investigated whether the relationship between rootstock and scion plays a role in the response to water deficit associated with an improved performance of water uptake capacity variability of stomatal conductance and leaf water potential as well as root hydraulic conductivity and whole plant water use efficiency we found that prunus rootstocks with a higher water uptake capacity increased the productivity biomass and water use efficiency g dw l 1 h2o of a specific rootstock scion combination under water deficit then in grafted prunus under water deficit the rootstock greatly affects the scion stomatal regulation controlling the transpiration through hydraulic mechanisms at the root the water movement across the plant depends on the sum of resistances from root to shoot venturas et al 2017 the transpiratory stream may be negatively affected by several environmental conditions but water deficit is one of the most detrimental affecting plant growth and crop yield lovisolo et al 2010 mashilo et al 2017 in grafted crops such as prunus rootstock is key to the regulation of the water uptake capacity as the water deficit increases opazo et al 2020 in general there is a wide variability in the hydric balance of crops in response to water deficit which are in a trade off between carbon gain and the risk of deleterious soil water depletion sade et al 2012 tardieu et al 2018 in prunus some species can take advantage of low soil water content even below a threshold where transpiration is reduced by more than 80 and thus maximize carbon gain opazo et al 2020 2019 in our study we found that rootstocks regulate the plant transpiratory stream in response to a decrease in the ftsw fig 1 our results highlight two contrasting responses in which colt rootstock maintains transpiration as the water deficit increases while mx60 reacts early to low water availability reducing transpiration when ftsw is still close to maximum fig 1 the maintenance of high gs under water deficit sustaining plant growth may be related to a productive strategy by the crops which could result in a better agronomic performance sade et al 2012 by contrast more conservative stomatal response convenient for maintaining the soil water availability adiredjo et al 2018 casadebaig et al 2008 sinclair and muchow 2001 these opposite behaviors found in colt and mx60 rootstocks are transferred partially to scion because colt affects lapins but did not on bing while mx60 transfers the conservative trait both to the lapins and bing scions in grafted citrus santana vieira et al 2016 found that the transfer of behavior from rootstock to variety was linked mainly to hormonal a mechanism determining either the productive or conservative strategies in response to dehydration the strategy for transpiratory regulation that a crop may adopt will directly affect both crop growth and productivity opazo et al 2020 sade et al 2012 our results show that the productivity of rootstock scion combinations under water deficit as whole plant biomass accumulation was partially less reduced with colt as rootstock bing colt but the rootstock scion combinations using mx60 rootstock exhibited a higher reduction of plant growth under water deficit fig 2c in addition the strategy observed in colt was associated with root growth by favoring carbon allocation to this organ fig 2b this could suggest a possible link between the productive strategy and the allocation of resources to the specific respiratory components of growth and ion uptake over the maintenance component although this has not been previously reported for water deficit it has been reported for stresses such as saline and hypoxia del saz et al 2017 toro et al 2018 since the success of sweet cherry crops depends on an optimum water supply orchards are equipped with controlled drip irrigation systems however it is possible to reduce irrigation in sweet cherry orchards without a negative effect on productivity with significant potential water savings in this context the use of rootstock scion combinations with a productive strategy could be more convenient than combinations with conservative responses sade et al 2012 stomatal regulation is the most important mechanism for the control of water losses from leaf to atmosphere buckley 2019 typically two kinds of plant sensitivity have been described to explain the stomata behavior under water deficit near isohydric behavior indicates a narrow range of experienced leaf water potential due to a high gs sensitivity to water deficit while near anisohydric behavior indicates a wider range of leaf water potential resulting from a lower stomatal sensitivity carminati and javaux 2020 hochberg et al 2018 martínez vilalta et al 2014 tardieu et al 2018 stomatal regulation may be affected by environmental conditions leaf or root hormone signaling and hydraulic response or both and even in grafted plants the rootstock could be directly involved in stomatal control hochberg et al 2013 lavoie lamoureux et al 2017 peccoux et al 2018 we found that colt rootstock maintained a higher ψgs50 near isohydric behavior than combinations using the mx60 rootstock near anisohydric behavior even with similar gs of 0 230 µmol m 2 s 1 fig 3 this result supports the idea that rootstock could control the stomatal response mainly through hydraulic responses rather than hormonal signaling mainly aba according to peccoux et al 2018 the grapevine rootstock controls the transpiration rate gs and ψmidday of shoot mainly through hydraulic responses rather than through aba signaling and the ψmidday could be purely related to a hydraulic response of the rootstock closely related to the root soil interface carminati and javaux 2020 in fact recent findings introduce the parameter ψgs50 as a support to synthesize belowground interactions between soil drying and stomata regulation because ψgs50 is not only a function of leaf traits but also dependent on the soil root hydraulic condition carminati and javaux 2020 then this would suggest that colt rootstock exhibit mechanisms associated with the root hydraulics which maintain hydraulic safety higher ψmidday despite a reduction in gs down to a 50 of gsmax it should be noted that in order to have a broader perspective and knowledge about plant behavior under water deficit it could be desirable to use several metrics for an accurate analysis martínez vilalta et al 2014 and use caution in comparing the response mechanisms for stomatal control and the concomitant leaf water potential garcia forner et al 2017 plant response to water deficit has commonly been determined as follows σ 1 as partial isohydric σ 1 as strict anisohydric and σ 1 as extreme anisohydric fu and meinzer 2019 we found differences between rootstocks in stomatal behavior through gs ψmidday curves fig 3 but no differences were found in the relationship between ψpre dawn and ψmidday fig 4 in this regard our results on the stomatal sensitivity deducted from the ψmidday to ψpre dawn relationship showed three categories of stomatal regulation partial isohydric σ 1 in bing colt and lapins mx60 strict anisohydric σ 1 in lapins colt colt and bing mx60 and extreme anisohydric σ 1 in mx60 fig 4 and table 2 the differences between may be due in part to the complexity between the stomatal response and leaf water potential since the water potential gradient under low water availability would not be determined directly by stomatal sensitivity but by the sensitivity of the plant hydraulic system as a whole as reported by martínez vilalta et al 2014 these authors also argue that highly stomatal sensitive plants could still show a strict anisohydric behavior provided that their hydraulic transport system is even more sensitive than the stomata to reductions in water availability thus lapins colt and colt and pertinent to lapins mx60 will show a critically high leaf water potential isohydric and low sensitivity of the transpiration rate and plant hydraulic conductance running the risk of hydraulic failure strict anisohydric as the water availability declines by contrast bing colt consistently showed an isohydric behavior σ 1 and was highly and negatively affected by water deficit these criteria for stomatal behavior are consistent with the hydroscape area which according to meinzer et al 2016 integrates more accurate information on the degree of iso or anisohydrism than other metrics in prunus álvarez maldini et al 2021 found that cultivars more tolerant to water deficit showed a large hydroscape area which was related to anisohydric behavior and maintenance of photosynthetic capacity compared to the cultivars with lower hydroscape area our results showed that bing colt has the most stringent stomatal control and small hydroscape area which could explain its lower biomass accumulation due to carbon limitations carbon starvation due to early stomatal closure could explain the low biomass accumulation exhibited by the bing colt combination fig 2 however it has been previously reported that isohydric plants will not necessarily be carbon starved by making use of the reserves present in stems and roots garcia forner et al 2017 root hydraulic conductance is a physiological trait sensitive to water deficit rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 and in most cases it has been reported that hydraulic conductivity loss is closely associated with gain in hydraulic safety gonçalves et al 2007 in addition it has recently been demonstrated that the decrease in root hydraulic conductance and even in the hydraulic of the root soil interface is the primary cause of hydraulic limitation leading to stomatal closure prior to cavitation carminati and javaux 2020 rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 in this regard we found at the end of the experiment that the most conservative combination in water use bing colt loses functionality of the root hydraulic conductivity at lower water potential gradients ψpre dawn ψmidday while more productive combinations do not reduce the root hydraulic conductivity as colt favoring the dynamics of the soil to leaf water potential gradient fig 5a recently rodriguez dominguez and brodribb 2020 reported that in olive plants under moderate water stress ψstem 2 5 mpa at least 95 of the whole plant hydraulic resistance is controlled by root hydraulic resistance i e a radial pathway from the xylem to the soil root interface in this regard one limitation of our study was the lack of continuous measurements of root hydraulic conductance and its correlation with data obtained from root cross sections however our results suggest that the differences found in root hydraulic conductance are associated with specific resistances resulting from differences in the diameter of xylem vessels between rootstock and scion from each combination in our study we found that despite lapins and bing scions being grafted onto the same rootstocks colt or mx60 both expressed differences arguably associated with genetic background for instance the remarkable differences in hydraulic conductivity were exhibited between lapins colt and bing colt under water deficit fig 5 in this regard a study by peschiutta et al 2013 anatomically compared the lapins and bing scions grafted onto p domestica rootstock under well watered condition found genetic differences associated with stem hydraulic traits xylem vessel frequency and diameter the authors showed that lapins scion had lower density and smaller xylem vessels 120 vessels mm 2 and 18 µm respectively compared to the bing scion 190 vessels mm 2 and 21 µm respectively concluding that lapins could be less vulnerable to stem cavitation than bing the higher stem vulnerability to cavitation reported in bing suggests that is mainly affected by the high tension in the xylem caused by the water deficit in the soil while lapins could avoid the embolism in vessels nevertheless it is possible that the differences observed between combinations may also be due to the variations in the anatomical configuration of rootstock xylem vessels olmstead et al 2006a regarding the xylem vessels of rootstocks in general colt has been reported with 35 vessels mm 2 and 40 µm olmstead 2006 olmstead et al 2006a whereas for mx60 we found no information about xylem vessels however if we use maxma14 p mahaleb x p avium as a reference showing similar vigor gonçalves et al 2007 we may assume that mx60 could have around 300 vessels mm 2 and 25 µm gonçalves et al 2007 hajagos and végvári 2013 for a close hydraulic connection between the scion and the rootstock the scion should have smaller xylem vessels than the rootstock olmstead et al 2006a therefore we can hypothesize that the losses in hydraulic functionality of bing colt in water deficit could be associated with large vessels of both bing and colt which could increase the vulnerability of the plant xylem to cavitation peschiutta et al 2013 while the other combinations have a better hydraulic connection either for having fewer and or smaller xylem vessels olmstead et al 2006b the effect of the rootstock on scion vigor through the water relationships related to root hydraulic conductance is well known jones 2012 tombesi et al 2010 despite both colt and mx60 having been classified as vigorous rootstocks csihon et al 2018 olmstead et al 2010 sotirov 2020 we found a slight difference in water use strategy between colt productive and mx60 intermediate which could redefine the classification of vigor according to the strategy colt maintains its vigorous trait due to its high capacity to extract water fig 1 and to maintain lapins colt or increase biomass as in root fig 2 but mx60 maintains a semi vigorous trait through the intermediate capacity of water uptake fig 1 and intermediate growth fig 2 we believe that the vigor of the rootstocks should be rigorously reviewed under the new climate scenarios interestingly we found evidence of a correlation between root hydraulic conductance and whole plant wue revealing that rootstock scion combinations with low root hydraulic conductance exhibited low whole plant wue fig 5b the finding related to whole plant wue suggests that root hydraulic conductivity may not only be controlling the water flow in roots and the plant but also that it can maintain the vigor of the whole plant the whole plant wue referes to the analysis of the balance between two components the biomass accumulation given by new growth and the water consumption during a period of time jiménez et al 2013 found that the most vigorous rootstock induced higher wue concomitant to the accumulation of osmoregulators mainly leaf sorbitol our results show that rootstocks with high whole plant wue under water deficit increased sorbitol content in leaf fig 6c sorbitol is considered the major end product of photosynthesis and the main form of translocated and storage carbon in many fruit tree species of the prunus genus centritto 2005 loescher 1987 it has also been found that sorbitol transport both via xylem and phloem increases under water deficit condition noiraud et al 2001 to perform osmotic adjustment functions in both roots and leaves jiménez et al 2013 lo bianco et al 2000 an early work showed a high capacity to adjust osmolarity of colt rootstock under water deficit mainly associated with accumulation of sorbitol in roots and leaves ranney et al 1991 in colt and lapins colt osmotic adjustments induced by sorbitol accumulation in leaves may contribute to the maintenance of open stomata at lower water potentials by sustaining turgor in response to an imposed water depletion pou et al 2012 thus our results would suggest that the relationship between rootstock and scion should consider an interaction that maximizes water uptake capacity even as water deficit increases since this will favor the mobility of sugars either to increase osmolarity or as a source of energy for growing organs therefore maintaining relatively high non structural sugar levels during water deficit stress and keeping them available i e during the recovery phase may be crucial to tree vigor and survival tomasella et al 2019 as for sucrose lo bianco et al 2000 found no influence in osmotic adjustment in peach plants this could be due to sucrose having energy rather than osmotic functions in our study the increase in sucrose in roots under water deficit suggests that this sugar may support energy mainly for root respiration and the maintenance of root growth as observed in the colt and lapins colt combinations fig 2 although it has been reported that tolerance to water deficit may be associated with low root respiration durand et al 2016 in citrus silva et al 2021 revealed that rootstock with tolerance to water deficit was able to use photoassimilates as an energy source to increase root respiration under water deficit and then to maintain root growth and improve drought tolerance 5 conclusion it is important to consider that rootstocks with a great influence of productive strategy on whole plant performance should be considered an opportunistic risk taker because this behavior characterized by a water uptake capacity under conditions of low water availability is only sustainable under minimal to moderate water stress and in the short term sade et al 2012 in our study we report that the water deficit sensitive combination bing colt exhibited an early reduction in its water uptake capacity higher ftsw values a concomitant lower hydroscape area and a remarkable reduction in its whole plant wue moreover this was the combination most negatively affected in its biomass accumulation conversely combinations with late reductions in their water uptake capacities lower ftsw values or risk taker combinations lapins colt and colt presented a greater hydroscape area with barely affected shoot biomass and even with an increase in biomass at root level under water deficit our study shows that there should not be a strict rule on whether it is the rootstock or scion that controls the behavior of the whole plant rather an integrative view of the physiology of both grafted components should be taken according to the above considerations the choice of which rootstock to take the risk in order to maintain a sustained water uptake capacity from the soil will be fundamental to maintaining high productivity this research highlights the importance of studying the physiological response of grafted plants in order to select better rootstock

practices under si or sr si significantly increased annual yield 5 0 ch4 emission 17 1 and δsoc 119 9 but decreased n2o emissions 19 4 and gwpd 19 6 thus resulting in a net gwp reduction of 23 6 as

measures including water saving and straw management strategies have been put in place to maintain high crop yields in northern china zhang et al 2019 however fewer studies have been carried out to

evaluate crop yield ghg emissions net global warming potential gwp and ghg intensity ghgi under different irrigation scenarios and straw practices it is also important to accurately guide for water saving irrigation by determining the suitable irrigation system and further explaining the water saving mechanism that improves grain production and reduces ghg emissions the objectives of this study

growth stage the irrigation amount used in each key stage of di and sdi was calculated by the following equation wang et al 2018a 1 i sρph θ f q 1 q 2 η where i is the irrigation water amount m3 s is the irrigated area m2 ρ is the soil bulk density 1 34 g m 3 p is the soil wetness ratio 0 8 h is the depth of the wetting soil layer 0 4 m θ f is the maximum value of the field water holding capacity

sdi from the turn green stage to the harvest stage in wheat season and in whole maize season in each irrigation events details of the timing and amount of each irrigation and rainfall and fertilizer application at different crop growth stages for all treatments are presented in fig 1 therefore the annual irrigation amount of di sdi pri and fp were 227 mm 137 mm and 405 mm in which 158 1 mm 97 7

752 4 mm in which 139 2 mm and 613 2 mm were received in wheat and maize season respectively the mean air temperature was 21 2 3 0 to 36 8 the mean soil temperature under si and sr was18 6 0 8 to 30 4 and 19 0 0 1 to 30 6 respectively fig 1 2 2 n2o and ch4 flux measurements direct greenhouse gas emissions released from the soil are co2 ch4 and n2o however in cropland systems co2 has not yet been considered as one greenhouse gas because crops are mainly harvested and consumed within one year gao et al 2018 the gas samples of the other two ghgs ch4 and n2o were collected from june 2020 to june 2021 using a closed chamber method in each replicated field plot a stainless steel base frame 30 30 10 cm was permanently installed during the experimental period by inserting into the soil while it would be inserted on the row laying a drip line fig s1 each chamber was made of a cube with stainless steel walls and frames a bottom area of 30 30 cm and a height of 50 cm that was adapted to the plant size the chambers were coated with heat insulating foam to prevent a significant change in the inner air temperature during sampling before we collected air samples we filled the channel with a certain amount of water then a chamber was mounted on the top of the base frame by inserting it into the channel filled with water to ensure a gas tight enclosure immediately after enclosure we took the first air sample using a 30 ml plastic syringe with a three way valve later we took another two air samples from the same chamber enclosure at an interval of 20 min then the chamber was immediately removed to allow for the least disturbance of the experimental area the above sampling procedures were conducted at each experimental plot on two week basis during the winter but were performed weekly during the other seasons sampling was carried out daily in the following three days and per three day from 4th to 14th day following the events like fertilizer application irrigation rainfall and tillage the sampling was completed between 08 00 a m and 11 00 a m at the local standard time to obtain a single flux of a gas at each plot for the day the gas samples were stored in glass vials 30 ml and analyzed with an agilent 7820 a gas chromatograph equipped with an auto sampler and an electron capture detector within 24 h using the dn co2 method for n2o yan et al 2015 and with a flame ionization detector for ch4 wu et al 2019 for the three gas samples analyzed n2o and ch4 fluxes were determined by a linear method and then the fluxes were calculated using the eq 2 as

2 while irrigation practices significantly affected the soil ph nh4 n concentration and moisture in the study a significant interaction effect of straw and irrigation was observed on c n ratio and ph however the concentration of soc tn no3 n and nh4 n and c n ratio moisture at 0 20 cm depth of soil layer showed no significant differences under si treatment in these four treatments the highest ph value was observed in fp under si fig 2 however nh4 n concentration and moisture were significantly increased under si as compared to sr in all irrigation practices among all treatments there were no significant influences of straw practices and irrigation practices and interaction effect on wheat and maize yield but significant influences of straw practices and irrigation practices were found on annual yield fig 3 sdi combined with si was observed to produce the highest annual yield which was 17 4 0 2 mg ha 1 additionally nh4 n concentration was significantly and negatively correlated to crop yield under si fig 4 3 2 n2o fluxes and cumulative emissions four n2o emission pulses occurred in association with fertilizer n application events fig 5 the highest peak fluxes of n2o were found after topdressing in maize season were 761 2 46 1 μg m 2 h 1 di 333 7 22 7 μg m 2 h 1 sdi 416 4 68 6 μg m 2 h 1 pri 763 0 96 4 μg m 2 h 1 under si and 765 8 254 3 μg m 2 h 1 di 528 1 144 6 μg m 2 h 1 sdi

of 16 3 and 25 8 under fertigation and flood irrigation respectively all of the highest average n2o fluxes were found in fp under si and sr treatments fig s2 the effects of straw practices p 0 001 and irrigation practices p 0 001 and an interaction effect p 0 001 were observed on n2o emissions table 1 the fp had the highest cumulative n2o emissions which were 1 28 0 08 kg n ha 1 for wheat and 1 79 0 14 kg n ha 1 for maize under si treatment and 1 45 0 01 kg n ha 1 for wheat and 2 27 0 07 kg n ha 1 for maize under sr fig 6 as compared to fp the n2o production was significantly deceased in fertigation under si or sr fig 6 for example the annual n2o emission of sdi was significantly decreased by 40 3 under si and 52 8 under sr as compared to fp additionally the c n ratio and ph significantly correlated with n2o emissions under sr and si treatment respectively fig 4 3 3 ch4 fluxes and cumulative emissions the cropland area was observed to be a weak sink of ch4 during the experimental period the ch4 emissions were significantly affected by straw practices p 0 001 and irrigation practices p 0 001 table 1 and the emission pulses occurred in association with irrigation events fig 5 the highest average of ch4 fluxes was observed in fp under si fig s2 which caused the highest cumulative ch4 emissions at 0 94 kg ha 1 under si fig 7 the ch4 emissions were significantly decreased by 17 1 sdi and 14 0 pri under si as compared to sr respectively fig 7 additionally soil moisture and ph significantly correlated with ch4 emissions under sr and si treatments respectively fig 4 3 4 indirect ghg emissions global warming potential and intensity for annual gwpi the smallest value 4239 5 kg co2 eq ha 1 was observed in pri which was 29 8 lower than fp for all treatments fertilizer and electricity were the major contributors accounting for 23 4 33 3 and 29 8 61 7 of gwpi release respectively fig s3 as shown in table 1 straw and irrigation practices both significantly affected net gwp and ghgi si was beneficial to reduce net gwp and ghgi in which the net gwp 3785 7 kg co2 eq ha 1 and ghgi 217 4 kg co2 eq mg 1 of sdi under si were decreased by 23 6 p 0 05 and 27 3 p 0 05 as compared to sr 4 discussion 4 1 crop grain yield under intensive agricultural practices soil production ability and crop yield tend to decline with the continuous removal of straw yuan et al 2021 the attainable yield of irrigated annual wheat maize rotation ranged from 16 9 to 20 4 mg ha 1 with an average of 18 8 mg ha 1 gao et al 2022 lu and fan 2013 wang et al 2023 as shown in this study the annual yield ranged from 16 1 to 17 4 mg ha 1 which was respected to previous studies however only a significant increase by 5 0 in sdi under si as compared to sr was observed fig 3 sdi can maintain a long duration with wet soil fig s5 si can supply organic c source liu et al 2014 which both were beneficial for microbial decomposition of straw through mineralization and humification to produce simple organic compounds e g soc and nitrogen compounds e g no3 n nh4 n fig 2 table 1 wang et al 2021b that are important for plant growth and therefore have a positive effect on crop yield islam et al 2022 fig s4 northern china is a semi arid region with dry winter and wet summer water is a limiting factor especially for wheat li et al 2019 therefore a better drip fertigation measurement could improve grain yield and fertilization efficiency bai et al 2020 in addition irrigation practice was the main contributor accounted for 39 3 p 0 01 to crop yield while irrigation amount was only accounted for 11 9 through a redundancy analysis table s2 which emphasized that irrigation practices have a significant impact on crop yield fig 3 eventhough sdi was found to be the best practice to achieve the maximum annual yield and 8 0 higher p 0 05 than pri under si no significant difference was found among di sdi and fp this is likely a consequence of 1 higher water evaporation under surface irrigation di which shortens the duration of suitable wfps as compared to sdi fig s5 2 excessive water stress in pri reduced the available c release from straw thus restricting the crop yield islam et al 2022 3 flood irrigation might cause an excessive build up of water in the soil and thus lead to anoxia over an extended period of time which was not beneficial for soil nutrient transport and root respiration yu et al 2020 eventhough the annual yield of sdi si has reached up to 17 4 mg ha 1 but there is still a yield gap to reach 18 8 mg ha 1 in irrigated field lu and fan 2013 wang et al 2023 4 2 soil organic carbon the changes in soc are a result of changes in the net balance between inputs application of straw and outputs soil respiration smith et al 2010 different farming managements e g straw incorporation fertilization irrigation can help with sequestration of carbon in soil by increasing soc and reducing the available carbon for ghg emission thereby contributing to climate change mitigation tang et al 2023 yagioka et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 this study observed 0 9 1 7 increase in the concentration of soc with si as compared to a 0 5 0 9 increase with sr fig s6 p 0 05 which caused a 28 9 119 8 higher of δsoc under si than sr table 1 lal 2007 reported that the rate of soc accrual reached 0 3 0 5 mg c ha 1 yr 1 equivalate to 0 12 0 19 g kg 1 yr 1 increase of soc concentration under intensive agricultural practices with use of crop straw corresponding to the observations in this study at the increase rate of 0 10 0 18 g kg 1 yr 1 table s3 as straw is incorporated up to 65 of wheat straw and 77 of maize straw are decomposed annually aiding significant soil c sequestration wang et al 2012 which highlighted strong potential for soil c sequestration in this region suggesting that use of straw can facilitate accumulation of soc in agroecosystems and be considered for future agricultural management practices irrigation changes the soil water environmental conditions and indirectly affects soil aeration microbial and enzymatic activity šnajdr et al 2008 thus affecting nutrient mineralization and its utilization by plants kamoni et al 2015 soc increased by 1 4 3 3 under drip irrigation as compared to fp fig 2 it means irrigation benefited from the accumulation of soc as demonstrated in a previous study zhang et al 2020 increasing soil moisture by heavy flood irrigation can inhibit the decomposition of soil organic matter under general anaerobic conditions moyano et al 2013 during all treatments the highest δsoc 1882 0 367 3 kg co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 was found under sdi treatment using si table 1 the reason probably was the longer duration and higher wfps fig s5 due to the irrigation water was supplied into sub surface soil layer 10 cm to reduce the water evaporation but increased the water moisture which inhibited the mineralization of soc by microorganisms bozkurt and mansuroglu 2018 cai et al 2021 thus contributed to soc increase fig 4 however compared to the high soc concentration of 14 5 23 2 g kg 1 in europe and us gao et al 2018 there is still a large potential to increase soc concentration in recent agroecosystems 4 3 n2o and ch4 emissions the n2o emissions are produced from soil under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions mutegi et al 2010 whereas ch4 emissions from irrigated soil are controlled by the production oxidation and transport processes and produced under strictly anaerobic conditions as a terminal product of anaerobic mineralization of soil organic matter som lagomarsino et al 2016 in this study a significant reduction in annual n2o emissions was observed in di sdi and fp under si by 23 8 19 4 and 17 4 respectively fig 6 crop straw with a high c n ratio 25 usually interacted with n fertilization and forces the microbial n immobilization by reducing the available n pool for nitrifiers and denitrifying microbes the c n ratio of wheat and maize straw utilized in this study was greater than 25 as shown by xu et al 2019 and li et al 2021a which might explain the significant reduction in n2o production the ch4 emissions were shown to be significantly and positively related to soc concentration wang et al 2019 huang et al 2022 for example the increment of soc concentration showed in fig 2 can provide abundant methanogenic substrates for methanogens thus stimulating ch4 production and consequent emissions under si as compared to sr overall the si benefited n2o mitigation but inhibited the ch4 uptake in the past several decades many studies have looked at the effects of water conditions on n2o and ch4 emissions in wheat maize cropping systems kennedy et al 2013 sainju et al 2014 li et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 the most used water saving irrigation regimes include sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation subsurface drip irrigation and partial rooting irrigation a global meta analysis shows that drip irrigation significantly reduced n2o emissions by 32 and 46 when compared to furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems respectively kuang et al 2021 estimate from this study show the average emission factor of n2o was 0 35 under drip irrigation as compared to 1 reduction of n2o calculated by ipcc lower n2o emissions are associated with several factors first soil water content under drip irrigation is lower than conventional irrigation inhibiting the activity of n2o producing microbes and thereby reducing n2o production sánchez martín et al 2008 secondly lower concentrations of n supplied through drip irrigation system fertigation are better utilized by crops and thus prevent its losses to the environment kennedy et al 2013 thirdly using subsurface driplines under the 10 cm of soil layer sdi prevents accumulation of n fertilizer over the surface soil when water evaporates thus resulting in higher wfps fig s5 than di and limiting the gas diffusivity i e the diffusion of soil n2o into the atmosphere the soil in northern china is a sink for ch4 emissions fig 7 li et al 2019 water saving irrigation regimes are therefore beneficial in reducing ch4 emissions in wheat maize fields and ensure stable crop yield at the same time wu et al 2019 in fig 5 only a peak flux of ch4 can be observed after flood irrigation this is likely due to the anaerobic soil conditions that stimulated methanogenic bacteria following heavy irrigation and therefore resulted in a substantial increase in ch4 emissions during the wheat and maize seasons itoh et al 2011 sdi can lead to aerobic conditions allowing oxidation of ch4 due to lower soil moisture as compared to fp fig s5 evidently sdi and pri were the best methods for n2o mitigation and ch4 sink 4 4 net gwp and ghgi net gwp is often calculated by using co2 equivalents of soil i e the ch4 and n2o emissions along with different farm management and agrochemical inputs ruan and philip robertson 2013 huang et al 2022 however these measurements do not take into account co2 emissions from soil gao et al 2018 here the fate of ghgs including direct soil n2o and ch4 emissions indirect different farm management and agrochemical inputs and soc change needed to be considered when calculating the net ghg sink or source sainju et al 2014 gao et al 2018 drip irrigation is beneficial in directly reducing greenhouse gas emissions i e n2o and ch4 mitigation and also indirect ghg i e power for irrigation emissions and sdi and pri have been identified as the best choices for this objective fig s3 table 1 the reduction in n2o emissions might offset the increase of ch4 emissions when straw is incorporated and help to further decrease direct ghg emissions in a cropping system ch4 fluxes generally did not contribute to net gwp sainju et al 2014 however indirect ghgs released from fertilizer pesticides seeds power use for irrigation diesel fuel polyethylene lines and labour may have strongly contributed to net gwp and followed by δsoc zhang et al 2020 overall sdi significantly improved δsoc and lowered n2o production and power for irrigation thus reduced the net gwp under si as compared to sr the net gwp values of drip irrigation were significant lower than that of fp which was comparable with previous studies yagioka et al 2015 ghgi provides a platform for comparing the effects of irrigation and straw practices on net gwp per unit of yield grassini and cassman 2012 gao et al 2018 in our study ghgi was observed to be significant lower in di 283 3 kg co2 eq mg 1 and sdi 217 4 kg co2 eq mg 1 under si as compared to sr table 1 which is similar to 117 3 223 7 kg co2 eq mg 1 reported in the united states cavigelli et al 2009 grassini and cassman 2012 and is also lower than that of 491 3 535 3 kg co2 eq mg 1 reported in china gao et al 2018 for irrigated wheat and maize systems additionally the lowest ghgi was found in sdi under si because of the highest annual yield therefore sdi combined with si is concluded to be the best combination for improved grain yield with lower ghg emissions however many previous studies have indicated that china still has a large potential to reduce net gwp and ghgi it is therefore an essential target for future sustainable agriculture to close the gap between china and other developed countries with low net gwp and ghgi ju et al 2009 chen et al 2014 gao et al 2018 5 conclusion limited irrigation water resources and high storage of crop residue are the main challenges faced by resource managers in intensive wheat maize cropping system in northern china fertigation treatments i e di sdi and pri are all significantly contributed to reduce gwpi net gwp and ghgi under si or sr as compared to fp sdi significantly decreased the n2o production and increased soil c sequestration reducing net gwp and ghgi under si when compared with sr under si pri resulted in the lowest annual yield which was not beneficial to reduce ghgi therefore sdi combined with si simultaneously mitigated ghg emissions reduced the global warming potential improved yield and enhanced soil c sequestration making it an alternative and effective method for the sustainable farming system with minimal environmental damage

8973,global water shortages and appropriate crop residues management are the major issues threatening the sustainable development of agriculture food security and the environment in this study we conducted a one year field experiment in 2020 2021 to investigate annual yield greenhouse gas ghg emissions global warming potential gwp and greenhouse gas intensity ghgi in a wheat maize cropping system straw practices were kept in the main plot including straw incorporation si and straw removal sr irrigation practices were allocated into sub plots including surface drip irrigation di sub surface drip irrigation sdi partial rootzone irrigation pri and flood irrigation fp all treatments were fertilized at the level of 210 kg n ha 1 for each season the soil acted as a net sink for ch4 but as a source of n2o emissions during the annual crop growth period under all irrigation treatments the highest direct ghgs net gwp and ghgi were found in fp compared with all other irrigation practices under si or sr si significantly increased annual yield 5 0 ch4 emission 17 1 and δsoc 119 9 but decreased n2o emissions 19 4 and gwpd 19 6 thus resulting in a net gwp reduction of 23 6 as compared to sr under sdi additionally the best treatment for minimizing the negative environmental impacts was found in sdi which reduced net gwp by 39 7 p 0 05 and decreased ghgi by 43 0 p 0 05 as compared to fp under si we conclude that sub surface drip irrigation combined with straw incorporation simultaneously mitigates ghg emissions improves yield and enhances soil c sequestration making it a suitable environment friendly agricultural management practice for sustainable farming in northern china graphical abstract ga1 keywords irrigation management soil conditions soil c sequestration

n2o emissions respectively it is estimated that ch4 and n2o contribute up to 12 of the total global greenhouse gas ghg emissions cui et al 2014 ipcc 2014 fan et al 2018 n2o and ch4 are both ozone depleting gases and have a significant effect on global warming in agroecosystems a variety of farm management practices and agrochemical inputs such as machine operation manufacturing and transportation of agricultural resources greatly contribute to global ghg driven climate change cui et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l cropping system is widely practiced in northern china which is the most important and intensive cereal crop production region in china yan et al 2015 the need for irrigation to meet crop water demand and straw management are the main challenges that the region is facing therefore optimized irrigation management strategies are needed to promote measures for conserving water ensuring food security and environmental sustainability wang et al 2021a the crop yields in semi arid regions like northern china particularly winter wheat are heavily dependent on groundwater irrigation zhang et al 2017b flood irrigation continues to be one of the widely used irrigation strategy worldwide akbari et al 2018 heavy irrigation causes nitrate no3 to infiltrate deeper soil layers promotes n2o production through the denitrification process and stimulates ch4 emissions currell et al 2012 wu et al 2019 liu et al 2021 combining drip irrigation with fertilizer fertigation has been used in smaller and precise applications frequent supplements of water and fertilizer are applied to the rooting zone through the surface di or sub surface sdi drip irrigation system farneselli et al 2015 di and sdi have been developed to sustain wetted soil area water filled pore space 60 70 to reduce early season evaporation zhao et al 2021 inhibit soil denitrification process and thereby reduce the release of n2o emissions hou et al 2016 previous studies have demonstrated that fertigation can reduce n2o emissions by 32 46 in comparison with other irrigation systems due to reduced irrigation and different soil wetting patterns kennedy et al 2013 kuang et al 2021 sdi application can reduce the amount of irrigation by supplying water and nitrogen fertilizer to sub surface soil with maximum crop root density schmidt et al 2018 partial rootzone irrigation pri irrigates half of the root zone and allows the other side to dry before irrigating on an alternate basis wang et al 2010 pri application exposes part of the rhizosphere environment to dry soil tang et al 2010 which can substantially reduce irrigation water consumption and lead to improve soil organic matters decomposition and ghg production wang et al 2016 2018b appropriate supplemental irrigation can simultaneously accelerate the aerobic decomposition of soil organic matter and reduce ch4 emissions by limiting organic substrates for methanogens kögel knabner et al 2010 haque et al 2016 straw production in china exceeded more than 109 mg per year accounting for 25 of global production ji 2015 crop straw incorporated in the field improves soil fertility and reduces the severe air pollution caused by burning of straw wu et al 2019 straw incorporation significantly reduced soil n losses in the form of n2o emissions and nitrate leaching by 17 3 and 8 7 respectively which was mainly due to induction of net n immobilization xia et al 2018 soc responded more sensitively to straw incorporation liu et al 2014 although straw incorporation contributed to co2 and ch4 emissions the soil organic carbon soc stock in surface soil has significantly increased by 14 in 11 years in northern china chen et al 2009 it has also been reported that straw incorporation also plays an essential role in soil c sequestration demonstrating over 90 of reduction potential for ghg mitigation in agroecosystems smith et al 2007 liao et al 2014 and minimize negative environmental impacts rizhiya et al 2011 zheng et al 2019 li et al 2021a the results of previous research that assessed the effect of straw incorporation on n2o emissions and net ghg were found to be inconsistent some studies have reported positive effects of crop incorporation because of a mineralizable n substrate for n2o generation through nitrification process li et al 2021b and reduced oxygen availability in the soil profile which favor n2o production through denitrification mutegi et al 2010 or neutral effects zhang et al 2017a since the early 1990 s various farming measures including water saving and straw management strategies have been put in place to maintain high crop yields in northern china zhang et al 2019 however fewer studies have been carried out to measure the combined effect of irrigation water management and straw incorporation on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield in this region therefore it is of great theoretical and practical value to evaluate crop yield ghg emissions net global warming potential gwp and ghg intensity ghgi under different irrigation scenarios and straw practices it is also important to accurately guide for water saving irrigation by determining the suitable irrigation system and further explaining the water saving mechanism that improves grain production and reduces ghg emissions the objectives of this study were to 1 evaluate the effects of irrigation and straw practices on crop yields and ghg emissions and 2 quantify the individual and interaction effects of irrigation and straw practices on net gwp and ghgi in order to optimize agricultural management practices and mitigate the impacts of greenhouse gases released from wheat maize cropping system 2 material and methods 2 1 study site and treatments

soil textural class was silt loam calcium carbonate content was 3 bulk density was 1 34 g cm 3 ph 1 2 5 soil water was 8 04 soil organic matter was 19 9 g kg 1 and total n concentration was 1 60 g kg 1 field study was carried out in the winter wheat t aestivum l and summer maize z mays l cropping system from october 16 2020 to october 10 2021 in this study straw treatment was kept in the main plot including straw incorporation si and straw removal sr the maize and wheat straw of the previous cropping seasons were mechanically chopped into the length of 5 8 cm and then incorporated in the soil si or all removed sr irrigation treatment was allocated into sub plots under split plot design including surface drip irrigation di sub surface drip irrigation sdi partial root zone irrigation pri and flood irrigation fp with the n fertilizer application rate of 420 kg n ha 1 yr 1 therefore eight treatments with three replicates resulting in a total of 24 plots each with an area of 10 m length 4 m width as shown in fig s1 split applications of n fertilizer were adopted with two splits each split was 105 kg n ha 1 for each crop as follows basal fertilization and top dressing at wheat jointing or at the 10 leaf stage of maize in addition phosphorous superphosphate and potassium potassium sulfate fertilizers were applied together at the rate of 135 kg p2o5 ha 1 105 kg k2o ha 1 for wheat and 70 kg p2o5 ha 1 100 kg k2o ha 1 for maize respectively for drip irrigation drip lines were installed with a space of 30 cm in row on surface di or in subsurface soil 10 cm depth sdi and pri the pressure emitters had a water flow of 0 15 l h 1 and were spaced 30 cm apart the measurements were treated from the turn green middle march stage to the harvest stage in wheat season and through whole maize growth stage the irrigation amount used in each key stage of di and sdi was calculated by the following equation wang et al 2018a 1 i sρph θ f q 1 q 2 η where i is the irrigation water amount m3 s is the irrigated area m2 ρ is the soil bulk density 1 34 g m 3 p is the soil wetness ratio 0 8 h is the depth of the wetting soil layer 0 4 m θ f is the maximum value of the field water holding capacity 34 26 q 1 and q 2 represent the upper irrigation limit 85 and the measured soil moisture content respectively and η is irrigation efficiency 0 95 the irrigation amount used in pri was half of di or sdi from the turn green stage to the harvest stage in wheat season and in whole maize season in each irrigation events details of the timing and amount of each irrigation and rainfall and fertilizer application at different crop growth stages for all treatments are presented in fig 1 therefore the annual irrigation amount of di sdi pri and fp were 227 mm 137 mm and 405 mm in which 158 1 mm 97 7 mm and 315 mm were received during wheat oct 16 2020 june 18 2021 and 68 8 mm 39 4 mm and 90 mm were received during maize season june 19 2021 oct 10 2021 respectively the cumulative precipitation was 752 4 mm in which 139 2 mm and 613 2 mm were received in wheat and maize season respectively the mean air temperature was 21 2 3 0 to 36 8 the mean soil temperature under si and sr was18 6 0 8 to 30 4 and 19 0 0 1 to 30 6 respectively fig 1 2 2 n2o and ch4 flux measurements direct greenhouse gas emissions released from the soil are co2 ch4 and n2o however in cropland systems co2 has not yet been considered as one greenhouse gas because crops are mainly harvested and consumed within one year gao et al 2018 the gas samples of the other two ghgs ch4 and n2o were collected from june 2020 to june 2021 using a closed chamber method in each replicated field plot a stainless steel base frame 30 30 10 cm was permanently installed during the experimental period by inserting into the soil while it would be inserted on the row laying a drip line fig s1 each chamber was made of a cube with stainless steel walls and frames a bottom area of 30 30 cm and a height of 50 cm that was adapted to the plant size the chambers were coated with heat insulating foam to prevent a significant change in the inner air temperature during sampling before we collected air samples we filled the channel with a certain amount of water then a chamber was mounted on the top of the base frame by inserting it into the channel filled with water to ensure a gas tight enclosure immediately after enclosure we took the first air sample using a 30 ml plastic syringe with a three way valve later we took another two air samples from the same chamber enclosure at an interval of 20 min then the chamber was immediately removed to allow for the least disturbance of the experimental area the above sampling procedures were conducted at each experimental plot on two week basis during the winter but were performed weekly during the other seasons sampling was carried out daily in the following three days and per three day from 4th to 14th day following the events like fertilizer application irrigation rainfall and tillage the sampling was completed between 08 00 a m and 11 00 a m at the local standard time to obtain a single flux of a gas at each plot for the day the gas samples were stored in glass vials 30 ml and analyzed with an agilent 7820 a gas chromatograph equipped with an auto sampler and an electron capture detector within 24 h using the dn co2 method for n2o yan et al 2015 and with a flame ionization detector for ch4 wu et al 2019 for the three gas samples analyzed n2o and ch4 fluxes were determined by a linear method and then the fluxes were calculated using the eq 2 as follows 2 f m v 0 p p 0 273 273 t h d c t dt where f is n2o ch4 flux μg m 2 h 1 m is gas molar mass g mol 1 v 0 is gas volume under standard condition 22 41 10 3 m3 t c and p hpa are the air

calculated using eq 3 as follows 3 f i 1 n 1 f i 1 f i 2 t i 1 t i 24 100000 where f is the cumulative emissions kg ha 1 i 1 n is the ith observation and 24 100000 is the transformation coefficient unit from μg m 2 h 1 to kg ha 1 2 3 auxiliary measurements and carbon storage the daily data for precipitation were obtained from the meteorological station located at the experimental site the amount of irrigation water used in each growth stage was recorded on each sampling day chamber air and topsoil 0 10 cm temperatures were recorded using a digital thermometer surface soil samples 0 20 cm were collected at each growth stage of wheat and maize the samples collected from the position under the drip line and between near lines were mixed into one sample which was sieved through a 2 mm mesh the gravimetric water content was measured using the oven drying method at 105 for 24 h soil nh4 n and no3 n concentrations were determined with a continuous flow analyzer traacs2000 bran and luebbe norderstedt germany after extraction with 1 m kcl soil solution 1 5 another soil sample was collected from each plot using a steel cylinder 5 cm diameter at a depth of 0 20 cm before wheat seeding october 2020 and at maize harvest october 2021 air dried sieved through 0 5 mm mesh and divided into two subsamples to measure the ph tn and soc concentration ph was determined with a ph meter phs 25

origin lab northampton ma usa 3 results 3 1 crop yield and soil conditions our results showed that straw practices significantly affect soc concentration no3 n and nh4 n concentration and moisture fig 2 while irrigation practices significantly affected the soil ph nh4 n concentration and moisture in the study a significant interaction effect of straw and irrigation was observed on c n ratio and ph however the concentration of soc tn no3 n and nh4 n and c n ratio moisture at 0 20 cm depth of soil layer showed no significant differences under si treatment in these four treatments the highest ph value was observed in fp under si fig 2 however nh4 n concentration and moisture were significantly increased under si as compared to sr in all irrigation practices among all treatments there were no significant influences of straw practices and irrigation practices and interaction effect on wheat and maize yield but significant influences of straw practices and irrigation practices were found on annual yield fig 3 sdi combined with si was observed to produce the highest annual yield which was 17 4 0 2 mg ha 1 additionally nh4 n concentration was significantly and negatively correlated to crop yield under si fig 4 3 2 n2o fluxes and cumulative emissions four n2o emission pulses occurred in association with fertilizer n application events fig 5 the highest peak fluxes of n2o were found after topdressing in maize season were 761 2 46 1 μg m 2 h 1 di 333 7 22 7 μg m 2 h 1 sdi 416 4 68 6 μg m 2 h 1 pri 763 0 96 4 μg m 2 h 1 under si and 765 8 254 3 μg m 2 h 1 di 528 1 144 6 μg m 2 h 1 sdi 580 2 98 0 μg m 2 h 1 pri 1137 6 63 0 μg m 2 h 1 fp under sr the n2o fluxes under sr treatment were higher than those under si after each event of fertilizer application with annual average increments of 16 3 and 25 8 under fertigation and flood irrigation respectively all of the highest average n2o fluxes were found in fp under si and sr treatments fig s2 the effects of straw practices p 0 001 and irrigation practices p 0 001 and an interaction effect p 0 001 were observed on n2o emissions table 1 the fp had the highest cumulative n2o emissions which were 1 28 0 08 kg n ha 1 for wheat and 1 79 0 14 kg n ha 1 for maize under si treatment and 1 45 0 01 kg n ha 1 for wheat and 2 27 0 07 kg n ha 1 for maize under sr fig 6 as compared to fp the n2o production was significantly deceased in fertigation under si or sr fig 6 for example the annual n2o emission of sdi was significantly decreased by 40 3 under si and 52 8 under sr as compared to fp additionally the c n ratio and ph significantly correlated with n2o emissions under sr and si treatment respectively fig 4 3 3 ch4 fluxes and cumulative emissions the cropland area was observed to be a weak sink of ch4 during the experimental period the ch4 emissions were significantly affected by straw practices p 0 001 and irrigation practices p 0 001 table 1 and the emission pulses occurred in association with irrigation events fig 5 the highest average of ch4 fluxes was observed in fp under si fig s2 which caused the highest cumulative ch4 emissions at 0 94 kg ha 1 under si fig 7 the ch4 emissions were significantly decreased by 17 1 sdi and 14 0 pri under si as compared to sr respectively fig 7 additionally soil moisture and ph significantly correlated with ch4 emissions under sr and si treatments respectively fig 4 3 4 indirect ghg emissions global warming potential and intensity for annual gwpi the smallest value 4239 5 kg co2 eq ha 1 was observed in pri which was 29 8 lower than fp for all treatments fertilizer and electricity were the major contributors accounting for 23 4 33 3 and 29 8 61 7 of gwpi release respectively fig s3 as shown in table 1 straw and irrigation practices both significantly affected net gwp and ghgi si was beneficial to reduce net gwp and ghgi in which the net gwp 3785 7 kg co2 eq ha 1 and ghgi 217 4 kg co2 eq mg 1 of sdi under si were decreased by 23 6 p 0 05 and 27 3 p 0 05 as compared to sr 4 discussion 4 1 crop grain yield under intensive agricultural practices soil production ability and crop yield tend to decline with the continuous removal of straw yuan et al 2021 the attainable yield of irrigated annual wheat maize rotation ranged from 16 9 to 20 4 mg ha 1 with an average of 18 8 mg ha 1 gao et al 2022 lu and fan 2013 wang et al 2023 as shown in this study the annual yield ranged from 16 1 to 17 4 mg ha 1 which was respected to previous studies however only a significant increase by 5 0 in sdi under si as compared to sr was observed fig 3 sdi can maintain a long duration with wet soil fig s5 si can supply organic c source liu et al 2014 which both were beneficial for microbial decomposition of straw through mineralization and humification to produce simple organic compounds e g soc and nitrogen compounds e g no3 n nh4 n fig 2 table 1 wang et al 2021b that are important for plant growth and therefore have a positive effect on crop yield islam et al 2022 fig s4 northern china is a semi arid region with dry winter and wet summer water is a limiting factor especially for wheat li et al 2019 therefore a better drip fertigation measurement could improve grain yield and fertilization efficiency bai et al 2020 in addition irrigation practice was the main contributor accounted for 39 3 p 0 01 to crop yield while irrigation amount was only accounted for 11 9 through a redundancy analysis table s2 which emphasized that irrigation practices have a significant impact on crop yield fig 3 eventhough sdi was found to be the best practice to achieve the maximum annual yield and 8 0 higher p 0 05 than pri under si no significant difference was found among di sdi and fp this is likely a consequence of 1 higher water evaporation under surface irrigation di which shortens the duration of suitable wfps as compared to sdi fig s5 2 excessive water stress in pri reduced the available c release from straw thus restricting the crop yield islam et al 2022 3 flood irrigation might cause an excessive build up of water in the soil and thus lead to anoxia over an extended period of time which was not beneficial for soil nutrient transport and root respiration yu et al 2020 eventhough the annual yield of sdi si has reached up to 17 4 mg ha 1 but there is still a yield gap to reach 18 8 mg ha 1 in irrigated field lu and fan 2013 wang et al 2023 4 2 soil organic carbon the changes in soc are a result of changes in the net balance between inputs application of straw and outputs soil respiration smith et al 2010 different farming managements e g straw incorporation fertilization irrigation can help with sequestration of carbon in soil by increasing soc and reducing the available carbon for ghg emission thereby contributing to climate change mitigation tang et al 2023 yagioka et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 this study observed 0 9 1 7 increase in the concentration of soc with si as compared to a 0 5 0 9 increase with sr fig s6 p 0 05 which caused a 28 9 119 8 higher of δsoc under si than sr table 1 lal 2007 reported that the rate of soc accrual reached 0 3 0 5 mg c ha 1 yr 1 equivalate to 0 12 0 19 g kg 1 yr 1 increase of soc concentration under intensive agricultural practices with use of crop straw corresponding to the observations in this study at the increase rate of 0 10 0 18 g kg 1 yr 1 table s3 as straw is incorporated up to 65 of wheat straw and 77 of maize straw are decomposed annually aiding significant soil c sequestration wang et al 2012 which highlighted strong potential for soil c sequestration in this region suggesting that use of straw can facilitate accumulation of soc in agroecosystems and be considered for future agricultural management practices irrigation changes the soil water environmental conditions and indirectly affects soil aeration microbial and enzymatic activity šnajdr et al 2008 thus affecting nutrient mineralization and its utilization by plants kamoni et al 2015 soc increased by 1 4 3 3 under drip irrigation as compared to fp fig 2 it means irrigation benefited from the accumulation of soc as demonstrated in a previous study zhang et al 2020 increasing soil moisture by heavy flood irrigation can inhibit the decomposition of soil organic matter under general anaerobic conditions moyano et al 2013 during all treatments the highest δsoc 1882 0 367 3 kg co2 eq ha 1 yr 1 was found under sdi treatment using si table 1 the reason probably was the longer duration and higher wfps fig s5 due to the irrigation water was supplied into sub surface soil layer 10 cm to reduce the water evaporation but increased the water moisture which inhibited the mineralization of soc by microorganisms bozkurt and mansuroglu 2018 cai et al 2021 thus contributed to soc increase fig 4 however compared to the high soc concentration of 14 5 23 2 g kg 1 in europe and us gao et al 2018 there is still a large potential to increase soc concentration in recent agroecosystems 4 3 n2o and ch4 emissions the n2o emissions are produced from soil under both aerobic and anaerobic conditions mutegi et al 2010 whereas ch4 emissions from irrigated soil are controlled by the production oxidation and transport processes and produced under strictly anaerobic conditions as a terminal product of anaerobic mineralization of soil organic matter som lagomarsino et al 2016 in this study a significant reduction in annual n2o emissions was observed in di sdi and fp under si by 23 8 19 4 and 17 4 respectively fig 6 crop straw with a high c n ratio 25 usually interacted with n fertilization and forces the microbial n immobilization by reducing the available n pool for nitrifiers and denitrifying microbes the c n ratio of wheat and maize straw utilized in this study was greater than 25 as shown by xu et al 2019 and li et al 2021a which might explain the significant reduction in n2o production the ch4 emissions were shown to be significantly and positively related to soc concentration wang et al 2019 huang et al 2022 for example the increment of soc concentration showed in fig 2 can provide abundant methanogenic substrates for methanogens thus stimulating ch4 production and consequent emissions under si as compared to sr overall the si benefited n2o mitigation but inhibited the ch4 uptake in the past several decades many studies have looked at the effects of water conditions on n2o and ch4 emissions in wheat maize cropping systems kennedy et al 2013 sainju et al 2014 li et al 2019 zhao et al 2021 the most used water saving irrigation regimes include sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation subsurface drip irrigation and partial rooting irrigation a global meta analysis shows that drip irrigation significantly reduced n2o emissions by 32 and 46 when compared to furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems respectively kuang et al 2021 estimate from this study show the average emission factor of n2o was 0 35 under drip irrigation as compared to 1 reduction of n2o calculated by ipcc lower n2o emissions are associated with several factors first soil water content under drip irrigation is lower than conventional irrigation inhibiting the activity of n2o producing microbes and thereby reducing n2o production sánchez martín et al 2008 secondly lower concentrations of n supplied through drip irrigation system fertigation are better utilized by crops and thus prevent its losses to the environment kennedy et al 2013 thirdly using subsurface driplines under the 10 cm of soil layer sdi prevents accumulation of n fertilizer over the surface soil when water evaporates thus resulting in higher wfps fig s5 than di and limiting the gas diffusivity i e the diffusion of soil n2o into the atmosphere the soil in northern china is a sink for ch4 emissions fig 7 li et al 2019 water saving irrigation regimes are therefore beneficial in reducing ch4 emissions in wheat maize fields and ensure stable crop yield at the same time wu et al 2019 in fig 5 only a peak flux of ch4 can be observed after flood irrigation this is likely due to the anaerobic soil conditions that stimulated methanogenic bacteria following heavy irrigation and therefore resulted in a substantial increase in ch4 emissions during the wheat and maize seasons itoh et al 2011 sdi can lead to aerobic conditions allowing oxidation of ch4 due to lower soil moisture as compared to fp fig s5 evidently sdi and pri were the best methods for n2o mitigation and ch4 sink 4 4 net gwp and ghgi net gwp is often calculated by using co2 equivalents of soil i e the ch4 and n2o emissions along with different farm management and agrochemical inputs ruan and philip robertson 2013 huang et al 2022 however these measurements do not take into account co2 emissions from soil gao et al 2018 here the fate of ghgs including direct soil n2o and ch4 emissions indirect different farm management and agrochemical inputs and soc change needed to be considered when calculating the net ghg sink or source sainju et al 2014 gao et al 2018 drip irrigation is beneficial in directly reducing greenhouse gas emissions i e n2o and ch4 mitigation and also indirect ghg i e power for irrigation emissions and sdi and pri have been identified as the best choices for this objective fig s3 table 1 the reduction in n2o emissions might offset the increase of ch4 emissions when straw is incorporated and help to further decrease direct ghg emissions in a cropping system ch4 fluxes generally did not contribute to net gwp sainju et al 2014 however indirect ghgs released from fertilizer pesticides seeds power use for irrigation diesel fuel polyethylene lines and labour may have strongly contributed to net gwp and followed by δsoc zhang et al 2020 overall sdi significantly improved δsoc and lowered n2o production and power for irrigation thus reduced the net gwp under si as compared to sr the net gwp values of drip irrigation were significant lower than that of fp which was comparable with previous studies yagioka et al 2015 ghgi provides a platform for comparing the effects of irrigation and straw practices on net gwp per unit of yield grassini and cassman 2012 gao et al 2018 in our study ghgi was observed to be significant lower in di 283 3 kg co2 eq mg 1 and sdi 217 4 kg co2 eq mg 1 under si as compared to sr table 1 which is similar to 117 3 223 7 kg co2 eq mg 1 reported in the united states cavigelli et al 2009 grassini and cassman 2012 and is also lower than that of 491 3 535 3 kg co2 eq mg 1 reported in china gao et al 2018 for irrigated wheat and maize systems additionally the lowest ghgi was found in sdi under si because of the highest annual yield therefore sdi combined with si is concluded to be the best combination for improved grain yield with lower ghg emissions however many previous studies have indicated that china still has a large potential to reduce net gwp and ghgi it is therefore an essential target for future sustainable agriculture to close the gap between china and other developed countries with low net gwp and ghgi ju et al 2009 chen et al 2014 gao et al 2018 5 conclusion limited irrigation water resources and high storage of crop residue are the main challenges faced by resource managers in intensive wheat maize cropping system in northern china fertigation treatments i e di sdi and pri are all significantly contributed to reduce gwpi net gwp and ghgi under si or sr as compared to fp sdi significantly decreased the n2o production and increased soil c sequestration reducing net gwp and ghgi under si when compared with sr under si pri resulted in the lowest annual yield which was not beneficial to reduce ghgi therefore sdi combined with si simultaneously mitigated ghg emissions reduced the global warming potential improved yield and enhanced soil c sequestration making it an alternative and effective method for the sustainable farming system with minimal environmental damage

8974,water resources shortage and unreasonable application of nitrogen fertilizer has been a problem in the wheat production of north china plain it is crucial to further increase wheat grain yield quality and resource use efficiency under limited water and nitrogen supply the aim of this study was to determine a nitrogen application mode to simultaneously improve wheat grain yield quality water and nitrogen use efficiency and clarify its enhancement mechanism a field experiment was conducted during the growing season of winter wheat in 2018 2021 under the total nitrogen application rate of 210 kg ha 1 three nitrogen base to topdressing ratios were set as b1 3 7 b2 5 5 and b3 7 3 respectively carbon and nitrogen metabolism characteristics of winter wheat was measured additionally water and nitrogen use were explored results showed that increasing the ratio of nitrogen topdressing b1 and b2 significantly improved the chlorophyll content net photosynthetic rate glutamine synthetase activity nitrate reductase activity and soluble protein content during grain filling on average compared with b3 treatment 1000 grain weight and total protein content in b1 were significantly increased by 7 6 and 48 6 and those in b2 were significantly increased by 4 5 and 4 5 respectively compared with b1 and b3 treatments the spike number and grain weight under b2 treatment were the most harmonious and the yield increased by 3 7 and 5 7 respectively additionally b2 treatment significantly enhanced soil water consumption decreased no3 n accumulation finally increased water and nitrogen use efficiency in summary when the total nitrogen application rate was 210 kg ha 1 under the micro sprinkler irrigation optimizing the ratio of base to topdressing of nitrogen fertilizer 5 5 could coordinate the post anthesis carbon and nitrogen metabolism and synergistically improve the grain yield protein content as well as water and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat keywords winter wheat base to topdressing ratio grain yield grain protein content water and nitrogen use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat has a unique gluten structure and it can be made into a variety of pasta foods providing food for more than 30 of the world s population li et al 2019a however current wheat production is still not enough to feed the world s growing population considering the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 about 12 of the world s population experienced extreme food insecurity and around 660 million people may still face hunger in 2030 https data unicef org resources sofi 2021 therefore it is of great significance to further increase wheat yield and quality to ensure food security and eliminate hunger and poverty wheat grains are mainly composed of 60 70 starch and 8 18 protein zörb et al 2018 and the content of protein in grains is an important standard to judge the quality and price of strong gluten wheat ma et al 2021 unfortunately it was found there is a significant negative correlation between wheat grain yield and protein content zörb et al 2018 mosleth et al 2020 which can be explained by c n competition and starch dilution of protein barraclough et al 2014 zhang et al 2021a acreche and slafer 2009 carbon and nitrogen metabolism are the two most basic metabolic processes in plants they are the crucial procedures that determine plant quality and yield coruzzi et al 2001 photosynthetic carbon assimilation is the important process in carbon metabolism and the photosynthetic rate after anthesis directly affects grain filling and grain size aranjuelo et al 2011 evans 1983 the essential enzymes in nitrogen metabolism are nitrate reductase nr and glutamine synthetase gs and their actions influence the ultimate accumulation and utilization of nitrogen masclaux daubresse et al 2010 carbon and nitrogen metabolism are also competing and dependent on each other coruzzi et al 2001 baslam et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 carbon metabolism requires nitrogen metabolism to provide other substances such as photosynthetic enzymes nunes nesi et al 2010 baslam et al 2020 chlorophyll nucleic acids and metabolic substances required for photosynthesis in turn n metabolism need carbon metabolism to supply the reducing power atp and c skeletons for n assimilation nunes nesi et al 2010 pask et al 2012 so the relationship between grain yield and protein content was not always negative recent studies have shown that the negative correlation between grain yield and protein content can be weakened or even broken to achieve the simultaneous improvement of grain yield and quality wu et al 2022 li et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 and it was proved that the coordination of the carbon and nitrogen metabolism post anthesis is a key strategy for improving the yield and protein content of winter wheat since wheat grain filling and protein accumulation primarily occur post anthesis huang et al 2020 the most direct and efficient agronomic strategy for controlling c n metabolism in winter wheat is nitrogen management as for nitrogen fertilizer application rate the recommended suitable nitrogen application rate in the north china plain ncp is 180 240 kg ha 1 if the nitrogen application rate is lower than or higher than this it may cause problems such as reduced production or low nitrogen use efficiency wang et al 2017 si et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 moreover the unreasonable use of nitrogen fertilizer has brought a series of problems to the environment such as water eutrophication groundwater nitrate pollution greenhouse gas emissions and so on axinte et al 2015 yang et al 2017 tedone et al 2018 therefore the optimization of nitrogen fertilizer management strategy is of great significance for high yield high quality and green production of winter wheat for a long time agronomists have summed up the most effective n fertilizer management strategies such as split n fertilizer n fertilizer late application change n fertilizer form and so on xue et at 2016 shi et al 2012 lyu et al 2022 among them the most simple and practical method is to optimize the base to topdressing ratio of nitrogen fertilizer under the premise of base fertilizer application topdressing nitrogen fertilizer in the late growth period can effectively improve wheat yield and nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2018a zhang et al 2021c wan et al 2021 as for the effect of the ratio of base fertilizer to topdressing fertilizer many research results are different zheng et al 2021 showed that the base to topdressing ratio of 7 3 was the best nitrogen fertilizer operation for wheat xu et al 2018 showed that 4 6 was the local nitrogen fertilizer operation with high yield high nitrogen use efficiency and high benefit saleem kubar et al 2021 believed that the base to topdressing ratio of 6 4 was optimal for yield while many studies believed that 5 5 was the ratio with the highest yield and efficiency shi et al 2012 abubakar et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the differences in these results are due to the differences in varieties and natural environments although these results are of reference significance but these results are obtained under enough irrigation condition under limited irrigation and efficient water saving technology the nitrogen management strategy is not clear in crop production water supply is essential to increase crop yield the primary region in china for the production of winter wheat is the ncp zhang et al 2015 however the winter wheat production in ncp is severely limited by the lack of rainfall in spring groundwater overexploitation and water shortage zhang et al 2010 ma et al 2018 therefore various irrigation systems and techniques have been applied to further improve wheat yield and water use efficiency such as the disposable pre sowing irrigation sun et al 2019 supplemental irrigation based on measurement of moisture content meng et al 2015 and micro sprinkler irrigation integration li et al 2019b and so on among them the application of water fertilizer integration technology of micro sprinkler irrigation has the most significant effect on increasing production and saving water liu et al 2013 because it has many advantages such as uniform irrigation man et al 2014a b improved microclimate of the population significantly increased crop yield water and nitrogen use efficiency and reduced soil nitrate leaching li et al 2018b our previous study showed that the yield water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency increased by 5 7 22 2 10 27 8 and 10 4 16 8 respectively under micro sprinkler irrigation at a nitrogen application rate of 195 kg ha 1 compared to traditional irrigation li et al 2019c however the optimal ratio of base to topdressing for nitrogen fertilizer under this mode and its effect on the yield and quality of winter wheat are still unclear and further studies are needed in this study we hypothesized that under water saving cultivation optimizing the nitrogen fertilizer basal to topdressing ratio could coordinate the post anthesis carbon and nitrogen metabolism of winter wheat thereby synergistically increasing grain yield and protein content and having a good regulating effect on water and nitrogen use efficiency specifically the purpose of this study is 1 to explore the strategy of high yield high efficiency and green n fertilizer base topdressing ratio application under the micro sprinkler irrigation condition 2 to clarify the physiological mechanism of different nitrogen fertilizer base to topdressing ratios affecting carbon and nitrogen metabolism yield and protein accumulation as well as water and nitrogen utilization of winter wheat in the north china plain 2

yao et al 2023 the kjeldahl nitrogen determination method dordas and sioulas 2009 was used to determine the total protein and protein components content and the n to protein conversion factor was 5 7 rossmann et al 2019 2 2 6 soil water consumption water use efficiency and crop water productivity before sowing at jointing stage booting stage anthesis stage grain filling stage and maturity soil samples of 0 200 cm were taken at 20 cm intervals after the collection of soil samples some of the samples were heated to 105 c in an oven to maintain a constant weight and some of the samples were used to measure the content of nitrate nitrogen in the soil soil volumetric water content was determined by gravimetric water content and bulk density soil water balance equation zhang et al 2011 was

based on the time between sowing and maturity r stands for runoff d for drainage beneath in the soil profile of 200 cm and cr for capillary rise into the root zone the experimental site s groundwater table is 7 9 m 4 m below the surface hence cr was negligible in the ncp including at the experimental site r and d may also be ignored gao et al 2017a the water productivity wp kg m3 was calculated as the grain yield divided by the et gao et al 2021 wp gy et where gy is grain yield water use efficiency wue m3 m 3 was calculated as the ratio of evapotranspiration et to the sum of effective precipitation p and irrigation i perry et al 2009 wue et p i 2 2 7 soil no3 n content and nitrogen utilization an ultraviolet spectrophotometer was used to measure the content of soil no3 n and 0 01 mol l 1 cacl2 was used to extract soil samples wang et al 2015 no3 n accumulation sna in 2 m soil was the sum of no3 n in each layer zhang et al 2013 nitrogen accumulation at maturity nam was

grain n accumulation divided by nitrogen accumulation at maturity ruisi et al 2016 2 3 statistical analysis analyses of 2 way variance anova were performed in spss with version 20 0 spss inc chicago il usa the least significant difference lsd at the 0 05 level was used origin2022 originlab corp northampton ma usa was used to draw the figures 3 results 3 1 flag leaf chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthetic rate as shown in fig 2 the chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate of flag leaves increased first and then decreased post anthesis the highest value occurred at 14 days post anthesis and the trend was similar in the two years during the whole grain filling process post anthesis the trend of chlorophyll content of flag leaves was b1 b2 b3 and there was significant difference among treatments the trend of net photosynthetic rate of flag leaf in different treatments was consistent with the chlorophyll content of flag leaf and the interannual variation pattern was consistent showing that b1 treatment was significantly higher than b2 and b3 treatment in conclusion increasing the proportion of topdressing significantly increased the chlorophyll content of flag leaves delayed the senescence of flag leaves and increased the net photosynthetic rate of flag leaves 3 2 dry matter accumulation it can be seen from table 2 the dry matter accumulation at anthesis post anthesis and maturity as well as harvest index of winter wheat were significantly affected by base to topdressing ratio b year y and b y at anthesis the dry matter accumulation of b1 treatment was significantly lower than that of b2 and b3 treatment however at post anthesis during the 2018 2019 growing season there was no significant difference in dry matter accumulation between b1 and b3 which were significantly lower than that of b2 during the 2019 2021 growing season there was no significant difference in post anther dry matter accumulation between b1 and b2 treatments but they were significantly higher than that of b3 treatment at maturity three years of experiments had the same trend b2 treatment obtained the highest dry matter accumulation in terms of harvest index the trend was similar in the three years b3 treatment was significantly lower than that of b1 and b2 treatment and there was no significant difference between b1 and b2 3 3 grain filling 3 3 1 grain dry matter accumulation dynamics as shown in fig 3 the variation of 1000 seed weight after anthesis was similar during the three years showing a sigmoid curve trend of slowly increasing at first then rapidly increasing and finally slowly increasing during the early stage 7 14 days of grain filling the grain weight of b3 treatment was the highest in the middle stage 14 21 days of grain filling there was no significant difference in grain weight among treatments in the late stage 21 35 days of grain filling the grain weight of b1 treatment was significantly higher than that of b2 and b3 treatment and b3 treatment was the lowest in conclusion increasing the proportion of topdressing can significantly increase the grain weight at the later stage of grain filling 21 35 days 3 3 2 filling parameters for grains as shown in table 3 different topdressing ratio treatments had significant effects on the grain filling parameters of gy 2018 according to the average values of the three years the theoretical 1 000 grain weight and maximum grain filling rate of b1 treatment were significantly higher than those of b2 and b3 treatment b1 treatment significantly delayed the time to reach the maximum grain filling rate and significantly increased the grain filling rate in the middle and later stages it can be concluded that increasing the proportion of topdressing improved the maximum filling rate the maximum grain filling time was also delayed so the total grain filling time was prolonged and the 1000 grain weight was finally increased 3 4 grain yield components and yield according to table 4 different basal ratio treatments and years significantly affected the number of tillers in the vegetative growth period of gy2018 b3 treatment significantly increased the number of tillers in the overwintering stage and jointing stage and then increased the spike number at maturity however b3 treatment significantly reduced the tiller heading rate resulting in certain ineffective tillers the tiller heading rate in b2 treatment was significantly higher than that in b3 treatment but there was no significant difference in the spike number at maturity between b2 and b3 the spike number number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight and grain yield of winter wheat were significantly affected by base to topdressing ratio b and the interaction of b y year the year type also had significant effect on spike number 1000 grain weight and grain yield the three years experiments all showed that with the increase of basal fertilizer ratio the spike number increased and reached the maximum value in b3 7 3 treatment and b1 3 7 treatment was significantly lower than b3 treatment however there was no significant difference between b2 and b3 base to topdressing ratio treatments had no significant effect on kernel number per spike the higher kernel number per spike in 2018 2019 was due to the lower temperature and longer spike differentiation time of wheat in that year and the main stem mostly formed spike however the higher temperature in the spike differentiation period of wheat and the different degrees of stem basal rot disease resulted in the lower kernel number per spike in 2019 2021 with the increase of topdressing ratio the thousands grain weight tgw increased however there was no significant difference between b1 and b2 and they were significantly higher than b3 in terms of grain yield in 2018 2019 there was no significant difference between b1 and b3 treatments which were significantly lower than that of b2 treatment in 2019 2021 there was no significant difference between b1 and b2 treatments which were significantly higher than that of b3 treatment in conclusion b1 treatment had the lowest spike number but the highest tgw which made up for the loss of yield to a certain extent b3 treatment had higher spike number but significantly lower tgw so the yield was significantly lower than b2 and similar to b1 while the spike number and tgw in b2 treatment were both at a higher level so the yield was the highest 3 5 nitrogen metabolism as shown in fig 4 different basal ratio treatments significantly affected the activities of glutamine synthetase gs and nitrate reductase nr of flag leaves after anthesis in gy 2018 the changes of nr activity were slightly different between years from 2019 2020 it increased first and then decreased with the grain filling and reached the highest level at the 14th day post anthesis from 2020 2021 nr activity showed a downward trend with the grain filling and the highest value occurred at 7 days post anthesis the trend among different basal ratio treatments was b1 b2 b3 and the difference was significant the changes of gs activity were consistent between the years and showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with the grain filling during the grain filling stage b1 treatment was always significantly higher than b3 treatment the effects of different basal ratio treatments on soluble proteins content of flag leaves in gy 2018 were basically the same for the two years b1 treatment was always significantly higher than b2 and b3 treatment during the whole grain filling process and b2 treatment was significantly higher than b3 treatment at 14 21 and 28 days after flowering in conclusion increasing the proportion of topdressing significantly increased the activities of key enzymes of protein synthesis and the soluble protein content in flag leaves 3 6 grain protein components according to table 5 the contents of grain protein components in gy 2018 were significantly affected by year and different basal ratio treatments from the average of three years there was no significant difference in albumin and globulin among the treatments compared with b2 and b3 treatments b1 treatment significantly increased the contents of gliadin and glutenin in grains and then significantly increased the total protein content there was no significant difference in the residual protein content among treatments in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 while the b1 treatment was significantly higher than the b2 and b3 treatments in 2020 2021 in conclusion increasing the proportion of topdressing significantly increased the storage protein content and then promoted the accumulation of total protein in grains 3 7 soil water utilization 3 7 1 soil water content according to fig 5 different base to topdressing ratio treatments had significant effects on the spatio temporal dynamics of soil moisture in winter wheat and across the three years the variations in soil water content were similar at the jointing stage the soil water content in the upper soil layer 0 100 cm was b3 b2 b1 while there was no significant difference among the treatments in the soil water content in the deep soil layer 100 200 cm it can be concluded that reducing the proportion of basal fertilizer increased the consumption of upper soil water by winter wheat at jointing stage the results at booting stage and jointing stage were similar and there was little difference between treatments in the upper soil 0 120 cm in 2019 2020 which was due to the high rainfall in this year at the anthesis and filling stage the difference of soil water content among the three base ratio treatments was further reduced at maturity in 2018 2019 the water content in the 0 40 cm and 160 200 cm soil layers in b2 treatment was lower than that of the other two treatments in 2019 2020 the water content in the 100 200 cm soil layer was lower in b2 treatment than that of b1 and b3 treatment in 2020 2021 the b2 treatment also had the lowest soil water content at 140 180 cm in general b1 treatment consumed more soil water in the upper layer before jointing stage which may increase the absorption of soil fertilizer and water due to the low base fertilizer amount after the anthesis the water consumption of b2 treatment increased and the gap between the three basal ratio treatments narrowed until maturity the soil water content of b2 treatment was lower than that of b1 3 7 2 crop water productivity and water use efficiency according to table 6 the b and y significantly affect the total evapotranspiration et soil water consumption δsw crop water productivity wp and water use efficiency wue y b also significantly affected wp from the perspective of rainfall in the three years of the experiment 2018 2019 was a dry year 2020 2021 was a normal year and 2019 2020 had the most precipitation which was a wet year in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 et δsw and wue of b2 treatment were significantly higher than those of b1 and b3 treatment but there was no significant difference between b1 and b3 treatment in 2020 2021 there was no significant difference in et δsw and wue among the three base to topdressing ratio treatments while b1 and b2 had higher wp than b3 from the three year average et δsw and wue in b2 were significantly higher than b1 and b3 while there was no significant difference in wp between b1 and b2 and they were significantly higher than b3 3 8 nitrogen utilization 3 8 1 nitrate nitrogen residue in soil according to fig 6 different base to topdressing ratio treatments had significant effects on soil nitrate nitrogen no3 n content in winter wheat at each growth stage the results of the 3 year field experiment were similar with the increase of soil depth soil no3 n content decreased first and then increased at the jointing stage the no3 n content of the upper soil 0 120 cm showed a trend of b3 b2 b1 and b3 was significantly higher than b1 treatment at booting stage the difference of soil no3 n content among the three treatments tended to narrow but the no3 n content of b1 treatment was still the lowest at anthesis the no3 n content in the surface layer 0 40 cm of b1 treatment was significantly higher than that of the other two treatments in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 this is because the topdressing amount of b1 treatment 36 75 kg ha 1 was higher than that of b2 26 25 kg ha 1 and b3 15 75 kg ha 1 at the filling stage and maturity the no3 n content in the soil surface layer 0 20 cm showed a pattern of b1 b2 b3 and the difference between treatments was significant in addition the no3 n content in the deep soil 120 180 cm of b2 treatment was significantly lower than that of b3 treatment in conclusion increasing the proportion of topdressing b1 significantly increased soil no3 n content in the surface layer 0 40 cm while increasing the proportion of base fertilizer b3 increased soil no3 n content in the deep layer 140 200 cm b2 kept the lower soil no3 n content in deep soil layers especially at maturity 3 8 2 nitrogen accumulation and utilization it can be seen from table 7 that b and y significantly affected total nitrogen accumulation of plants soil nitrate nitrogen accumulation nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen harvest index of winter wheat the interaction of b y also had significant effects on nitrogen accumulation and n use efficiency the total nitrogen accumulation of winter wheat plants increased first and then decreased with the increase of base fertilizer ratio and the maximum value was reached in b2 treatment which was significantly higher than that in b1 and b3 treatment and the trend of the three years was consistent in terms of soil no3 n accumulation b1 treatment was significantly higher than b2 and b3 treatment and the 3 year trend was consistent in terms of nue in 2018 2019 b2 treatment was significantly higher than b1 and b3 treatment there was no significant difference between b1 and b3 treatment in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 there was no significant difference between b1 and b2 treatments but they were significantly higher than b3 treatment from the three year average the nue of b3 treatment was significantly lower than b2 treatment in terms of nitrogen harvest index nhi b1 treatment was significantly higher than b3 treatment in conclusion b1 treatment had higher soil no3 n accumulation than b2 and b3 also had higher nhi than b3 treatment however the nitrogen accumulation and nue of b2 treatment reached the maximum at maturity while b3 treatment showed poor performance in all indexes 4 discussion 4 1 synergistical increase in grain yield and protein content it is known well that wheat yield and quality are determined by carbon and nitrogen metabolism in plants coruzzi et al 2001 and coordinating the carbon and nitrogen metabolism post anthesis is expected to simultaneously improve the yield and protein content of winter wheat huang et al 2020 in our present study we also found wheat carbon and nitrogen metabolism were enhanced simultaneously and grain weight and protein content were simultaneously increased when topdressing n was increased under micro sprinkler irrigation tables 4 and 5 the physiological mechanism of the synergistic increase of grain weight and protein content in winter wheat under this experimental condition may be fig 7 increasing the percentage of canopy n topdressing under micro sprinkler irrigation significantly increased the activities of key enzymes gs and nr of n metabolism in wheat fig 4 which could provide essential substances for carbon metabolism such as photosynthetic enzymes while increasing the content of soluble protein in flag leaf fig 4 and grain nunes nesi et al 2010 baslam et al 2020 on the other hand increasing the proportion of canopy nitrogen topdressing led to a significant increase in carbon metabolic processes which significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate of flag leaves and grain filling rate fig 2 table 3 while at the same time carbon metabolic processes provided energy material and carbon skeleton for nitrogen metabolic processes cheng et al 2019 baslam et al 2020 and this significant increase in carbon metabolism may offset the competition between them for energy and c skeleton in addition 80 of grain protein content was gliadin and glutenin and these two proteins were mainly formed in the middle and late grain filling stage luo et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 in this experiment the increase of nitrogen topdressing ratio under micro sprinkler irrigation may promote the synthesis of storage protein because under micro sprinkler irrigation condition topdressing n was sprayed in the plant canopy which may accelerate the nitrogen absorption and protein accumulation in plants previous studies have shown that foliar leaf nitrogen application can significantly increase grain protein content lyu et al 2022 gooding and davies 1992 in brief the co promotion of post anthesis carbon and nitrogen metabolism ultimately increased grain weight and grain protein content under higher topdressing n ratio yet wheat yield formation is complex the yield is composed of three elements spikes per unit land area grains per spike and grain weight grafius 1972 prystupa et al 2004 it is the most direct and effective way to increase the spike number by increasing the seed quantity xu et al 2018 increasing the dry matter and nitrogen content of spike before anthesis can increase grain number per spike but the effect is very limited abbate et al 1995 thousand grain weight is mainly formed post anthesis and is often the most difficult to control however in our study different n fertilizer base to topdressing ratios had significant regulatory effects on spike number and 1000 grain weight especially 1000 grain weight but had no significant effect on grains per spike table 4 obviously increasing the proportion of basal fertilizer had a certain promotion effect on increasing the spike number but excessive basal fertilizer could not significantly increase the spike number xu et al 2018 because excessive basal fertilizer may affect the number of tillers of winter wheat and then increase the number of ineffective tillers darwinkel 1978 such results were also found in this study table 4 the yield components restrict and influence each other and population also has self regulating function freeze et al 1990 the spike number and 1000 grain weight are negatively correlated tompkins et al 1991 and the appropriate base to topdressing ratio is beneficial to balance the negative correlation between spike number and 1000 grain weight in this study the optimum nitrogen fertilizer base ratio b2 5 5 adjusted the contradiction between spike number and 1000 grain weight and the highest grain yield was obtained therefore b2 treatment is the best choice to achieve high yield and high protein content 4 2 nitrogen management and efficient use of resources nitrogen and water are essential elements for plant growth and development li et al 2015 soil water and soil nitrogen are mutually affected and coupled zain et al 2021 in this study soil water consumption δsw seasonal evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue were significantly regulated by different base to topdressing ratio treatments the δsw and et of b2 5 5 treatment were the highest at maturity so the wue was significantly higher than that of b1 and b3 treatments compared with b1 and b3 the grain yield of b2 treatment increased by 3 7 and 5 7 respectively while the et only increased by 2 8 and 2 8 respectively the increase of yield was higher than that of et so the b2 treatment crop water productivity wp was still the highest tables 4 and 6 this is consistent with the results of zhang et al 2020 irrigation is an important factor affecting crop water productivity and water use efficiency in crop production our previous studies showed that compared with traditional border irrigation and drip irrigation water use efficiency of wheat increased by 17 and 5 under micro sprinkler irrigation li et al 2018b the water use efficiency and drought resistance of wheat were also significantly improved by increasing the ratio of topdressing n zain et al 2021 in this study wp and wue were further improved by optimizing the base fertilizer ratio of nitrogen fertilizer under the water saving cultivation technology of micro sprinkler irrigation and water fertilizer integration therefore further optimization of nitrogen management in the context of water management can further improve the water saving potential of crops in this study increasing the proportion of topdressing improved nitrogen use efficiency nue and nitrogen harvest index nhi table 7 shi et al 2007 also showed that increasing the proportion of topdressing significantly improved nue of topdressing nitrogen and a 15n experiment showed that foliar nitrogen fertilizer application before and after heading stage resulted in a nitrogen recovery of up to 70 and 90 of the nitrogen could enter the grain at maturity gooding and davies 1992 moreover under the condition of water fertilizer integration of micro sprinkler irrigation in this experiment the spraying of water and fertilizer in the late growth stage increased the way of nitrogen absorption of plants which had the effect of foliar fertilizer and improved nitrogen absorption rossmann et al 2019 therefore a reasonable increase in the proportion of topdressing is an effective method to improve water and nitrogen use efficiency simultaneously 4 3 environmentally friendly nitrogen management strategies the unreasonable application of nitrogen fertilizer is the main reason of nitrate pollution and greenhouse gas emission in groundwater pappa et al 2011 wang et al 2018 under this experimental condition the residual no3 n in the 2 m soil at maturity was significantly different under different nitrogen fertilizer base to topdressing ratio treatments increasing the ratio of base fertilizer b3 had significantly higher no3 n residue in the deep soil of 140 200 cm than the other two treatments while b2 5 5 had the lowest no3 n residue in the deep soil and the lowest risk of groundwater pollution fig 6 although increasing the ratio of topdressing 3 7 significantly increased the accumulation of no3 n in 2 m of soil at maturity the no3 n was mainly distributed in the soil surface 0 40 cm and the residual no3 n in the deep soil was still very low fig 6 therefore if the residual no3 n in the surface layer can be reasonably used it will be a good choice for example in cases where significant amounts of no3 n remain in the soil surface layer after wheat harvest subsequent crops e g corn or soybeans can use the residual n ultimately this can lead to increased yields and improved resource use efficiency for both wheat and subsequent crops this provides a good idea for us to further optimize water and nitrogen supply to improve annual wheat and maize yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency in the future in addition more studies have shown that the optimized nitrogen fertilizer base to topdressing ratio of 5 5 treatment can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and economic input zhang et al 2021b xu et al 2018 therefore optimizing the base to topdressing ratio of nitrogen fertilizer is an effective way for winter wheat to achieve high yield high efficiency green and economic goals 5 conclusions under the same total nitrogen application rate 210 kg ha 1 condition increasing the ratio of nitrogen topdressing b1 and b2 significantly improved the chlorophyll content net photosynthetic rate glutamine synthetase activity nitrate reductase activity soluble protein content of flag leaf during grain filling finally the 1000 grain weight and total protein content of b1 were significantly increased by 7 6 and 48 6 and that of b2 was significantly increased by 4 5 and 4 5 on average as compared with b3 treatment compared with b1 and b3 treatments the spike number and grain weight of b2 treatment were the most harmonious and the yield increased by 3 7 and 5 7 respectively additionally b2 treatment significantly enhanced soil water consumption decreased no3 n accumulation finally increased water and nitrogen use efficiency in conclusion when the total amount of nitrogen applied in water saving cultivation with micro sprinkler irrigation was 210 kg ha 1 optimizing the ratio of base to topdressing 5 5 for nitrogen fertilizer could coordinate post anthesis carbon and nitrogen metabolism which significantly improved the yield of winter wheat and synergistically improved grain protein content and water

8974,water resources shortage and unreasonable application of nitrogen fertilizer has been a problem in the wheat production of north china plain it is crucial to further increase wheat grain yield quality and resource use efficiency under limited water and nitrogen supply the aim of this study was to determine a nitrogen application mode to simultaneously improve wheat grain yield quality water and nitrogen use efficiency and clarify its enhancement mechanism a field experiment was conducted during the growing season of winter wheat in 2018 2021 under the total nitrogen application rate of 210 kg ha 1 three nitrogen base to topdressing ratios were set as b1 3 7 b2 5 5 and b3 7 3 respectively carbon and nitrogen metabolism characteristics of winter wheat was measured additionally water and nitrogen use were explored results showed that increasing the ratio of nitrogen topdressing b1 and b2 significantly improved the chlorophyll content net photosynthetic rate glutamine synthetase activity nitrate reductase activity and soluble protein content during grain filling on average compared with b3 treatment 1000 grain weight and total protein content in b1 were significantly increased by 7 6 and 48 6 and those in b2 were significantly increased by 4 5 and 4 5 respectively compared with b1 and b3 treatments the spike number and grain weight under b2 treatment were the most harmonious and the yield increased by 3 7 and 5 7 respectively additionally b2 treatment significantly enhanced soil water consumption decreased no3 n accumulation finally increased water and nitrogen use efficiency in summary when the total nitrogen application rate was 210 kg ha 1 under the micro sprinkler irrigation optimizing the ratio of base to topdressing of nitrogen fertilizer 5 5 could coordinate the post anthesis carbon and nitrogen metabolism and synergistically improve the grain yield protein content as well as water and nitrogen use efficiency of winter wheat keywords winter wheat base to topdressing ratio grain yield grain protein content water and nitrogen use efficiency data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction wheat has a unique gluten structure and it can be made into a variety of pasta foods providing food for more than 30 of the world s population li et al 2019a however current wheat production is still not enough to feed the world s growing population considering the covid 19 pandemic in 2020 about 12 of the world s population experienced extreme food insecurity and around 660 million people may still face hunger in 2030 https data unicef org resources sofi 2021 therefore it is of great significance to further increase wheat yield and quality to ensure food security and eliminate hunger and poverty wheat grains are mainly composed of 60 70 starch and 8 18 protein zörb et al 2018 and the content of protein in grains is an important standard to judge the quality and price of strong gluten wheat ma et al 2021 unfortunately it was found there is a significant negative correlation between wheat grain yield and protein content zörb et al 2018 mosleth et al 2020 which can be explained by c n competition and starch dilution of protein barraclough et al 2014 zhang et al 2021a acreche and slafer 2009 carbon and nitrogen metabolism are the two most basic metabolic processes in plants they are the crucial procedures that determine plant quality and yield coruzzi et al 2001 photosynthetic carbon assimilation is the important process in carbon metabolism and the photosynthetic rate after anthesis directly affects grain filling and grain size aranjuelo et al 2011 evans 1983 the essential enzymes in nitrogen metabolism are nitrate reductase nr and glutamine synthetase gs and their actions influence the ultimate accumulation and utilization of nitrogen masclaux daubresse et al 2010 carbon and nitrogen metabolism are also competing and dependent on each other coruzzi et al 2001 baslam et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 carbon metabolism requires nitrogen metabolism to provide other substances such as photosynthetic enzymes nunes nesi et al 2010 baslam et al 2020 chlorophyll nucleic acids and metabolic substances required for photosynthesis in turn n metabolism need carbon metabolism to supply the reducing power atp and c skeletons for n assimilation nunes nesi et al 2010 pask et al 2012 so the relationship between grain yield and protein content was not always negative recent studies have shown that the negative correlation between grain yield and protein content can be weakened or even broken to achieve the simultaneous improvement of grain yield and quality wu et al 2022 li et al 2021 zhang et al 2022 and it was proved that the coordination of the carbon and nitrogen metabolism post anthesis is a key strategy for improving the yield and protein content of winter wheat since wheat grain filling and protein accumulation primarily occur post anthesis huang et al 2020 the most direct and efficient agronomic strategy for controlling c n metabolism in winter wheat is nitrogen management as for nitrogen fertilizer application rate the recommended suitable nitrogen application rate in the north china plain ncp is 180 240 kg ha 1 if the nitrogen application rate is lower than or higher than this it may cause problems such as reduced production or low nitrogen use efficiency wang et al 2017 si et al 2020 zhang et al 2018 moreover the unreasonable use of nitrogen fertilizer has brought a series of problems to the environment such as water eutrophication groundwater nitrate pollution greenhouse gas emissions and so on axinte et al 2015 yang et al 2017 tedone et al 2018 therefore the optimization of nitrogen fertilizer management strategy is of great significance for high yield high quality and green production of winter wheat for a long time agronomists have summed up the most effective n fertilizer management strategies such as split n fertilizer n fertilizer late application change n fertilizer form and so on xue et at 2016 shi et al 2012 lyu et al 2022 among them the most simple and practical method is to optimize the base to topdressing ratio of nitrogen fertilizer under the premise of base fertilizer application topdressing nitrogen fertilizer in the late growth period can effectively improve wheat yield and nitrogen use efficiency li et al 2018a zhang et al 2021c wan et al 2021 as for the effect of the ratio of base fertilizer to topdressing fertilizer many research results are different zheng et al 2021 showed that the base to topdressing ratio of 7 3 was the best nitrogen fertilizer operation for wheat xu et al 2018 showed that 4 6 was the local nitrogen fertilizer operation with high yield high nitrogen use efficiency and high benefit saleem kubar et al 2021 believed that the base to topdressing ratio of 6 4 was optimal for yield while many studies believed that 5 5 was the ratio with the highest yield and efficiency shi et al 2012 abubakar et al 2022 zhang et al 2020 the differences in these results are due to the differences in varieties and natural environments although these results are of reference significance but these results are obtained under enough irrigation condition under limited irrigation and efficient water saving technology the nitrogen management strategy is not clear in crop production water supply is essential to increase crop yield the primary region in china for the production of winter wheat is the ncp zhang et al 2015 however the winter wheat production in ncp is severely limited by the lack of rainfall in spring groundwater overexploitation and water shortage zhang et al 2010 ma et al 2018 therefore various irrigation systems and techniques have been applied to further improve wheat yield and water use efficiency such as the disposable pre sowing irrigation sun et al 2019 supplemental irrigation based on measurement of moisture content meng et al 2015 and micro sprinkler irrigation integration li et al 2019b and so on among them the application of water fertilizer integration technology of micro sprinkler irrigation has the most significant effect on increasing production and saving water liu et al 2013 because it has many advantages such as uniform irrigation man et al 2014a b improved microclimate of the population significantly increased crop yield water and nitrogen use efficiency and reduced soil nitrate leaching li et al 2018b our previous study showed that the yield water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency increased by 5 7 22 2 10 27 8 and 10 4 16 8 respectively under micro sprinkler irrigation at a nitrogen application rate of 195 kg ha 1 compared to traditional irrigation li et al 2019c however the optimal ratio of base to topdressing for nitrogen fertilizer under this mode and its effect on the yield and quality of winter wheat are still unclear and further studies are needed in this study we hypothesized that under water saving cultivation optimizing the nitrogen fertilizer basal to topdressing ratio could coordinate the post anthesis carbon and nitrogen metabolism of winter wheat thereby synergistically increasing grain yield and protein content and having a good regulating effect on water and nitrogen use efficiency specifically the purpose of this study is 1 to explore the strategy of high yield high efficiency and green n fertilizer base topdressing ratio application under the micro sprinkler irrigation condition 2 to clarify the physiological mechanism of different nitrogen fertilizer base to topdressing ratios affecting carbon and nitrogen metabolism yield and protein accumulation as well as water and nitrogen utilization of winter wheat in the north china plain 2

apart were selected to determine the dry matter weight at the anthesis z61 and maturity z91 zadoks et al 1974 the plants were decomposed into stems leaves and spikes at the anthesis and into stems leaves grains and the remaining parts at maturity the plants were weighed after being dried to a consistent weight at 75 c by subtracting the dry matter accumulation at anthesis and maturity the dry matter accumulation post anthesis was estimated the ratio of grain yield to total aboveground dry matter accumulated at maturity was used to construct harvest index 2 2 2 flag leaf chlorophyll content

yao et al 2023 the kjeldahl nitrogen determination method dordas and sioulas 2009 was used to determine the total protein and protein components content and the n to protein conversion factor was 5 7 rossmann et al 2019 2 2 6 soil water consumption water use efficiency and crop water productivity before sowing at jointing stage booting stage anthesis stage grain filling stage and maturity soil samples of 0 200 cm were taken at 20 cm intervals after the collection of soil samples some of the samples were heated to 105 c in an oven to maintain a constant weight and some of the samples were used to measure the content of nitrate nitrogen in the soil soil volumetric water content was determined by gravimetric water content and bulk density soil water balance equation zhang et al 2011 was

based on the time between sowing and maturity r stands for runoff d for drainage beneath in the soil profile of 200 cm and cr for capillary rise into the root zone the experimental site s groundwater table is 7 9 m 4 m below the surface hence cr was negligible in the ncp including at the experimental site r and d may also be ignored gao et al 2017a the water productivity wp kg m3 was calculated as

il usa the least significant difference lsd at the 0 05 level was used origin2022 originlab corp northampton ma usa was used to draw the figures 3 results 3 1 flag leaf chlorophyll concentration and net photosynthetic rate as shown in fig 2 the chlorophyll content and net photosynthetic rate of flag leaves increased first and then decreased post anthesis the highest value occurred at 14 days post anthesis and the trend was similar in the two years during the whole grain filling process post anthesis the trend of chlorophyll content of flag leaves was b1 b2 b3 and there was significant difference among treatments the trend of net photosynthetic rate of flag leaf in different treatments was consistent with the chlorophyll content of flag leaf and the interannual variation pattern was consistent showing that b1 treatment was significantly higher than b2 and b3 treatment in conclusion increasing the proportion of topdressing significantly increased the chlorophyll content of flag leaves delayed the senescence of flag leaves and increased the net photosynthetic rate of flag leaves 3 2 dry matter accumulation it can be seen from table 2 the dry matter accumulation at anthesis post anthesis and maturity as well as harvest index of winter wheat were significantly affected by base to topdressing ratio b year y and b y at anthesis the dry matter accumulation of b1 treatment was significantly lower than that of b2 and b3 treatment however at post anthesis during the 2018 2019 growing season there was no significant difference in dry matter accumulation between b1 and b3 which were significantly lower than that of b2 during the 2019 2021 growing season there was no significant difference in post anther dry matter accumulation between b1 and b2 treatments but they were significantly higher than that of b3 treatment at maturity three years of experiments had the same trend b2 treatment obtained the highest dry matter accumulation in terms of harvest index the trend was similar in the three years b3 treatment was significantly lower than that of b1 and b2 treatment and there was no significant difference between b1 and b2 3 3 grain filling 3 3 1 grain dry matter accumulation dynamics as shown in fig 3 the variation of 1000 seed weight after anthesis was similar during the three years showing a sigmoid curve trend of slowly increasing at first then rapidly increasing and finally slowly increasing during the early stage 7 14 days of grain filling the grain weight of b3 treatment was the highest in the middle stage 14 21 days of grain filling there was no significant difference in grain weight among treatments in the late stage 21 35 days of grain filling the grain weight of b1 treatment was significantly higher than that of b2 and b3 treatment and b3 treatment was the lowest in conclusion increasing the proportion of topdressing can significantly increase the grain weight at the later stage of grain filling 21 35 days 3 3 2 filling parameters for grains as shown in table 3 different topdressing ratio treatments had significant effects on the grain filling parameters of gy 2018 according to the average values of the three years the theoretical 1 000 grain weight and maximum grain filling rate of b1 treatment were significantly higher than those of b2 and b3 treatment b1 treatment significantly delayed the time to reach the maximum grain filling rate and significantly increased the grain filling rate in the middle and later stages it can be concluded that increasing the proportion of topdressing improved the maximum filling rate the maximum grain filling time was also delayed so the total grain filling time was prolonged and the 1000 grain weight was finally increased 3 4 grain yield components and yield according to table 4 different basal ratio treatments and years significantly affected the number of tillers in the vegetative growth period of gy2018 b3 treatment significantly increased the number of tillers in the overwintering stage and jointing stage and then increased the spike number at maturity however b3 treatment significantly reduced the tiller heading rate resulting in certain ineffective tillers the tiller heading rate in b2 treatment was significantly higher than that in b3 treatment but there was no significant difference in the spike number at maturity between b2 and b3 the spike number number of grains per spike 1000 grain weight and grain yield of winter wheat were significantly affected by base to topdressing ratio b and the interaction of b y year the year type also had significant effect on spike number 1000 grain weight and grain yield the three years experiments all showed that with the increase of basal fertilizer ratio the spike number increased and reached the maximum value in b3 7 3 treatment and b1 3 7 treatment was significantly lower than b3 treatment however there was no significant difference between b2 and b3 base to topdressing ratio treatments had no significant effect on kernel number per spike the higher kernel number per spike in 2018 2019 was due to the lower temperature and longer spike differentiation time of wheat in that year and the main stem mostly formed spike however the higher temperature in the spike differentiation period of wheat and the different degrees of stem basal rot disease resulted in the lower kernel number per spike in 2019 2021 with the increase of topdressing ratio the thousands grain weight tgw increased however there was no significant difference between b1 and b2 and they were significantly higher than b3 in terms of grain yield in 2018 2019 there was no significant difference between b1 and b3 treatments which were significantly lower than that of b2 treatment in 2019 2021 there was no significant difference between b1 and b2 treatments which were significantly higher than that of b3 treatment in conclusion b1 treatment had the lowest spike number but the highest tgw which made up for the loss of yield to a certain extent b3 treatment had higher spike number but significantly lower tgw so the yield was significantly lower than b2 and similar to b1 while the spike number and tgw in b2 treatment were both at a higher level so the yield was the highest 3 5 nitrogen metabolism as shown in fig 4 different basal ratio treatments significantly affected the activities of glutamine synthetase gs and nitrate reductase nr of flag leaves after anthesis in gy 2018 the changes of nr activity were slightly different between years from 2019 2020 it increased first and then decreased with the grain filling and reached the highest level at the 14th day post anthesis from 2020 2021 nr activity showed a downward trend with the grain filling and the highest value occurred at 7 days post anthesis the trend among different basal ratio treatments was b1 b2 b3 and the difference was significant the changes of gs activity were consistent between the years and showed a trend of increasing first and then decreasing with the grain filling during the grain filling stage b1 treatment was always significantly higher than b3 treatment the effects of different basal ratio treatments on soluble proteins content of flag leaves in gy 2018 were basically the same for the two years b1 treatment was always significantly higher than b2 and b3 treatment during the whole grain filling process and b2 treatment was significantly higher than b3 treatment at 14 21 and 28 days after flowering in conclusion increasing the proportion of topdressing significantly increased the activities of key enzymes of protein synthesis and the soluble protein content in flag leaves 3 6 grain protein components according to table 5 the contents of grain protein components in gy 2018 were significantly affected by year and different basal ratio treatments from the average of three years there was no significant difference in albumin and globulin among the treatments compared with b2 and b3 treatments b1 treatment significantly increased the contents of gliadin and glutenin in grains and then significantly increased the total protein content there was no significant difference in the residual protein content among treatments in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 while the b1 treatment was significantly higher than the b2 and b3 treatments in 2020 2021 in conclusion increasing the proportion of topdressing significantly increased the storage protein content and then promoted the accumulation of total protein in grains 3 7 soil water utilization 3 7 1 soil water content according to fig 5 different base to topdressing ratio treatments had significant effects on the spatio temporal dynamics of soil moisture in winter wheat and across the three years the variations in soil water content were similar at the jointing stage the soil water content in the upper soil layer 0 100 cm was b3 b2 b1 while there was no significant difference among the treatments in the soil water content in the deep soil layer 100 200 cm it can be concluded that reducing the proportion of basal fertilizer increased the consumption of upper soil water by winter wheat at jointing stage the results at booting stage and jointing stage were similar and there was little difference between treatments in the upper soil 0 120 cm in 2019 2020 which was due to the high rainfall in this year at the anthesis and filling stage the difference of soil water content among the three base ratio treatments was further reduced at maturity in 2018 2019 the water content in the 0 40 cm and 160 200 cm soil layers in b2 treatment was lower than that of the other two treatments in 2019 2020 the water content in the 100 200 cm soil layer was lower in b2 treatment than that of b1 and b3 treatment in 2020 2021 the b2 treatment also had the lowest soil water content at 140 180 cm in general b1 treatment consumed more soil water in the upper layer before jointing stage which may increase the absorption of soil fertilizer and water due to the low base fertilizer amount after the anthesis the water consumption of b2 treatment increased and the gap between the three basal ratio treatments narrowed until maturity the soil water content of b2 treatment was lower than that of b1 3 7 2 crop water productivity and water use efficiency according to table 6 the b and y significantly affect the total evapotranspiration et soil water consumption δsw crop water productivity wp and water use efficiency wue y b also significantly affected wp from the perspective of rainfall in the three years of the experiment 2018 2019 was a dry year 2020 2021 was a normal year and 2019 2020 had the most precipitation which was a wet year in 2018 2019 and 2019 2020 et δsw and wue of b2 treatment were significantly higher than those of b1 and b3 treatment but there was no significant difference between b1 and b3 treatment in 2020 2021 there was no significant difference in et δsw and wue among the three base to topdressing ratio treatments while b1 and b2 had higher wp than b3 from the three year average et δsw and wue in b2 were significantly higher than b1 and b3 while there was no significant difference in wp between b1 and b2 and they were significantly higher than b3 3 8 nitrogen utilization 3 8 1 nitrate nitrogen residue in soil according to fig 6 different base to topdressing ratio treatments had significant effects on soil nitrate nitrogen no3 n content in winter wheat at each growth stage the results of the 3 year field experiment were similar with the increase of soil depth soil no3 n content decreased first and then increased at the jointing stage the no3 n content of the upper soil 0 120 cm showed a trend of b3 b2 b1 and b3 was significantly higher than b1 treatment at booting stage the difference of soil no3 n content among the three treatments tended to narrow but the no3 n content of b1 treatment was still the lowest at anthesis the no3 n content in the surface layer 0 40 cm of b1 treatment was significantly higher than that of the other two treatments in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 this is because the topdressing amount of b1 treatment 36 75 kg ha 1 was higher than that of b2 26 25 kg ha 1 and b3 15 75 kg ha 1 at the filling stage and maturity the no3 n content in the soil surface layer 0 20 cm showed a pattern of b1 b2 b3 and the difference between treatments was significant in addition the no3 n content in the deep soil 120 180 cm of b2 treatment was significantly lower than that of b3 treatment in conclusion increasing the proportion of topdressing b1 significantly increased soil no3 n content in the surface layer 0 40 cm while increasing the proportion of base fertilizer b3 increased soil no3 n content in the deep layer 140 200 cm b2 kept the lower soil no3 n content in deep soil layers especially at maturity 3 8 2 nitrogen accumulation and utilization it can be seen from table 7 that b and y significantly affected total nitrogen accumulation of plants soil nitrate nitrogen accumulation nitrogen use efficiency and nitrogen harvest index of winter wheat the interaction of b y also had significant effects on nitrogen accumulation and n use efficiency the total nitrogen accumulation of winter wheat plants increased first and then decreased with the increase of base fertilizer ratio and the maximum value was reached in b2 treatment which was significantly higher than that in b1 and b3 treatment and the trend of the three years was consistent in terms of soil no3 n accumulation b1 treatment was significantly higher than b2 and b3 treatment and the 3 year trend was consistent in terms of nue in 2018 2019 b2 treatment was significantly higher than b1 and b3 treatment there was no significant difference between b1 and b3 treatment in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 there was no significant difference between b1 and b2 treatments but they were significantly higher than b3 treatment from the three year average the nue of b3 treatment was significantly lower than b2 treatment in terms of nitrogen harvest index nhi b1 treatment was significantly higher than b3 treatment in conclusion b1 treatment had higher soil no3 n accumulation than b2 and b3 also had higher nhi than b3 treatment however the nitrogen accumulation and nue of b2 treatment reached the maximum at maturity while b3 treatment showed poor performance in all indexes 4 discussion 4 1 synergistical increase in grain yield and protein content it is known well that wheat yield and quality are determined by carbon and nitrogen metabolism in plants coruzzi et al 2001 and coordinating the carbon and nitrogen metabolism post anthesis is expected to simultaneously improve the yield and protein content of winter wheat huang et al 2020 in our present study we also found wheat carbon and nitrogen metabolism were enhanced simultaneously and grain weight and protein content were simultaneously increased when topdressing n was increased under micro sprinkler irrigation tables 4 and 5 the physiological mechanism of the synergistic increase of grain weight and protein content in winter wheat under this experimental condition may be fig 7 increasing the percentage of canopy n topdressing under micro sprinkler irrigation significantly increased the activities of key enzymes gs and nr of n metabolism in wheat fig 4 which could provide essential substances for carbon metabolism such as photosynthetic enzymes while increasing the content of soluble protein in flag leaf fig 4 and grain nunes nesi et al 2010 baslam et al 2020 on the other hand increasing the proportion of canopy nitrogen topdressing led to a significant increase in carbon metabolic processes which significantly increased the net photosynthetic rate of flag leaves and grain filling rate fig 2 table 3 while at the same time carbon metabolic processes provided energy material and carbon skeleton for nitrogen metabolic processes cheng et al 2019 baslam et al 2020 and this significant increase in carbon metabolism may offset the competition between them for energy and c skeleton in addition 80 of grain protein content was gliadin and glutenin and these two proteins were mainly formed in the middle and late grain filling stage luo et al 2019 zhong et al 2018 in this experiment the increase of nitrogen topdressing ratio under micro sprinkler irrigation may promote the synthesis of storage protein because under micro sprinkler irrigation condition topdressing n was sprayed in the plant canopy which may accelerate the nitrogen absorption and protein accumulation in plants previous studies have shown that foliar leaf nitrogen application can significantly increase grain protein content lyu et al 2022 gooding and davies 1992 in brief the co promotion of post anthesis carbon and nitrogen metabolism ultimately increased grain weight and grain protein content under higher topdressing n ratio yet wheat yield formation is complex the yield is composed of three elements spikes per unit land area grains per spike and grain weight grafius 1972 prystupa et al 2004 it is the most direct and effective way to increase the spike number by increasing the seed quantity xu et al 2018 increasing the dry matter and nitrogen content of spike before anthesis can increase grain number per spike but the effect is very limited abbate et al 1995 thousand grain weight is mainly formed post anthesis and is often the most difficult to control however in our study different n fertilizer base to topdressing ratios had significant regulatory effects on spike number and 1000 grain weight especially 1000 grain weight but had no significant effect on grains per spike table 4 obviously increasing the proportion of basal fertilizer had a certain promotion effect on increasing the spike number but excessive basal fertilizer could not significantly increase the spike number xu et al 2018 because excessive basal fertilizer may affect the number of tillers of winter wheat and then increase the number of ineffective tillers darwinkel 1978 such results were also found in this study table 4 the yield components restrict and influence each other and population also has self regulating function freeze et al 1990 the spike number and 1000 grain weight are negatively correlated tompkins et al 1991 and the appropriate base to topdressing ratio is beneficial to balance the negative correlation between spike number and 1000 grain weight in this study the optimum nitrogen fertilizer base ratio b2 5 5 adjusted the contradiction between spike number and 1000 grain weight and the highest grain yield was obtained therefore b2 treatment is the best choice to achieve high yield and high protein content 4 2 nitrogen management and efficient use of resources nitrogen and water are essential elements for plant growth and development li et al 2015 soil water and soil nitrogen are mutually affected and coupled zain et al 2021 in this study soil water consumption δsw seasonal evapotranspiration et and water use efficiency wue were significantly regulated by different base to topdressing ratio treatments the δsw and et of b2 5 5 treatment were the highest at maturity so the wue was significantly higher than that of b1 and b3 treatments compared with b1 and b3 the grain yield of b2 treatment increased by 3 7 and 5 7 respectively while the et only increased by 2 8 and 2 8 respectively the increase of yield was higher than that of et so the b2 treatment crop water productivity wp was still the highest tables 4 and 6 this is consistent with the results of zhang et al 2020 irrigation is an important factor affecting crop water productivity and water use efficiency in crop production our previous studies showed that compared with traditional border irrigation and drip irrigation water use efficiency of wheat increased by 17 and 5 under micro sprinkler irrigation li et al 2018b the water use efficiency and drought resistance of wheat were also significantly improved by increasing the ratio of topdressing n zain et al 2021 in this study wp and wue were further improved by optimizing the base fertilizer ratio of nitrogen fertilizer under the water saving cultivation technology of micro sprinkler irrigation and water fertilizer integration therefore further optimization of nitrogen management in the context of water management can further improve the water saving potential of crops in this study increasing the proportion of topdressing improved nitrogen use efficiency nue and nitrogen harvest index nhi table 7 shi et al 2007 also showed that increasing the proportion of topdressing significantly improved nue of topdressing nitrogen and a 15n experiment showed that foliar nitrogen fertilizer application before and after heading stage resulted in a nitrogen recovery of up to 70 and 90 of the nitrogen could enter the grain at maturity gooding and davies 1992 moreover under the condition of water fertilizer integration of micro sprinkler irrigation in this experiment the spraying of water and fertilizer in the late growth stage increased the way of nitrogen absorption of plants which had the effect of foliar fertilizer and improved nitrogen absorption rossmann et al 2019 therefore a reasonable increase in the proportion of topdressing is an effective method to improve water and nitrogen use efficiency simultaneously 4 3 environmentally friendly nitrogen management strategies the unreasonable application of nitrogen fertilizer is the main reason of nitrate pollution and greenhouse gas emission in groundwater pappa et al 2011 wang et al 2018 under this experimental condition the residual no3 n in the 2 m soil at maturity was significantly different under different nitrogen fertilizer base to topdressing ratio treatments increasing the ratio of base fertilizer b3 had significantly higher no3 n residue in the deep soil of 140 200 cm than the other two treatments while b2 5 5 had the lowest no3 n residue in the deep soil and the lowest risk of groundwater pollution fig 6 although increasing the ratio of topdressing 3 7 significantly increased the accumulation of no3 n in 2 m of soil at maturity the no3 n was mainly distributed in the soil surface 0 40 cm and the residual no3 n in the deep soil was still very low fig 6 therefore if the residual no3 n in the surface layer can be reasonably used it will be a good choice for example in cases where significant amounts of no3 n remain in the soil surface layer after wheat harvest subsequent crops e g corn or soybeans can use the residual n ultimately this can lead to increased yields and improved resource use efficiency for both wheat and subsequent crops this provides a good idea for us to further optimize water and nitrogen supply to improve annual wheat and maize yield and water and nitrogen use efficiency in the future in addition more studies have shown that the optimized nitrogen fertilizer base to topdressing ratio of 5 5 treatment can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and economic input zhang et al 2021b xu et al 2018 therefore optimizing the base to topdressing ratio of nitrogen fertilizer is an effective way for winter wheat to achieve high yield high efficiency green and economic goals 5 conclusions under the same total nitrogen application rate 210 kg ha 1 condition increasing the ratio of nitrogen topdressing b1 and b2 significantly improved the chlorophyll content net photosynthetic rate glutamine synthetase activity nitrate reductase activity soluble protein content of flag leaf during grain filling finally the 1000 grain weight and total protein content of b1 were significantly increased by 7 6 and 48 6 and that of b2 was significantly increased by 4 5 and 4 5 on average as compared with b3 treatment compared with b1 and b3 treatments the spike number and grain weight of b2 treatment were the most harmonious and the yield increased by 3 7 and 5 7 respectively additionally b2 treatment significantly enhanced soil water consumption decreased no3 n accumulation finally increased water and nitrogen use efficiency in conclusion when the total amount of nitrogen applied in water saving cultivation with micro sprinkler irrigation was 210 kg ha 1 optimizing the ratio of base to topdressing 5 5 for nitrogen fertilizer could coordinate post anthesis carbon and nitrogen metabolism which significantly improved the yield of winter wheat and synergistically improved grain protein content and water
