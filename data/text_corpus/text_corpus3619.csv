18095,taking advantage of the high mass transfer in the bulk solution of fluidized bed reactor fbr and the benefits of simultaneous particle separation and ozone catalysis on ceramic membranes we proposed a hybrid fluidized bed reactor hfbr based on arrayed ceramic membranes acms coupled with powdered activated carbon pac for efficient catalytic ozonation the optimum hfbr performance on a pilot scale was found at pac addition of 3 g l ozone dosage of 25 mg l hydraulic retention time of 60 min and auxiliary aeration strength of 5 m3 h during the 30 day treatment of coal gasification secondary effluent 200 l h the hfbr system revealed not only a 117 increase in ozone utilization efficiency δcod δo3 upon pure ozonation but also a highly purified effluent with better sterilization and low residual bromate 11 μg l low molecular weight organic fragments and acids as well as phthalate esters were identified as the main products in this process by density functional theory dft calculations it was found the main functional groups carbonyls c o on the pac could be protected from direct ozonation in the presence of ozone degradable organics e g phenolic and aliphatic compounds in the wastewater through an ozone competing reaction which prevented the rapid inactivation of the pac in catalytic ozonation a longer service life and cheaper materials for ceramic membranes would benefit low operation costs for the hfbr moreover the addition of pac could greatly reduce ozone demand by 60 in the hfbr and therefore decrease energy consumption by 30 hence the hfbr was proved to be a highly competitive technology for wide application in the near future graphical abstract image 1 keywords catalytic ozonation ceramic membrane powdered activated carbon advanced oxidation process

water shortages have been an issue worldwide worse still the available water per capita is dropping rapidly in recent decades hanasaki et al 2018 chemical industries are regarded as one of the major water consumers and discharge different kinds of wastewaters which usually contain various toxic pollutants and a high degree of color lin and lai 2000 wu et al 2016 moreover bio treated chemical wastewaters secondary effluent still contain refractory organics wei et al 2019 such as aromatic hydrocarbons long chain hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbon which pose an obstacle to further purification and reclamation using traditional technologies wu et al 2017 heterogeneous catalytic ozonation hco is an advanced oxidation process aop that can continually generate powerful hydroxyl radicals oh e 0 oh h2o 2 80 v without frequent catalyst addition kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 and is effective in degrading refractory pollutants and enhancing the biodegradability of secondary effluent zhu et al 2017 packed bed reactors pbrs are classical hco technologies for their facile assembly and simple operation rosal et al 2010 however a high solid to liquid ratio is required for the pbr to ensure the necessary contact between ozone catalysts and pollutants fluidized bed reactors fbrs are regarded as more efficient for hco due to the better mass transfer on powdered catalysts at a relatively low solid to liquid ratio moussavi et al 2014 one challenge for conventional fbr is the separation or retention of the powdered catalysts dai et al 2014 lee et al 2018 in addition the instability of the catalysts von gunten 2018 raises concerns in practical applications such as the metal leaching afzal et al 2016 catalyst breakage and fragments flowing out with the effluent wei et al 2019 which could increase the toxicity and turbidity of treated wastewater von gunten 2018 in recent years ozone aeration systems coupled with filtration by ceramic membranes cheng et al 2017 stylianou et al 2016 have been reported as an alternative method in advanced treatment processes the abundant micro or nanopores in ceramic membranes are beneficial not only for separation but also for catalytic ozonation during the mixed ozone liquid filtration process zhu et al 2013 the stable mechanical properties and high resistance to ozone attack of these membranes can also reduce the replacement frequency and enhance the service life wang et al 2019 in addition due to the membrane rejection of suspended particles the low turbidity can be maintained in the effluent of the ozone membrane system which is beneficial for further water reclamation processes e g reverse osmosis recent studies have focused on the surface modification of membranes to enhance their catalytic activity such as coating with ti mn zhang et al 2016 fe park et al 2012 mn cheng et al 2017 or mn co guo et al 2016 oxide layers however little emphasis has been paid on the optimization of the reactions in the bulk solution for example in the ozone liquid mixture step before entering the membrane module guo et al 2016 and in the area where most ozone molecules are uncatalyzed due to the absence of membranes wang et al 2015 therefore resulting in a decrease in ozone utilization efficiency and a high cost for operation traditional fbr for hco raise concerns for catalysts loss while membrane based systems face challenges in improving the ozone utilization and cutting down the operation cost herein it s of great significance to find a possible way to remedy the problems in these hco systems by which the high ozone utilization stable effluent quality and low operation cost could be all satisfied in this work taking advantage of the high mass transfer of fbrs in the bulk solution the free of metal leaching from activated carbon catalysts and the benefits of simultaneous particle separation and ozone catalysis on ceramic membranes we proposed a hybrid fluidized bed reactor hfbr based on arrayed ceramic membranes acms coupled with powdered activated carbon pac for efficient catalytic ozonation subsequently a pilot scale study of the hfbr was conducted with two targeted wastewaters crude phenol solution and coal gasification secondary effluent which were chosen for their inclusion of toxic and refractory pollutants tentscher et al 2018 xu et al 2019 the influence of operation parameters such as catalyst addition ozone dosage and aeration strength on the organic removal and transmembrane pressure tmp were also evaluated the water qualities were tracked and analyzed during the pilot scale treatment process the mechanism for the change in pac surface functional groups during catalytic ozonation was explored based on density functional theory dft the energy consumption and operation cost were also evaluated based on the study above 2 material and method 2 1 site and system description 2 1 1 location and wastewater treatment process this study was conducted at a coal gasification wastewater treatment plant wwtp in central region of china the evaluated pilot plant for catalytic ozonation was placed after a pretreatment process coagulation and cartridge filtration to ensure the elimination of suspended solids the secondary effluent derived from the nitrification denitrification process was first treated by the pretreatment process and then directly pumped into the catalytic ozonation system fig 1 2 1 2 pilot plant description the pilot system for catalytic ozonation fig 1 and supplemental information si fig s1 consisted of a rectangular column size 450 mm 410 mm height 2300 mm effective volume of 0 2 m3 a pair of influent and effluent pumps and an ozone generator guolin 300 g h china the rectangular column consisted of an enclosed stainless steel shell with an acm module in the center ten pieces of flat sheet ceramic membranes al2o3 based size 250 mm 1000 mm thickness 6 mm pore size 0 1 μm with a total active membrane area of 5 m2 0 5 m2 10 pieces were parallelly assembled spaced at 10 mm into the stainless steel module 170 mm 250 mm 1580 mm opened on both top and bottom and vertically fixed above the titanium aeration rods located at the bottom center of the module ozone produced from an oxygen source was bubbled through the titanium rods entered the module channels to cause an internal aeration flow and was then collected by an axial flow fan in the top of the column and sent to a gas breaker the wastewater influent was pumped into the upper part of the column flowed down along the channels formed by the outer wall of the module and inner wall of the reactor column and was then transported via the aeration flow into the membrane module from the bottom purified water was obtained through membrane filtration driven by the effluent pump which was connected to a clean water tank the pac mesh number 400 600 which acted as an ozonation catalyst in the system was fluidized by the aeration circulated in a vertical pattern with the water and trapped by acms a group of extra aeration rods was also installed at the bottom of the acms to provide auxiliary air aeration to assist in fluidization and relieve membrane fouling a detailed schematic of the acm module in the hfbr is presented in fig 2 another column reactor that was operated using ozone alone was used as a blank control si p s2 and fig s1 2 1 3 automatic control system the system status and operation process were detected and controlled by a programmable logic controller plc the liquid level in the column was detected and controlled by two float valves to adjust the flux difference between the influent and effluent pumps for normal operation the effluent pump was set to run for 9 min for filtration stop for 15 s and run in reverse for 45 s for back washing the wash flux was double the filtration flux pipeline switching was accomplished by several solenoid valves under plc control the transmembrane pressure tmp was detected by a digital pressure gage and recorded by the plc 2 1 4 maintenance strategy the membranes in the column were chemically cleaned online with 0 1 sodium hypochlorite 2 l m2 every 10 days or as long as the running tmp exceeded 35 kpa blank tmp 20 kpa while the membranes needed to be washed with 2 citric acid 2 l m2 every 3 months the cleaning program was set to include chemical injection for 30 min stabilization for 90 min aeration washing for 30 min and discharge for 15 min the pac was refreshed after each cleaning cycle 2 2 experiments and analytical methods the demonstration of the pilot system was performed using two different kinds of targeted wastewater details are provided in table 1 for the first stage to determine the optimum operation conditions a crude phenol solution with an initial cod of 3 000 000 mg l was diluted to cod 130 mg l for each test the ozone dosage was adjusted from 10 200 mg l by the ozone generator and the hydraulic retention time hrt was controlled within a range of 30 60 min based on different water flux rates the ozone dosage was calculated as follows 1 o z o n e d o s a g e o 3 i n j g a s j w a t e r where o 3 i n is the ozone concentration mg l in the influent gas and j g a s and j w a t e r stand for the influent gas flux l h and influent water flux l h in the hfbr respectively pac addition was varied from 0 to 5 g l and the flux for auxiliary aeration was settled from 0 10 m3 h in view of the adsorption of organics by pac a certain stabilization time was required before each run and both influent and effluent were sampled in the formal run to measure the cod value the tmp was automatically recorded in the operation process the ozone utilization efficiency δcod δo3 lin and lai 2000 based on the removed cod and ozone consumption was calculated according to eq 2 2 δ c o d δ o 3 c o d i n c o d o u t j w a t e r o 3 i n o 3 o u t j g a s c o d i n c o d o u t o z o n e d o s a g e where cod in and cod out represent to the cod mg l in the influent and effluent o 3 i n and o 3 o u t represent to the ozone concentration mg l in the influent gas and effluent gas respectively due to the auxiliary aeration o 3 o u t in this work was difficult to accurately detect si p s2 and was assumed to be approximately 0 mg l the pac utilization efficiency δcod δpac was also calculated in this work and represents the removed cod per added pac as follows 3 δ c o d δ p a c c o d p a c 0 c o d p a c i p a c i where pac 0 refers to the addition of 0 g l pac and pac i refers to the addition of i g l pac i 1 2 3 4 and 5 cod pac i refers to the corresponding effluent cod mg l under the addition pac i the second stage was conducted with 200 l h coal gasification wastewater secondary effluent that had been subjected to the pretreatment process the optimized conditions were as follows ozone dosage of 25 mg l hrt of 60 min pac addition of 3 g l and air aeration flux of 5 m3 h during the 30 day running period the water quality of both the influent and effluent was analyzed each day the cod ammonia nh3 n and volatile phenol concentration vph were measured using a multi parameter water quality analyzer 5b 3bv8 lianhua china total organic carbon toc was monitored via an organic carbon analyzer toc lcph shimadzu japan the total phenol concentration tph was determined using folin ciocalteu s reagent rover and brown 2013 the uv254 absorbance was determined using a uv spectrophotometer uv2700 shimadzu japan the organics in the coal gasification wastewater were analyzed using a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms 7890a 5975c agilent usa si p s3 the low molecular weight organic acids and bromate were detected by ion chromatography ic ics2000 dionex usa si p s3 the sterilization performance of hfbr was evaluated by a cell integrity test double staining method hiraoka and kimbara 2002 using calcein am cam stain for live cells and propidium iodide pi stain for dead cells si p s3 the surface carbon structures carboxyl and acidity of the pac were detected by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi usa boehm titration boehm 1966 and zeta potential analyzer delsa nano c beckman coulter usa respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 set of functional zones in hfbr the hfbr was designed with three functional zones fig 2 as follows zone i mixture of different phases organics adsorbed on pac zone ii utilization of dissolved ozone mild hco with pac zone iii intensified hco reactions with acms and pac advanced cod removal the water purification process is depicted according to the life cycles of the ozone pac and organics as presented in fig s2 3 2 effects of operation parameters on the treatment of crude phenol solution 3 2 1 addition of pac the evaluation of pac addition based on net volume 0 2 m3 of hfbr is presented in fig 3 the addition of 0 g l pac is referred as the pure membrane ozonation process at an influent cod of 130 mg l crude phenol the cod in the effluent decreased from 75 4 0 4 mg l to 64 6 1 0 mg l as the pac addition increased from 0 g l labelled as pac 0 to 5 g l pac 5 and the cod removal correspondingly increased from 42 1 0 3 to 50 2 0 8 fig 3a and fig s3 this result suggested better ozonation performance at higher pac addition as presented in fig 3b the ozone utilization efficiency δcod δo3 was also found to rise from 2 18 0 01 with pac 0 to 2 61 0 04 with pac 5 which indicated the promotion of ozone utilization in the bulk solution under the assistance of pac addition similar enhancements with increased carbon addition in fbrs have also been found in other studies chen et al 2017 lin and lai 2000 however few reports have been based on membrane ozonation systems the catalyst utilization efficiency δcod δpac was calculated according to eq 3 as shown in fig 3b δcod δpac was 1 20 0 43 1 54 0 47 1 65 0 39 2 34 0 30 2 34 0 23 and 2 15 0 19 for pac 0 5 to pac 5 respectively the highest values were observed for pac 3 and pac 4 rather than pac 5 higher pac addition could promote total organic removal but would decrease the catalytic efficiency per unit pac other risks derived from high catalyst addition such as increased transmembrane pressure le et al 2019 should also be taken into consideration for practical applications fig 3c shows the δtmp for all pac additions with respect to operation time the results revealed an increase in δtmp from 0 5 kpa to 3 6 kpa with increased pac addition from 0 mg l to 5 mg l at a sampling time of 360 min this result implied that a higher addition of catalyst particles could increase the turbidity of the influent and therefore lead to a fast formation of cake layer on membrane surface le et al 2019 in the filtration process thus low pac addition with high catalyst utilization efficiency was preferred in our process for this work in view of the favorable catalytic performance relatively low catalyst consumption and reduced membrane fouling 3 g l pac addition was chosen for further investigation 3 2 2 ozone dosage and hrt the influence of ozone dosage on catalytic performance was studied using a control group of pure o3 o3 membrane shortened as o3 mem and o3 membrane pac o3 mem pac with membrane pac mem pac that without ozone addition as a blank control si fig s4 when crude phenol solution at cod 130 mg l was treated fresh pac coupled with ceramic membrane si fig s4 showed a rapid removal of cod in initial state and then reached a relatively steady effluent cod of 120 mg l which could be regarded as a sorption process of the fresh pac this result also implied that membrane was ineffective in organics rejection in this work due to its relatively large pore size 0 1 μm as for three ozone added systems fig 4 a with increased ozone dosage all three control experiments showed a similar decrease in residual cod in the effluent and a trend for cod removal appeared o3 mem pac o3 mem o3 alone fig 4a pure ozonation revealed a cod removal of 19 9 and 58 2 at ozone dosages of 10 mg l and 200 mg l respectively while the removal was 39 8 and 71 9 for o3 mem and 41 9 and 74 2 for o3 mem pac both o3 mem and o3 mem pac showed considerably higher cod removal than pure o3 indicating that the acms contributed a large part of the catalytic reactions in the system zone iii fig 2 on the other hand the least cod residue after addition of pac o3 mem pac indicated an enhanced performance in catalytic ozonation which was mainly due to the promoted utilization of both gaseous and dissolved ozone by the fluidized pac especially at non membrane area such as zone i and zone ii such enhancement was considerable in view of the low cod and the poor water quality in the influent the ozone utilization efficiency at different ozone dosages was also calculated and is presented in fig 4b the δcod δo3 values for the three control experiments decreased dramatically from 2 59 0 56 to 0 38 0 01 o3 5 18 0 43 to 0 47 0 01 o3 mem and 5 45 0 43 to 0 48 0 01 o3 mem pac with increasing ozone dosage from 10 mg l to 200 mg l similarly o3 mem pac showed higher δcod δo3 values than the other systems under all conditions and a maximum increase in δcod δo3 2 59 0 10 was revealed at an ozone dosage of 25 mg l this value was 21 9 and 125 higher than that obtained with o3 mem and pure ozonation respectively high ozone dosages could enhance both direct ozonation and catalytic ozonation bourgin et al 2017 guo et al 2018 but would result in a low utilization efficiency of ozone molecules which is in agreement with the previous findings from pilot scale studies wei et al 2019 moreover high ozone addition has been reported to increase energy consumption correspondingly wang et al 2017 2019 as well as the risk for the generation of oxidation by products such as bromate bourgin et al 2017 previous studies have found that bromate would become a problem when the specific ozone dosage expressed as mg o3 mg doc exceeds 1 5 bourgin et al 2017 soltermann et al 2017 yao et al 2017 herein we selected a 25 mg l ozone dosage as the optimum condition for subsequent experiments which corresponded to a specific ozone dosage of approximately 1 mg o3 mg doc based on a toc content of 20 25 mg l equal to the doc value at low ss of coal gasification wastewater the effect of hrt at an ozone dosage of 25 mg l was subsequently evaluated as shown in fig 4c hrt provided nearly no influence on the pure ozonation process in which an effluent cod of approximately 97 mg l was maintained under all chosen conditions indicating the limitation of direct ozonation in contrast as the hrt lengthened from 30 min to 60 min the effluent cod further decreased from 76 7 4 3 mg l to 60 2 2 5 mg l for o3 mem and from 65 4 2 1 mg l to 48 1 1 6 mg l for o3 mem pac these results implied that a breakthrough of the reaction limit was achieved by changing from ozonation to a catalytic ozonation process which was consistent with the reported results saeid et al 2018 yao et al 2018 moreover a long hrt would ensure sufficient contact among solids liquid and gas in the system which could benefit both ozone catalysis and organic degradation in the hfbr 3 2 3 auxiliary aeration strength the investigation of the influence of auxiliary aeration strength on catalytic ozonation was conducted at an aeration flux of 0 10 m3 h as seen from fig 5 a the effluent cod for o3 mem was found to decrease from 78 3 2 2 mg l to 68 2 1 7 mg l when the auxiliary aeration flux increased from 0 m3 h to 4 m3 h which could probably be attributed to the better mixing and mass transfer at the membrane liquid interface that induced at higher aeration strengths however no further cod decrease was observed when the aeration was continually increased to greater than 4 m3 h one possible reason was under higher aeration flux of 5 10 m3 h not the mass transfer but the reaction kinetics of catalytic ozonation became the limitation of the cod removal for o3 mem pac the effluent cod continually decreased with the increasing auxiliary aeration from 77 1 2 2 mg l to 59 6 1 8 mg l as the aeration flux increased from 0 m3 h to 10 m3 h the main difference between o3 mem and o3 mem pac was observed at an aeration flux of 5 10 m3 h since auxiliary aeration showed little contribution of catalytic performance to o3 mem at these fluxes such enhanced cod removal for o3 mem pac was mainly attributed to the promoted pac fluidization and pac based reactions under stronger aeration the δtmp values during 60 min operation periods with different auxiliary aeration fluxes were further studied as presented in fig 5b compared with the δtmp of 1 3 kpa obtained with no auxiliary aeration flux of 0 m3 h the δtmp clearly increased when the flux of auxiliary aeration was set to 1 m3 h 1 8 kpa at 60 min and reached the highest value 2 4 kpa at a flux of 2 m3 h this was probably because the pac started to be fluidized at these aeration strengths and increased the turbidity in the reaction system which led to a rise in membrane fouling then with a further increase of aeration flux the δtmp began to decrease from 2 4 kpa at 2 m3 h to 2 1 kpa at 4 m3 h at an operation time of 60 min and decreased further to 1 5 kpa at an aeration flux 5 m3 h this was mainly due to the intensified cross flow on the membrane surface at higher aeration strengths which quickly removed the sedimented particles through shear force relieving membrane fouling and slowing the enhancement of δtmp kim et al 2008 herein according to the results above the auxiliary aeration flux was chosen to be 5 m3 h due to its balanced effects of relatively high contribution to cod removal and a low risk of δtmp enhancement from the above the optimum parameters for the pilot scale operation were selected as follows ozone dosage of 25 mg l pac addition of 3 g l hrt of 60 min and auxiliary aeration flux of 5 m3 h 3 3 pilot scale treatment of coal gasification secondary effluent 3 3 1 treatment performance the pilot scale treatment of coal gasification wastewater secondary effluent by the fluidized bed reactor was conducted under the chosen optimum conditions the water quality indexes for the effluent during 30 day operation period are presented in fig 6 a f the o3 mem pac system showed favorable and steady performance as well as low tmp increment si fig s5 during the 30 day pilot operation at an average influent cod of 82 2 mg l toc of 23 8 mg l nh3 n of 4 68 mg l tph of 8 37 mg l vph of 5 24 mg l and uv254 of 1 03 the effluent indexes of treated wastewater showed a low cod residual of 27 5 mg l toc of 7 96 mg l nh3 n of 0 89 mg l tph of 3 89 mg l vph of 0 29 mg l and uv254 of 0 11 which outperformed the first class standard a of the discharge standards of pollutants of china gb 18918 2002 cod 50 mg l nh3 n 3 mg l tph 5 mg l and vph 0 5 mg l regarding the ozone utilization efficiency δcod δo3 during the pilot operation a remarkably high value of 2 19 was found for the hfbr which was 117 higher than the achieved result based on pure ozonation 1 01 and was also higher than the values found in other pilot studies in the treatment of industrial wastewater table s1 such improvement was possibly due to the cooperation between the fixed acms and fluidized pac which optimized the ozone utilization and was also attributed to the promoted hydraulic conditions that in the designed hfbr fig 2 and fig s2 in addition it was found the δcod δo3 for secondary effluent treatment 2 19 was a little lower than that for crude phenol 2 59 fig 4b at the same 25 mg l ozone dosage one possible reason could be the lower cod value in influent 70 90 mg l for secondary effluent compared with 130 mg l for crude phenol that affected the mass transfer efficiency in hfbr 3 3 2 water quality analysis gc ms analysis tables s2 and s3 revealed a total amount of 108 possible organics in the influent and 97 organics in the effluent during the advanced treatment of the coal gasification secondary effluent as shown in fig 7 a the number of organics was not obviously changed before and after treatment the corresponding abundance of organics is shown in fig 7b the main organic pollutants and their corresponding removals were aliphatic compounds 76 4 aromatic compounds 32 4 ketones aldehydes 84 8 and n containing compounds 81 3 while esters showed an increase of 46 9 in the effluent cl br and s compounds also showed a considerable removal of 78 1 58 9 and 63 1 respectively heterocyclic compounds and phenols quinones which have attracted widespread attentions due to their bio resistance and toxic properties bai et al 2011 tentscher et al 2018 were removed by 52 2 and 84 3 through catalytic ozonation respectively organic acids decreased by 54 1 through the gc ms analysis fig 8 a shows the distribution of the molecular weight m w of organics in the wastewater organics in the influent were mainly located at m w values of 999 g mol 617 g mol and in the range of 150 400 g mol while organics with a m w of 282 g mol showed the highest abundance the effluent showed an organic removal of 61 2 for m w 400 g mol 59 7 for m w values form 150 400 g mol and an increase of 25 6 in organics with m w 150 g mol since microfiltration by ceramic membranes pore size 0 1 μm is not effective in rejecting organics with m w 7 500 g mol park et al 2012 the elimination of these high m w organics 150 999 g mol was mainly attributed to degradation by catalytic ozonation which could result in a corresponding increase in low m w fragments park et al 2012 winter et al 2016 it should be noted that the contents of organics with m w values of 194 g mol mainly dimethyl phthalate table s3 and figs s5 and 278 g mol dibutyl phthalate and isobutyl phthalate table s3 were also obviously enhanced in the effluent which could indicate that these compounds were the main products generated from catalytic ozonation fig 8b shows a comparison of the number of carbon atoms in the organics between the influent and effluent high carbon containing molecules such as those with carbon numbers of 20 44 and 69 labelled as c 20 c 44 and c 69 respectively were nearly eliminated and most organics between c 11 and c 19 were also decreased in the effluent similarly an increase in c 10 and c 16 organics was observed in the effluent these compounds corresponded to the organics with m w values of 194 g mol and 278 g mol in fig 8a table s3 respectively these results demonstrated that the organics in the coal gasification secondary wastewater were effectively degraded and broken into low m w and low carbon molecules such degradation was possibly due to the ring opening and decomposition of aromatic heterocyclic pollutants and the decrease or breakage of the conjugated groups in long carbon chain structures 3 3 3 evolution of carboxylic acids and bromate when detected by ic fig 9 a three low molecular weight acids formic acid acetic acid and oxalic acid were found to be increased in the effluent and were considered as the main acid products during organic oxidation zhu et al 2017 in detail a pure ozonation process showed the highest formation of acetic acid 9 00 1 78 mg l and oxalic acid 14 10 1 68 mg l in effluent while the values were observed deceasing to 5 06 1 14 mg l and 6 64 2 17 mg l for o3 mem and 2 43 0 34 mg l and 3 98 1 74 mg l for o3 mem pac system such inhibition of acid accumulation was mainly due to the generation of powerful radicals by o3 mem and o3 mem pac through an ozone catalysis process a less formation of formic acid was found for pure o3 system which was probably due to the less generation of organic fragments especially the mono carbon compounds during the direct ozonation process similar phenomenon was also reported elsewhere qu et al 2015 fig 9b showed a comparison of bromate contents in the effluent of coal gasification secondary effluent with different systems notably a high formation of bromate 71 0 7 2 μg l at 100 mg l ozone dosage and 29 3 3 2 μg l at 25 mg l ozone dosage was found for direct ozonation process when transferred to catalytic ozonation the value was declined to 17 3 3 1 μg l of o3 mem and 11 2 1 5 μg l of o3 mem pac at 25 mg l ozone dosage it could be indicated that bromate was reduced in catalytic ozonation process and low ozone condition the better bro3 reduction in o3 mem pac was possibly due to the high utilization and catalysis of ozone molecules that prevented the direct br oxidation process and might also account for the generation of h2o2 alvárez et al 2006 wei et al 2019 during catalytic ozonation that quenched br containing intermediate products yao et al 2018 3 3 4 sterilization effect of hfbr fig 10 showed the fsc and ssc parameters as well as survival rates of cells in the influent and effluent sampled at zone iii before entering acms of coal gasification wastewater treated by different reaction systems the intensities of fsc and ssc were proportional to cell size and intracellular complexity combarros et al 2016 respectively seen from the plots when treated by three systems an obvious enhancement of dot signal could be found mainly at r1 area which could be regarded as a generation of dead cells and cell debris such enhancement was more obvious in o3 mem pac and o3 mem than pure o3 process indicating a better sterilization and damage of cells under catalytic ozonation oh e 0 oh h2o 2 80 v than direct ozonation o3 e 0 o3 h2o 2 07 v meanwhile the double staining method showed a live cell rate as following in decreasing order influent 77 o3 40 o3 mem 24 o3 mem pac 17 which also supported the better sterilization by coupling acms with pac in a hfbr it should be noted due to the pore size of 0 1 μm most cells and their debris would be rejected by the acms in the practical operation according to the analysis above as inferred from the increased contents in the effluent dimethyl phthalate m w 194 g mol c 10 dibutyl phthalate m w 278 g mol c 16 and diisobutyl phthalate m w 278 g mol c 16 were considered the main products while formic acid acetate acid and oxalic acid were regarded as the main acids produced by the catalytic ozonation of coal gasification secondary effluent moreover a high δcod δo3 and a better sterilization were obtained and a low bromate content was detected in the effluent of the hfbr 3 4 change in pac surface functional groups surface functional groups on activated carbon are considered the main reaction sites for the transformation of o3 into active radicals oulton et al 2015 however are also known to be gradually altered in the catalytic ozonation process valdés et al 2002 wang et al 2016 which will lead to the inactivation of carbon catalysts nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 studies have found that a high ozone dosage and the long term exposure of carbon materials in ozone aeration could greatly accelerate the decrease in carbonyls c o and simultaneously increase the surface acidity wang et al 2016 in practical applications the situation could be more complex due to the existence of different species of organics in the reaction system table 2 shows the surface properties of pac treated by ozone with different organics from the target wastewater phenol and oxalate deionized water as a blank control in a fast ozonation test si p s4 where phenol k o3 1300 l mol s and oxalate k o3 0 04 l mol s were chosen for the large difference in their reaction rates of ozonation hoigné and bader 1983 the surface content of carbonyl groups c o in all pac samples decreased after 4 h of catalytic ozonation with value of 11 19 in the phenol o3 condition 7 50 in the oxalate o3 condition and 2 81 in the pure o3 condition compared with 16 29 for fresh pac c oh c o c structures in the pac were also found to slightly decrease under different ozonation conditions on the other hand o c o structures were observed to increase from 3 45 in fresh pac to 4 07 in the pheonl o3 condition 8 57 in the oxalate o3 condition and 16 16 in the pure o3 condition the surface carboxyl groups cooh detected by boehm titration si p s5 and acidity inversely correlated to the phpzc value on the pac were also found to increase in the same order of conditions all these results implied a possible transformation from carbonyl to carboxyl on pac during the exposure of pac to ozone and organics in the water were found to have certain impacts on such transformation as presented in fig 11 the dft calculation si p s5 showed a possible ozone hybrid transition status of oxalate phenol and edge carbonyl i e aldehyde groups h c o on the pac with corresponding energy barriers of 40 1 kcal mol 3 6 kcal mol and 2 1 kcal mol respectively the low values of the energy barriers implied highly vulnerable structures under ozone attack zhang et al 2017 the uncatalyzed ozone molecules both gaseous and dissolved that accumulate at the pac liquid interface would increase the oxidation of surface carbonyls and result in acidification of the pac in the presence of organics a shared ozonation reaction could occur between phenol and carbonyl groups due to their similar energy barriers which resulted in the protection of carbonyl on the other hand oxalate showed little competitivity in this process due to its extremely high energy barrier and would hence lead to low protection for pac in pure o3 conditions no organics added the surface groups were directly exposed to ozone and a fast transformation from c o to cooh occurred therefore through competitive reactions with ozone the organics in the wastewater were able to affect the change in pac surface carbonyl groups for the treatment of secondary effluent of coal gasification wastewater the pac surface oxygen groups in the hfbr after operation for 10 days time to be refreshed were also analyzed by xps compared to fresh pac fig 12 a small decrease in c o from 16 29 to 13 94 could be found for used pac which was mainly due to the abundant presence of ozone degradable organics e g phenolic and aliphatic compounds in the influent fig 7b and table s2 which contribute to the maintenance of surface carbonyls in addition the high ozone utilization efficiency 2 19 provided by the acms and pac could also reduce the direct ozonation process on the pac interestingly an obvious increase in c oh c o c and o c o could be found despite the low consumption of c o such an unbalanced change in oxygen groups on the used pac led to an increased oxidation degree o1s c1s of 0 34 in contrast to 0 14 for fresh pac this was mainly because the aromatic structure on the pac was destroyed and invaded by oxygen atoms during long term exposure in ozone aeration valdés et al 2002 which was supported by the decreased π π bands sp2 carbon from aromatic rings on the used pac as shown in fig 12 3 5 estimation of energy consumption and operation cost of hfbr the energy consumption and operation cost of the different technologies were calculated according to the parameters in table s4 and the results from fig 4a at the same effluent cod of 65 mg l the ozone dosage was determined to be 25 mg l for o3 mem pac 60 mg l for o3 mem and 100 mg l for pure o3 on the other hand the processes of filtration backwashing and auxiliary aeration should be taken into consideration in membrane based systems as presented in fig 13 the energy consumption of o3 mem pac was 10 8 kwh kgcod which was 30 lower than those of the o3 mem 15 1 kwh kgcod and pure o3 processes 16 2 kwh kgcod this low consumption of o3 mem pac was mainly due to its lowest required ozone dosage the operation costs of these systems were calculated based on the energy consumption and the cost of acms and pac according to fig 13 and table s5 not only the added ozone and material costs wang et al 2017 2019 but also the service life of the ceramic membranes play important roles in membrane based systems a longer service life and lower material price of acms would benefit a decrease in operation cost o3 mem showed the highest cost still higher than that of the pure o3 system even though the acms are supposed to serve for a maximum of 120 months 10 years o3 mem pac showed a lower cost which was comparable to that of pure o3 at a supposed membrane service life of 58 months this value could be shortened to 44 months if the price of the acms were reduced to 75 and could be 29 months at half price cheaper ceramic membranes with optimized performance could be developed in the future on the basis of innovative discoveries and the gradual maturation of technologies in production benkhaya et al 2019 hwa et al 2018 saikia et al 2019 due to the better utilization of ozone in the bulk solution the addition of pac was advantageous for saving both energy consumption and operation costs for the o3 mem pac system especially compared with the non pac system o3 mem therefore a more promising configuration for practical applications is the coupling of acms with pac in a hfbr 4 conclusions this study presented a hybrid fluidized bed reactor based on arrayed ceramic membranes coupled with pac for catalytic ozonation on a pilot scale which was designed with three functional zones to facilitate ozone utilization and organic removal the findings are as following 1 the performance in terms of ozone utilization and organic removal in a pilot scale hco was found to be o3 mem pac o3 mem pure ozonation fluidized pac could promote catalytic performance by utilizing residual dissolved ozone in the hfbr a lower ozone dosage was preferred in the hfbr due to the higher ozone utilization efficiency and lower bromate generations hrt showed higher impacts on membrane based systems than the pure ozonation process and a longer hrt resulted in better organic removal auxiliary aeration had a greater influence on o3 mem pac than o3 mem and pac induced membrane fouling was effectively decreased under relatively high aeration strength 2 the continuous pilot scale treatment of coal gasification secondary effluent by hfbr showed a stable effluent with favorable water qualities most organics in the influent were degraded and fragmented into low m w low carbon species and organic acids due to the high utilization of ozone by the acms and pac much better sterilization and low generation of bromate was found in the hfbr dimethyl phthalate dibutyl phthalate and diisobutyl phthalate were considered as the main products during catalytic ozonation 3 the surface functional groups on carbon catalysts could be influenced by the organic species in the influent the dft calculation showed that the edge carbonyl groups of pac were vulnerable to ozone attack carbons exposed to highly ozone resistant organics or non organic circumstances would be easily acidized by ozone molecules leading to the fast transformation of surface carbonyl groups c o to carboxyl groups cooh 4 lower ozone addition longer service life and cheaper materials for ceramic membranes would benefit a decrease in operation cost for membrane based ozonation processes the addition of pac was found to be efficient and economical due to its low cost and high utilization of ozone molecules which could greatly reduce the ozone demands of the o3 mem pac system therefore catalytic ozonation by coupling acms with pac to an hfbr was proved to be a highly competitive

18095,taking advantage of the high mass transfer in the bulk solution of fluidized bed reactor fbr and the benefits of simultaneous particle separation and ozone catalysis on ceramic membranes we proposed a hybrid fluidized bed reactor hfbr based on arrayed ceramic membranes acms coupled with powdered activated carbon pac for efficient catalytic ozonation the optimum hfbr performance on a pilot scale was found at pac addition of 3 g l ozone dosage of 25 mg l hydraulic retention time of 60 min and auxiliary aeration strength of 5 m3 h during the 30 day treatment of coal gasification secondary effluent 200 l h the hfbr system revealed not only a 117 increase in ozone utilization efficiency δcod δo3 upon pure ozonation but also a highly purified effluent with better sterilization and low residual bromate 11 μg l low molecular weight organic fragments and acids as well as phthalate esters were identified as the main products in this process by density functional theory dft calculations it was found the main functional groups carbonyls c o on the pac could be protected from direct ozonation in the presence of ozone degradable organics e g phenolic and aliphatic compounds in the wastewater through an ozone competing reaction which prevented the rapid inactivation of the pac in catalytic ozonation a longer service life and cheaper materials for ceramic membranes would benefit low operation costs for the hfbr moreover the addition of pac could greatly reduce ozone demand by 60 in the hfbr and therefore decrease energy consumption by 30 hence the hfbr was proved to be a highly competitive technology for wide application in the near future graphical abstract image 1 keywords catalytic ozonation ceramic membrane powdered activated carbon advanced oxidation process

water shortages have been an issue worldwide worse still the available water per capita is dropping rapidly in recent decades hanasaki et al 2018 chemical industries are regarded as one of the major water consumers and discharge different kinds of wastewaters which usually contain various toxic pollutants and a high degree of color lin and lai 2000 wu et al 2016 moreover bio treated chemical wastewaters secondary effluent still contain refractory organics wei et al 2019 such as aromatic hydrocarbons long chain hydrocarbons and halogenated hydrocarbon which pose an obstacle to further purification and reclamation using traditional technologies wu et al 2017 heterogeneous catalytic ozonation hco is an advanced oxidation process aop that can continually generate powerful hydroxyl radicals oh e 0 oh h2o 2 80 v without frequent catalyst addition kasprzyk hordern et al 2003 and is effective in degrading refractory pollutants and enhancing the biodegradability of secondary effluent zhu et al 2017 packed bed reactors pbrs are classical hco technologies for their facile assembly and simple operation rosal et al 2010 however a high solid to liquid ratio is required for the pbr to ensure the necessary contact between ozone catalysts and pollutants fluidized bed reactors fbrs are regarded as more efficient for hco due to the better mass transfer on powdered catalysts at a relatively low solid to liquid ratio moussavi et al 2014 one challenge for conventional fbr is the separation or retention of the powdered catalysts dai et al 2014 lee et al 2018 in addition the instability of the catalysts von gunten 2018 raises concerns in practical applications such as the metal leaching afzal et al 2016 catalyst breakage and fragments flowing out with the effluent wei et al 2019 which could increase the toxicity and turbidity of treated wastewater von gunten 2018 in recent years ozone aeration systems coupled with filtration by ceramic membranes cheng et al 2017 stylianou et al 2016 have been reported as an alternative method in advanced treatment processes the abundant micro or nanopores in ceramic membranes are beneficial not only for separation but also for catalytic ozonation during the mixed ozone liquid filtration process zhu et al 2013 the stable mechanical properties and high resistance to ozone attack of these membranes can also reduce the replacement frequency and enhance the service life wang et al 2019 in addition due to the membrane rejection of suspended particles the low turbidity can be maintained in the effluent of the ozone membrane system which is beneficial for further water reclamation processes e g reverse osmosis recent studies have focused on the surface modification of membranes to enhance their catalytic activity such as coating with ti mn zhang et al 2016 fe park et al 2012 mn cheng et al 2017 or mn co guo et al 2016 oxide layers however little emphasis has been paid on the optimization of the reactions in the bulk solution for example in the ozone liquid mixture step before entering the membrane module guo et al 2016 and in the area where most ozone molecules are uncatalyzed due to the absence of membranes wang et al 2015 therefore resulting in a decrease in ozone utilization efficiency and a high cost for operation traditional fbr for hco raise concerns for catalysts loss while membrane based systems face challenges in improving the ozone utilization and cutting down the operation cost herein it s of great significance to find a possible way to remedy the problems in these hco systems by which the high ozone utilization stable effluent quality and low operation cost could be all satisfied in this work taking advantage of the high mass transfer of fbrs in the bulk solution the free of metal leaching from activated carbon catalysts and the benefits of simultaneous particle separation and ozone catalysis on ceramic membranes we proposed a hybrid fluidized bed reactor hfbr based on arrayed ceramic membranes acms coupled with powdered activated carbon pac for efficient catalytic ozonation subsequently a pilot scale study of the hfbr was conducted with two targeted wastewaters crude phenol solution and coal gasification secondary effluent which were chosen for their inclusion of toxic and refractory pollutants tentscher et al 2018 xu et al 2019 the influence of operation parameters such as catalyst addition ozone dosage and aeration strength on the organic removal and transmembrane pressure tmp were also evaluated the water qualities were tracked and analyzed during the pilot scale treatment process the mechanism for the change in pac surface functional groups during catalytic ozonation was explored based on density functional theory dft the energy consumption and operation cost were also evaluated based on the study above 2 material and method 2 1 site and system description 2 1 1 location and wastewater treatment process this study was conducted at a coal gasification wastewater treatment plant wwtp in central region of china the evaluated pilot plant for catalytic ozonation was placed after a pretreatment process coagulation and cartridge filtration to ensure the elimination of suspended solids the secondary effluent derived from the nitrification denitrification process was first treated by the pretreatment process and then directly pumped into the catalytic ozonation system fig 1 2 1 2 pilot plant description the pilot system for catalytic ozonation fig 1 and supplemental information si fig s1 consisted of a rectangular column size 450 mm 410 mm height 2300 mm effective volume of 0 2 m3 a pair of influent and effluent pumps and an ozone generator guolin 300 g h china the rectangular column consisted of an enclosed stainless steel shell with an acm module in the center ten pieces of flat sheet ceramic membranes al2o3 based size 250 mm 1000 mm thickness 6 mm pore size 0 1 μm with a total active membrane area of 5 m2 0 5 m2 10 pieces were parallelly assembled spaced at 10 mm into the stainless steel module 170 mm 250 mm 1580 mm opened on both top and bottom and vertically fixed above the titanium aeration rods located at the bottom center of the module ozone produced from an oxygen source was bubbled through the titanium rods entered the module channels to cause an internal aeration flow and was then collected by an axial flow fan in the top of the column and sent to a gas breaker the wastewater influent was pumped into the upper part of the column flowed down along the channels formed by the outer wall of the module and inner wall of the reactor column and was then transported via the aeration flow into the membrane module from the bottom purified water was obtained through membrane filtration driven by the effluent pump which was connected to a clean water tank the pac mesh number 400 600 which acted as an ozonation catalyst in the system was fluidized by the aeration circulated in a vertical pattern with the water and trapped by acms a group of extra aeration rods was also installed at the bottom of the acms to provide auxiliary air aeration to assist in fluidization and relieve membrane fouling a detailed schematic of the acm module in the hfbr is presented in fig 2 another column reactor that was operated using ozone alone was used as a blank control si p s2 and fig s1 2 1 3 automatic control system the system status and operation process were detected and controlled by a programmable logic controller plc the liquid level in the column was detected and controlled by two float valves to adjust the flux difference between the influent and effluent pumps for normal operation the effluent pump was set to run for 9 min for filtration stop for 15 s and run in reverse for 45 s for back washing the wash flux was double the filtration flux pipeline switching was accomplished by several solenoid valves under plc control the transmembrane pressure tmp was detected by a digital pressure gage and recorded by the plc 2 1 4 maintenance strategy the membranes in the column were chemically cleaned online with 0 1 sodium hypochlorite 2 l m2 every 10 days or as long as the running tmp exceeded 35 kpa blank tmp 20 kpa while the membranes needed to be washed with 2 citric acid 2 l m2 every 3 months the cleaning program was set to include chemical injection for 30 min stabilization for 90 min aeration washing for 30 min and discharge for 15 min the pac was refreshed after each cleaning cycle 2 2 experiments and analytical methods the demonstration of the pilot system was performed using two different kinds of targeted wastewater details are provided in table 1 for the first stage to determine the optimum operation conditions a crude phenol solution with an initial cod of 3 000 000 mg l was diluted to cod 130 mg l for each test the ozone dosage was adjusted from 10 200 mg l by the ozone generator and the hydraulic retention time hrt was controlled within a range of 30 60 min based on different water flux rates the ozone dosage was calculated as follows 1 o z o n e d o s a g e o 3 i n j g a s j w a t e r where o 3 i n is the ozone concentration mg l in the influent gas and j g a s and j w a t e r stand for the influent gas flux l h and influent water flux l h in the hfbr respectively pac addition was varied from 0 to 5 g l and the flux for auxiliary aeration was settled from 0 10 m3 h in view of the adsorption of organics by pac a certain stabilization time was required before each run and both influent and effluent were sampled in the formal run to measure the cod value the tmp was automatically recorded in the operation process the ozone utilization efficiency δcod δo3 lin and lai 2000 based on the removed cod and ozone consumption was calculated according to eq 2 2 δ c o d δ o 3 c o d i n c o d o u t j w a t e r o 3 i n o 3 o u t j g a s c o d i n c o d o u t o z o n e d o s a g e where cod in and cod out represent to the cod mg l in the influent and effluent o 3 i n and o 3 o u t represent to the ozone concentration mg l in the influent gas and effluent gas respectively due to the auxiliary aeration o 3 o u t in this work was difficult to accurately detect si p s2 and was assumed to be approximately 0 mg l the pac utilization efficiency δcod δpac was also calculated in this work and represents the removed cod per added pac as follows 3 δ c o d δ p a c c o d p a c 0 c o d p a c i p a c i where pac 0 refers to the addition of 0 g l pac and pac i refers to the addition of i g l pac i 1 2 3 4 and 5 cod pac i refers to the corresponding effluent cod mg l under the addition pac i the second stage was conducted with 200 l h coal gasification wastewater secondary effluent that had been subjected to the pretreatment process the optimized conditions were as follows ozone dosage of 25 mg l hrt of 60 min pac addition of 3 g l and air aeration flux of 5 m3 h during the 30 day running period the water quality of both the influent and effluent was analyzed each day the cod ammonia nh3 n and volatile phenol concentration vph were measured using a multi parameter water quality analyzer 5b 3bv8 lianhua china total organic carbon toc was monitored via an organic carbon analyzer toc lcph shimadzu japan the total phenol concentration tph was determined using folin ciocalteu s reagent rover and brown 2013 the uv254 absorbance was determined using a uv spectrophotometer uv2700 shimadzu japan the organics in the coal gasification wastewater were analyzed using a gas chromatography mass spectrometer gc ms 7890a 5975c agilent usa si p s3 the low molecular weight organic acids and bromate were detected by ion chromatography ic ics2000 dionex usa si p s3 the sterilization performance of hfbr was evaluated by a cell integrity test double staining method hiraoka and kimbara 2002 using calcein am cam stain for live cells and propidium iodide pi stain for dead cells si p s3 the surface carbon structures carboxyl and acidity of the pac were detected by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi usa boehm titration boehm 1966 and zeta potential analyzer delsa nano c beckman coulter usa respectively 3 results and discussions 3 1 set of functional zones in hfbr the hfbr was designed with three functional zones fig 2 as follows zone i mixture of different phases organics adsorbed on pac zone ii utilization of dissolved ozone mild hco with pac zone iii intensified hco reactions with acms and pac advanced cod removal the water purification process is depicted according to the life cycles of the ozone pac and organics as presented in fig s2 3 2 effects of operation parameters on the treatment of crude phenol solution 3 2 1 addition of pac the evaluation of pac addition based on net volume 0 2 m3 of hfbr is presented in fig 3 the addition of 0 g l pac is referred as the pure membrane ozonation process at an influent cod of 130 mg l crude phenol the cod in the effluent decreased from 75 4 0 4 mg l to 64 6 1 0 mg l as the pac addition increased from 0 g l labelled as pac 0 to 5 g l pac 5 and the cod removal correspondingly increased from 42 1 0 3 to 50 2 0 8 fig 3a and fig s3 this result suggested better ozonation performance at higher pac addition as presented in fig 3b the ozone utilization efficiency δcod δo3 was also found to rise from 2 18 0 01 with pac 0 to 2 61 0 04 with pac 5 which indicated the promotion of ozone utilization in the bulk solution under the assistance of pac addition similar enhancements with increased carbon addition in fbrs have also been found in other studies chen et al 2017 lin and lai 2000 however few reports have been based on membrane ozonation systems the catalyst utilization efficiency δcod δpac was calculated according to eq 3 as shown in fig 3b δcod δpac was 1 20 0 43 1 54 0 47 1 65 0 39 2 34 0 30 2 34 0 23 and 2 15 0 19 for pac 0 5 to pac 5 respectively the highest values were observed for pac 3 and pac 4 rather than pac 5 higher pac addition could promote total organic removal but would decrease the catalytic efficiency per unit pac other risks derived from high catalyst addition such as increased transmembrane pressure le et al 2019 should also be taken into consideration for practical applications fig 3c shows the δtmp for all pac additions with respect to operation time the results revealed an increase in δtmp from 0 5 kpa to 3 6 kpa with increased pac addition from 0 mg l to 5 mg l at a sampling time of 360 min this result implied that a higher addition of catalyst particles could increase the turbidity of the influent and therefore lead to a fast formation of cake layer on membrane surface le et al 2019 in the filtration process thus low pac addition with high catalyst utilization efficiency was preferred in our process for this work in view of the favorable catalytic performance relatively low catalyst consumption and reduced membrane fouling 3 g l pac addition was chosen for further investigation 3 2 2 ozone dosage and hrt the influence of ozone dosage on catalytic performance was studied using a control group of pure o3 o3 membrane shortened as o3 mem and o3 membrane pac o3 mem pac with membrane pac mem pac that without ozone addition as a blank control si fig s4 when crude phenol solution at cod 130 mg l was treated fresh pac coupled with ceramic membrane si fig s4 showed a rapid removal of cod in initial state and then reached a relatively steady effluent cod of 120 mg l which could be regarded as a sorption process of the fresh pac this result also implied that membrane was ineffective in organics rejection in this work due to its relatively large pore size 0 1 μm as for three ozone added systems fig 4 a with increased ozone dosage all three control experiments showed a similar decrease in residual cod in the effluent and a trend for cod removal appeared o3 mem pac o3 mem o3 alone fig 4a pure ozonation revealed a cod removal of 19 9 and 58 2 at ozone dosages of 10 mg l and 200 mg l respectively while the removal was 39 8 and 71 9 for o3 mem and 41 9 and 74 2 for o3 mem pac both o3 mem and o3 mem pac showed considerably higher cod removal than pure o3 indicating that the acms contributed a large part of the catalytic reactions in the system zone iii fig 2 on the other hand the least cod residue after addition of pac o3 mem pac indicated an enhanced performance in catalytic ozonation which was mainly due to the promoted utilization of both gaseous and dissolved ozone by the fluidized pac especially at non membrane area such as zone i and zone ii such enhancement was considerable in view of the low cod and the poor water quality in the influent the ozone utilization efficiency at different ozone dosages was also calculated and is presented in fig 4b the δcod δo3 values for the three control experiments decreased dramatically from 2 59 0 56 to 0 38 0 01 o3 5 18 0 43 to 0 47 0 01 o3 mem and 5 45 0 43 to 0 48 0 01 o3 mem pac with increasing ozone dosage from 10 mg l to 200 mg l similarly o3 mem pac showed higher δcod δo3 values than the other systems under all conditions and a maximum increase in δcod δo3 2 59 0 10 was revealed at an ozone dosage of 25 mg l this value was 21 9 and 125 higher than that obtained with o3 mem and pure ozonation respectively high ozone dosages could enhance both direct ozonation and catalytic ozonation bourgin et al 2017 guo et al 2018 but would result in a low utilization efficiency of ozone molecules which is in agreement with the previous findings from pilot scale studies wei et al 2019 moreover high ozone addition has been reported to increase energy consumption correspondingly wang et al 2017 2019 as well as the risk for the generation of oxidation by products such as bromate bourgin et al 2017 previous studies have found that bromate would become a problem when the specific ozone dosage expressed as mg o3 mg doc exceeds 1 5 bourgin et al 2017 soltermann et al 2017 yao et al 2017 herein we selected a 25 mg l ozone dosage as the optimum condition for subsequent experiments which corresponded to a specific ozone dosage of approximately 1 mg o3 mg doc based on a toc content of 20 25 mg l equal to the doc value at low ss of coal gasification wastewater the effect of hrt at an ozone dosage of 25 mg l was subsequently evaluated as shown in fig 4c hrt provided nearly no influence on the pure ozonation process in which an effluent cod of approximately 97 mg l was maintained under all chosen conditions indicating the limitation of direct ozonation in contrast as the hrt lengthened from 30 min to 60 min the effluent cod further decreased from 76 7 4 3 mg l to 60 2 2 5 mg l for o3 mem and from 65 4 2 1 mg l to 48 1 1 6 mg l for o3 mem pac these results implied that a breakthrough of the reaction limit was achieved by changing from ozonation to a catalytic ozonation process which was consistent with the reported results saeid et al 2018 yao et al 2018 moreover a long hrt would ensure sufficient contact among solids liquid and gas in the system which could benefit both ozone catalysis and organic degradation in the hfbr 3 2 3 auxiliary aeration strength the investigation of the influence of auxiliary aeration strength on catalytic ozonation was conducted at an aeration flux of 0 10 m3 h as seen from fig 5 a the effluent cod for o3 mem was found to decrease from 78 3 2 2 mg l to 68 2 1 7 mg l when the auxiliary aeration flux increased from 0 m3 h to 4 m3 h which could probably be attributed to the better mixing and mass transfer at the membrane liquid interface that induced at higher aeration strengths however no further cod decrease was observed when the aeration was continually increased to greater than 4 m3 h one possible reason was under higher aeration flux of 5 10 m3 h not the mass transfer but the reaction kinetics of catalytic ozonation became the limitation of the cod removal for o3 mem pac the effluent cod continually decreased with the increasing auxiliary aeration from 77 1 2 2 mg l to 59 6 1 8 mg l as the aeration flux increased from 0 m3 h to 10 m3 h the main difference between o3 mem and o3 mem pac was observed at an aeration flux of 5 10 m3 h since auxiliary aeration showed little contribution of catalytic performance to o3 mem at these fluxes such enhanced cod removal for o3 mem pac was mainly attributed to the promoted pac fluidization and pac based reactions under stronger aeration the δtmp values during 60 min operation periods with different auxiliary aeration fluxes were further studied as presented in fig 5b compared with the δtmp of 1 3 kpa obtained with no auxiliary aeration flux of 0 m3 h the δtmp clearly increased when the flux of auxiliary aeration was set to 1 m3 h 1 8 kpa at 60 min and reached the highest value 2 4 kpa at a flux of 2 m3 h this was probably because the pac started to be fluidized at these aeration strengths and increased the turbidity in the reaction system which led to a rise in membrane fouling then with a further increase of aeration flux the δtmp began to decrease from 2 4 kpa at 2 m3 h to 2 1 kpa at 4 m3 h at an operation time of 60 min and decreased further to 1 5 kpa at an aeration flux 5 m3 h this was mainly due to the intensified cross flow on the membrane surface at higher aeration strengths which quickly removed the sedimented particles through shear force relieving membrane fouling and slowing the enhancement of δtmp kim et al 2008 herein according to the results above the auxiliary aeration flux was chosen to be 5 m3 h due to its balanced effects of relatively high contribution to cod removal and a low risk of δtmp enhancement from the above the optimum parameters for the pilot scale operation were selected as follows ozone dosage of 25 mg l pac addition of 3 g l hrt of 60 min and auxiliary aeration flux of 5 m3 h 3 3 pilot scale treatment of coal gasification secondary effluent 3 3 1 treatment performance the pilot scale treatment of coal gasification wastewater secondary effluent by the fluidized bed reactor was conducted under the chosen optimum conditions the water quality indexes for the effluent during 30 day operation period are presented in fig 6 a f the o3 mem pac system showed favorable and steady performance as well as low tmp increment si fig s5 during the 30 day pilot operation at an average influent cod of 82 2 mg l toc of 23 8 mg l nh3 n of 4 68 mg l tph of 8 37 mg l vph of 5 24 mg l and uv254 of 1 03 the effluent indexes of treated wastewater showed a low cod residual of 27 5 mg l toc of 7 96 mg l nh3 n of 0 89 mg l tph of 3 89 mg l vph of 0 29 mg l and uv254 of 0 11 which outperformed the first class standard a of the discharge standards of pollutants of china gb 18918 2002 cod 50 mg l nh3 n 3 mg l tph 5 mg l and vph 0 5 mg l regarding the ozone utilization efficiency δcod δo3 during the pilot operation a remarkably high value of 2 19 was found for the hfbr which was 117 higher than the achieved result based on pure ozonation 1 01 and was also higher than the values found in other pilot studies in the treatment of industrial wastewater table s1 such improvement was possibly due to the cooperation between the fixed acms and fluidized pac which optimized the ozone utilization and was also attributed to the promoted hydraulic conditions that in the designed hfbr fig 2 and fig s2 in addition it was found the δcod δo3 for secondary effluent treatment 2 19 was a little lower than that for crude phenol 2 59 fig 4b at the same 25 mg l ozone dosage one possible reason could be the lower cod value in influent 70 90 mg l for secondary effluent compared with 130 mg l for crude phenol that affected the mass transfer efficiency in hfbr 3 3 2 water quality analysis gc ms analysis tables s2 and s3 revealed a total amount of 108 possible organics in the influent and 97 organics in the effluent during the advanced treatment of the coal gasification secondary effluent as shown in fig 7 a the number of organics was not obviously changed before and after treatment the corresponding abundance of organics is shown in fig 7b the main organic pollutants and their corresponding removals were aliphatic compounds 76 4 aromatic compounds 32 4 ketones aldehydes 84 8 and n containing compounds 81 3 while esters showed an increase of 46 9 in the effluent cl br and s compounds also showed a considerable removal of 78 1 58 9 and 63 1 respectively heterocyclic compounds and phenols quinones which have attracted widespread attentions due to their bio resistance and toxic properties bai et al 2011 tentscher et al 2018 were removed by 52 2 and 84 3 through catalytic ozonation respectively organic acids decreased by 54 1 through the gc ms analysis fig 8 a shows the distribution of the molecular weight m w of organics in the wastewater organics in the influent were mainly located at m w values of 999 g mol 617 g mol and in the range of 150 400 g mol while organics with a m w of 282 g mol showed the highest abundance the effluent showed an organic removal of 61 2 for m w 400 g mol 59 7 for m w values form 150 400 g mol and an increase of 25 6 in organics with m w 150 g mol since microfiltration by ceramic membranes pore size 0 1 μm is not effective in rejecting organics with m w 7 500 g mol park et al 2012 the elimination of these high m w organics 150 999 g mol was mainly attributed to degradation by catalytic ozonation which could result in a corresponding increase in low m w fragments park et al 2012 winter et al 2016 it should be noted that the contents of organics with m w values of 194 g mol mainly dimethyl phthalate table s3 and figs s5 and 278 g mol dibutyl phthalate and isobutyl phthalate table s3 were also obviously enhanced in the effluent which could indicate that these compounds were the main products generated from catalytic ozonation fig 8b shows a comparison of the number of carbon atoms in the organics between the influent and effluent high carbon containing molecules such as those with carbon numbers of 20 44 and 69 labelled as c 20 c 44 and c 69 respectively were nearly eliminated and most organics between c 11 and c 19 were also decreased in the effluent similarly an increase in c 10 and c 16 organics was observed in the effluent these compounds corresponded to the organics with m w values of 194 g mol and 278 g mol in fig 8a table s3 respectively these results demonstrated that the organics in the coal gasification secondary wastewater were effectively degraded and broken into low m w and low carbon molecules such degradation was possibly due to the ring opening and decomposition of aromatic heterocyclic pollutants and the decrease or breakage of the conjugated groups in long carbon chain structures 3 3 3 evolution of carboxylic acids and bromate when detected by ic fig 9 a three low molecular weight acids formic acid acetic acid and oxalic acid were found to be increased in the effluent and were considered as the main acid products during organic oxidation zhu et al 2017 in detail a pure ozonation process showed the highest formation of acetic acid 9 00 1 78 mg l and oxalic acid 14 10 1 68 mg l in effluent while the values were observed deceasing to 5 06 1 14 mg l and 6 64 2 17 mg l for o3 mem and 2 43 0 34 mg l and 3 98 1 74 mg l for o3 mem pac system such inhibition of acid accumulation was mainly due to the generation of powerful radicals by o3 mem and o3 mem pac through an ozone catalysis process a less formation of formic acid was found for pure o3 system which was probably due to the less generation of organic fragments especially the mono carbon compounds during the direct ozonation process similar phenomenon was also reported elsewhere qu et al 2015 fig 9b showed a comparison of bromate contents in the effluent of coal gasification secondary effluent with different systems notably a high formation of bromate 71 0 7 2 μg l at 100 mg l ozone dosage and 29 3 3 2 μg l at 25 mg l ozone dosage was found for direct ozonation process when transferred to catalytic ozonation the value was declined to 17 3 3 1 μg l of o3 mem and 11 2 1 5 μg l of o3 mem pac at 25 mg l ozone dosage it could be indicated that bromate was reduced in catalytic ozonation process and low ozone condition the better bro3 reduction in o3 mem pac was possibly due to the high utilization and catalysis of ozone molecules that prevented the direct br oxidation process and might also account for the generation of h2o2 alvárez et al 2006 wei et al 2019 during catalytic ozonation that quenched br containing intermediate products yao et al 2018 3 3 4 sterilization effect of hfbr fig 10 showed the fsc and ssc parameters as well as survival rates of cells in the influent and effluent sampled at zone iii before entering acms of coal gasification wastewater treated by different reaction systems the intensities of fsc and ssc were proportional to cell size and intracellular complexity combarros et al 2016 respectively seen from the plots when treated by three systems an obvious enhancement of dot signal could be found mainly at r1 area which could be regarded as a generation of dead cells and cell debris such enhancement was more obvious in o3 mem pac and o3 mem than pure o3 process indicating a better sterilization and damage of cells under catalytic ozonation oh e 0 oh h2o 2 80 v than direct ozonation o3 e 0 o3 h2o 2 07 v meanwhile the double staining method showed a live cell rate as following in decreasing order influent 77 o3 40 o3 mem 24 o3 mem pac 17 which also supported the better sterilization by coupling acms with pac in a hfbr it should be noted due to the pore size of 0 1 μm most cells and their debris would be rejected by the acms in the practical operation according to the analysis above as inferred from the increased contents in the effluent dimethyl phthalate m w 194 g mol c 10 dibutyl phthalate m w 278 g mol c 16 and diisobutyl phthalate m w 278 g mol c 16 were considered the main products while formic acid acetate acid and oxalic acid were regarded as the main acids produced by the catalytic ozonation of coal gasification secondary effluent moreover a high δcod δo3 and a better sterilization were obtained and a low bromate content was detected in the effluent of the hfbr 3 4 change in pac surface functional groups surface functional groups on activated carbon are considered the main reaction sites for the transformation of o3 into active radicals oulton et al 2015 however are also known to be gradually altered in the catalytic ozonation process valdés et al 2002 wang et al 2016 which will lead to the inactivation of carbon catalysts nawrocki and kasprzyk hordern 2010 studies have found that a high ozone dosage and the long term exposure of carbon materials in ozone aeration could greatly accelerate the decrease in carbonyls c o and simultaneously increase the surface acidity wang et al 2016 in practical applications the situation could be more complex due to the existence of different species of organics in the reaction system table 2 shows the surface properties of pac treated by ozone with different organics from the target wastewater phenol and oxalate deionized water as a blank control in a fast ozonation test si p s4 where phenol k o3 1300 l mol s and oxalate k o3 0 04 l mol s were chosen for the large difference in their reaction rates of ozonation hoigné and bader 1983 the surface content of carbonyl groups c o in all pac samples decreased after 4 h of catalytic ozonation with value of 11 19 in the phenol o3 condition 7 50 in the oxalate o3 condition and 2 81 in the pure o3 condition compared with 16 29 for fresh pac c oh c o c structures in the pac were also found to slightly decrease under different ozonation conditions on the other hand o c o structures were observed to increase from 3 45 in fresh pac to 4 07 in the pheonl o3 condition 8 57 in the oxalate o3 condition and 16 16 in the pure o3 condition the surface carboxyl groups cooh detected by boehm titration si p s5 and acidity inversely correlated to the phpzc value on the pac were also found to increase in the same order of conditions all these results implied a possible transformation from carbonyl to carboxyl on pac during the exposure of pac to ozone and organics in the water were found to have certain impacts on such transformation as presented in fig 11 the dft calculation si p s5 showed a possible ozone hybrid transition status of oxalate phenol and edge carbonyl i e aldehyde groups h c o on the pac with corresponding energy barriers of 40 1 kcal mol 3 6 kcal mol and 2 1 kcal mol respectively the low values of the energy barriers implied highly vulnerable structures under ozone attack zhang et al 2017 the uncatalyzed ozone molecules both gaseous and dissolved that accumulate at the pac liquid interface would increase the oxidation of surface carbonyls and result in acidification of the pac in the presence of organics a shared ozonation reaction could occur between phenol and carbonyl groups due to their similar energy barriers which resulted in the protection of carbonyl on the other hand oxalate showed little competitivity in this process due to its extremely high energy barrier and would hence lead to low protection for pac in pure o3 conditions no organics added the surface groups were directly exposed to ozone and a fast transformation from c o to cooh occurred therefore through competitive reactions with ozone the organics in the wastewater were able to affect the change in pac surface carbonyl groups for the treatment of secondary effluent of coal gasification wastewater the pac surface oxygen groups in the hfbr after operation for 10 days time to be refreshed were also analyzed by xps compared to fresh pac fig 12 a small decrease in c o from 16 29 to 13 94 could be found for used pac which was mainly due to the abundant presence of ozone degradable organics e g phenolic and aliphatic compounds in the influent fig 7b and table s2 which contribute to the maintenance of surface carbonyls in addition the high ozone utilization efficiency 2 19 provided by the acms and pac could also reduce the direct ozonation process on the pac interestingly an obvious increase in c oh c o c and o c o could be found despite the low consumption of c o such an unbalanced change in oxygen groups on the used pac led to an increased oxidation degree o1s c1s of 0 34 in contrast to 0 14 for fresh pac this was mainly because the aromatic structure on the pac was destroyed and invaded by oxygen atoms during long term exposure in ozone aeration valdés et al 2002 which was supported by the decreased π π bands sp2 carbon from aromatic rings on the used pac as shown in fig 12 3 5 estimation of energy consumption and operation cost of hfbr the energy consumption and operation cost of the different technologies were calculated according to the parameters in table s4 and the results from fig 4a at the same effluent cod of 65 mg l the ozone dosage was determined to be 25 mg l for o3 mem pac 60 mg l for o3 mem and 100 mg l for pure o3 on the other hand the processes of filtration backwashing and auxiliary aeration should be taken into consideration in membrane based systems as presented in fig 13 the energy consumption of o3 mem pac was 10 8 kwh kgcod which was 30 lower than those of the o3 mem 15 1 kwh kgcod and pure o3 processes 16 2 kwh kgcod this low consumption of o3 mem pac was mainly due to its lowest required ozone dosage the operation costs of these systems were calculated based on the energy consumption and the cost of acms and pac according to fig 13 and table s5 not only the added ozone and material costs wang et al 2017 2019 but also the service life of the ceramic membranes play important roles in membrane based systems a longer service life and lower material price of acms would benefit a decrease in operation cost o3 mem showed the highest cost still higher than that of the pure o3 system even though the acms are supposed to serve for a maximum of 120 months 10 years o3 mem pac showed a lower cost which was comparable to that of pure o3 at a supposed membrane service life of 58 months this value could be shortened to 44 months if the price of the acms were reduced to 75 and could be 29 months at half price cheaper ceramic membranes with optimized performance could be developed in the future on the basis of innovative discoveries and the gradual maturation of technologies in production benkhaya et al 2019 hwa et al 2018 saikia et al 2019 due to the better utilization of ozone in the bulk solution the addition of pac was advantageous for saving both energy consumption and operation costs for the o3 mem pac system especially compared with the non pac system o3 mem therefore a more promising configuration for practical applications is the coupling of acms with pac in a hfbr 4 conclusions this study presented a hybrid fluidized bed reactor based on arrayed ceramic membranes coupled with pac for catalytic ozonation on a pilot scale which was designed with three functional zones to facilitate ozone utilization and organic removal the findings are as following 1 the performance in terms of ozone utilization and organic removal in a pilot scale hco was found to be o3 mem pac o3 mem pure ozonation fluidized pac could promote catalytic performance by utilizing residual dissolved ozone in the hfbr a lower ozone dosage was preferred in the hfbr due to the higher ozone utilization efficiency and lower bromate generations hrt showed higher impacts on membrane based systems than the pure ozonation process and a longer hrt resulted in better organic removal auxiliary aeration had a greater influence on o3 mem pac than o3 mem and pac induced membrane fouling was effectively decreased under relatively high aeration strength 2 the continuous pilot scale treatment of coal gasification secondary effluent by hfbr showed a stable effluent with favorable water qualities most organics in the influent were degraded and fragmented into low m w low carbon species and organic acids due to the high utilization of ozone by the acms and pac much better sterilization and low generation of bromate was found in the hfbr dimethyl phthalate dibutyl phthalate and diisobutyl phthalate were considered as the main products during catalytic ozonation 3 the surface functional groups on carbon catalysts could be influenced by the organic species in the influent the dft calculation showed that the edge carbonyl groups of pac were vulnerable to ozone attack carbons exposed to highly ozone resistant organics or non organic circumstances would be easily acidized by ozone molecules leading to the fast transformation of surface carbonyl groups c o to carboxyl groups cooh 4 lower ozone addition longer service life and cheaper materials for ceramic membranes would benefit a decrease in operation cost for membrane based ozonation processes the addition of pac was found to be efficient and economical due to its low cost and high utilization of ozone molecules which could greatly reduce the ozone demands of the o3 mem pac system therefore catalytic ozonation by coupling acms with pac to an hfbr was proved to be a highly competitive

18096,recently the contamination of fungi in water supply systems has been an area of increasing concern such as aspergillus spp and penicillium spp it can cause some waterborne issues such as odor taste and formation of mycotoxins ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds are considered as a potential alternative to conventional mercury lamps for water disinfection this study has compared the performance of lpuv low pressure ultraviolet and uv leds with emissions at 265 280 nm and combination emissions at 265 280 nm to test inactivation efficiency reactivation viability and electrical energy consumption in the treatment of three water borne fungal species aspergillus niger penicillium polonicum trichoderma harzianum at a batch water disinfection system the results showed that the performances of uv leds were superior for the inactivation of fungal spores compared to the 254 nm lp while no statistically differences were observed among the uv leds p 0 05 the average photoreactivation rate k 1 of fungal spores irradiated by uv leds and 254 nm lp follows the order t harzianum a niger p polonicum compared with lpuv uv leds irradiation at 280 nm and 265 280 nm more efficiently inhibits photoreactivation which was attributed to that irradiation of 280 nm and 265 280 nm would cause greater membrane damage and increase intracellular reactive oxygen species level of fungal spores according to the flow cytometric results the electrical energy consumption of uv leds was higher than that of lpuv which was due to its lower wall plug efficiency the results of this study can provide additional and beneficial information for the reasonable exploitation of uv leds in water disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords fungal spores uv leds disinfection reactivation membrane permeabilized spores intracellular reactive oxygen species 1 introduction the contamination of fungi in water supply system has arisen increasing concern in recent years since it could cause many environmental problems such as taste turbidity odor and the formation of mycotoxins pereira et al 2009 oliveira et al 2013 wen et al 2017a previous studies have demonstrated the wide occurrence of aspergillus spp and penicillium spp in municipal drinking water of which aspergillus spp are considered as potential opportunistic pathogens anaissie et al 2003 gonçalves et al 2006 ma et al 2015 mesquita rocha et al 2013 oliveira et al 2016 in addition trichoderma spp were also found to be the most dominant species in norwegian drinking water hageskal et al 2006 healthy individuals are not at risk of invasive fungal infections but may suffer from superficial or localised infections for example the hair skin or nails nevertheless the occurrence of fungi in drinking water will threaten the health of individuals at higher risk of invasive infections such as immunocompromised patients or those with underlying health conditions sonigo et al 2011 pereira et al 2013 therefore there is a compelling demand for controlling the contamination of fungi in water supplies ultraviolet uv irradiation with wavelengths in the range of 200 320 nm is considered as an effective disinfection technology in recent years wen et al 2017b kowalski 2009 oliveira et al 2013 hijnen et al 2006 and it is being widely applied in water and wastewater treatment due to its versatility effectiveness and lower potential to form harmful disinfection byproducts compared to traditional chemical disinfection processes sun et al 2016 the most widely used uv sources are low pressure lp emitting monochromatic emission at a wavelength of 254 nm and medium pressure mp mercury lamp which emits a polychromatic light at a broad range of wavelengths 200 600 nm bolton and cotton 2011 compared to traditional uv lamps the newly emerging ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led reactors possess the advantages of diversity in wavelengths compactness longer lifetime environmental friendliness no toxic mercury faster start up time potentially less energy consumption and the ability to turn on and off frequently wurtele et al 2011 li et al 2017 song et al 2016 bowker et al 2011 zou et al 2019 thus it is considered as a potential alternative to conventional mercury lamps in the area of water disinfection some studies have examined the application of uv leds in the inactivation of pathogens such as bacteria and viruses for water disinfection oguma et al 2013 have applied uv leds with peak emissions of 265 280 and 310 nm separately or in combination to batch and flow through water disinfection systems and evaluated the disinfection efficiencies of e coli rattanakul and oguma 2018 have investigated the inactivation efficiency and energy consumption of uv leds at various wavelengths for pathogens such as p aeruginosa bacteriophage qβ and b subtilis spores li et al 2018 evaluated the potential of uv leds 265 and 280 nm chlorine uv cl2 for b subtilis spores inactivation however little was known about its efficiency in inactivation of waterborne fungi a recent published research has reported the effectiveness of light emitting diodes 255 nm and 265 nm to achieve an inactivation of three different aspergillus species oliveira et al 2020 but the inactivation of light emitting diodes with other wavelengths such as 280 nm has not been studied for this genera of fungi and other indicative fungi in water furthermore incubation time of fungal spores may influence the uv inactivation efficiency which has not been studied yet thus inactivation characteristics of uv leds and lpuv for fungal spores germinated at different incubation time were also investigated in this study cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds and 6 4 pyrimidine dimers are formed on dna strands of microbial cells after irradiated by uv lamps and the existence of these uv induced lesions would prevent the normal transcription and replication of dna resulting in inactivation of the microorganisms sanz et al 2007 braga et al 2015 however microorganisms inactivated both by lpuv and uv leds still have a high risk of reactivation including photoreactivation and dark repair hijnen et al 2006 pescheck 2019 wang et al 2019 which will greatly weaken the efficiency of uv disinfection and rise the biological risk of water environment li et al 2017 guo et al 2012 to our knowledge previous research regarding the reactivation of microorganisms after being inactivated by uv leds was mainly focused on bacteria including kinetics influencing factors and mechanisms nyangaresi et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 reactivation of fungal spores inactivated by lpuv has been reported by wen et al 2019b 2019c while the photoreactivation and dark repair of fungal spores inactivated by uv leds has not been studied yet as there are significant differences between lpuv and uv leds especially in terms of wavelength it is necessary to investigate characteristics with regard to the reactivation of fungi exposed to different wavelengths through various methods such as staining or detection by flow cytometry fcm plate counting was used as a common method to evaluate the susceptibility of various microorganisms to uv disinfection murdoch et al 2013 chen et al 2009 but this technique is time consuming and labor intensive and it can only be applied to culturability assessment mesquita rocha et al 2013 other methodologies can also be used to assess the viability indicators to complement this cultivation method the combination of fcm with fluorescence based viability stains is a simple rapid and accurate method to access the growth viability and metabolic activity of microorganisms wen et al 2015 2016 mesquita et al 2013 ehgartner et al 2016 ramani et al 2003 however only several reports have mentioned the application of fcm for viability evaluation of fungi disinfection in water bradner and nevalainen 2003 valeria et al 2004 for example oliveira et al 2020 have studied the inactivation efficiencies of uv leds that emit light at the wavelength of 255 nm and 265 nm on three aspergillus species and tested the membrane permeability and enzymatic activity using fcm wen et al 2020 have established a rapid simple and accurate method for quantifying fungal spores and discriminating their viability in water and verified that this technique can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of common disinfectants applied in drinking water treatment electrical energy efficiency is also an important factor that should be considered when designing an economically reasonable disinfection systems a parameter known as electrical energy per order ee o has been previously used to estimate electrical efficiencies of lpuv and mpuv lamps for the degradation of chemical contaminants sharpless and linden 2005 the electrical energy consumption primarily depends on the wall plug efficiency radiant efficiency which represents the energy conversion efficiency in other words the system converts the inputted electrical power into optical output power based on the wall plug efficiency barnes 2007 therefore this parameter can also be applied in uv leds disinfection systems to predict their electrical energy efficiency the objectives of this research were to 1 compare the inactivation efficiency of uv leds 265 nm 280 nm and 265 280 nm combination with lpuv for three genera of fungal spores incubated at different time 2 test the membrane permeability and intracellular reactive oxygen species ros level of the fungal spores inactivated by uv leds and lp uv using fcm 3 explore the reactivation characteristics of the three fungal species after irradiated by uv leds and lpuv 4 evaluate the electrical energy efficiency of uv leds and lpuv for inactivating fungal spores 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganisms and preparation of spore suspensions in this study aspergillus niger a niger penicillium polonicum p polonicum and trichoderma harzianum t harzianum were chosen as model microbes because they were dominant genera of fungal spores isolated from water source in northwest of china wen et al 2017a the fungi were inoculated on dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol drbc agar and cultivated in an incubator at 27 c for one week two weeks three weeks and four weeks respectively fig 1 then the spores were scraped from the drbc agar and washed three times with a sterile phosphate buffer solution pbs at ph 7 3 by centrifugation 8000 rpm 10 min according to the method in our previous study wen et al 2019a immediately after washing the spores were resuspended in a sterile pbs at a concentration of approximately 108 cfu ml as determined by a light microscope bx51 olympus japan and plate counting 2 2 characterization of uv leds scheme of the experimental device used for uv leds irradiation was showed in fig s1 the batch reactor contained two types of uv led chips the 265 nm led and the 280 nm led qingdao jason electric co ltd china a magnetic stirrer direct current dc power source and a fungal spore sample in a glass reactor the led spectra fig s2 measured with a pro spectrometer haas 2000 everfine china exhibited peak wavelength emissions at 266 9 nm and 283 7 nm with fwhm bandwidths of 11 5 nm and 11 2 nm respectively these leds were used both together and separately an air cooling fan was also installed to dissipate heat 2 3 uv irradiations collimated beam experiments were performed to determine the uv fluence response relationships for the three genera of fungal spores wen et al 2017b before the uv irradiation experiments fungal spore suspensions 108 cfu ml were diluted with pbs to achieve a spore concentration of 106 cfu ml for uv leds 10 ml fungal spore suspensions were placed in a petri dish with 4 cm in diameter and exposed to each wavelength or wavelengths combination for each exposure period the distance from the uv leds to the suspension surface was 2 cm for 254 nm lp lamps 100 ml fungal spore suspensions were placed in a petri dish with 12 cm in diameter and irradiated at 50 cm when the scheduled irradiation time reached samples were taken followed by procedures of serial dilution and plated on drbc agar in triplicate the plates were incubated while inverted at 27 c for 2 4 days and the plate counts with the range of 20 300 colonies were selected for enumeration all of the irradiation experiments were conducted three times at room temperature irradiance of 254 nm lp and uv leds were measured by iodide iodate chemical actinometry rahn et al 2003 2006 the irradiance were 0 215 mw cm2 for the 265 nm leds 0 214 mw cm2 for the 280 nm leds 0 185 mw cm2 for the 265 280 nm combination uv leds and 0 120 mw cm2 for the 254 nm lp before irradiation the uv led modules were conducted to warm up and reach a stable emission phase for 5 min and the 254 nm lp went through a similar process for 30 min 2 4 reactivation experiments after 2 log10 inactivation by uv leds or 254 nm lp the petri dishes containing the samples were performed with photoreactivation and dark repair process because the reactivation process of fungal spores was influenced by temperature wen et al 2019b all the reactivation experiments were conducted in a constant temperature incubator 25 c for photoreactivation petri dishes were exposed to two fluorescent lamps 8 w 15 w philips holland for 8 h with stirring and samples were taken at a pre set interval the wavelengths of the fluorescent lamps were 365 nm with an irradiance of 0 25 mw cm2 measured by a spectroradiometer uva365 sanpometer china for dark repair the petri dishes containing the samples were kept in dark for the same amount of time as the samples exposed to the photoreactivation light all of the reactivation experiments were conducted three times 2 5 flow cytometric measurements a flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa equipped with double solid state laser emitting at wavelength of 488 nm and 640 nm was applied to detect the membrane integrity and intracellular ros level of fungal spores green fluorescence was collected in fl1 channel orange and red fluorescence were collected in fl2 and fl3 channel respectively measurements were performed at a fixed flow rate 33 μl min the count rate was kept below 500 particles s during analysis the detection range of the flow cytometer applied in the current study was 103 105 cfu ml thus the sample suspensions were diluted with ultrapure water as necessary the threshold value of 600 was applied on the green fluorescence channel fl1 sybr green ι propidium iodide sg pi dye was used to evaluate the membrane integrity of fungal spores after irradiated by uv leds and lpuv wen et al 2020 the staining condition was as follows 460 μl of spores suspension was inserted into to a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube then 30 μl edta 0 5m ph 8 and 10 μl sg pi 1 50 were added the samples were mixed by a vortex vs 1 dhs china for 3 5 s and then incubated in a thermostatic metal bath hdb smart dhs china at 35 c for 20 min in dark the stained samples were further diluted using ultrapure water before fcm analysis dihydroethidium dhe dye was used to evaluate the intracellular ros level of fungal spores after irradiated by uv leds and lpuv the staining condition was as follows 1 μm dhe was added into a 500 μl spores suspension and then the samples were treated by a vortex and thermostatic metal bath as mentioned above in this work spores staining with dhe with the fluorescence intensity exceeding 9χ103 were defined as those with high ros level which were counted as the percentage of total number of spores 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 inactivation kinetics inactivation efficiency of uv leds and 254 nm lp was described as follows 1 n l og n t n where n 0 and n is the number of colonies cfu ml before and after uv irradiation and n is the value of log10 inactivation uv fluence in this work is the product of the uv irradiance mw cm2 and the irradiation time s the geeraerd and van impe inactivation model fitting tool ginafit was used to describe the inactivation processes of fungal spores berney et al 2006 the following models were used log linear regression plus tail p polonicum and t harzianum log linear regression plus shoulder plus tail a niger the values of the root mean sum of squared errors rmse were used to assess the goodness of fit with the experiment data inactivation rate constants of fungal spores at different uv wavelengths were calculated from a linear part on the fluence response curve 2 6 2 photoreactivation kinetics reactivation of the three genera of fungal spores can be expressed as a function of the survival ratio kashimada et al 1996 the equation used was 2 survival ratio n r n 0 100 where n 0 is the colony number before uv irradiation cfu ml and n r is the colony number after photoreactivation or dark repair for a period of time cfu ml a saturation type first order reaction model proposed by kashimada et al 1996 was used to predict the photoreactivation process which was described as follows 3 s s m s 0 1 e k 1 t s 0 where k 1 is the first order photoreactivation rate constant s 0 is the survival ratio after uv inactivation n d n 0 n d is the colony number of fungal spores after uv inactivation s is the survival ratio at photoreactivation time t n r n 0 and s m is the maximum survival ratio during the photoreactivation process the goodness of fit was evaluated using the correlation coefficient r 2 2 7 electrical energy determination the electrical energy for a specific n log reduction of microbes ee n kwh m3 was applied to estimate the electrical efficiencies of microbial inactivation to compare the performance of uv leds with that of traditional 254 nm lp beck et al 2017 nyangaresi et al 2018 rattanakul and oguma 2018 the equation was described as follows 4 e e n a f n 3 6 10 3 v c wf where a is the irradiated surface area cm2 and fn is the dosage required for n log reduction mj cm2 the factor 3 6 103 is to convert between w and kw s and h ml and m3 and v is the volume of sample ml c is the wall plug efficiency obtained from the manufacturer 0 32 for 254 nm lp and 0 015 0 016 and 0 0155 for the 265 nm 280 nm and 265 280 nm leds respectively and wf is the water factor accounting for the uv absorbance and depth of the water bolton and linden 2003 this equation is for fluence response curve with non linear log reduction 2 8 statistical analysis one way anova was conducted to assess the statistical difference of the inactivation of fungal spores incubated at different time using the software spss 23 0 the data were considered to be significantly different at the significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation characteristics of fungal spores at different incubation time the uv inactivation of a niger p polonicum and t harzianum at different incubation time was examined in a pbs solution using uv leds emitting at 265 nm 280 nm 265 280 nm combination and 254 nm lp as shown in fig 2 fig s3 and fig s4 all of the fluence response curves for the three genera of fungal spores showed tailing phenomena at a high uv fluence regardless of the incubation time and emission of wavelengths which was probably due to the aggregation of spores mattle and tamar 2012 in addition a shoulder was observed in fig 2 which may be attributed to the resistance of fungal spores to oxidative stress sichel et al 2009 furthermore it also can be observed that uv inactivation efficiency uv leds and lp uv was not influenced by the incubation time of fungal spores according to the log count reduction lcr the inactivation performance of uv leds emitting at 265 280 and 265 280 nm were more effective for fungal spores compared with the 254 nm lp while no statistically differences were observed among uv leds p 0 05 in addition no synergic effect of the combination of 265 and 280 nm leds for inactivating fungal spores was found for example the uv fluence required to attain 2 log10 inactivation of a niger incubated at three weeks was 60 59 and 58 mj cm2 for the 265 280 and 265 280 nm leds respectively as for 254 nm lp it required a relatively higher uv fluence of around 100 mj cm2 for the same log inactivation of a niger furthermore based on the uv fluence required for 2 log10 inactivation the order of resistance to uv irradiation was determined as t harzianum p polonicum a niger this order was mainly attributed to differences in enzymes diversity of intracellular structure and pigments content inside the cells of fungi braga et al 2015 wen et al 2019c inactivation rate constants for the three genera of fungal spores calculated form a linear part were shown in table 1 and the goodness of fit with the experiment data assessed by rmse were listed in table s1 it can be observed that there was no significant change in the inactivation rate constants k for fungal spores at different incubated time regardless of the wavelength in addition the inactivation rate constants k of uv leds were significantly higher than those of 254 nm lp and no statistically differences were observed between the uv leds p 0 05 taking a niger incubation at 3 weeks as an example the uv leds inactivation rate constants k of 265 nm 280 nm and 265 280 nm were 0 0837 0 0847 and 0 0972 cm2 mj respectively which were remarkably higher than the k of 254 nm lp 0 0488 cm2 mj the average inactivation rate constants k of a niger were relatively lower than those of p polonicum and t harzianum which corresponds to the lcr results that a niger owns to the highest resistant to uv irradiation among the three genera of fungal spores the values of k 254 0 049 0 098 cm2 mj k 265 0 072 0 111 cm2 mj k 280 0 076 0 114 cm2 mj and k 265 280 0 082 0 120 cm2 mj for fungal spores in this work were similar to that of some virus such as ms2 coliphage 0 061 0 066 cm2 mj and bacteriophage qβ 0 056 0 098 cm2 mj but were lower than that of e coli 0 44 0 91 cm2 mj p aeruginosa 0 51 0 74 cm2 mj l pneumophila 0 45 0 86 cm2 mj and other bacteria li et al 2017 beck et al 2017 nyangaresi et al 2018 rattanakul and oguma 2018 these discrepancies were probably attributed to the structural differences among the fungi bacteria and virus wen et al 2017b rattanakul and oguma 2018 this study revealed that inactivation of fungal spores by uv leds showed the better results compared to conventional 254 nm lpuv according to the fluence based inactivation rate constants 3 2 variation of membrane permeabilized spores after irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp the variation in membrane permeability detected by fcm for the three genera of fungal spores after irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp was shown in fig 3 it can be observed that with the increase of uv fluence the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores increased at different degrees the small amount of membrane permeabilizad spores obtained before inactivation could be explained as the sublethal damage of spores during the storage thanh et al 2007 for a niger irradiated by uv leds at 280 nm and 265 280 nm the number of membrane permeabilized spores rapidly increased up to 78 05 and 73 10 respectively when the uv fluence reached 100 mj cm2 however the number of membrane permeabilized spores after irradiated by uv led of 265 nm and 254 nm lp increased from 8 95 to 36 60 and 12 65 20 50 respectively which did not rise too much the membrane permeabilized spores of p polonicum accounted for more than 90 after irradiated by uv leds at the fluence of 100 mj cm2 while for 254 nm lp it only accounted for 40 00 even if the uv fluence has increased up to 140 mj cm2 completely inactivated according to the plating results with respect to t harzianum the maximum proportion of membrane permeabilized spores 60 40 was lower than that of a niger and p polonicum the discrepancies in the degree of membrane damage existed among the three fungi species probably can be attributed to their differences in cell structure and metabolism characteristics sonigo et al 2011 the 2d dot plot of a niger p polonicum and t harzianum staining with sg pi were shown in in fig 4 fig s5 and fig s6 respectively which intuitively reflect the changes in the percentage of permeabilized membrane spores as pi can only penetrate cells with permeabilized membranes to stain nucleic acids nescerecka et al 2016 the percentage of spores with relatively higher intensity of red fluorescence fl3 a increased with the increase of uv fluence especially for uv leds indicating that the damage of cell membrane was accelerated in summary compared with lpuv uv leds irradiation especially at 280 nm and 265 280 nm could cause more serious membrane damage to fungal spores in spite of the plating results were not statistically different several previous studies have reported that uv irradiation at 280 nm could cause protein damage compared with other wavelengths schmid 2001 oguma et al 2016 nyangaresi et al 2018 which may enhance the permeabilizing process 3 3 intracellular ros level of fungi after irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp the variation in intracellular ros level detected by fcm for the three genera of fungal spores after irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp was shown in fig 5 it can be observed that the percentage of spores with a high ros level for a niger after irradiated by uv leds began to increase when the uv fluence reached 100 mj cm2 and the greatest increases were caused by uv leds 280 nm and 265 280 nm however the intracellular ros level was nearly unchanged when the spores were irradiated by 254 nm lp for p polonicum the percentage of spores with a high ros level after irradiated by uv leds increased rapidly at the uv fluence of 60 mj cm2 and it eventually reached over 95 00 furthermore the percentage of spores for p polonicum with a high ros level after irradiated by 254 nm lp varied from 25 30 to 51 40 with the increase of uv fluence which is a much lower increase than that of uv leds different from a niger and p polonicum the percentage of spores for t harzianum with high ros level remained around 53 00 with the increase of uv fluence both for uv leds and lpuv the histograms of a niger p polonicum and t harzianum dyeing with dhe were shown in in fig 6 fig s7 and fig s8 respectively which intuitively reflect the changes in the percentage of spores with a high ros level with the increase of uv fluence dhe can permeate into cell membranes and be oxidized to ethidium by intracellular ros which can intercalates with dna to produce red fluorescence fl3 a mesquita et al 2013 according to the variation of red fluorescence in cells the ros content and changes in cells can be determined for a niger and p polonicum it can be observed that the intensity of red fluorescence fl3 a increased with the increase of uv fluence especially for uv leds indicating that the production of intracellular ros was accelerated as well ros are formed during metabolic activity acting as signaling molecules regulating developmental processes and physiological responses in fungi they can also be used as metabolic indicators mesquita et al 2013 ros production would be enhanced in fungi due to various stress such as ionizing radiation uv radiation starvation light temperature shifts etc a relatively higher intracellular ros level may lead to increased cell damage severely affect dna accelerating both strand breaks and base damage proteins and other intracellular components it can also contribute to cell membrane instability as well gessler et al 2007 moreno et al 2019 thus compared with lpuv the higher inactivation efficiency of uv leds can be attributed to the higher production of intracellular ros in addition based on the results obtained from figs 3 and 5 it can be speculated that a high ros level promotes the permeabilization of fungal spores for p polonicum and a niger the maximum proportion of membrane permeabilized spores for t harzianum was lower than that of a niger and p polonicum indicating the membrane damage of t harzianum was not as severe as the other two fungal spores which was in accordance to the almost no changes of intracellular ros in t harzianum thus the loss of membrane permeability for t harzianum mainly was caused by other activity damage such as the damage of membrane protein after a long time of uv irradiation especially at 280 nm and 265 280 nm schmid 2001 oguma et al 2002 wen et al 2017b nyangaresi et al 2018 in previous study the disorganization of the outer membrane and damage to the plasma membrane caused by uvc irradiation has also been reported for e coli mody et al 1991 the variety of intracellular ros level is related to genes and enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase gpx inside the fungal cells which leads to the different levels of ros in these fungal spores after uv irradiation gessler et al 2007 3 4 reactivation of fungi after irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp 3 4 1 photoreactivation as shown in fig 7 the three genera of fungal spores in water underwent photoreactivation at different levels following the irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp the survival ratio versus exposure time under photoreactivation light 365 nm for these fungal spores after 2 log10 inactivation were modelled by eq 3 uv fluence required for 2 log10 inactivation of fungal spores were listed in table s2 a good fitting of the first order reaction model to the photoreactivation experimental data can be observed which shows that fungal spores had a faster initial photoreactivation process without induction phase compared with that of bacteria nyangaresi et al 2018 wen et al 2019c the kinetic parameters were listed in table s3 for a niger it is obvious that a higher degree of photoreactivation was occurred after irradiation by 265 nm leds and the s m can reach up to 69 89 no differences existed in s m between the uv leds of 280 nm 265 280 nm and 254 nm lp p 0 05 which were 28 54 28 12 and 29 51 respectively in addition the photoreactivation rate constant of a niger was 0 0055 min 1 0 0041 min 1 0 0070 min 1 and 0 0091 min 1 after inactivated by uv leds of 265 nm 280 nm 265 280 nm combination and 254 nm lp respectively k 1 of 254 nm lp for a niger was the highest indicating that it had a faster initial photoreactivation rate as discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the membrane permeability and intracellular ros level for a niger irradiated by uv led at 265 nm and 254 nm lp did not change too much indicating less damage to the cells in addition the lesions of dna can be easily repaired by photolyase and resulted in the higher photoreactivation percentage of fungal spores irradiated by uv leds at 265 nm and lpuv at 254 nm therefore the double effect of dna damage and membrane damage lead to a lower level of photoreactivation of a niger irradiated by uv leds at 280 nm and 265 280 nm compared with that of uv leds at 265 nm and lpuv at 254 nm for p polonicum a lower degree of photoreactivation was occurred after irradiation by 280 nm leds and combination of 265 280 nm p 0 05 the s m of which were 15 28 15 20 respectively fig 7 b in addition similar results were obtained for t harzianum as shown in fig 7 c the s m of 280 nm leds 21 79 and combination of 265 280 nm leds 20 57 were significantly lower than that of 265 nm leds 26 83 and 254 nm lp 27 80 p 0 05 the average photoreactivation rate constant of p polonicum was lower than that of the other two fungal species which was in accordance with its lower photoreactivation percentage table s2 in summary uv leds irradiation at 280 nm and 265 280 nm would inhibit the photoreactivation more efficiently based on the results detected by fcm as discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 and compared with lpuv uv leds irradiation at 280 nm and 265 280 nm would cause more membrane damage and increase the intracellular ros level of fungal spores further affecting other cellular components and function thus inhibiting the photoreactivation more efficiently this finding was in accordance with a previous study that the photoreactivation of e coli was significantly repressed at 280 nm which was probably due to protein damage that was irreparable by dna repair mechanisms oguma et al 2016 li et al 2017 discrepancies in s m and k 1 existed among these fungal spores may be due to their differences in cell structures pigment contents and repair enzymes bohrerova and linden 2010 sinha and häder 2002 3 4 2 dark repair fig s9 shows the survival ratios of fungal spores versus dark repair time after 2 log10 inactivation by uv leds emitting at 265 nm 280 nm 265 280 nm combination and 254 nm lp in a pbs solution during the process no significant reactivation was observed for the three genera of fungal spores and the survival ratios of a niger p polonicum and t harzianum were all approximately 1 on average the findings were similar to those in our previous study wen et al 2019b that dark repair of fungal spores was insignificant at different temperatures thus the conclusion can be drawn that the dark repair makes almost no difference in the reactivation of fungal spores after being inactivated by uv led or 254 nm lp this was possibly due to the excision repair mechanism of fungal spores in darkness was not obvious wen et al 2019c 3 5 electrical energy efficiency comparisons of the electrical energy ee n required for per order inactivation of fungal spores was shown in fig 8 in this study the 265 280 265 280 nm uv leds and 254 nm lp were used the ee n was calculated using eq 4 254 nm lp owned the lowest ee n required for per log reduction of the three genera of fungal spores compared with uv leds and it was the most energy efficient of the four uv sources as previously reported autin et al 2013 beck et al 2017 of the uv led sources for a niger inactivation the 265 280 265 280 nm uv leds required nearly the same amount of electricity and the same is true for p polonicum and t harzianum which is mainly because 1 the wall plug efficiency c provided by the manufacturer was similar 2 the inactivation efficiency of the three wavelengths was similar however since various uv fluence was required to inactivate the three genera of fungal spores as earlier explained the electrical energies required for ee 1 ee 2 and ee 3 in inactivation of them were different the determined order was as follows t harzianum p polonicum a niger both for 254 nm lpuv and uv leds the ee n value of fungal spores was much higher than that of e coli p aeruginosa and l pneumophila reported by previous studies and was similar to that of some viruses such as hadv2 and bacteriophage qβ beck et al 2017 nyangaresi et al 2018 rattanakul and oguma 2018 which was due to the different uv resistance of fungal spores compared to bacteria and virus in summary the results of this research showed that not only does the ee n depend on the wall plug efficiency but also on the vulnerability of microorganism at the given wavelength which determines the required uv fluence to inactivate them the performance of uv led reactor will be improved quickly with the development of semiconductor technology thus making the promising technology more efficient and more practical use in the water disinfection industry 4 conclusions the main conclusions that can be drawn from this study are as follows 1 uv inactivation efficiency uv leds and lpuv was not influenced by the incubation time of fungal spores the inactivation performances of uv leds emitting at 265 280 and 265 280 nm were more efficient compared with those of the 254 nm lp for fungal spores at different incubation time while no statistically significant differences were observed among the uv leds p 0 05 2 the uv leds and lpuv could affect the membrane permeability and intracellular ros level of the fungal spores to different extents compared with lpuv uv leds irradiation especially at 280 nm and 265 280 nm could cause more serious membrane damage to fungal spores which was verified by fcm and a high ros level can also promote the permeabilization of fungal spores 3 the average photoreactivation rate k 1 of the three genera of fungal spores in water inactivated by uv leds and 254 nm lp follows the order t harzianum a niger p polonicum compared with lpuv uv leds irradiation at 280 nm and 265 280 nm could cause more membrane damage and increase intracellular ros level of fungal spores thus inhibiting the photoreactivation more efficiently no significant dark repair was observed for the three genera of fungal spores after irradiation by different uv sources 4 even though the electrical energy consumption of uv leds was higher than that of lpuv the uv leds especially 280 nm could control the photoreactivation of fungi more efficiently and the performance of uv led reactor will be improved rapidly with further developments in semiconductor technology thus making the promising technology more efficient and more practical use in the near future declaration of competing interest the

18096,recently the contamination of fungi in water supply systems has been an area of increasing concern such as aspergillus spp and penicillium spp it can cause some waterborne issues such as odor taste and formation of mycotoxins ultraviolet light emitting diodes uv leds are considered as a potential alternative to conventional mercury lamps for water disinfection this study has compared the performance of lpuv low pressure ultraviolet and uv leds with emissions at 265 280 nm and combination emissions at 265 280 nm to test inactivation efficiency reactivation viability and electrical energy consumption in the treatment of three water borne fungal species aspergillus niger penicillium polonicum trichoderma harzianum at a batch water disinfection system the results showed that the performances of uv leds were superior for the inactivation of fungal spores compared to the 254 nm lp while no statistically differences were observed among the uv leds p 0 05 the average photoreactivation rate k 1 of fungal spores irradiated by uv leds and 254 nm lp follows the order t harzianum a niger p polonicum compared with lpuv uv leds irradiation at 280 nm and 265 280 nm more efficiently inhibits photoreactivation which was attributed to that irradiation of 280 nm and 265 280 nm would cause greater membrane damage and increase intracellular reactive oxygen species level of fungal spores according to the flow cytometric results the electrical energy consumption of uv leds was higher than that of lpuv which was due to its lower wall plug efficiency the results of this study can provide additional and beneficial information for the reasonable exploitation of uv leds in water disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords fungal spores uv leds disinfection reactivation membrane permeabilized spores intracellular reactive oxygen species 1 introduction the contamination of fungi in water supply system has arisen increasing concern in recent years since it could cause many environmental problems such as taste turbidity odor and the formation of mycotoxins pereira et al 2009 oliveira et al 2013 wen et al 2017a previous studies have demonstrated the wide occurrence of aspergillus spp and penicillium spp in municipal drinking water of which aspergillus spp are considered as potential opportunistic pathogens anaissie et al 2003 gonçalves et al 2006 ma et al 2015 mesquita rocha et al 2013 oliveira et al 2016 in addition trichoderma spp were also found to be the most dominant species in norwegian drinking water hageskal et al 2006 healthy individuals are not at risk of invasive fungal infections but may suffer from superficial or localised infections for example the hair skin or nails nevertheless the occurrence of fungi in drinking water will threaten the health of individuals at higher risk of invasive infections such as immunocompromised patients or those with underlying health conditions sonigo et al 2011 pereira et al 2013 therefore there is a compelling demand for controlling the contamination of fungi in water supplies ultraviolet uv irradiation with wavelengths in the range of 200 320 nm is considered as an effective disinfection technology in recent years wen et al 2017b kowalski 2009 oliveira et al 2013 hijnen et al 2006 and it is being widely applied in water and wastewater treatment due to its versatility effectiveness and lower potential to form harmful disinfection byproducts compared to traditional chemical disinfection processes sun et al 2016 the most widely used uv sources are low pressure lp emitting monochromatic emission at a wavelength of 254 nm and medium pressure mp mercury lamp which emits a polychromatic light at a broad range of wavelengths 200 600 nm bolton and cotton 2011 compared to traditional uv lamps the newly emerging ultraviolet light emitting diode uv led reactors possess the advantages of diversity in wavelengths compactness longer lifetime environmental friendliness no toxic mercury faster start up time potentially less energy consumption and the ability to turn on and off frequently wurtele et al 2011 li et al 2017 song et al 2016 bowker et al 2011 zou et al 2019 thus it is considered as a potential alternative to conventional mercury lamps in the area of water disinfection some studies have examined the application of uv leds in the inactivation of pathogens such as bacteria and viruses for water disinfection oguma et al 2013 have applied uv leds with peak emissions of 265 280 and 310 nm separately or in combination to batch and flow through water disinfection systems and evaluated the disinfection efficiencies of e coli rattanakul and oguma 2018 have investigated the inactivation efficiency and energy consumption of uv leds at various wavelengths for pathogens such as p aeruginosa bacteriophage qβ and b subtilis spores li et al 2018 evaluated the potential of uv leds 265 and 280 nm chlorine uv cl2 for b subtilis spores inactivation however little was known about its efficiency in inactivation of waterborne fungi a recent published research has reported the effectiveness of light emitting diodes 255 nm and 265 nm to achieve an inactivation of three different aspergillus species oliveira et al 2020 but the inactivation of light emitting diodes with other wavelengths such as 280 nm has not been studied for this genera of fungi and other indicative fungi in water furthermore incubation time of fungal spores may influence the uv inactivation efficiency which has not been studied yet thus inactivation characteristics of uv leds and lpuv for fungal spores germinated at different incubation time were also investigated in this study cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers cpds and 6 4 pyrimidine dimers are formed on dna strands of microbial cells after irradiated by uv lamps and the existence of these uv induced lesions would prevent the normal transcription and replication of dna resulting in inactivation of the microorganisms sanz et al 2007 braga et al 2015 however microorganisms inactivated both by lpuv and uv leds still have a high risk of reactivation including photoreactivation and dark repair hijnen et al 2006 pescheck 2019 wang et al 2019 which will greatly weaken the efficiency of uv disinfection and rise the biological risk of water environment li et al 2017 guo et al 2012 to our knowledge previous research regarding the reactivation of microorganisms after being inactivated by uv leds was mainly focused on bacteria including kinetics influencing factors and mechanisms nyangaresi et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 reactivation of fungal spores inactivated by lpuv has been reported by wen et al 2019b 2019c while the photoreactivation and dark repair of fungal spores inactivated by uv leds has not been studied yet as there are significant differences between lpuv and uv leds especially in terms of wavelength it is necessary to investigate characteristics with regard to the reactivation of fungi exposed to different wavelengths through various methods such as staining or detection by flow cytometry fcm plate counting was used as a common method to evaluate the susceptibility of various microorganisms to uv disinfection murdoch et al 2013 chen et al 2009 but this technique is time consuming and labor intensive and it can only be applied to culturability assessment mesquita rocha et al 2013 other methodologies can also be used to assess the viability indicators to complement this cultivation method the combination of fcm with fluorescence based viability stains is a simple rapid and accurate method to access the growth viability and metabolic activity of microorganisms wen et al 2015 2016 mesquita et al 2013 ehgartner et al 2016 ramani et al 2003 however only several reports have mentioned the application of fcm for viability evaluation of fungi disinfection in water bradner and nevalainen 2003 valeria et al 2004 for example oliveira et al 2020 have studied the inactivation efficiencies of uv leds that emit light at the wavelength of 255 nm and 265 nm on three aspergillus species and tested the membrane permeability and enzymatic activity using fcm wen et al 2020 have established a rapid simple and accurate method for quantifying fungal spores and discriminating their viability in water and verified that this technique can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of common disinfectants applied in drinking water treatment electrical energy efficiency is also an important factor that should be considered when designing an economically reasonable disinfection systems a parameter known as electrical energy per order ee o has been previously used to estimate electrical efficiencies of lpuv and mpuv lamps for the degradation of chemical contaminants sharpless and linden 2005 the electrical energy consumption primarily depends on the wall plug efficiency radiant efficiency which represents the energy conversion efficiency in other words the system converts the inputted electrical power into optical output power based on the wall plug efficiency barnes 2007 therefore this parameter can also be applied in uv leds disinfection systems to predict their electrical energy efficiency the objectives of this research were to 1 compare the inactivation efficiency of uv leds 265 nm 280 nm and 265 280 nm combination with lpuv for three genera of fungal spores incubated at different time 2 test the membrane permeability and intracellular reactive oxygen species ros level of the fungal spores inactivated by uv leds and lp uv using fcm 3 explore the reactivation characteristics of the three fungal species after irradiated by uv leds and lpuv 4 evaluate the electrical energy efficiency of uv leds and lpuv for inactivating fungal spores 2 materials and methods 2 1 microorganisms and preparation of spore suspensions in this study aspergillus niger a niger penicillium polonicum p polonicum and trichoderma harzianum t harzianum were chosen as model microbes because they were dominant genera of fungal spores isolated from water source in northwest of china wen et al 2017a the fungi were inoculated on dichloran rose bengal chloramphenicol drbc agar and cultivated in an incubator at 27 c for one week two weeks three weeks and four weeks respectively fig 1 then the spores were scraped from the drbc agar and washed three times with a sterile phosphate buffer solution pbs at ph 7 3 by centrifugation 8000 rpm 10 min according to the method in our previous study wen et al 2019a immediately after washing the spores were resuspended in a sterile pbs at a concentration of approximately 108 cfu ml as determined by a light microscope bx51 olympus japan and plate counting 2 2 characterization of uv leds scheme of the experimental device used for uv leds irradiation was showed in fig s1 the batch reactor contained two types of uv led chips the 265 nm led and the 280 nm led qingdao jason electric co ltd china a magnetic stirrer direct current dc power source and a fungal spore sample in a glass reactor the led spectra fig s2 measured with a pro spectrometer haas 2000 everfine china exhibited peak wavelength emissions at 266 9 nm and 283 7 nm with fwhm bandwidths of 11 5 nm and 11 2 nm respectively these leds were used both together and separately an air cooling fan was also installed to dissipate heat 2 3 uv irradiations collimated beam experiments were performed to determine the uv fluence response relationships for the three genera of fungal spores wen et al 2017b before the uv irradiation experiments fungal spore suspensions 108 cfu ml were diluted with pbs to achieve a spore concentration of 106 cfu ml for uv leds 10 ml fungal spore suspensions were placed in a petri dish with 4 cm in diameter and exposed to each wavelength or wavelengths combination for each exposure period the distance from the uv leds to the suspension surface was 2 cm for 254 nm lp lamps 100 ml fungal spore suspensions were placed in a petri dish with 12 cm in diameter and irradiated at 50 cm when the scheduled irradiation time reached samples were taken followed by procedures of serial dilution and plated on drbc agar in triplicate the plates were incubated while inverted at 27 c for 2 4 days and the plate counts with the range of 20 300 colonies were selected for enumeration all of the irradiation experiments were conducted three times at room temperature irradiance of 254 nm lp and uv leds were measured by iodide iodate chemical actinometry rahn et al 2003 2006 the irradiance were 0 215 mw cm2 for the 265 nm leds 0 214 mw cm2 for the 280 nm leds 0 185 mw cm2 for the 265 280 nm combination uv leds and 0 120 mw cm2 for the 254 nm lp before irradiation the uv led modules were conducted to warm up and reach a stable emission phase for 5 min and the 254 nm lp went through a similar process for 30 min 2 4 reactivation experiments after 2 log10 inactivation by uv leds or 254 nm lp the petri dishes containing the samples were performed with photoreactivation and dark repair process because the reactivation process of fungal spores was influenced by temperature wen et al 2019b all the reactivation experiments were conducted in a constant temperature incubator 25 c for photoreactivation petri dishes were exposed to two fluorescent lamps 8 w 15 w philips holland for 8 h with stirring and samples were taken at a pre set interval the wavelengths of the fluorescent lamps were 365 nm with an irradiance of 0 25 mw cm2 measured by a spectroradiometer uva365 sanpometer china for dark repair the petri dishes containing the samples were kept in dark for the same amount of time as the samples exposed to the photoreactivation light all of the reactivation experiments were conducted three times 2 5 flow cytometric measurements a flow cytometer accuri c6 bd usa equipped with double solid state laser emitting at wavelength of 488 nm and 640 nm was applied to detect the membrane integrity and intracellular ros level of fungal spores green fluorescence was collected in fl1 channel orange and red fluorescence were collected in fl2 and fl3 channel respectively measurements were performed at a fixed flow rate 33 μl min the count rate was kept below 500 particles s during analysis the detection range of the flow cytometer applied in the current study was 103 105 cfu ml thus the sample suspensions were diluted with ultrapure water as necessary the threshold value of 600 was applied on the green fluorescence channel fl1 sybr green ι propidium iodide sg pi dye was used to evaluate the membrane integrity of fungal spores after irradiated by uv leds and lpuv wen et al 2020 the staining condition was as follows 460 μl of spores suspension was inserted into to a 1 5 ml centrifuge tube then 30 μl edta 0 5m ph 8 and 10 μl sg pi 1 50 were added the samples were mixed by a vortex vs 1 dhs china for 3 5 s and then incubated in a thermostatic metal bath hdb smart dhs china at 35 c for 20 min in dark the stained samples were further diluted using ultrapure water before fcm analysis dihydroethidium dhe dye was used to evaluate the intracellular ros level of fungal spores after irradiated by uv leds and lpuv the staining condition was as follows 1 μm dhe was added into a 500 μl spores suspension and then the samples were treated by a vortex and thermostatic metal bath as mentioned above in this work spores staining with dhe with the fluorescence intensity exceeding 9χ103 were defined as those with high ros level which were counted as the percentage of total number of spores 2 6 data analysis 2 6 1 inactivation kinetics inactivation efficiency of uv leds and 254 nm lp was described as follows 1 n l og n t n where n 0 and n is the number of colonies cfu ml before and after uv irradiation and n is the value of log10 inactivation uv fluence in this work is the product of the uv irradiance mw cm2 and the irradiation time s the geeraerd and van impe inactivation model fitting tool ginafit was used to describe the inactivation processes of fungal spores berney et al 2006 the following models were used log linear regression plus tail p polonicum and t harzianum log linear regression plus shoulder plus tail a niger the values of the root mean sum of squared errors rmse were used to assess the goodness of fit with the experiment data inactivation rate constants of fungal spores at different uv wavelengths were calculated from a linear part on the fluence response curve 2 6 2 photoreactivation kinetics reactivation of the three genera of fungal spores can be expressed as a function of the survival ratio kashimada et al 1996 the equation used was 2 survival ratio n r n 0 100 where n 0 is the colony number before uv irradiation cfu ml and n r is the colony number after photoreactivation or dark repair for a period of time cfu ml a saturation type first order reaction model proposed by kashimada et al 1996 was used to predict the photoreactivation process which was described as follows 3 s s m s 0 1 e k 1 t s 0 where k 1 is the first order photoreactivation rate constant s 0 is the survival ratio after uv inactivation n d n 0 n d is the colony number of fungal spores after uv inactivation s is the survival ratio at photoreactivation time t n r n 0 and s m is the maximum survival ratio during the photoreactivation process the goodness of fit was evaluated using the correlation coefficient r 2 2 7 electrical energy determination the electrical energy for a specific n log reduction of microbes ee n kwh m3 was applied to estimate the electrical efficiencies of microbial inactivation to compare the performance of uv leds with that of traditional 254 nm lp beck et al 2017 nyangaresi et al 2018 rattanakul and oguma 2018 the equation was described as follows 4 e e n a f n 3 6 10 3 v c wf where a is the irradiated surface area cm2 and fn is the dosage required for n log reduction mj cm2 the factor 3 6 103 is to convert between w and kw s and h ml and m3 and v is the volume of sample ml c is the wall plug efficiency obtained from the manufacturer 0 32 for 254 nm lp and 0 015 0 016 and 0 0155 for the 265 nm 280 nm and 265 280 nm leds respectively and wf is the water factor accounting for the uv absorbance and depth of the water bolton and linden 2003 this equation is for fluence response curve with non linear log reduction 2 8 statistical analysis one way anova was conducted to assess the statistical difference of the inactivation of fungal spores incubated at different time using the software spss 23 0 the data were considered to be significantly different at the significance level of 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 inactivation characteristics of fungal spores at different incubation time the uv inactivation of a niger p polonicum and t harzianum at different incubation time was examined in a pbs solution using uv leds emitting at 265 nm 280 nm 265 280 nm combination and 254 nm lp as shown in fig 2 fig s3 and fig s4 all of the fluence response curves for the three genera of fungal spores showed tailing phenomena at a high uv fluence regardless of the incubation time and emission of wavelengths which was probably due to the aggregation of spores mattle and tamar 2012 in addition a shoulder was observed in fig 2 which may be attributed to the resistance of fungal spores to oxidative stress sichel et al 2009 furthermore it also can be observed that uv inactivation efficiency uv leds and lp uv was not influenced by the incubation time of fungal spores according to the log count reduction lcr the inactivation performance of uv leds emitting at 265 280 and 265 280 nm were more effective for fungal spores compared with the 254 nm lp while no statistically differences were observed among uv leds p 0 05 in addition no synergic effect of the combination of 265 and 280 nm leds for inactivating fungal spores was found for example the uv fluence required to attain 2 log10 inactivation of a niger incubated at three weeks was 60 59 and 58 mj cm2 for the 265 280 and 265 280 nm leds respectively as for 254 nm lp it required a relatively higher uv fluence of around 100 mj cm2 for the same log inactivation of a niger furthermore based on the uv fluence required for 2 log10 inactivation the order of resistance to uv irradiation was determined as t harzianum p polonicum a niger this order was mainly attributed to differences in enzymes diversity of intracellular structure and pigments content inside the cells of fungi braga et al 2015 wen et al 2019c inactivation rate constants for the three genera of fungal spores calculated form a linear part were shown in table 1 and the goodness of fit with the experiment data assessed by rmse were listed in table s1 it can be observed that there was no significant change in the inactivation rate constants k for fungal spores at different incubated time regardless of the wavelength in addition the inactivation rate constants k of uv leds were significantly higher than those of 254 nm lp and no statistically differences were observed between the uv leds p 0 05 taking a niger incubation at 3 weeks as an example the uv leds inactivation rate constants k of 265 nm 280 nm and 265 280 nm were 0 0837 0 0847 and 0 0972 cm2 mj respectively which were remarkably higher than the k of 254 nm lp 0 0488 cm2 mj the average inactivation rate constants k of a niger were relatively lower than those of p polonicum and t harzianum which corresponds to the lcr results that a niger owns to the highest resistant to uv irradiation among the three genera of fungal spores the values of k 254 0 049 0 098 cm2 mj k 265 0 072 0 111 cm2 mj k 280 0 076 0 114 cm2 mj and k 265 280 0 082 0 120 cm2 mj for fungal spores in this work were similar to that of some virus such as ms2 coliphage 0 061 0 066 cm2 mj and bacteriophage qβ 0 056 0 098 cm2 mj but were lower than that of e coli 0 44 0 91 cm2 mj p aeruginosa 0 51 0 74 cm2 mj l pneumophila 0 45 0 86 cm2 mj and other bacteria li et al 2017 beck et al 2017 nyangaresi et al 2018 rattanakul and oguma 2018 these discrepancies were probably attributed to the structural differences among the fungi bacteria and virus wen et al 2017b rattanakul and oguma 2018 this study revealed that inactivation of fungal spores by uv leds showed the better results compared to conventional 254 nm lpuv according to the fluence based inactivation rate constants 3 2 variation of membrane permeabilized spores after irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp the variation in membrane permeability detected by fcm for the three genera of fungal spores after irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp was shown in fig 3 it can be observed that with the increase of uv fluence the percentage of membrane permeabilized spores increased at different degrees the small amount of membrane permeabilizad spores obtained before inactivation could be explained as the sublethal damage of spores during the storage thanh et al 2007 for a niger irradiated by uv leds at 280 nm and 265 280 nm the number of membrane permeabilized spores rapidly increased up to 78 05 and 73 10 respectively when the uv fluence reached 100 mj cm2 however the number of membrane permeabilized spores after irradiated by uv led of 265 nm and 254 nm lp increased from 8 95 to 36 60 and 12 65 20 50 respectively which did not rise too much the membrane permeabilized spores of p polonicum accounted for more than 90 after irradiated by uv leds at the fluence of 100 mj cm2 while for 254 nm lp it only accounted for 40 00 even if the uv fluence has increased up to 140 mj cm2 completely inactivated according to the plating results with respect to t harzianum the maximum proportion of membrane permeabilized spores 60 40 was lower than that of a niger and p polonicum the discrepancies in the degree of membrane damage existed among the three fungi species probably can be attributed to their differences in cell structure and metabolism characteristics sonigo et al 2011 the 2d dot plot of a niger p polonicum and t harzianum staining with sg pi were shown in in fig 4 fig s5 and fig s6 respectively which intuitively reflect the changes in the percentage of permeabilized membrane spores as pi can only penetrate cells with permeabilized membranes to stain nucleic acids nescerecka et al 2016 the percentage of spores with relatively higher intensity of red fluorescence fl3 a increased with the increase of uv fluence especially for uv leds indicating that the damage of cell membrane was accelerated in summary compared with lpuv uv leds irradiation especially at 280 nm and 265 280 nm could cause more serious membrane damage to fungal spores in spite of the plating results were not statistically different several previous studies have reported that uv irradiation at 280 nm could cause protein damage compared with other wavelengths schmid 2001 oguma et al 2016 nyangaresi et al 2018 which may enhance the permeabilizing process 3 3 intracellular ros level of fungi after irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp the variation in intracellular ros level detected by fcm for the three genera of fungal spores after irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp was shown in fig 5 it can be observed that the percentage of spores with a high ros level for a niger after irradiated by uv leds began to increase when the uv fluence reached 100 mj cm2 and the greatest increases were caused by uv leds 280 nm and 265 280 nm however the intracellular ros level was nearly unchanged when the spores were irradiated by 254 nm lp for p polonicum the percentage of spores with a high ros level after irradiated by uv leds increased rapidly at the uv fluence of 60 mj cm2 and it eventually reached over 95 00 furthermore the percentage of spores for p polonicum with a high ros level after irradiated by 254 nm lp varied from 25 30 to 51 40 with the increase of uv fluence which is a much lower increase than that of uv leds different from a niger and p polonicum the percentage of spores for t harzianum with high ros level remained around 53 00 with the increase of uv fluence both for uv leds and lpuv the histograms of a niger p polonicum and t harzianum dyeing with dhe were shown in in fig 6 fig s7 and fig s8 respectively which intuitively reflect the changes in the percentage of spores with a high ros level with the increase of uv fluence dhe can permeate into cell membranes and be oxidized to ethidium by intracellular ros which can intercalates with dna to produce red fluorescence fl3 a mesquita et al 2013 according to the variation of red fluorescence in cells the ros content and changes in cells can be determined for a niger and p polonicum it can be observed that the intensity of red fluorescence fl3 a increased with the increase of uv fluence especially for uv leds indicating that the production of intracellular ros was accelerated as well ros are formed during metabolic activity acting as signaling molecules regulating developmental processes and physiological responses in fungi they can also be used as metabolic indicators mesquita et al 2013 ros production would be enhanced in fungi due to various stress such as ionizing radiation uv radiation starvation light temperature shifts etc a relatively higher intracellular ros level may lead to increased cell damage severely affect dna accelerating both strand breaks and base damage proteins and other intracellular components it can also contribute to cell membrane instability as well gessler et al 2007 moreno et al 2019 thus compared with lpuv the higher inactivation efficiency of uv leds can be attributed to the higher production of intracellular ros in addition based on the results obtained from figs 3 and 5 it can be speculated that a high ros level promotes the permeabilization of fungal spores for p polonicum and a niger the maximum proportion of membrane permeabilized spores for t harzianum was lower than that of a niger and p polonicum indicating the membrane damage of t harzianum was not as severe as the other two fungal spores which was in accordance to the almost no changes of intracellular ros in t harzianum thus the loss of membrane permeability for t harzianum mainly was caused by other activity damage such as the damage of membrane protein after a long time of uv irradiation especially at 280 nm and 265 280 nm schmid 2001 oguma et al 2002 wen et al 2017b nyangaresi et al 2018 in previous study the disorganization of the outer membrane and damage to the plasma membrane caused by uvc irradiation has also been reported for e coli mody et al 1991 the variety of intracellular ros level is related to genes and enzymes such as glutathione peroxidase gpx inside the fungal cells which leads to the different levels of ros in these fungal spores after uv irradiation gessler et al 2007 3 4 reactivation of fungi after irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp 3 4 1 photoreactivation as shown in fig 7 the three genera of fungal spores in water underwent photoreactivation at different levels following the irradiation by uv leds and 254 nm lp the survival ratio versus exposure time under photoreactivation light 365 nm for these fungal spores after 2 log10 inactivation were modelled by eq 3 uv fluence required for 2 log10 inactivation of fungal spores were listed in table s2 a good fitting of the first order reaction model to the photoreactivation experimental data can be observed which shows that fungal spores had a faster initial photoreactivation process without induction phase compared with that of bacteria nyangaresi et al 2018 wen et al 2019c the kinetic parameters were listed in table s3 for a niger it is obvious that a higher degree of photoreactivation was occurred after irradiation by 265 nm leds and the s m can reach up to 69 89 no differences existed in s m between the uv leds of 280 nm 265 280 nm and 254 nm lp p 0 05 which were 28 54 28 12 and 29 51 respectively in addition the photoreactivation rate constant of a niger was 0 0055 min 1 0 0041 min 1 0 0070 min 1 and 0 0091 min 1 after inactivated by uv leds of 265 nm 280 nm 265 280 nm combination and 254 nm lp respectively k 1 of 254 nm lp for a niger was the highest indicating that it had a faster initial photoreactivation rate as discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 the membrane permeability and intracellular ros level for a niger irradiated by uv led at 265 nm and 254 nm lp did not change too much indicating less damage to the cells in addition the lesions of dna can be easily repaired by photolyase and resulted in the higher photoreactivation percentage of fungal spores irradiated by uv leds at 265 nm and lpuv at 254 nm therefore the double effect of dna damage and membrane damage lead to a lower level of photoreactivation of a niger irradiated by uv leds at 280 nm and 265 280 nm compared with that of uv leds at 265 nm and lpuv at 254 nm for p polonicum a lower degree of photoreactivation was occurred after irradiation by 280 nm leds and combination of 265 280 nm p 0 05 the s m of which were 15 28 15 20 respectively fig 7 b in addition similar results were obtained for t harzianum as shown in fig 7 c the s m of 280 nm leds 21 79 and combination of 265 280 nm leds 20 57 were significantly lower than that of 265 nm leds 26 83 and 254 nm lp 27 80 p 0 05 the average photoreactivation rate constant of p polonicum was lower than that of the other two fungal species which was in accordance with its lower photoreactivation percentage table s2 in summary uv leds irradiation at 280 nm and 265 280 nm would inhibit the photoreactivation more efficiently based on the results detected by fcm as discussed in sections 3 2 and 3 3 and compared with lpuv uv leds irradiation at 280 nm and 265 280 nm would cause more membrane damage and increase the intracellular ros level of fungal spores further affecting other cellular components and function thus inhibiting the photoreactivation more efficiently this finding was in accordance with a previous study that the photoreactivation of e coli was significantly repressed at 280 nm which was probably due to protein damage that was irreparable by dna repair mechanisms oguma et al 2016 li et al 2017 discrepancies in s m and k 1 existed among these fungal spores may be due to their differences in cell structures pigment contents and repair enzymes bohrerova and linden 2010 sinha and häder 2002 3 4 2 dark repair fig s9 shows the survival ratios of fungal spores versus dark repair time after 2 log10 inactivation by uv leds emitting at 265 nm 280 nm 265 280 nm combination and 254 nm lp in a pbs solution during the process no significant reactivation was observed for the three genera of fungal spores and the survival ratios of a niger p polonicum and t harzianum were all approximately 1 on average the findings were similar to those in our previous study wen et al 2019b that dark repair of fungal spores was insignificant at different temperatures thus the conclusion can be drawn that the dark repair makes almost no difference in the reactivation of fungal spores after being inactivated by uv led or 254 nm lp this was possibly due to the excision repair mechanism of fungal spores in darkness was not obvious wen et al 2019c 3 5 electrical energy efficiency comparisons of the electrical energy ee n required for per order inactivation of fungal spores was shown in fig 8 in this study the 265 280 265 280 nm uv leds and 254 nm lp were used the ee n was calculated using eq 4 254 nm lp owned the lowest ee n required for per log reduction of the three genera of fungal spores compared with uv leds and it was the most energy efficient of the four uv sources as previously reported autin et al 2013 beck et al 2017 of the uv led sources for a niger inactivation the 265 280 265 280 nm uv leds required nearly the same amount of electricity and the same is true for p polonicum and t harzianum which is mainly because 1 the wall plug efficiency c provided by the manufacturer was similar 2 the inactivation efficiency of the three wavelengths was similar however since various uv fluence was required to inactivate the three genera of fungal spores as earlier explained the electrical energies required for ee 1 ee 2 and ee 3 in inactivation of them were different the determined order was as follows t harzianum p polonicum a niger both for 254 nm lpuv and uv leds the ee n value of fungal spores was much higher than that of e coli p aeruginosa and l pneumophila reported by previous studies and was similar to that of some viruses such as hadv2 and bacteriophage qβ beck et al 2017 nyangaresi et al 2018 rattanakul and oguma 2018 which was due to the different uv resistance of fungal spores compared to bacteria and virus in summary the results of this research showed that not only does the ee n depend on the wall plug efficiency but also on the vulnerability of microorganism at the given wavelength which determines the required uv fluence to inactivate them the performance of uv led reactor will be improved quickly with the development of semiconductor technology thus making the promising technology more efficient and more practical use in the water disinfection industry 4 conclusions the main conclusions that can be drawn from this study are as follows 1 uv inactivation efficiency uv leds and lpuv was not influenced by the incubation time of fungal spores the inactivation performances of uv leds emitting at 265 280 and 265 280 nm were more efficient compared with those of the 254 nm lp for fungal spores at different incubation time while no statistically significant differences were observed among the uv leds p 0 05 2 the uv leds and lpuv could affect the membrane permeability and intracellular ros level of the fungal spores to different extents compared with lpuv uv leds irradiation especially at 280 nm and 265 280 nm could cause more serious membrane damage to fungal spores which was verified by fcm and a high ros level can also promote the permeabilization of fungal spores 3 the average photoreactivation rate k 1 of the three genera of fungal spores in water inactivated by uv leds and 254 nm lp follows the order t harzianum a niger p polonicum compared with lpuv uv leds irradiation at 280 nm and 265 280 nm could cause more membrane damage and increase intracellular ros level of fungal spores thus inhibiting the photoreactivation more efficiently no significant dark repair was observed for the three genera of fungal spores after irradiation by different uv sources 4 even though the electrical energy consumption of uv leds was higher than that of lpuv the uv leds especially 280 nm could control the photoreactivation of fungi more efficiently and the performance of uv led reactor will be improved rapidly with further developments in semiconductor technology thus making the promising technology more efficient and more practical use in the near future declaration of competing interest the

18097,harmful algal blooms habs are an ecological concern but relatively few studies have investigated the functional potential of bacterioplankton over a complete algal bloom cycle which is critical for determining their contribution to the fate of algal blooms to address this point we carried out a time series metagenomic analysis of the functional features of microbial communities at three different gymnodinium catenatum bloom stages pre peak and post bloom different microbial composition were observed during the blooming stages the environmental parameters and correlation networks co contribute to microbial variability and the former explained 38 4 of total variations of the bacterioplankton community composition functionally a range of pathways involved in carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur cycling were significantly different during the various hab stages genes associated with carbohydrate active enzymes denitrification and iron oxidation were enriched at the pre bloom stage genes involved in reductive citrate cycle for carbon fixation carbon degradation nitrification and phosphate transport were enhanced at the peak stage and relative gene abundance related to sulfur oxidation vitamin synthesis and iron transport and storage was increased at the post bloom stage the ecological linkage analysis has shown that microbial functional potential especially the c p fe metabolism were significantly linked to the fate of the algal blooms taken together our results demonstrated that microorganisms displayed successional patterns not only at the community level but also in the metabolic potential on hab s progression this work contributes to a growing understanding of microbial structural elasticity and functional plasticity and shed light on the potential mechanisms of microbial mediated hab trajectory graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal blooms microbial functional profiles matter cycle metagenomic 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs are an ecological disaster and result from excessive proliferation of algal species or other phytoplankton pinckney et al 1997 the impacts of habs include human food poisoning resulting from ingestion of contaminated seafood loss of wild or farmed fish resources and impairment of tourism anderson 2009 in some cases high biomass habs can also induce hypoxia or produce toxins jeopardize marine organisms and destroy the stability of marine ecosystems all of which cause both major economic losses and ecological damage guo et al 2015 wolf et al 2017 over the past several decades annually recurring habs in lakes estuaries and coastal waters worldwide have become a major concern zhou et al 2018 the global climate change and environmental stresses such as eutrophication the spread of contaminants and human activities e g impoundment shoreline development and dredging have increased the frequency and complexity of habs gobler et al 2017 needham et al 2017 identifying the factors that modulate hab dynamics is critical for their effective management numerous studies have investigated mechanisms underlying the formation and extinction of habs which is influenced by abiotic factors such as

roles in habs is still limited in part because 16s rrna gene sequencing cannot directly link function to phylogeny marchesi and ravel 2015 there is limited information about the molecular and physiological functions of microbes within habs to address this point functional analyses of microbial metabolic potential during an hab event are required metagenome sequencing provides a chance to examine the abundance of metabolic related genes across the complete hab cycle previously many studies have revealed the taxonomic diversity of marine and freshwater microbial communities ganesh et al

methods yang et al 2016 unfried et al 2018 however we need to note that each hab event is unique to a specific ecosystem or species and specific set of environmental conditions yu et al 2020 it is essential to investigate microbial function and their contribution to hab dynamics in a case by case manner gong et al 2017 yu et al 2020 in this study we investigated the microbial community composition and metabolic potential in response to a natural marine dinoflagellate bloom gymnodinium catenatum at different successional stages samples were collected directly from the field and thus reflected in situ information we hypothesized that 1 microorganisms displayed successional patterns not only on community structure but also on functional characters 2 metabolic genes carbon nitrogen phosphorus sulfur iron are differentially abundant at different stages and a functional shift contributes to the dynamic process of hab our aim was to elucidate the successional profiles of microorganisms in a hab cycle from structural to functional perspective 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and environmental parameters the samples were collected and processed as

packages in r v 3 1 1 http www rproject org 3 results 3 1 hab characteristics blooming dinoflagellates were morphologically identified as predominantly gymnodinium catenatum fig s1 to reduce the complexity of analyses we selected samples from three stages to represent the hab event i e pre bloom stage yt1 peak stage yt5 and yt6 and post bloom stage yt10 and yt11 g catenatum cell concentrations ranged from 0 51 0 042 102 to 5 4 0 61 103 cells ml 1 with the largest value occurring at the peak bloom stage p 0 01 fig 1a total chlorophyll a followed a similar trend with a maximum concentration 210 μg l 1 at the peak stage p 0 01 the variable fluorescence to maximum fluorescence ratio ranged from 0 29 to 0 71 and was relatively constant 0 61 0 06 at the peak of the bloom total bacterial abundance was 4 2 0 38 105 to 3 6 0 37 106 cells ml 1 with the highest value detected in the post bloom stage p 0 01 fig 1a during the hab event temperature ranged from 27 5 c to 28 7 c salinity from 27 8 to 34 6 and ph from 7 36 to 8 52 huang et al 2018 among nutrients the highest 0 26 0 024 mg l 1 and lowest 0 043 0 0044 mg l 1 concentrations of no3 no2 were detected during the pre bloom and peak stages respectively p 0 05 fig 1b a similar trend was observed for po4 3 and nh4 which were present at a higher concentration in pre bloom stage and lower levels in peak post bloom stages p 0 05 3 2 biodiversity and microbial community dynamics rarefaction analyses showed clear differences among g catenatum associated bacterial communities at different hab stages chao1 richness was significantly higher p 0 014 at the pre bloom stage than at the peak and post bloom stages fig 2 i the shannon index showed a similar trend with values of 7 1 5 0 and 5 8 at the pre bloom peak and post bloom stages respectively p 0 008 fig 2ii some significant differences were also observed in the simpson indices of bacterial communities at different stages p 0 021 fig 2iii among the various stages the β diversity was higher at the post bloom stage than at the pre bloom and peak stages fig 2iv these data indicate that microbial biodiversity declined during the g catenatum bloom significant cluster differences fig s2 and composition changes in bacterial community were observed during the hab event and the detailed information can be seen from our previously work huang et al 2018 briefly the alphaproteobacteria and synechococcophycideae dominated during the pre bloom stage at the peak of the bloom the abundance of gammaproteobacteria and flavobacteria increased along with that oceanospirillales rhodobacteriales and synechococcales at the post bloom stage the predominant taxa were flavobacteriales pseudomonadales and alteromonadales 3 3 correlation between environmental factors and microbial community structure cca was used to evaluate associations between microbial community structure and environmental parameters po4 3 chlorophyll a and nh4 no3 made the greatest contribution to the variation in bacterial community composition fig 3 a in terms of physical parameters temperature was associated with bacterial composition whereas no clear positive or negative correlation was observed between salinity or ph and population structure the detailed relationship between the abundance of specific genus and environmental factors was also assessed by pearson s correlation analysis fig s3 the relative contributions of environmental parameters to bacterial abundance were further evaluated by vpa method temperature t nutrients n including no3 no2 nh4 and po4 3 and salinity ph sp collectively explained 38 4 of microbial community variation based on otu data fig 3b individually t n and sp explained 14 3 p 0 01 11 5 p 0 05 and 5 1 p 0 05 respectively of the total observed variation meanwhile interactions between t and n t and sp and n and sp explained 3 4 2 3 and 1 8 of the variation respectively however these parameters could not explain 61 6 of the variation in microbial community composition to identify biotic factors that contribute to bacterial community composition in the g catenatum bloom we carried out a network analysis based on the spearman s correlations of 16s rrna gene otus there are significant pairwise correlations especially between α proteobacteria and γ proteobacteria fig s4 an interaction network based on community correlations is shown in fig 3c for simplicity we selected the top 35 otus which were analyzed at the genus level totally there were 733 associations of which 53 2 were positive and 46 8 were negative among the bacterial groups we found that complex inter and intra relationships in the co occurring network the shewanella synechococcus atcanivorax pseudoalteromonas and hatomonas were the potential keystone taxa which co occurred most frequently in pairwise analyses with the other members particularly with dinoflagellates such as alexandrium pyrophacus and gyrodinium in the eukaryotic groups we also observed active interplay which showed the highest degree in the bloom forming organism gymnodinium sp among the prokaryotic microorganisms the pearson correlation metric revealed that the target algae g catenatum was positively associated r2 0 72 p 0 05 with shewanella alteromonas pseudoalteromonas and hatomonas and negatively associated r2 0 77 p 0 05 with pesudoxanthomonas wautersiella thermomonas and chryseobacterium in addition among the eukaryotic microorganisms mutualistic positive or competitive negative interactions with g catenatum were also observed and the former involved gyrodinium ellobiopsis gonyauiax and dsgm 50 whereas the latter involved haplozoon nitzschia thalassiosira and some zooplankton such as ciliate fig 3c 3 4 metagenomic profiling we obtained eight metagenomes containing 242 5 gigabases of raw reads by high throughput sequencing after trimming low quality reads 89 358 contigs 500 bp including 741 660 protein coding genes were assembled details of the sequence information for each sample can be found in our previous work huang et al 2018 there were 31 metabolic pathways represented in the metagenome data fig 4 genes associated with cell cell communication and energy processes including those involved in membrane transport nucleotide metabolism replication and repair cell motility and cell cell interaction were most abundant in pre bloom samples indicating enhanced metabolic potential of microbial communication at this stage genes involved in growth reproduction including those associated with development glycan biosynthesis energy metabolism protein translation and excretion were enriched at the peak stage suggesting that the potential for energy generation switch were more active in this phase in the post bloom stage genes involved in lipid metabolism secondary metabolite synthesis and environmental adaptation such as those related to carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism cofactor and vitamin biosynthesis antibiotic production and signaling interaction were highly enriched the relative abundance of biodegradation genes also increased at the post bloom stage 3 5 patterns of functional genes in microbial metagenomes 3 5 1 carbon fixation four carbon fixation pathways were identified including the reductive citrate cycle pathway frda b c d sdha b c d kora korb pora b g and pyruvate carboxylase gene

event the abundance of genes encoding succinate dehydrogenase sdhb formate dehydrogenase fdha formate tetrahydrofolate ligase fhs pyruvate ppc and 2 oxoglutarate 2 oxoacid ferredoxin oxidoreductase kora b were about 2 times higher at the pre bloom stage than at other stages p 0 05 showing the importance of the reductive citrate cycle pathway at this stage genes encoding methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase nadp fold pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase subunit porb g fumarate reductase flavoprotein subunit frda b c d isocitrate dehydrogenase idh1 succinate dehydrogenase sdha pyruvate dikinase pps and biotin carboxyl carrier protein k18605 were enriched at the peak stage p 0 05 or 0 01 indicating that reductive citric acid and wood ljungdahl pathways simultaneously play a role at this stage fig s5 in the post bloom stage the most active response gene was pc pyruvate carboxylase which was also abundant at the peak stage p 0 05 fig 5a in addition the level of the gene encoding acetyl coa carboxylase carboxyl transferase subunit accd which is involved in the 3 hydroxypropionate bi cycle pathway was elevated at the peak stage p 0 05 different taxa were represented in the various carbon fixation processes fig s6 genes encoding components of the reductive citrate cycle pathway were mostly affiliated with actinobacteria opitutae bacteroidetes and almost all types of proteobacteria α γ β δ and ε genes in the reductive acetyl coa pathway mostly belonged to alphaproteobacteria planctomycetia cytophagia and γ proteobacteria the 3 hydroxypropionate bi cycle pathway was attributed to alphaproteobacteria and γ proteobacteria and the incomplete reductive citrate cycle pathway was mostly related to bacillus and other bacteria fig s6 genes related to the degradation of detrital organic matter such as complex carbohydrates lipids and proteins were prevalent across the bacterial metagenome fig 5b most carbohydrate metabolism genes encoded alpha amylase starch degradation glycoside hydrolases e g gh3 cellulose degradation and carbohydrate active enzymes such as glycoside hydrolase family 13 gh13 and glycosyltransferase family 2 gt2 gh13 was enriched at the pre bloom stage p 0 05 and gh3 and gt2 predominated at the peak stage p 0 05 indicating that the bacteria in the bloom had access to a more varied carbohydrate pool the relative abundance of cellobiohydrolase gene i cbh i was overrepresented at the post bloom stage p 0 01 which is involved in the degradation of cellulose of phytoplankton origin the majority of gh glycoside hydrolase genes were associated with γ proteobacteria flavobacteria α proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes glycosyl transferase was derived from alphaproteobacteria deltaproteobacteria firmicutes and nitrospirae and cellulase was associated with actinobacteria gammaproteobacteria deinococcus and deltaproteobacteria fig s7 3 5 2 nitrogen cycling pathways for assimilatory nitrate reduction anr dissimilatory nitrate reduction dnr to ammonium denitrification and nitrification of ammonia to nitrite were identified at all stages of the hab event fig s8 genes encoding nitrate reductase narb nasa and especially narb for anr were enriched at the pre bloom stage p 0 05 fig 6 a relative abundance of napa encoding periplasmic nitrate reductase and napb encoding cytochrome c type protein for denitrification were also increased at this stage p 0 05 or 0 01 nitrogen metabolism especially the denitrification and nitrification processes was most potential at the peak stage as evidenced by the enrichment of the denitrification factors nitrite reductase nadh nira b k and narg nitric oxide reductase norb and nitrous oxide reductase nosz p 0 05 fig 6a and nitrification factor ammonia monooxygenase amoa b c especially amob exhibited at 4 times higher levels p 0 01 fig 6a nitrogen metabolism decreased at the post bloom stage and only nrfa and norc showed elevated enrichment p 0 05 the metagenomic analysis revealed that planctomycetia alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria were mostly responsible for anr fig s9 dissimilatory nitrate reduction genes were linked to gammaproteobacteria at the pre bloom stage whereas at later stages they were associated with gammaproteobacteria and alphaproteobacteria denitrification genes were distributed among alphaproteobacteria betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria flavobacteria and acidimicrobiia other bacteria within the community contributed ammonia monooxygenase activity fig s9 3 5 3 phosphorus metabolism four phosphorus metabolism pathways were identified including the polyphosphate synthesis polyphosphate degradation pentose phosphate pathways and phosphate phosphonate transport system fig 6b and fig s10 genes encoding gtp pyrophosphokinase rela pyruvate kinase pk involved in polyphosphate degradation and methylphosphonate synthase mpns were abundant at the pre bloom stage p 0 05 indicating that polyphosphate degradation gtp to pppgpp or imp to atp and the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway may appear at this stage genes responsible for inorganic phosphate transport psta b c s was enriched at the peak stage p 0 05 along with the spot gene encoding gtp diphosphokinase and purine metabolism gene hddc3 encoding guanosine 3 5 bis diphosphate 3 pyrophosphohydrolase p 0 01 at the post bloom stage polyphosphate synthesis and degradation were increased as evidenced by the enrichment of polyphosphate kinase ppk nucleoside diphosphate kinase ndk and exopolyphosphatase ppx gppa genes p 0 05 the most significant change was the enriched phn family genes phnd l g p encoding alpha d ribose 1 methylphosphonate 5 triphosphate synthase at the post bloom stage p 0 05 which implied an enhancement of the phosphate phosphonate transport and pentose phosphate pathways factors involved in phosphorus utilization such as phosphate transporters were mainly associated with alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria and planctomycetia fig s11 various phyla contribute genes associated with phosphonate metabolism e g phn showing extensive phosphorus scavenging mechanisms in heterotrophic bacteria fig s11 3 5 4 sulfur cycling three types of sulfur metabolism pathways namely assimilatory sulfate reduction asr dissimilatory sulfate reduction dsr and thiosulfate oxidation were detected in our data fig s12 some significant changes in sulfur metabolism were observed during the hab event the dsra b dissimilatory sulfite reductase and sir assimilatory sulfate reductase genes were enriched at the pre bloom stage p 0 05 fig 6c whereas genes encoding adenylsulfate reductase apra b or involved in sulfide assimilation cysj and sulfate oxidation soxy z dominated the peak stage p 0 05 the apra b adenylylsulfate reductase genes showed the highest abundance at this stage at least 2 times higher expression than at other stages p 0 05 indicating that the dsr pathway was enhanced during this period interestingly at the post bloom stage the asr and dsr pathways were highly represented as demonstrated by the enrichment of cysc d h i and fccb genes respectively p 0 05 the abundance of sulfide oxidation genes soxb c x were also increased at this stage p 0 05 especially sorb and sorc encoding s sulfosulfanyl l cysteine sulfohydrolase and sulfane dehydrogenase subunit respectively this indicated that heterotrophic bacteria in algal communities have the capacity for thiosulfate oxidation asr genes were mostly affiliated with alphaproteobacteria actinobacteria and flavobacteriia whereas dsr genes were mostly derived from other bacteria fig s13 3 5 5 iron and vitamin vb12 metabolism the g catenatum associated bacterial community included many genes involved in iron transport oxidation storage and acquisition fig s14 and were primarily associated with alphaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria flavobacteriia and actinobacteria fig s15 iron oxidation affinity related genes such as fecb ferrous iron transport protein b cira outer membrane receptor for ferrienterochelin and colicins feca fe3 dicitrate transport protein and ftra periplasmic iron binding protein were enriched at the pre bloom stage p 0 05 fig 7 a iron storage fhue affinity ftr ferritin transport bfr and modification of lipopolysaccharides basr and arnb constituted the major part of iron metabolism at the peak stage p 0 05 at the post bloom stage genes encoding permeases of the iron transport system sita b trob c d fiu and afua b were enriched and these genes function as catecholate siderophore receptors that bind iron related proteins and thereby enhance the affinity of other factors for iron several genes in the vb12 biosynthesis pathway were identified in the analysis fig 7b the two major gene families were cob b f g h i j k l m nst and cbi a c d e f g h j k t x which are involved in anaerobic and aerobic reactions respectively fig s16 a small number of vb12 biosynthesis genes including cbia and cobf were moderately abundant at the pre bloom stage p 0 05 while the cysg gene encoding siroheme synthase of the siroheme biosynthesis pathway was primarily enriched at the pre bloom stage p 0 05 three vb12 biosynthesis genes cbit e and cobnst were enriched at the peak stage with 2 times higher levels than at other stages p 0 05 interestingly the levels of over 80 of vb12 biosynthesis genes were concentrated in 2 1 3 8 times at the post bloom stage p 0 01 indicating that the demand for vb12 or the associated porphyrin was increased at this period the cbi group genes were mostly affiliated with alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria whereas the cob group genes were mostly derived from alphaproteobacteria and other bacteria fig s17 3 6 the ecological linkages between microbial metabolic potential and hab event functionally in order to visualize the analytical result of functional changes among the hab associated microorganisms the predicted metabolic functions fig s18 were performed using the picrust v1 0 0 protocol langille et al 2013 pre bloom stage contained more genes related to cell proliferation and carbohydrates metabolism peak bloom stage contained more overall metabolic functional capacity such as the amino acids metabolism energy flux and glycan biosynthesis interestingly secondary metabolite synthesis xenobics biodegrading and environmental adaptation genes were most highly represented in post stage to better integrate these complicated interrelationships we constructed a partial least squares path model pls pm relating functional genes abundance to hab event fig 8 c p fe n and s metabolism showed obvious effects on algal cell concentration with r2 value ranged from 0 127 to 0 665 and p 0 05 or 0 01 showing that element metabolism was important factor affecting algal bloom occurrence 4 discussion 4 1 microbial community structure and potential driving factors we previously observed that alphaproteobacteria and synechococcophycideae dominated during the pre bloom stage gammaproteobacteria and flavobacteria were abundant at the peak stage and flavobacteriale pseudomonadales and alteromonadales were the major taxa at the post bloom stage huang et al 2018 implying that bacterial community composition varies according to the g catenatum life cycle the cluster analysis provides further evidence for this result fig s2 during an hab event algae initially release low molecular weight molecules organic acids amino acids sugar alcohols and carbohydrates myklestad 2000 followed by higher molecular weight macromolecules proteins lipids nucleic acids and polysaccharides at the later stage azam and malfatti 2007 this can affect bacterial community structure as natural dissolved organic matter dom is a major force affecting bacterial diversity at different bloom stages christaki et al 2014 these findings provide evidence that substrate preferences can lead to resource partitioning and biogeochemical fluxes landa et al 2018 contributing to the variations in biodiversity observed in this study fig 2 to evaluate the relative contributions of environmental factors to microbial communities physicochemical data were analyzed to identify factors t n ph and salinity contributing to alterations in community structure these factors independently explained 5 1 14 3 of the total observed variation in the otu data fig 3b however only 38 4 of the variation was explained by the measured parameters indicating that unidentified factors or biotic parameters e g community interactions shape community structure during algal events indeed diverse network relationships positive or negative were observed among microorganisms fig 3c the interactions demonstrating that biotic factors co occurrence or exclusion are important for shaping microbial composition the broader significance of these interactions has yet to be determined but the occurrence of such relationships as observed in our study and others supports the notion that biotic interactions influence the succession of microbial communities madsen et al 2018 our finding that microbial community succession is linked to hab stage and is co influenced by biotic and abiotic factors is in accordance with previous reports rohwer and thurber 2009 smetacek 2012 lima mendez et al 2015 worden et al 2015 4 2 major metabolic processes during the hab event 4 2 1 carbon cycling the metagenomic data showed that distinct carbon fixation pathways appeared at different hab stages the reductive acetyl coa wood ljungdahl and incomplete reductive citrate cycles dominated the pre bloom stage the reductive citrate cycle and 3 hydroxypropionate bi cycle pathways were more active at the peak stage and pyruvate carboxylase was highly represented at the post stage the detection of genes encoding 2 oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase kor ec 1 2 7 3 fumarate reductase frd ec 1 3 5 4 and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase por ec 1 2 7 1 at pre bloom and peak stages suggests that microorganisms use the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle to fix co2 this cycle is advantageous in an energy limiting situation as it involves substantially less atp and reducing equivalents compared with other cycles liu et al 2017 the reductive acetyl coa wood ljungdahl pathway is considered as important mechanisms of co2 fixation under anaerobic and reducing conditions liu et al 2017 and this may be associated with increased respiration at the pre bloom stage due to a sharp increase in biomass münzner and berggren 2019 pyruvate carboxylase was more active in the post bloom stage than at the two earlier stages it is possible that the energy storage of bacteria was sufficient at this stage resulting in an increase in the amount of carbon entering the tca cycle and being catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase the enrichment of pyruvate carboxylase and monoxide dehydrogenase at the post bloom stage suggest that habs serve a carbon sink yang et al 2016 algal blooms occurring at the ocean surface provide food for ecosystems and remove carbon from the atmosphere additionally changes in carbon fixation pathways during hab events affect the balance of mineralization vs sequestration and carbon fate yang et al 2016 the breakdown of dom including polysaccharides carbohydrates lipids and proteins by heterotrophic microbes is a central part of the marine carbon cycle bejarano et al 2005 decho and gutierrez 2017 glycoside hydrolases are the best characterized enzymes that act on disaccharides oligosaccharides polysaccharides and chitins in this work we observed an increase in the abundance of the gh13 gene encoding α amylase with the degradation of glycoside at the pre bloom stage this suggests that dom in the early stage of hab is highly labile and serves as a substrate for heterotrophic activity a large amount of dom is released at the peak of an algal bloom zheng 2011 genes encoding carbohydrate related enzymes gh3 and gt2 were overrepresented at this stage fig 5b indicating that algae associated bacteria can metabolize extracellular polymeric substances eps and polysaccharides such as cellulose or chitin beier and bertilsson 2013 gammaproteobacteria and flavobacteria are capable of utilizing n acetyl glucosamine and chitin cottrell and kirchman 2000 these taxa were abundantly represented at the peak stage consistent with their role as primary degraders of high molecular weight organic compounds derived from the algal exoskeleton beier and bertilsson 2013 the cbh1 gene was enriched at the post bloom stage suggesting increased bacterial degradation of extracellular organic carbon such as cellulose present in the algal cell wall the observed changes in abundance of the above genes imply an adaptive shift in bacterial communities from the utilization of labile to recalcitrant carbon compounds zhou et al 2018 which could provide a dynamic nutrient source for algae and promote hab maintenance the abundance of carbohydrate biosynthesis and transport genes suggests that the microbial utilization of organic carbon is an important driver of nutrient cycles in an hab event our results further support the viewpoint that successive bacterioplankton blooms are mainly controlled by substrate availability teeling et al 2012 4 2 2 nitrogen cycling phycosphere microorganisms at the three hab stages have multiple genes involved in nitrogen cycling fig 6a the pre bloom stage was highly enriched in genes required for denitrification no2 utilization and nitrate reduction anr or dnr indicating that nitrate is an essential electron acceptor for organic matter oxidation at this stage the enrichment of denitrification genes during the bloom implied significant nitrogen consumption and insufficient input of extraneous nitrogen and biological nitrogen fixation zhang et al 2013 additionally the transfer potential of nitrate to n2 may have been increased by the bloom by the increased abundance of denitrification related genes nosz nirk and narg an earlier study reported an increase in denitrification and decrease in total nitrogen concentration 25 in microcystis aeruginosa krausfeldt et al 2017 our results suggest that denitrification is an important energy generating process for the microbial community associated with habs this further support the viewpoint that host algae influence the denitrification activity and affect the diversity of active microbiota through their exudates wafa et al 2019 in contrast with the pre bloom stage that was dominated by denitrification activity bacterial communities at the peak stage exhibit a greater diversity of genes associated with nitrogen metabolism specifically denitrification nitrification and dnr to ammonia fig 6a anr and dnr may have been enhanced at this stage in order to compensate for the deficiency in organic nitrogen at the peak stage ammonia monooxygenases amoa b c were abundant which are involved in ammonia oxidation and catalyze ammonia oxidation to nitrite a study of nitrogen specific uptake rates of akashiwo sanguinea dominated natural blooms in california reported similar results kudela et al 2008 indicating that ammonium is a favorable nitrogen source of a sanguinea ammonium production from n2 and nitrate may have been enhanced in the microbial community through enrichment of nifa b d k napa and nrfa thereby increasing the duration of the hab meanwhile nitrogen metabolism also affects the progression of hab previous study showed that nitrogen metabolism was decreased by 25 97 28 16 in post stage of microcystis aeruginosa yang et al 2017 we also observed that the diminishment of gene pool of nitrogen metabolism genes at the decline stage fig 6 indicating that bacteria flourishing after bloom utilized the organic nitrogen present in the water and n limitation is a possible factor contributing to bloom collapse 4 2 3 phosphorus metabolism phosphorus is essential for organism growth purine metabolism and polyphosphate degradation are increased during the pre bloom stage which may be necessary for the uptake of inorganic phosphorus the associated genes including rela and pk are responsible for recovering phosphorus from organic molecules thus serving as a phosphorus reservoir kornberg 1995 mobberley et al 2017 it was previously shown that phosphorus was required for rapid proliferation and bloom formation by a sanguinea yang et al 2016 we found that phosphate transport system related genes psta b c s were highly enriched during the peak stage suggesting that both organic and inorganic phosphorus are utilized by algal associated bacteria nelson et al 2008 in the post bloom stage genes of the pentose phosphate pathway such as those in the phn family were significantly enriched fig 6b producing large amounts of nadph and providing reductants for various cell synthesis reactions seufferheld et al 2008 polyphosphate kinase ppk which catalyzes the formation of polyphosphate polyp used by bacteria to remove phosphorus from the water yang et al 2016 was also enriched the abundance of ppk was higher at the post bloom stage than at other stages and likely prolonged bloom duration given that it is usually more abundant in environments with limited phosphate availability temperton et al 2011 4 2 4 sulfur cycling the abundance of sir dsra b and apra b genes were increased at the pre bloom stage fig 6c suggesting that the dsr pathway was enhanced approximately 30 of sequences coding for these enzymes were associated with sulfate reducing gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes fig s13 highlighting the importance of sulfur metabolism and the ability of pre bloom stage communities to utilize other sources of sulfur sulfur oxidation and reduction were both active during the peak stage indicating a reciprocal exchange of sulfur compounds that enhanced the general energy efficiency of the system braissant et al 2007 at the same time the levels of sulfide assimilation genes cysd n h were elevated at the peak of the bloom these genes allow assimilation and conversion of sulfides to cysteine which is thought to participate in eps degradation and amino acid metabolism breitbart et al 2009 thus the higher abundance of cys family genes at the peak stage may be linked to the increased algal biomass and levels of surrounding eps compounds unlike the pre bloom and peak stages asr genes were enriched at the post bloom stage the corresponding enzymes promote the oxidation of sulfide to polysulfide and electron flow from sulfide to the transport chain genes encoding thiosulfate oxidizing enzymes of the sox pathway which comprise core soxa b x y z and supplementary soxc d groups that oxidize a variety of reduced sulfur compounds to sulfate so4 2 spring 2014 were overrepresented in the post bloom metagenome fig 6c indicating that sulfur oxidation is an important pathway for energy metabolism genes encoding components of the sox enzyme complex for oxidation of thiosulfate s2o3 2 to elemental sulfur s0 and further oxidation of thiosulfate to sulfate so4 2 were mainly related to flavobacteriales accounting for the enrichment of this taxon in post bloom samples 4 3 vb12 and iron metabolism profiles analysis of the vb12 biosynthesis pathway indicated that gammaproteobacteria especially oceanospirillaceae and alphaproteobacteria species were main contributors of the vb12 required for algal growth fig s17 vb12 biosynthesis related genes were less abundant at the pre bloom stage suggesting low vb12 availability during bloom initiation however significant enrichment was observed at the peak stage fig 7b this was especially true for cbit k02191 and cbie k03399 which encode cobalt precorrin 6b c15 methyltransferase and cobalt precorrin 7 c5 methyltransferase respectively heterotrophic bacteria supply the trace element cobalamin to their host algae through an anaerobic reaction xie et al 2017 aerobic metabolism related genes were detected at the post bloom stage and vb12 producing genes were enriched with more than half of these especially those encoding cbi family enzymes showing a greater than 2 fold increase given that bacteria are the major suppliers of vb12 to dinoflagellates we speculate that vb12 intermediates derived from bacteria are processed to generate vb12 indeed the cobalamin biosynthesis gene cobw has been detected in dinoflagellate blooms zhang et al 2013 and vb12 was produced in an artificial co culture of synechococcus sp and two heterotrophic bacteria ren et al 2017 dinoroseobacter shibae was found to depend on vitamin b7 produced by lingulodinium polyedrum while in turn providing vitamin b12 to the algal host cruz lópez et al 2018 we found that the abundance of vb12 related genes was increased during mid to late bloom stages implying that vb12 or porphyrin metabolism were enhanced based on these results we speculate that the supply of vb12 promotes the proliferation and longevity of dinoflagellate blooms in addition to serving as an electron carrier in various protein complexes iron plays a major role in cellular respiration photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism marchetti and maldonado 2016 in this work we found that ferritin transport genes such as cira feca and fecb were more abundant at the pre bloom stage than at other stages fig 7a the levels of iron complex transport system components were previously found to be elevated in an iron deficient environment katoh et al 2001 yuan et al 2005 2008 the enrichment of the associated genes during a dinoflagellate bloom could reflect an increase in iron requirements compared with the pre bloom stage genes related to iron oxidation transport and storage such as chut u basr arnb and ftr were enriched at the peak stage implying a heightened iron acquisition potential at the post bloom stage iron storage capacity was enhanced as evidenced by the increased abundance of fiu gene encoding catecholate siderophore receptor which binds iron associated proteins and enhances their affinity for iron feng et al 2019 marinobacter algicola was found to promote dinoflagellate growth by providing bioavailable iron via the siderophore vibrioferrin yarimizu et al 2018 iron vb12 coupling is also critical for phytoplankton growth as vb12 consumption depends on iron availability bertrand et al 2011 it is worth mentioning that the iron metabolism related genes showing the greatest change in abundance at the post bloom stage were those involved in iron transport such as sita b c d troa b c d and afua b c given that iron is a limiting factor for phytoplankton growth behrenfeld and kolber 1999 behrenfeld and milligan 2013 a greater iron transport capacity imply that microbes enhanced the transporting change of iron and contributed to the persistence of the hab tagliabue et al 2017 4 4 linkages between metagenome and ecological event our pls pm results demonstrated that microbial functions had strong effects on algal proliferation fig 8 providing evidence that algal biomass could be associated with microbial metabolic potential from the figure c p fe metabolism have relatively bigger contribution to hab process than other members such as the n cycle the possible reason is n cycle particularly denitrification consists of more biogeochemical transformations and pathways and is more broadly distributed across phylogenetic groups than the c cycle a hypothetical diagram about hab dynamic and microbial metabolic profiles are summarized in fig 9 microbes in the pre bloom stage contribute to bloom formation by altering carbon fixation pathways promoting nitrogen denitrification and increasing ferritin transport rate the peak stage is characterized by enhanced carbon degradation capacity and phosphorus transport to meet the high energy requirement in the post bloom stage genes related to sulfur oxidation vb12 biosynthesis and iron utilization were highly enriched potentially contributing to hab maintenance and adaption additionally some genes related to stress adaptation environmental stress and biodegradation were enriched in the post bloom stage combined with the results of microbial composition fig s2 and huang et al 2018 we can see that microorganisms display successional patterns not only at the community level but also within functional groups the taxonomic and metabolic processes may be coupled which could be important for both bloom initiation and termination one important point needs to note that there are still many challenges in linking microbiome changes to ecological event directly particularly in complex cycles and without accounting for intermediate mechanistic steps rocca et al 2015 hall et al 2018 a more comprehensive experimental framework focused on individual processes should be strengthened therefore future studies that increasing the sample size and more precisely targeting specific biogeochemical processes are essential for a better understanding of the relationships between microbial communities genes and hab dynamics 5 conclusions our results indicate bacterial communities have significant heterogeneity response to hab event huang et al 2018 hab also had disproportionate effects on the abundance of sequences related to c n p s metabolism modifications of the fe vb12 utilization and adaption to environmental stress these results support our hypothesis that planktonic bacteria exhibit a successional profile not only in terms of population structure but also functional potential that is the algae associated microbiome demonstrates structural elasticity and functional plasticity in response to an hab event our findings elucidate possible mechanisms driving hab formation under microbial behavior it should be noted that exploration of the relationship between habs and the associated microbes using omics technologies is in the stage of in depth study and further analyses of metabolic profiles at a single cell level with new tools such as stable isotope labeling and nanosims imaging are needed to fully elucidate microbial functions and algal bacterial interactions in hab process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18097,harmful algal blooms habs are an ecological concern but relatively few studies have investigated the functional potential of bacterioplankton over a complete algal bloom cycle which is critical for determining their contribution to the fate of algal blooms to address this point we carried out a time series metagenomic analysis of the functional features of microbial communities at three different gymnodinium catenatum bloom stages pre peak and post bloom different microbial composition were observed during the blooming stages the environmental parameters and correlation networks co contribute to microbial variability and the former explained 38 4 of total variations of the bacterioplankton community composition functionally a range of pathways involved in carbon nitrogen phosphorus and sulfur cycling were significantly different during the various hab stages genes associated with carbohydrate active enzymes denitrification and iron oxidation were enriched at the pre bloom stage genes involved in reductive citrate cycle for carbon fixation carbon degradation nitrification and phosphate transport were enhanced at the peak stage and relative gene abundance related to sulfur oxidation vitamin synthesis and iron transport and storage was increased at the post bloom stage the ecological linkage analysis has shown that microbial functional potential especially the c p fe metabolism were significantly linked to the fate of the algal blooms taken together our results demonstrated that microorganisms displayed successional patterns not only at the community level but also in the metabolic potential on hab s progression this work contributes to a growing understanding of microbial structural elasticity and functional plasticity and shed light on the potential mechanisms of microbial mediated hab trajectory graphical abstract image 1 keywords algal blooms microbial functional profiles matter cycle metagenomic 1 introduction harmful algal blooms habs are an ecological disaster and result from excessive proliferation of algal species or other phytoplankton pinckney et al 1997 the impacts of habs include human food poisoning resulting from ingestion of contaminated seafood loss of wild or farmed fish resources and impairment of tourism anderson 2009 in some cases high biomass habs can also induce hypoxia or produce toxins jeopardize marine organisms and destroy the stability of marine ecosystems all of which cause both major economic losses and ecological damage guo et al 2015 wolf et al 2017 over the past several decades annually recurring habs in lakes estuaries and coastal waters worldwide have become a major concern zhou et al 2018 the global climate change and environmental stresses such as eutrophication the spread of contaminants and human activities e g impoundment shoreline development and dredging have increased the frequency and complexity of habs gobler et al 2017 needham et al 2017 identifying the factors that modulate hab dynamics is critical for their effective management numerous studies have investigated mechanisms underlying the formation and extinction of habs which is influenced by abiotic factors such as environmental conditions and nutrient availability and biotic factors such as grazing parasitism viral lysis as well as programmed cell death bouchouicha et al 2012 carnicer et al 2015 choi et al 2017 among the biotic factors microorganisms are pivotal drivers of hab formation teeling et al 2012 klindworth et al 2014 needham and fuhrman 2016 owing to their roles in biogeochemical cycling matter

including nutrient provision release of organic compounds and competition with algae for a specific ecological niche riemann et al 2000 jones et al 2010 theroux et al 2012 amin et al 2015 even more many researchers deem that bacterial community structure affects phytoplankton through mutualistic and parasitic interactions that regulate the initiation duration and disappearance of habs mayali and azam 2004 tan et al 2015 cruz lópez and maske 2016 park et al 2016 needham et al 2017 despite many efforts have been made in microbial composition analysis our understanding of their ecophysiological roles in habs is still limited in part because 16s rrna gene sequencing cannot directly link function to phylogeny marchesi and ravel 2015 there is limited information about the molecular and physiological functions of microbes within habs to address this point functional analyses of microbial metabolic potential during an hab event are required metagenome sequencing provides a chance to examine the abundance of metabolic related genes across the complete hab cycle previously many studies have revealed the taxonomic diversity of marine and freshwater microbial communities ganesh et al 2014 logares et al 2014 brown et al 2015 and recent reports described the metabolic pathways in environmental microorganisms by high throughput microarray based technology and proteomics metagenomics methods yang et al 2016 unfried et al 2018 however we need to note that each hab event is unique to a specific ecosystem or species and specific set of environmental conditions yu et al 2020 it is essential to investigate microbial function and their contribution to hab dynamics in a case by case manner gong et al 2017 yu et al 2020 in this study we investigated the microbial community composition and metabolic potential in response to a natural marine dinoflagellate bloom gymnodinium catenatum at different successional stages samples were collected directly from the field and thus reflected in situ information we hypothesized that 1 microorganisms displayed successional patterns not only on community structure but also on functional characters 2 metabolic genes carbon nitrogen phosphorus sulfur iron are differentially abundant at different stages and a functional shift contributes to the dynamic process of hab our aim was to elucidate the successional profiles of

iron metabolism at the peak stage p 0 05 at the post bloom stage genes encoding permeases of the iron transport system sita b trob c d fiu and afua b were enriched and these genes function as catecholate siderophore receptors that bind iron related proteins and thereby enhance the affinity of other factors for iron several genes in the vb12 biosynthesis pathway were identified in the analysis fig 7b the two major gene families were cob b f g h i j k l m nst and cbi a c d e f g h j k t x which are involved in anaerobic and aerobic reactions respectively fig s16 a small number of vb12 biosynthesis genes including cbia and cobf were moderately abundant at the pre bloom stage p 0 05 while the cysg gene encoding siroheme synthase of the siroheme biosynthesis pathway was primarily enriched at the pre bloom stage p 0 05 three vb12 biosynthesis genes cbit e and cobnst were enriched at the peak stage with 2 times higher levels than at other stages p 0 05 interestingly the levels of over 80 of vb12 biosynthesis genes were concentrated in 2 1 3 8 times at the post bloom stage p 0 01 indicating that the demand for vb12 or the associated porphyrin was increased at this period the cbi group genes were mostly affiliated with alphaproteobacteria and gammaproteobacteria whereas the cob group genes were mostly derived from alphaproteobacteria and other bacteria fig s17 3 6 the ecological linkages between microbial metabolic potential and hab event functionally in order to visualize the analytical result of functional changes among the hab associated microorganisms the predicted metabolic functions fig s18 were performed using the picrust v1 0 0 protocol langille et al 2013 pre bloom stage contained more genes related to cell proliferation and carbohydrates metabolism peak bloom stage contained more overall metabolic functional capacity such as the amino acids metabolism energy flux and glycan biosynthesis interestingly secondary metabolite synthesis xenobics biodegrading and environmental adaptation genes were most highly represented in post stage to better integrate these complicated interrelationships we constructed a partial least squares path model pls pm relating functional genes abundance to hab event fig 8 c p fe n and s metabolism showed obvious effects on algal cell concentration with r2 value ranged from 0 127 to 0 665 and p 0 05 or 0 01 showing that element metabolism was important factor affecting algal bloom occurrence 4 discussion 4 1 microbial community structure and potential driving factors we previously observed that alphaproteobacteria and synechococcophycideae dominated during the pre bloom stage gammaproteobacteria and flavobacteria were abundant at the peak stage and flavobacteriale pseudomonadales and alteromonadales were the major taxa at the post bloom stage huang et al 2018 implying that bacterial community composition varies according to the g catenatum life cycle the cluster analysis provides further evidence for this result fig s2 during an hab event algae initially release low molecular weight molecules organic acids amino acids sugar alcohols and carbohydrates myklestad 2000 followed by higher molecular weight macromolecules proteins lipids nucleic acids and polysaccharides at the later stage azam and malfatti 2007 this can affect bacterial community structure as natural dissolved organic matter dom is a major force affecting bacterial diversity at different bloom stages christaki et al 2014 these findings provide evidence that substrate preferences can lead to resource partitioning and biogeochemical fluxes landa et al 2018 contributing to the variations in biodiversity observed in this study fig 2 to evaluate the relative contributions of environmental factors to microbial communities physicochemical data were analyzed to identify factors t n ph and salinity contributing to alterations in community structure these factors independently explained 5 1 14 3 of the total observed variation in the otu data fig 3b however only 38 4 of the variation was explained by the measured parameters indicating that unidentified factors or biotic parameters e g community interactions shape community structure during algal events indeed diverse network relationships positive or negative were observed among microorganisms fig 3c the interactions demonstrating that biotic factors co occurrence or exclusion are important for shaping microbial composition the broader significance of these interactions has yet to be determined but the occurrence of such relationships as observed in our study and others supports the notion that biotic interactions influence the succession of microbial communities madsen et al 2018 our finding that microbial community succession is linked to hab stage and is co influenced by biotic and abiotic factors is in accordance with previous reports rohwer and thurber 2009 smetacek 2012 lima mendez et al 2015 worden et al 2015 4 2 major metabolic processes during the hab event 4 2 1 carbon cycling the metagenomic data showed that distinct carbon fixation pathways appeared at different hab stages the reductive acetyl coa wood ljungdahl and incomplete reductive citrate cycles dominated the pre bloom stage the reductive citrate cycle and 3 hydroxypropionate bi cycle pathways were more active at the peak stage and pyruvate carboxylase was highly represented at the post stage the detection of genes encoding 2 oxoglutarate ferredoxin oxidoreductase kor ec 1 2 7 3 fumarate reductase frd ec 1 3 5 4 and pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase por ec 1 2 7 1 at pre bloom and peak stages suggests that microorganisms use the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle to fix co2 this cycle is advantageous in an energy limiting situation as it involves substantially less atp and reducing equivalents compared with other cycles liu et al 2017 the reductive acetyl coa wood ljungdahl pathway is considered as important mechanisms of co2 fixation under anaerobic and reducing conditions liu et al 2017 and this may be associated with increased respiration at the pre bloom stage due to a sharp increase in biomass münzner and berggren 2019 pyruvate carboxylase was more active in the post bloom stage than at the two earlier stages it is possible that the energy storage of bacteria was sufficient at this stage resulting in an increase in the amount of carbon entering the tca cycle and being catalyzed by pyruvate carboxylase the enrichment of pyruvate carboxylase and monoxide dehydrogenase at the post bloom stage suggest that habs serve a carbon sink yang et al 2016 algal blooms occurring at the ocean surface provide food for ecosystems and remove carbon from the atmosphere additionally changes in carbon fixation pathways during hab events affect the balance of mineralization vs sequestration and carbon fate yang et al 2016 the breakdown of dom including polysaccharides carbohydrates lipids and proteins by heterotrophic microbes is a central part of the marine carbon cycle bejarano et al 2005 decho and gutierrez 2017 glycoside hydrolases are the best characterized enzymes that act on disaccharides oligosaccharides polysaccharides and chitins in this work we observed an increase in the abundance of the gh13 gene encoding α amylase with the degradation of glycoside at the pre bloom stage this suggests that dom in the early stage of hab is highly labile and serves as a substrate for heterotrophic activity a large amount of dom is released at the peak of an algal bloom zheng 2011 genes encoding carbohydrate related enzymes gh3 and gt2 were overrepresented at this stage fig 5b indicating that algae associated bacteria can metabolize extracellular polymeric substances eps and polysaccharides such as cellulose or chitin beier and bertilsson 2013 gammaproteobacteria and flavobacteria are capable of utilizing n acetyl glucosamine and chitin cottrell and kirchman 2000 these taxa were abundantly represented at the peak stage consistent with their role as primary degraders of high molecular weight organic compounds derived from the algal exoskeleton beier and bertilsson 2013 the cbh1 gene was enriched at the post bloom stage suggesting increased bacterial degradation of extracellular organic carbon such as cellulose present in the algal cell wall the observed changes in abundance of the above genes imply an adaptive shift in bacterial communities from the utilization of labile to recalcitrant carbon compounds zhou et al 2018 which could provide a dynamic nutrient source for algae and promote hab maintenance the abundance of carbohydrate biosynthesis and transport genes suggests that the microbial utilization of organic carbon is an important driver of nutrient cycles in an hab event our results further support the viewpoint that successive bacterioplankton blooms are mainly controlled by substrate availability teeling et al 2012 4 2 2 nitrogen cycling phycosphere microorganisms at the three hab stages have multiple genes involved in nitrogen cycling fig 6a the pre bloom stage was highly enriched in genes required for denitrification no2 utilization and nitrate reduction anr or dnr indicating that nitrate is an essential electron acceptor for organic matter oxidation at this stage the enrichment of denitrification genes during the bloom implied significant nitrogen consumption and insufficient input of extraneous nitrogen and biological nitrogen fixation zhang et al 2013 additionally the transfer potential of nitrate to n2 may have been increased by the bloom by the increased abundance of denitrification related genes nosz nirk and narg an earlier study reported an increase in denitrification and decrease in total nitrogen concentration 25 in microcystis aeruginosa krausfeldt et al 2017 our results suggest that denitrification is an important energy generating process for the microbial community associated with habs this further support the viewpoint that host algae influence the denitrification activity and affect the diversity of active microbiota through their exudates wafa et al 2019 in contrast with the pre bloom stage that was dominated by denitrification activity bacterial communities at the peak stage exhibit a greater diversity of genes associated with nitrogen metabolism specifically denitrification nitrification and dnr to ammonia fig 6a anr and dnr may have been enhanced at this stage in order to compensate for the deficiency in organic nitrogen at the peak stage ammonia monooxygenases amoa b c were abundant which are involved in ammonia oxidation and catalyze ammonia oxidation to nitrite a study of nitrogen specific uptake rates of akashiwo sanguinea dominated natural blooms in california reported similar results kudela et al 2008 indicating that ammonium is a favorable nitrogen source of a sanguinea ammonium production from n2 and nitrate may have been enhanced in the microbial community through enrichment of nifa b d k napa and nrfa thereby increasing the duration of the hab meanwhile nitrogen metabolism also affects the progression of hab previous study showed that nitrogen metabolism was decreased by 25 97 28 16 in post stage of microcystis aeruginosa yang et al 2017 we also observed that the diminishment of gene pool of nitrogen metabolism genes at the decline stage fig 6 indicating that bacteria flourishing after bloom utilized the organic nitrogen present in the water and n limitation is a possible factor contributing to bloom collapse 4 2 3 phosphorus metabolism phosphorus is essential for organism growth purine metabolism and polyphosphate degradation are increased during the pre bloom stage which may be necessary for the uptake of inorganic phosphorus the associated genes including rela and pk are responsible for recovering phosphorus from organic molecules thus serving as a phosphorus reservoir kornberg 1995 mobberley et al 2017 it was previously shown that phosphorus was required for rapid proliferation and bloom formation by a sanguinea yang et al 2016 we found that phosphate transport system related genes psta b c s were highly enriched during the peak stage suggesting that both organic and inorganic phosphorus are utilized by algal associated bacteria nelson et al 2008 in the post bloom stage genes of the pentose phosphate pathway such as those in the phn family were significantly enriched fig 6b producing large amounts of nadph and providing reductants for various cell synthesis reactions seufferheld et al 2008 polyphosphate kinase ppk which catalyzes the formation of polyphosphate polyp used by bacteria to remove phosphorus from the water yang et al 2016 was also enriched the abundance of ppk was higher at the post bloom stage than at other stages and likely prolonged bloom duration given that it is usually more abundant in environments with limited phosphate availability temperton et al 2011 4 2 4 sulfur cycling the abundance of sir dsra b and apra b genes were increased at the pre bloom stage fig 6c suggesting that the dsr pathway was enhanced approximately 30 of sequences coding for these enzymes were associated with sulfate reducing gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and bacteroidetes fig s13 highlighting the importance of sulfur metabolism and the ability of pre bloom stage communities to utilize other sources of sulfur sulfur oxidation and reduction were both active during the peak stage indicating a reciprocal exchange of sulfur compounds that enhanced the general energy efficiency of the system braissant et al 2007 at the same time the levels of sulfide assimilation genes cysd n h were elevated at the peak of the bloom these genes allow assimilation and conversion of sulfides to cysteine which is thought to participate in eps degradation and amino acid metabolism breitbart et al 2009 thus the higher abundance of cys family genes at the peak stage may be linked to the increased algal biomass and levels of surrounding eps compounds unlike the pre bloom and peak stages asr genes were enriched at the post bloom stage the corresponding enzymes promote the oxidation of sulfide to polysulfide and electron flow from sulfide to the transport chain genes encoding thiosulfate oxidizing enzymes of the sox pathway which comprise core soxa b x y z and supplementary soxc d groups that oxidize a variety of reduced sulfur compounds to sulfate so4 2 spring 2014 were overrepresented in the post bloom metagenome fig 6c indicating that sulfur oxidation is an important pathway for energy metabolism genes encoding components of the sox enzyme complex for oxidation of thiosulfate s2o3 2 to elemental sulfur s0 and further oxidation of thiosulfate to sulfate so4 2 were mainly related to flavobacteriales accounting for the enrichment of this taxon in post bloom samples 4 3 vb12 and iron metabolism profiles analysis of the vb12 biosynthesis pathway indicated that gammaproteobacteria especially oceanospirillaceae and alphaproteobacteria species were main contributors of the vb12 required for algal growth fig s17 vb12 biosynthesis related genes were less abundant at the pre bloom stage suggesting low vb12 availability during bloom initiation however significant enrichment was observed at the peak stage fig 7b this was especially true for cbit k02191 and cbie k03399 which encode cobalt precorrin 6b c15 methyltransferase and cobalt precorrin 7 c5 methyltransferase respectively heterotrophic bacteria supply the trace element cobalamin to their host algae through an anaerobic reaction xie et al 2017 aerobic metabolism related genes were detected at the post bloom stage and vb12 producing genes were enriched with more than half of these especially those encoding cbi family enzymes showing a greater than 2 fold increase given that bacteria are the major suppliers of vb12 to dinoflagellates we speculate that vb12 intermediates derived from bacteria are processed to generate vb12 indeed the cobalamin biosynthesis gene cobw has been detected in dinoflagellate blooms zhang et al 2013 and vb12 was produced in an artificial co culture of synechococcus sp and two heterotrophic bacteria ren et al 2017 dinoroseobacter shibae was found to depend on vitamin b7 produced by lingulodinium polyedrum while in turn providing vitamin b12 to the algal host cruz lópez et al 2018 we found that the abundance of vb12 related genes was increased during mid to late bloom stages implying that vb12 or porphyrin metabolism were enhanced based on these results we speculate that the supply of vb12 promotes the proliferation and longevity of dinoflagellate blooms in addition to serving as an electron carrier in various protein complexes iron plays a major role in cellular respiration photosynthesis and nitrogen metabolism marchetti and maldonado 2016 in this work we found that ferritin transport genes such as cira feca and fecb were more abundant at the pre bloom stage than at other stages fig 7a the levels of iron complex transport system components were previously found to be elevated in an iron deficient environment katoh et al 2001 yuan et al 2005 2008 the enrichment of the associated genes during a dinoflagellate bloom could reflect an increase in iron requirements compared with the pre bloom stage genes related to iron oxidation transport and storage such as chut u basr arnb and ftr were enriched at the peak stage implying a heightened iron acquisition potential at the post bloom stage iron storage capacity was enhanced as evidenced by the increased abundance of fiu gene encoding catecholate siderophore receptor which binds iron associated proteins and enhances their affinity for iron feng et al 2019 marinobacter algicola was found to promote dinoflagellate growth by providing bioavailable iron via the siderophore vibrioferrin yarimizu et al 2018 iron vb12 coupling is also critical for phytoplankton growth as vb12 consumption depends on iron availability bertrand et al 2011 it is worth mentioning that the iron metabolism related genes showing the greatest change in abundance at the post bloom stage were those involved in iron transport such as sita b c d troa b c d and afua b c given that iron is a limiting factor for phytoplankton growth behrenfeld and kolber 1999 behrenfeld and milligan 2013 a greater iron transport capacity imply that microbes enhanced the transporting change of iron and contributed to the persistence of the hab tagliabue et al 2017 4 4 linkages between metagenome and ecological event our pls pm results demonstrated that microbial functions had strong effects on algal proliferation fig 8 providing evidence that algal biomass could be associated with microbial metabolic potential from the figure c p fe metabolism have relatively bigger contribution to hab process than other members such as the n cycle the possible reason is n cycle particularly denitrification consists of more biogeochemical transformations and pathways and is more broadly distributed across phylogenetic groups than the c cycle a hypothetical diagram about hab dynamic and microbial metabolic profiles are summarized in fig 9 microbes in the pre bloom stage contribute to bloom formation by altering carbon fixation pathways promoting nitrogen denitrification and increasing ferritin transport rate the peak stage is characterized by enhanced carbon degradation capacity and phosphorus transport to meet the high energy requirement in the post bloom stage genes related to sulfur oxidation vb12 biosynthesis and iron utilization were highly enriched potentially contributing to hab maintenance and adaption additionally some genes related to stress adaptation environmental stress and biodegradation were enriched in the post bloom stage combined with the results of microbial composition fig s2 and huang et al 2018 we can see that microorganisms display successional patterns not only at the community level but also within functional groups the taxonomic and metabolic processes may be coupled which could be important for both bloom initiation and termination one important point needs to note that there are still many challenges in linking microbiome changes to ecological event directly particularly in complex cycles and without accounting for intermediate mechanistic steps rocca et al 2015 hall et al 2018 a more comprehensive experimental framework focused on individual processes should be strengthened therefore future studies that increasing the sample size and more precisely targeting specific biogeochemical processes are essential for a better understanding of the relationships between microbial communities genes and hab dynamics 5 conclusions our results indicate bacterial communities have significant heterogeneity response to hab event huang et al 2018 hab also had disproportionate effects on the abundance of sequences related to c n p s metabolism modifications of the fe vb12 utilization and adaption to environmental stress these results support our hypothesis that planktonic bacteria exhibit a successional profile not only in terms of population structure but also functional potential that is the algae associated microbiome demonstrates structural elasticity and functional plasticity in response to an hab event our findings elucidate possible mechanisms driving hab formation under microbial behavior it should be noted that exploration of the relationship between habs and the associated microbes using omics technologies is in the stage of in depth study and further analyses of metabolic profiles at a single cell level with new tools such as stable isotope labeling and nanosims imaging are needed to fully elucidate microbial functions and algal bacterial interactions in hab process declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known

18098,microplastics may experience photoaging and breakdown into nanoplastics in aquatic environment as a result of long term light irradiation however the underlying mechanisms responsible for the photodegradation of microplastics are largely overlooked in this study the photodegradation of microplastics utilizing polystyrene microplastic ps mp as a model was investigated under irradiation with simulated solar light for as long as 150 d a large amount of reactive oxygen species ros including o2 1o2 h2o2 and oh were detected in the ps mp suspension due to light irradiation which displayed significant relationships with the generated environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs distinct photoaging of ps mp was observed with increased surface roughness and decreased particle size however these photoaging effects were significantly inhibited by ros quenchers suggesting that the generation ros played a vital role in the ps mp phototransformation in addition ros induced formation of more oxidative functional groups on the ps mp thus enhancing the negative surface potential and the stability of ps mp in water this study elucidated the mechanism of formation of ros by simulated solar light irradiated mps and their subsequent roles in the phototransformation of mp thus expanding current knowledge on the fate of mps in aquatic environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords polystyrene microplastic reactive oxygen species environmentally persistent free radicals phototransformation aquatic environments 1 introduction microplastics mps referring to plastic debris with a size of less than 5 mm have caused global concerns in recent years cox et al 2019 mps have been detected and reported in a variety of environmental matrices including aquatic environments kara lavender and thompson 2014 david et al 2009 kawecki and nowack 2019 it was estimated that the load of mps in the ocean surface is as high as 5 25 trillion items jambeck et al 2015 thus aquatic species including fish invertebrates fur seals etc are expected to be threatened due to long term chronic exposure to mps mps can induce direct and indirect toxicities to organisms due to the localized leaching of component monomers endogenous additives and adsorbed environmental pollutants browne et al 2013 lithner et al 2011 guo et al 2018 therefore the fate of mps in aquatic environment has become a key issue that warrants further studies plastic debris released in the environment will inevitably be broken into mps and nanoplastics nps because of solar light radiation mechanical abrasion and wave action andrés et al 2014 lambert and wagner 2016 many studies demonstrated that uv irradiation may cause significant formation of carbonyl groups rendering the polymers more fragile and enhancing the likelihood of mechanical degradation andrady 2015 gewert et al 2015 it was reported that more mp particles were produced as a result of prolonged sunlight irradiation song et al 2017 moreover photoaging enhanced the mobility and adsorption capacities of mps for environmental contaminants such as bisphenol a ciprofloxacin 4 nonylphenol and pyrene which was attributed to their increased hydrophilicity and surface area liu et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2020 the photodegradation of mps in the natural environment is considered to be very slow especially in aquatic environments liu et al 2019b several studies attempted to simulate the aging of mps in the environment with uv o3 or advanced oxidation usually with an aging time of less than one month which does not accurately describe the natural photoaging process liu et al 2019a 2019b therefore investigation of the long term transformation of mps in aquatic environments under solar light is necessary and contributes to a better understanding of the photoaging behaviors of mps in actual aquatic environments and the related mechanisms one of our recent studies reported the formation of environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs on solar light irradiated plastics such as polystyrene ps and phenol formaldehyde resin during which some reactive oxygen species ros were also observed zhu et al 2019 however the formation mechanisms and the evolution of these ros as well as their impacts on the photochemical transformation of mps in aquatic environments deserve further study ros including superoxide radical o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 are highly reactive tong et al 2018 for example oh has a high oxidation potential of 2 8 v and thus has a very strong oxidative capacity to degrade a variety of organic pollutants in water xiao et al 2017a a few studies have demonstrated that ros played critical roles in the photochemical transformation of carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts graphene oxide dissolved black carbon and c3n4 in water xiao et al 2017a qu et al 2013 fu et al 2016 there is a large knowledge gap regarding the involvement of ros in the transformation of mps during the photoaging process in aquatic environments in this study polystyrene microplastics ps mp which are one of the most detected plastics in aquatic environments that has a global annual production of more than 13 million tonnes liu et al 2019a delilah et al 2011 was selected as the model mp this study aimed to i identify and quantify the yields of each ros in a suspension of ps mp receiving 150 d of simulated solar light irradiation ii to explore the formation mechanisms of the identified ros in the reaction system and iii to ascertain the roles of the ros in the transformation of ps mp with comprehensive characterizations including size distribution and carbonyl index ci this study provides the first evidence for the formation of ros by the photoaged ps mp and elucidate the mechanisms of mp transformation due to attack by ros which will improve our understanding of the long term phototransformation of mps in natural aquatic environments as well as the environmental risks of mps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials high purity 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyroline n oxide dmpo 97 isopropyl alcohol ia ar dimethyl sulfoxide dmso ar ascorbic acid aa 99 0

carboxanilide xtt 90 were obtained from sigma aldrich reagent company shanghai china ultrapure water was used in the experiments 2 2 photochemical experiments prior to use the ps mp powder was rinsed 3 times sequentially using ethanol and ultrapure water subsequently 2 g of dry sample was mixed with 40 ml of ultrapure water and then put in a 50 ml glass tube the mixture was incubated in a rotary incubator mx rd pro dragonlab china at 70 rpm for 24 h in the dark to ensure the ps was well dispersed in water the obtained suspension was filtered with a 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes membrane and then freeze dried for 1 h the resultant ps was used for the following photochemical experiments specifically 0 2 g of ps mp and 20 ml of ultrapure water were mixed in a 50 ml quartz tube which then was placed in a merry go round photochemical reactor bl ghx v shanghai bilon china and magnetically stirred at 250 rpm to ensure uniform illumination the simulated sunlight wavelength range 295 2500 nm was provided by a 1000 w xenon lamp in the center of the photochemical reactor fig s1 the light intensity on each quartz tube was 68 25 mw cm2 which is lower than that of solar light 100 mw cm2 in summer at the equator yeang 2007 the reaction temperature was controlled at 25 c parallel experiments without ps mp or light were performed as controls at predetermined reaction intervals such as 1 2 60 and 150 d max ros measurements and ps characterization were conducted 2 3 determination of ros at the predetermined intervals 18 5 ml of the suspension was withdrawn from the reaction system and filtered with a 0 22 μm pes membrane the obtained ps mp powder was dried at 45 c in a vacuum oven for 20 min and 50 mg of the powder was then added to 0 5 ml of 0 1 m dmpo aqueous solution to trap oh on ps mp surfaces another 50 mg was dispersed in 0 5 ml of 0 1 m dmpo in dmso solution to measure o2 on ps mp surfaces the remaining ps powder was stored for the subsequent physical and chemical characterization the remaining 1 5 ml of the suspension in the photochemical reactor was divided into three equal parts which were used to probe the presence of oh o2 in water and to determine the h2o2 concentration in water using a hydrogen peroxide assay kit solarbio life sciences beijing the details for the ros measurements are shown in the supporting information text s1 and fig s2 the concentrations of o2 oh and 1o2 in suspension were determined using chemical probe methods and were quantified by xtt ba and ffa respectively qu et al 2013 nosaka and nosaka 2017 likewise 20 ml of 10 g l ps suspension containing different probe molecules 0 05 mm of xtt 2 0 mm of ba and 0 5 mm of ffa was exposed to simulated sunlight under the same conditions blank experiments without ps mp or light were conducted after a certain reaction time 1 ml of the mixture was sampled and filtered through a 0 22 μm nylon membrane for the following analysis the detailed processes of the chemical probe methods are provided in text s1 to assess the effects of ros on the phototransformation of ps in aquatic environments ros scavengers 2 mg l sod for o2 10 mm isopropyl alcohol for oh 10 mm l histidine for 1o2 and oh and 10 mm aa for o2 1o2 and oh were added to the ps mp suspension in addition 20 ml of 10 mm h2o2 solution with 0 2 g ps was prepared the same amount of ros scavengers was renewed in the suspension every 12 h to compensate for the consumption of ros scavengers fig s3 to prevent the accumulation of ros scavengers and h2o2 in the suspension the ps mp were separated from the suspension via filtration every 3 d and washed 4 times with ultrapure water which was again introduced with fresh ros scavengers and h2o2 solution the ps mp suspension was continuously illuminated according to the above procedures for 150 d control samples were maintained in ultrapure water under the same conditions 2 4 characterization of ps mp the morphologies of ps mp were analyzed by an s 3400n scanning electron microscope sem hitachi japan and the size of the particles was obtained by nano measurer software analysis of the sem images zhu et al 2019 attenuated total reflectance fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy was used to identify the functional groups and the ratio of the absorbance of carbonyl groups relative to methylene reference peaks is referred to as the

molecular weight distribution of the pristine and photoaged ps mp the concentration of epfrs generated on the aged ps mp was quantified using an epr spectrometer bruker emxmicro 6 1 p l karlsruhe germany the details for the sample characterizations are presented in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 generation and evolution of ros in the suspension of ps mp advanced oxidation can accelerate mp aging by introducing a large amount of ros liu et al 2019b therefore epr coupled with the spin trapping agent dmpo was applied to determine the level of ros in the reaction system including oh o2 and 1o2 as shown in fig s4a dmpo oh adducts with a splitting of αn αh 14 9 g were observed in the ps mp suspensions under light irradiation buettner 1987 while no ros were detected in the control water without ps mp during the 150 d of illumination however oh was not detected on the aged ps mp solids because of the low conversion rate and yield from o2 to oh in the dark fig s4d finkelstein et al 1982 buettner 1993 these findings indicated that oh was generated in the suspension under the simulated sunlight irradiation meanwhile dmpo ooh adducts with hyperfine splitting of αn 14 2 g αh β 11 4 g and αh γ1 1 2 g appeared on the aged ps mp solids separated from the suspensions fig s4b buettner 1987 xiao et al 2017b while no epr signal was detected in the control moreover a 3 line epr signal with an intensity of 1 1 1 was observed on the ps mp powder fig s4b indicating that 1o2 was also produced fang et al 2017 however no epr signal of dmpo ooh adducts appeared in the ps mp suspension fig s4c which might be due to the low efficacy of dmpo for trapping o2 and the instability of the dmpo ooh adduct in aqueous media t 1 2 60 s barriga et al 2010 lavrent et al 2011 these results manifested that o2 was generated on the aged ps mp surfaces furthermore the intensities of dmpo oh and dmpo ooh adducts increased with the irradiation time according to the obtained epr spectra the yield of each ros was quantitatively analyzed by a spin counting method embedded in the bruker software spinfit bruker s xenon program and the evolutions of o2 and oh as a function of irradiation time are shown in fig 1 the yields of o2 and oh increased slowly before 60 d of illumination followed by a rapid increase moreover the temporal yield variation of h2o2 in ps mp suspension displayed a similar trend under light irradiation fig 1c to further determine the types of ros in ps mp suspension the chemical probe method was applied in this study as revealed in figs s5a and a low concentration of xtt formazan was detected during irradiation indicating that a small amount of o2 reacted with xtt buettner and oberley 1978 as shown in fig s5b ffa as the 1o2 probe remained stable in the dark and with sunlight in the absence of ps mp however ffa was rapidly consumed in the presence of ps mp during light irradiation with more than 98 of the ffa being consumed in 11 d the calculated pseudosteady state concentration of 1o2 ss was 3 27 10 14 m fig s5c presents the production of p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba by the reaction of ba with oh no p hba was formed in the controls during light irradiation p hba quickly accumulated in the presence of ps mp as light irradiation was extended which implied the generation of a notable amount of oh fig s5c after 60 d of irradiation the pseudo steady state yield of oh ss was calculated to be 6 21 μmol fig s5d these results were in accordance with the obtained results from epr 3 2 ros formation mechanisms the sem images in fig s6 illustrate that the pristine ps mp were ellipsoidal particles with a smooth surface however after 60 d of light irradiation the ps mp experienced a significant morphological change and became sheet like with obvious cracks forming on the surface as the irradiation time prolonged to 150 d a large number of ps mp flakes appeared with multiple cracks which might be attributed to the light penetrating deep into the cracks and pores which were gradually formed during light irradiation hüffer et al 2018 similar morphological changes were reported for uv aged and advanced oxidation treated ps mp in previous studies liu et al 2019b 2019c fig 2 shows that the mean particle size of the pristine ps mp was 150 μm with most of the particles 88 having a size 80 μm upon irradiation the mean size of the aged ps mp decreased to 93 μm and 52 μm after 60 d and 150 d light exposure respectively a total of 44 1 and 71 4 of the particles were 80 μm the results demonstrated that sunlight irradiation caused the breakdown of ps mp particles thus resulting in the formation of smaller particles which is likely related to chain scission processes liu et al 2019a the atr ftir spectra of ps mp fig 3 a indicated that new functional groups corresponding to the absorption peaks of 1734 1225 and 1067 cm 1 appeared after irradiation for 60 and 150 d these peaks were attributed to the co of carboxyl mailhot and gardette 1992 the c o c of lipids or ethers bandow et al 2017 and the c o of alcohols or ethers liu et al 2019a respectively and their intensities increased with irradiation time previous studies have well documented the formation of oxidation functional groups on ps surfaces during light irradiation yousif and haddad 2013 kaczmarek 1995 the carbon centered free radicals were generated by a photoinduced homolytic c h bond cleavage in the initiation step which reacted with o2 to generate peroxy radicals zhu et al 2019 subsequently peroxy radicals were rapidly transformed by hydrogen abstraction into photochemically unstable hydroperoxides the alkoxy radicals produced by photolysis of hydroperoxides may combine with hydrogen atoms to form hydroxyl functional groups the dispropertionation reaction of alkoxy radicals generated carbonyl groups yousif and haddad 2013 kaczmarek 1995 ci is commonly used to indicate the aging degree of plastics and was determined as the ratio of the absorbance of 1743 cm 1 to 1447 cm 1 in this study song et al 2017 liu et al 2019b the value of ci increased from 0 04 to 0 14 and from 0 14 to 0 33 after light irradiation for 60 d and 150 d respectively fig 3b the control experiments showed that soaking and stirring in water without light irradiation had a very weak effect on the change in the surface morphology and functional groups of ps mp fig s7 these results suggested that light irradiation induced the generation of oxygen containing functional groups on ps mp in agreement with previous studies liu et al 2019a zhu et al 2019 the xps spectra indicated that the o c of ps mp increased from 0 022 to 0 055 and 0 055 to 0 12 after irradiation for 60 and 150 d respectively table s1 the increased o 1s peak was deconvoluted into three individual peaks o h o c co and o co suggesting that oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl groups carboxyl groups and carbonyl groups were produced fig s8 jun et al 2014 in addition the relative proportion of o co increased as the irradiation time prolonged table s1 indicating that more carboxyl groups were produced which may be due to dispropertionation reaction of polymer alkoxy radicals and oxidation of oh kaczmarek 1995 these results further indicated that the surface of ps mp experienced extensive oxidation as it was continuously exposed to simulated solar light the characteristic changes in the photoaged ps mp might involve bond cleavage and free radical formation in previous studies it was reported that epfrs were generated on some polymers and organic molecules under light irradiation zhu et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 which may transfer electrons to h2o o2 and induce ros generation xiao et al 2017b gehling et al 2014 therefore epr was applied to quantify the epfrs formed on ps mp which was believed to be related to the photochemical reactivity of ps mp the epr spectra revealed that epfrs were formed on ps mp with a signal width of 7 48 8 61 g and a g factor of 2 00401 2 00424 representing o centered organic radicals fig s9 valavanidis et al 2008 jia et al 2016 2018 in our previous study it was reported that simulated sunlight induced the formation of epfrs which then initiated the cleavage of methine c h in ps mp leading to formation of tertiary alkyl radical tertiary peroxy radical and tertiary alkoxy radical zhu et al 2019 the epfr signals increased gradually from 0 to 1 80 1016 spins g with irradiation time fig 1d suggesting that simulated sunlight irradiation stimulated epfr formation on ps mp in aqueous solution to further elucidate the mechanism of ros formation in the ps mp suspensions by light illumination the correlations between the normalized epfr concentrations and the yields of different ros are shown in fig 4 there were significant correlations between the yields of epfrs and each ros suggesting that epfrs played an important role in the formation of ros tong et al 2018 gehling et al 2014 moreover the strongest positive correlation was observed between epfrs and o2 r2 0 94 p 0 001 followed by that between h2o2 and oh this was reasonable because epfrs could transfer electrons directly to dissolved oxygen to form o2 during light irradiation lavrent et al 2011 gehling et al 2014 furthermore o2 and h2o2 displayed significant correlations with h2o2 and oh respectively suggesting that h2o2 and oh were mainly derived from the o2 disproportionation reaction and h2o2 reduction respectively lavrent et al 2011 kim et al 2016 overall the above results suggested that the ps bound epfrs reacted with dissolved o2 via electron transfer to yield o2 which allowed electrons to form h2o2 by the disproportionation reaction two possible pathways could be responsible for h2o2 mediation of oh formation one possible pathway is that the generated h2o2 was decomposed by a photo fenton like reaction in the presence of light fang et al 2017 the other pathway could occur due to the activation of h2o2 by epfrs through single electron transfer from epfrs to h2o2 thus generating oh gehling et al 2014 fang et al 2014 several studies suggested that 1o2 was generated through a photosensitization reaction in which photoexcited materials transfer energy to dissolved o2 fu et al 2016 fang et al 2017 the aged ps mp with carbonyl containing structures could absorb the energy of light and be excited to the triplet states ps 3ps by uv vis irradiation fig s10a which transfers energy to dissolved o2 to form 1o2 to confirm this hypothesis tmp 60 μm as a triplet state quencher fang et al 2017 was used with an ffa probe the results showed that the loss of ffa in ps mp suspensions was markedly suppressed in the presence of tmp fig s10b indicating that the formation of 3ps was inhibited leading to a decrease in 1o2 formation based on the above results the mechanisms of ros formation in the ps mp suspension were proposed and are illustrated in scheme 1 3 3 the roles of ros in ps mp phototransformation the epfrs produced on the photoaged ps mp can induce the formation of ros which might also accelerate the aging process of ps mp scavenger trapping tests were applied to identify the roles of ros in ps mp phototransformation and the results are shown in fig 5 and table 1 two mg l sod was used to scavenge o2 10 mm ia was used to scavenge oh 10 mm l histidine was used to trap oh and 1o2 and aa was used to scavenge oh o2 and 1o2 tong et al 2018 lavrent et al 2011 han et al 2017 in the presence of ros quenchers significant changes were observed for the mean particle size ci and molecular weight of ps mp when oh o2 and 1o2 were quenched by the aa solution 47 2 of the ps mp particles had sizes less than 80 μm whereas this proportion was significantly higher in water 88 fig 5a compared with the aa free system the mean size of the ps mp particles increased to 82 μm in the presence of aa fig s11a correspondingly aa reduced the ci value of the ps mp from 0 33 to 0 17 fig 5b these results indicated that the ros played a key role in the transformation of ps mp under light irradiation which was in line with the aging behavior of ps mp by advanced oxidation liu et al 2019b this was also consistent with the gpc results which showed that the m w m n and m p of ps mp increased in the presence of aa while the pdi decreased table 1 to more clearly determine the contribution of each ros to ps mp phototransformation the ci values of ps before and after ros quenching were compared and analyzed in the presence of sod the ci value decreased to 0 28 representing a 17 6 reduction in the aging degree the aging degree of ps decreased by 31 2 in the presence of ia while l histidine and aa reduced the aging degree of ps mp by 40 9 and 55 5 respectively these results highlighted that ros facilitated the aging of ps mp and that the contribution of o2 oh and 1o2 was different for the aging degree of ps with the order of oh o2 1o2 after 150 d of irradiation the highest contribution of oh to aging may be due to its strong oxidative potential e 0 2 8 v consistent with the accelerated aging of ps mp by h2o2 under light conditions fig 5b furthermore the m w m n and m p of ps mp increased after adding ros quenchers table 1 indicating ros promoted the phototransformation of ps mp which agreed with the above results fig 5b interestingly a comparison with the change in molecular weight showed that a significant change in ci was attributed to the important role of ros in the change in the oxygen containing functional groups in ps mp it is interesting that the concentration of epfrs was significantly reduced after the addition of h2o2 fig s11b however the epfrs concentration increased after dosing with ros quenchers these findings indicated that the phototransformation of ps mp was not directly affected by epfrs but rather was related to the ros as discussed above ros distinctly mediated the photodegradation of ps mp under light irradiation and the contribution to ps mp aging differed between each ros previous studies argued that the direct scission of chemical bonds by uv light was responsible for ps phototransformation andrady 2011 geuskens and david 2009 this study is the first to report the formation of ros by ps mp and the key roles of ros on the long term transformation of ps mp in water under sunlight irradiation however the transformation mechanism of each ros to ps requires further exploration 3 4 impacts of the ros on the sedimentation of ps mp previous studies suggested that uv irradiation enhanced negative surface charges and the mobility of ps mp which was attributed to the increase in oxidative functional groups liu et al 2019a as shown in fig s12 the aged ps mp were more dispersed and settled down more slowly than the pristine ps mp the stability of ps mp in 5 mm nacl solution increased after 150 d of irradiation however the presence of a ros quencher aa significantly reduced the stability of the photoaged ps mp this result was consistent with the change in the surface zeta potential fig 6 photochemical reactions induced the formation of more surface functional groups such as o h and co on ps mp fig s13 resulting in enhanced surface negative charges stronger electrostatic repulsion and slower aggregation and sedimentation qu et al 2013 the results suggested that the ros changed the properties and surface functional groups of ps mp and then improved their stability and mobility in water 4 conclusions there are increasing concerns about the effects of photoirradiation on the transformation of mps and their environmental behaviors however the underlying mechanisms related to the changes in mps lack in depth understanding results of this study reveal that ps mp can be significantly altered in water by simulated sunlight irradiation with regard to not only particle size functional groups and epfrs but also photoinduced ros the formation ros including o2 h2o2 and oh had an important relationship with epfrs meanwhile ros exhibited strong reactivity toward ps mp evidenced by ros inhibition experiments inferring that ros mediated the phototransformation of ps mp in addition long term photoaging caused more oxidation functional groups and more negative charges on ps mp surfaces leading to stronger electrostatic repulsion and slower sedimentation in water these dynamic alterations are expected to have significant impacts on the fate and transportation of aged mps in natural aquatic environments mps might coexist with ros derived from photosensitization of dissolved organic matter and pigments no2 and no3 photolysis biological processes and photo fenton reactions the effect of these ros generating processes on the aging of mps

18098,microplastics may experience photoaging and breakdown into nanoplastics in aquatic environment as a result of long term light irradiation however the underlying mechanisms responsible for the photodegradation of microplastics are largely overlooked in this study the photodegradation of microplastics utilizing polystyrene microplastic ps mp as a model was investigated under irradiation with simulated solar light for as long as 150 d a large amount of reactive oxygen species ros including o2 1o2 h2o2 and oh were detected in the ps mp suspension due to light irradiation which displayed significant relationships with the generated environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs distinct photoaging of ps mp was observed with increased surface roughness and decreased particle size however these photoaging effects were significantly inhibited by ros quenchers suggesting that the generation ros played a vital role in the ps mp phototransformation in addition ros induced formation of more oxidative functional groups on the ps mp thus enhancing the negative surface potential and the stability of ps mp in water this study elucidated the mechanism of formation of ros by simulated solar light irradiated mps and their subsequent roles in the phototransformation of mp thus expanding current knowledge on the fate of mps in aquatic environments graphical abstract image 1 keywords polystyrene microplastic reactive oxygen species environmentally persistent free radicals phototransformation aquatic environments 1 introduction microplastics mps referring to plastic debris with a size of less than 5 mm have caused global concerns in recent years cox et al 2019 mps have been detected and reported in a variety of environmental matrices including aquatic environments kara lavender and thompson 2014 david et al 2009 kawecki and nowack 2019 it was estimated that the load of mps in the ocean surface is as high as 5 25 trillion items jambeck et al 2015 thus aquatic species including fish invertebrates fur seals etc are expected to be threatened due to long term chronic exposure to mps mps can induce direct and indirect toxicities to organisms due to the localized leaching of component monomers endogenous additives and adsorbed environmental pollutants browne et al 2013 lithner et al 2011 guo et al 2018 therefore the fate of mps in aquatic environment has become a key issue that warrants further studies plastic debris released in the environment will inevitably be broken into mps and nanoplastics nps because of solar light radiation mechanical abrasion and wave action andrés et al 2014 lambert and wagner 2016 many studies demonstrated that uv irradiation may cause significant formation of carbonyl groups rendering the polymers more fragile and enhancing the likelihood of mechanical degradation andrady 2015 gewert et al 2015 it was reported that more mp particles were produced as a result of prolonged sunlight irradiation song et al 2017 moreover photoaging enhanced the mobility and adsorption capacities of mps for environmental contaminants such as bisphenol a ciprofloxacin 4 nonylphenol and pyrene which was attributed to their increased hydrophilicity and surface area liu et al 2019a 2019b zhang et al 2020 the photodegradation of mps in the natural environment is considered to be very slow especially in aquatic environments liu et al 2019b several studies attempted to simulate the aging of mps in the environment with uv o3 or advanced oxidation usually with an aging time of less than one month which does not accurately describe the natural photoaging process liu et al 2019a 2019b therefore investigation of the long term transformation of mps in aquatic environments under solar light is necessary and contributes to a better understanding of the photoaging behaviors of mps in actual aquatic environments and the related mechanisms one of our recent studies reported the formation of environmentally persistent free radicals epfrs on solar light irradiated plastics such as polystyrene ps and phenol formaldehyde resin during which some reactive oxygen species ros were also observed zhu et al 2019 however the formation mechanisms and the evolution of these ros as well as their impacts on the photochemical transformation of mps in aquatic environments deserve further study ros including superoxide radical o2 singlet oxygen 1o2 hydroxyl radicals oh and hydrogen peroxide h2o2 are highly reactive tong et al 2018 for example oh has a high oxidation potential of 2 8 v and thus has a very strong oxidative capacity to degrade a variety of organic pollutants in water xiao et al 2017a a few studies have demonstrated that ros played critical roles in the photochemical transformation of carboxylated multiwalled carbon nanotubes mwcnts graphene oxide dissolved black carbon and c3n4 in water xiao et al 2017a qu et al 2013 fu et al 2016 there is a large knowledge gap regarding the involvement of ros in the transformation of mps during the photoaging process in aquatic environments in this study polystyrene microplastics ps mp which are one of the most detected plastics in aquatic environments that has a global annual production of more than 13 million tonnes liu et al 2019a delilah et al 2011 was selected as the model mp this study aimed to i identify and quantify the yields of each ros in a suspension of ps mp receiving 150 d of simulated solar light irradiation ii to explore the formation mechanisms of the identified ros in the reaction system and iii to ascertain the roles of the ros in the transformation of ps mp with comprehensive characterizations including size distribution and carbonyl index ci this study provides the first evidence for the formation of ros by the photoaged ps mp and elucidate the mechanisms of mp transformation due to attack by ros which will improve our understanding of the long term phototransformation of mps in natural aquatic environments as well as the environmental risks of mps 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials high purity 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyroline n oxide dmpo 97 isopropyl alcohol ia ar dimethyl sulfoxide dmso ar ascorbic acid aa 99 0

carboxanilide xtt 90 were obtained from sigma aldrich reagent company shanghai china ultrapure water was used in the experiments 2 2 photochemical experiments prior to use the ps mp powder was rinsed 3 times sequentially using ethanol and ultrapure water subsequently 2 g of dry sample was mixed with 40 ml of ultrapure water and then put in a 50 ml glass tube the mixture was incubated in a rotary incubator mx rd pro dragonlab china at 70 rpm for 24 h in the dark to ensure the ps was well dispersed in water the obtained suspension was filtered with a 0 22 μm polyethersulfone pes membrane and then freeze dried for 1 h the resultant ps was used for the following photochemical experiments specifically 0 2 g of ps mp and 20 ml of ultrapure water were mixed in a 50 ml quartz tube which then was placed in a merry go round photochemical reactor bl ghx v shanghai bilon china and magnetically stirred at 250 rpm to ensure uniform illumination the simulated sunlight wavelength range 295 2500

summer at the equator yeang 2007 the reaction temperature was controlled at 25 c parallel experiments without ps mp or light were performed as controls at predetermined reaction intervals such as 1 2 60 and 150 d max ros measurements and ps characterization were conducted 2 3 determination of ros at the predetermined intervals 18 5 ml of the suspension was withdrawn from the reaction system and filtered with a 0 22 μm pes membrane the obtained ps mp powder was dried at 45 c in a vacuum oven for 20 min and 50 mg of the powder was then added to 0 5 ml of 0 1 m dmpo aqueous solution to trap oh on ps mp surfaces another 50 mg was dispersed in 0 5 ml of 0 1 m dmpo in dmso solution to measure o2 on ps mp surfaces the remaining ps powder was stored for the subsequent physical and chemical characterization the remaining 1 5 ml of the suspension in the photochemical reactor was divided into three equal parts which were used to probe the presence of oh o2 in water and to determine the h2o2 concentration in water using a hydrogen peroxide assay kit solarbio life sciences beijing the details for the ros measurements are shown in the supporting information text s1 and fig s2 the concentrations of o2 oh and 1o2 in suspension were determined using chemical probe methods and were quantified by xtt ba and ffa respectively qu et al 2013 nosaka and nosaka 2017 likewise 20 ml of 10

for 1o2 and oh and 10 mm aa for o2 1o2 and oh were added to the ps mp suspension in addition 20 ml of 10 mm h2o2 solution with 0 2 g ps was prepared the same amount of ros scavengers was renewed in the suspension every 12 h to compensate for the consumption of ros scavengers fig s3 to prevent the accumulation of ros scavengers and h2o2 in the suspension the ps mp were separated from the suspension via filtration every 3 d and washed 4 times with ultrapure water which was again introduced with fresh ros scavengers and h2o2 solution the ps mp suspension was continuously illuminated according to the above procedures for 150 d control samples were maintained in ultrapure water under the same conditions 2 4 characterization of ps mp the morphologies of ps mp were analyzed by an s 3400n scanning electron microscope sem hitachi japan and the size of the particles was obtained by nano measurer software analysis of the sem images zhu et al 2019 attenuated total reflectance fourier

germany the details for the sample characterizations are presented in text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 generation and evolution of ros in the suspension of ps mp advanced oxidation can accelerate mp aging by introducing a large amount of ros liu et al 2019b therefore epr coupled with the spin trapping agent dmpo was applied to determine the level of ros in the reaction system including oh o2 and 1o2 as shown in fig s4a dmpo oh adducts with a splitting of αn αh 14 9 g were observed in the ps mp suspensions under light irradiation buettner 1987 while no ros were detected in the control water without ps mp during the 150 d of illumination however oh was not detected on the aged ps mp solids because of the low conversion rate and yield from o2 to oh in the dark fig s4d finkelstein et al 1982 buettner 1993 these findings indicated that oh was generated in the suspension under the simulated sunlight irradiation meanwhile dmpo ooh adducts with hyperfine splitting of αn 14 2 g αh β 11 4 g and αh γ1 1 2 g appeared on the aged ps mp solids separated from the suspensions fig s4b buettner 1987 xiao et al 2017b while no epr signal was detected in the control moreover a 3 line epr signal with an intensity of 1 1 1 was observed on the ps mp powder fig s4b indicating that 1o2 was also produced fang et al 2017 however no epr signal of dmpo ooh adducts appeared in the ps mp suspension fig s4c which might be due to the low efficacy of dmpo for trapping o2 and the instability of the dmpo ooh adduct in aqueous media t 1 2 60 s barriga et al 2010 lavrent et al 2011 these results manifested that o2 was generated on the aged ps mp surfaces furthermore the intensities of dmpo oh and dmpo ooh adducts increased with the irradiation time according to the obtained epr spectra the yield of each ros was quantitatively analyzed by a spin counting method embedded in the bruker software spinfit bruker s xenon program and the evolutions of o2 and oh as a function of irradiation time are shown in fig 1 the yields of o2 and oh increased slowly before 60 d of illumination followed by a rapid increase moreover the temporal yield variation of h2o2 in ps mp suspension displayed a similar trend under light irradiation fig 1c to further determine the types of ros in ps mp suspension the chemical probe method was applied in this study as revealed in figs s5a and a low concentration of xtt formazan was detected during irradiation indicating that a small amount of o2 reacted with xtt buettner and oberley 1978 as shown in fig s5b ffa as the 1o2 probe remained stable in the dark and with sunlight in the absence of ps mp however ffa was rapidly consumed in the presence of ps mp during light irradiation with more than 98 of the ffa being consumed in 11 d the calculated pseudosteady state concentration of 1o2 ss was 3 27 10 14 m fig s5c presents the production of p hydroxybenzoic acid p hba by the reaction of ba with oh no p hba was formed in the controls during light irradiation p hba quickly accumulated in the presence of ps mp as light irradiation was extended which implied the generation of a notable amount of oh fig s5c after 60 d of irradiation the pseudo steady state yield of oh ss was calculated to be 6 21 μmol fig s5d these results were in accordance with the obtained results from epr 3 2 ros formation mechanisms the sem images in fig s6 illustrate that the pristine ps mp were ellipsoidal particles with a smooth surface however after 60 d of light irradiation the ps mp experienced a significant morphological change and became sheet like with obvious cracks forming on the surface as the irradiation time prolonged to 150 d a large number of ps mp flakes appeared with multiple cracks which might be attributed to the light penetrating deep into the cracks and pores which were gradually formed during light irradiation hüffer et al 2018 similar morphological changes were reported for uv aged and advanced oxidation treated ps mp in previous studies liu et al 2019b 2019c fig 2 shows that the mean particle size of the pristine ps mp was 150 μm with most of the particles 88 having a size 80 μm upon irradiation the mean size of the aged ps mp decreased to 93 μm and 52 μm after 60 d and 150 d light exposure respectively a total of 44 1 and 71 4 of the particles were 80 μm the results demonstrated that sunlight irradiation caused the breakdown of ps mp particles thus resulting in the formation of smaller particles which is likely related to chain scission processes liu et al 2019a the atr ftir spectra of ps mp fig 3 a indicated that new functional groups corresponding to the absorption peaks of 1734 1225 and 1067 cm 1 appeared after irradiation for 60 and 150 d these peaks were attributed to the co of carboxyl mailhot and gardette 1992 the c o c of lipids or ethers bandow et al 2017 and the c o of alcohols or ethers liu et al 2019a respectively and their intensities increased with irradiation time previous studies have well documented the formation of oxidation functional groups on ps surfaces during light irradiation yousif and haddad 2013 kaczmarek 1995 the carbon centered free radicals were generated by a photoinduced homolytic c h bond cleavage in the initiation step which reacted with o2 to generate peroxy radicals zhu et al 2019 subsequently peroxy radicals were rapidly transformed by hydrogen abstraction into photochemically unstable hydroperoxides the alkoxy radicals produced by photolysis of hydroperoxides may combine with hydrogen atoms to form hydroxyl functional groups the dispropertionation reaction of alkoxy radicals generated carbonyl groups yousif and haddad 2013 kaczmarek 1995 ci is commonly used to indicate the aging degree of plastics and was determined as the ratio of the absorbance of 1743 cm 1 to 1447 cm 1 in this study song et al 2017 liu et al 2019b the value of ci increased from 0 04 to 0 14 and from 0 14 to 0 33 after light irradiation for 60 d and 150 d respectively fig 3b the control experiments showed that soaking and stirring in water without light irradiation had a very weak effect on the change in the surface morphology and functional groups of ps mp fig s7 these results suggested that light irradiation induced the generation of oxygen containing functional groups on ps mp in agreement with previous studies liu et al 2019a zhu et al 2019 the xps spectra indicated that the o c of ps mp increased from 0 022 to 0 055 and 0 055 to 0 12 after irradiation for 60 and 150 d respectively table s1 the increased o 1s peak was deconvoluted into three individual peaks o h o c co and o co suggesting that oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl groups carboxyl groups and carbonyl groups were produced fig s8 jun et al 2014 in addition the relative proportion of o co increased as the irradiation time prolonged table s1 indicating that more carboxyl groups were produced which may be due to dispropertionation reaction of polymer alkoxy radicals and oxidation of oh kaczmarek 1995 these results further indicated that the surface of ps mp experienced extensive oxidation as it was continuously exposed to simulated solar light the characteristic changes in the photoaged ps mp might involve bond cleavage and free radical formation in previous studies it was reported that epfrs were generated on some polymers and organic molecules under light irradiation zhu et al 2019 zhao et al 2017 which may transfer electrons to h2o o2 and induce ros generation xiao et al 2017b gehling et al 2014 therefore epr was applied to quantify the epfrs formed on ps mp which was believed to be related to the photochemical reactivity of ps mp the epr spectra revealed that epfrs were formed on ps mp with a signal width of 7 48 8 61 g and a g factor of 2 00401 2 00424 representing o centered organic radicals fig s9 valavanidis et al 2008 jia et al 2016 2018 in our previous study it was reported that simulated sunlight induced the formation of epfrs which then initiated the cleavage of methine c h in ps mp leading to formation of tertiary alkyl radical tertiary peroxy radical and tertiary alkoxy radical zhu et al 2019 the epfr signals increased gradually from 0 to 1 80 1016 spins g with irradiation time fig 1d suggesting that simulated sunlight irradiation stimulated epfr formation on ps mp in aqueous solution to further elucidate the mechanism of ros formation in the ps mp suspensions by light illumination the correlations between the normalized epfr concentrations and the yields of different ros are shown in fig 4 there were significant correlations between the yields of epfrs and each ros suggesting that epfrs played an important role in the formation of ros tong et al 2018 gehling et al 2014 moreover the strongest positive correlation was observed between epfrs and o2 r2 0 94 p 0 001 followed by that between h2o2 and oh this was reasonable because epfrs could transfer electrons directly to dissolved oxygen to form o2 during light irradiation lavrent et al 2011 gehling et al 2014 furthermore o2 and h2o2 displayed significant correlations with h2o2 and oh respectively suggesting that h2o2 and oh were mainly derived from the o2 disproportionation reaction and h2o2 reduction respectively lavrent et al 2011 kim et al 2016 overall the above results suggested that the ps bound epfrs reacted with dissolved o2 via electron transfer to yield o2 which allowed electrons to form h2o2 by the disproportionation reaction two possible pathways could be responsible for h2o2 mediation of oh formation one possible pathway is that the generated h2o2 was decomposed by a photo fenton like reaction in the presence of light fang et al 2017 the other pathway could occur due to the activation of h2o2 by epfrs through single electron transfer from epfrs to h2o2 thus generating oh gehling et al 2014 fang et al 2014 several studies suggested that 1o2 was generated through a photosensitization reaction in which photoexcited materials transfer energy to dissolved o2 fu et al 2016 fang et al 2017 the aged ps mp with carbonyl containing structures could absorb the energy of light and be excited to the triplet states ps 3ps by uv vis irradiation fig s10a which transfers energy to dissolved o2 to form 1o2 to confirm this hypothesis tmp 60 μm as a triplet state quencher fang et al 2017 was used with an ffa probe the results showed that the loss of ffa in ps mp suspensions was markedly suppressed in the presence of tmp fig s10b indicating that the formation of 3ps was inhibited leading to a decrease in 1o2 formation based on the above results the mechanisms of ros formation in the ps mp suspension were proposed and are illustrated in scheme 1 3 3 the roles of ros in ps mp phototransformation the epfrs produced on the photoaged ps mp can induce the formation of ros which might also accelerate the aging process of ps mp scavenger trapping tests were applied to identify the roles of ros in ps mp phototransformation and the results are shown in fig 5 and table 1 two mg l sod was used to scavenge o2 10 mm ia was used to scavenge oh 10 mm l histidine was used to trap oh and 1o2 and aa was used to scavenge oh o2 and 1o2 tong et al 2018 lavrent et al 2011 han et al 2017 in the presence of ros quenchers significant changes were observed for the mean particle size ci and molecular weight of ps mp when oh o2 and 1o2 were quenched by the aa solution 47 2 of the ps mp particles had sizes less than 80 μm whereas this proportion was significantly higher in water 88 fig 5a compared with the aa free system the mean size of the ps mp particles increased to 82 μm in the presence of aa fig s11a correspondingly aa reduced the ci value of the ps mp from 0 33 to 0 17 fig 5b these results indicated that the ros played a key role in the transformation of ps mp under light irradiation which was in line with the aging behavior of ps mp by advanced oxidation liu et al 2019b this was also consistent with the gpc results which showed that the m w m n and m p of ps mp increased in the presence of aa while the pdi decreased table 1 to more clearly determine the contribution of each ros to ps mp phototransformation the ci values of ps before and after ros quenching were compared and analyzed in the presence of sod the ci value decreased to 0 28 representing a 17 6 reduction in the aging degree the aging degree of ps decreased by 31 2 in the presence of ia while l histidine and aa reduced the aging degree of ps mp by 40 9 and 55 5 respectively these results highlighted that ros facilitated the aging of ps mp and that the contribution of o2 oh and 1o2 was different for the aging degree of ps with the order of oh o2 1o2 after 150 d of irradiation the highest contribution of oh to aging may be due to its strong oxidative potential e 0 2 8 v consistent with the accelerated aging of ps mp by h2o2 under light conditions fig 5b furthermore the m w m n and m p of ps mp increased after adding ros quenchers table 1 indicating ros promoted the phototransformation of ps mp which agreed with the above results fig 5b interestingly a comparison with the change in molecular weight showed that a significant change in ci was attributed to the important role of ros in the change in the oxygen containing functional groups in ps mp it is interesting that the concentration of epfrs was significantly reduced after the addition of h2o2 fig s11b however the epfrs concentration increased after dosing with ros quenchers these findings indicated that the phototransformation of ps mp was not directly affected by epfrs but rather was related to the ros as discussed above ros distinctly mediated the photodegradation of ps mp under light irradiation and the contribution to ps mp aging differed between each ros previous studies argued that the direct scission of chemical bonds by uv light was responsible for ps phototransformation andrady 2011 geuskens and david 2009 this study is the first to report the formation of ros by ps mp and the key roles of ros on the long term transformation of ps mp in water under sunlight irradiation however the transformation mechanism of each ros to ps requires further exploration 3 4 impacts of the ros on the sedimentation of ps mp previous studies suggested that uv irradiation enhanced negative surface charges and the mobility of ps mp which was attributed to the increase in oxidative functional groups liu et al 2019a as shown in fig s12 the aged ps mp were more dispersed and settled down more slowly than the pristine ps mp the stability of ps mp in 5 mm nacl solution increased after 150 d of irradiation however the presence of a ros quencher aa significantly reduced the stability of the photoaged ps mp this result was consistent with the change in the surface zeta potential fig 6 photochemical reactions induced the formation of more surface functional groups such as o h and co on ps mp fig s13 resulting in enhanced surface negative charges stronger electrostatic repulsion and slower aggregation and sedimentation qu et al 2013 the results suggested that the ros changed the properties and surface functional groups of ps mp and then improved their stability and mobility in water 4 conclusions there are increasing concerns about the effects of photoirradiation on the transformation of mps and their environmental behaviors however the underlying mechanisms related to the changes in mps lack in depth understanding results of this study reveal that ps mp can be significantly altered in water by simulated sunlight irradiation with regard to not only particle size functional groups and epfrs but also photoinduced ros the formation ros including o2 h2o2 and oh had an important relationship with epfrs meanwhile ros exhibited strong reactivity toward ps mp evidenced by ros inhibition experiments inferring that ros mediated the phototransformation of ps mp in addition long term photoaging caused more oxidation functional groups and more negative charges on ps mp surfaces leading to stronger electrostatic repulsion and slower sedimentation in water these dynamic alterations are expected to have significant impacts on the fate and transportation of aged mps in natural aquatic environments mps might coexist with ros derived from photosensitization of dissolved organic matter and pigments no2 and no3 photolysis biological processes and photo fenton reactions the effect of these ros generating processes on the aging of mps

18099,the performance of adsorbents for the removal of organic micropollutants mps from water can be influenced by the presence of water matrix constituents the objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of water matrix constituents on the performance of coconut shell activated carbon ccac porous β cyclodextrin polymer cdp and cdp coated on cellulose microcrystal cdp cmc adsorbents mp removals were measured in batch experiments for a mixture of 90 mp at 1 μg l 1 and mp breakthrough was measured in rapid small scale column test rssct experiments for a mixture of 15 mp at 500 ng l 1 all experiments were performed first with nanopure water and subsequently with six different water samples collected from two separate groundwater surface water and wastewater effluent sources the results of batch and rssct experiments demonstrate more rapid adsorption kinetics and less adsorption inhibition in the presence of matrix constituents for cdp adsorbents relative to ccac further the treatment capacity of cdp cmc in the rssct experiments was higher than that of ccac particularly in more complex water matrices statistical analyses were performed to investigate associations between adsorption inhibition among groups of mps and the concentrations of specific water matrix constituents for ccac adsorption inhibition was observed for all mps and was primarily attributed to the presence of dissolved organic matter with molar weight less than 1000 da for cdp adsorbents adsorption inhibition was primarily observed for cationic mps and was attributed to the screening of the negative surface charge of cdp by inorganic ions in water samples with high ionic strength these data further demonstrate the value of cdp as an alternative adsorbent to ccac for the removal of mps during water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords micropollutant adsorption breakthrough fouling activated carbon β cyclodextrin polymer abbreviations ac

referred to as micropollutants mps due to their typical occurrence at trace levels in the environment carpenter and helbling 2018 carpenter et al 2019 schwarzenbach et al 2006 because of their diverse physicochemical properties and low concentrations mp removal is generally limited in conventional water and wastewater treatment processes benner et al 2013 activated carbon ac adsorption has emerged as a leading technology and has been demonstrated to effectively remove a broad spectrum of mps bonvin et al 2015 kennedy et al 2015 margot et al 2013 however limitations of ac adsorption arise from relatively slow kinetics bonvin et al 2015 poor removal of polar mps kovalova et al 2013 and fouling by dissolved organic matter dom and other matrix constituents kennedy and summers 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 further the expenses of applying ac in water and wastewater treatment processes are generally high because of the significant energy required for ac regeneration margot et al 2013 to address these deficiencies alternative adsorbents such as porous β cyclodextrin polymers cdps alsbaiee et al 2015 ling et al 2017 have been developed for potential implementation in batch adsorption followed by ultrafiltration ba uf processes more recently cdps coated on cellulose microcrystals cdp cmc have been developed by polymerizing cdps in the presence of cmcs resulting in adsorbents with larger particle sizes amenable for packed bed filtration pbf processes alzate sánchez et al 2019 the fouling of ac by water matrix constituents is perhaps the major concern for mp removal in both ba uf and pbf processes bonvin et al 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 mps adsorb to ac materials primarily by means of hydrophobic interactions though charged functional groups on ac surfaces can also facilitate the adsorption of ionic mps by means of electrostatic interactions ling et al 2019 as ac adsorption is non selective both mps and dom which is generally present in all waters from either natural or anthropogenic sources can be adsorbed by means of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions according to previous research the adsorption of mps on ac can be inhibited through direct site competition with low and medium molecular weight mw dom that is similar in size and charge state to mps and through pore blockage caused by high mw dom ding et al 2008 li et al 2003 newcombe et al 1997 in addition the presence of inorganic ions in the bulk water can diminish the surface charge of ac by screening local ionizable functional groups thereby limiting their electrostatic interactions with mps newcombe and drikas 1997 summers and roberts 1988 for example the coconut shell ac ccac employed in this study exhibits a positive surface charge at neutral ph de ridder et al 2013 therefore the adsorption of anionic mps on ccac could be inhibited by negatively charged low mw dom through direct site competition and or by the presence of inorganic anions that screen the positive surface charge newcombe and drikas 1997 summers and roberts 1988 though the mechanisms of adsorption inhibition on ac adsorbents have been evaluated in previous research how adsorbent fouling will influence the removal of diverse groups of mps in ba uf and pbf processes remains less clear because previous studies were either performed with very limited types of mps e g neutral mps or with high concentrations of mps that were not environmentally relevant bonvin et al 2015 kennedy and summers 2015 sgroi et al 2018 zietzschmann et al 2016 in our previous study a tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile tfn crosslinked cdp exhibited rapid adsorption kinetics and efficient removal of a variety of mps and was not fouled by humic acid a surrogate for dom or sodium chloride a surrogate for inorganic ions demonstrating its potential as an alternative adsorbent to ac for mp removal during water and wastewater treatment ling et al 2017 mp adsorption on cdp relies on the formation of host guest complexes in the 0 78 nm interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomer which requires adsorbates to fit within a certain size range ling et al 2019 2017 additionally cdp exhibits a negative surface charge at neutral ph klemes et al 2018 the specific role that the negative surface charge of cdp plays in mp adsorption is unknown though enhanced adsorption affinity for cationic mps has been observed ling et al 2017 while cdp is not fouled by humic acid and nacl we could expect that smaller dom molecules could inhibit mp uptake through direct site competition by binding in the interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomer further positively charged dom and the presence of inorganic cations could screen the negative surface charge of cdp thereby lowering the adsorption affinity for cationic mps to further our understanding of the fouling of ccac and cdp by natural matrix constituents we designed experiments to explore the removal of mps by means of ccac and cdp adsorption in environmentally derived water samples with varying types and amounts of dom and inorganic ions the objectives of the research were to 1 benchmark the performance of ccac and cdp in simulated ba uf processes with water samples from six different sources with 90 mps 2 benchmark the performance of ccac and cdp cmc in rapid small scale column test rssct experiments that simulate pbf processes with water samples from different sources with 15 mps and 3 identify the water matrix constituents contributing most to adsorption inhibition on ccac cdp and cdp cmc our results demonstrate less adsorption inhibition and greater treatment capacity for cdp adsorbents relative to ccac we also identified specific water matrix constituents that are associated with the adsorption inhibition of certain groups of mps these data significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which ccac and cdp adsorbents remove mps from water and support the continued evaluation of cdps as alternative adsorbents for use in ba uf or pbf processes during water and wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and adsorbents all experiments with nanopure water were performed at ph 6 7 the ph was confirmed to be stable by measuring ph throughout each experiment all experiments with real water samples were performed at the original ph of the water samples without adjustment we selected 90 and 15 mps for batch and rssct experiments respectively according to their environmental relevance bradley et al 2017 carpenter and helbling 2018 pochodylo and helbling 2017 their broad range of physiochemical properties and previous studies exploring their adsorption on ccac and cdp ling et al 2019 2017 rossner et al 2009 a list of all mps along with their measured logk d values for ccac and cdp and charge state at neutral ph is provided in table s1 of the supplementary data sd all logk d values were measured experimentally in a previous study for each mp adsorbent pair ling et al 2019 we selected 44 isotope labeled internal standards iliss to account for the matrix effects of different water samples on the quantification of mps a list of all iliss along with their suppliers is provided in table s2 of the sd the preparation of stock solutions for each mp and two analytical mixtures containing the 90 and 15 mps were performed as previously described li et al 2018 for batch experiments ccac and cdp adsorbents were prepared and synthesized according to previously established methods alsbaiee et al 2015 ling et al 2017 briefly the ccac is commercially available aquacarb 1230c westates carbon siemens roseville mn and has an average particle size of 850 μm the as synthesized cdp has an average particle size on the order of 50 60 μm to increase the similarity in particle size between the ccac and cdp the ccac was pulverized with a mortar and pestle until 95 mass passed a 74 μm sieve 200 u s mesh for rssct experiments the ccac was pulverized with a mortar and pestle to achieve an average particle diameter of approximately 125 μm with 100 200 u s standard mesh kennedy and summers 2015 the cdp cmc with an average particle diameter of approximately 125 μm was synthesized according to a previously published method alzate sánchez et al 2019 the particle size surface area and porosity for these adsorbents were previously reported and are provided in table s3

sources ww1 and ww2 were employed in this study all experiments were also performed in nanopure water against which the performance of the adsorbents in environmentally derived water samples were benchmarked each water sample was characterized for its ph dissolved organic carbon doc a surrogate measurement for dom concentration total dissolved solids tds concentration conductivity and inorganic ion concentrations using standard methods baird et al 2017 further to investigate the effect of dom size on mp adsorption we characterized the mw distribution of dom in each water sample through high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec followed by total organic carbon toc analysis more details are provided in the sd including a description of our procedure and an example chromatogram provided in fig s1 all water samples were pre filtered with a 47 mm gf f glass fiber membrane whatman and a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone syringe filter successively to remove suspended solids before they were employed in adsorption experiments knappe et al 1997 zietzschmann et al 2016 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments to evaluate the fouling of ccac and cdp in ba uf processes were performed in 100 ml of water in 125 ml glass erlenmeyer flasks with magnetic stir bars on a multi position stirrer vwr with a stirring rate of 400 revolutions per minute rpm at 23 c mps were spiked to generate an additional concentration of each adsorbate of 1 μg l 1 to any background concentration of the mps that may have been present experiments investigating ccac and cdp were both performed at an adsorbent dose of 10 mg l 1 these adsorbate and adsorbent doses were selected according to previous research investigating mp removal by ccac and cdp adsorbents ling et al 2019 2017 and previous research regarding the application of ac in ba uf processes bonvin et al 2015 the restoration of the dried adsorbents was performed as previously described to create a suspension of each adsorbent ling et al 2017 briefly 10 mg of adsorbent was added to a 20 ml amber vial containing nanopure water 10 ml to yield a 1 g l suspension the suspension was mixed with a vortex mixer fisher scientific for 30 s sonicated for 1 min to break small aggregates and then stirred on a multiposition stirrer for 30 min at 360 rpm following this restoration procedure appropriate volumes of water samples the analytical mp mixture 90 mps each mp at 100 μg l 1 and the adsorbent suspension 1 g l were added to each flask successively samples were collected in 8 ml volumes after 1 h of contact time and filtered through a 0 22 μm pvdf syringe filter restek this contact time was selected according to previous research exploring mp removal by ccac and cdp adsorbents and typical hydraulic retention times in ba uf processes bonvin et al 2015 ling et al 2019 2017 control experiments to account for other mp losses were performed under the same conditions with no addition of adsorbent all experiments were performed in triplicate the samples were analyzed by means of high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms to determine the concentration of each mp in the aqueous phase the removal efficiency of each mp was determined by the following equation equation 1 r m p c 0 c t c 0 100 where r mp is the percent removal of each mp c 0 ng l 1 is the average concentration of a mp in the samples of the control experiments c t ng l 1 is the concentration of a mp in the liquid phase at sampling time t we defined a fouling scale index fsi as a metric to quantify the extent of adsorption inhibition for each mp in each experiment relative to the adsorption in nanopure water the fsi for batch experiments was determined by the following equation equation

column restek with an inside diameter of 0 4 cm a column length of 3 cm and stainless steel frits was employed as the host of packed bed adsorption materials a shimadzu lc 20ad pump with parallel double micro plunger was employed to deliver a constant flow rate of 1 ml min 1 of feed solution for all rssct experiments all rssct experiments were performed with a simulated empty bed contact time ebct of 9 6 min the ccac and cdp cmc tested in the column experiments both had an average particle size of 125 μm the flow rates particle sizes and the dimensions of the rssct column were determined according to the constant diffusivity approach crittenden et al 1991 1986 which has been successfully applied in previous research to simulate pilot scale mp breakthrough knappe et al 1997 detailed information on the rssct experiments and the simulated column can be found in table s4 of the sd we note that rssct experiments were selected as a test system to compare the performance of ccac and cdp cmc under uniform experimental conditions similar to a previous study employing rssct to evaluate the potential of ion exchange resins for the removal of perfluoroalkyl acids schaefer et al 2019 robust extrapolation of the results from the rssct experiments to the simulated system would require further validation particularly for the cdp cmc adsorbent all natural water samples were pre filtered with a 47 mm gf f glass fiber membrane whatman and a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone syringe filter to remove suspended solids then the analytical mp mixture 15 mps each mp at 100 μg l 1 was spiked into each water sample to generate an additional concentration of each mp at 500 ng l 1 to any background concentration of the mps that may have been present though the designed dimensions of the rssct columns for both materials are identical due to their different densities the mass of ccac and cdp cmc packed into the columns to achieve a 1 cm bed depth are 85 mg and 65 mg per column respectively the rssct columns were run continuously until all 15 mps exhibited over 10 breakthrough or the predetermined 60 000 bed volumes of treatment were achieved we selected 60 000 bed volumes of treatment as a conservative threshold for the economical usage of ccac or cdp cmc for drinking water production which is often cited as 15 000 bed volumes of treatment kennedy et al 2015 samples were collected in 8 ml volumes on an hourly basis and filtered through a 0 22 μm pvdf syringe filter before they were analyzed by means of hplc ms ms to confirm that influent concentrations of all mps remained constant throughout each rssct experiment samples were collected at the influent of the column every 24 h for each test these samples were also filtered and analyzed by means of the same method the adsorbent use rate of ccac and cdp cmc for each mp was determined by the following equation equation 3 a d s o r b e n t u s e r a t e ρ a d s o r b e n t b v 10 where bv 10 is the 10 breakthrough bed volumes of each mp on each adsorbent in each water matrix and ρ adsorbent is the density of each adsorbent mg l 1 the fsi for rssct experiments was determined by the following equation equation 4 f o u l i n g s c a l e i n d e x b v 10 i n n p b v 10 i n a w a t e r s a m p l e b v 10 i n n p 100 we selected bv 10 as the metric to evaluate adsorption inhibition based on previous research kennedy and summers 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 2 5 analytical methods the quantification of analytes in samples from the batch experiments and rssct experiments was performed by means of hplc ms ms qexactive thermofisher scientific the analytical method is described in the sd and analytical details used for the detection and quantification of each analyte can be found in table s5 of the sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 water characterization the six environmentally derived water samples were selected for their diverse matrix compositions and their relevance for water and wastewater treatment each water sample was characterized for general water quality parameters including ph doc concentration a surrogate measurement for dom conductivity tds concentration and the concentrations of several target inorganic ions all water characterization data are provided in table 1 the ph of the six water samples were all between 8 1 and 8 3 which is consistent with ph measurements of water samples from the same region reported in previous research carpenter et al 2019 due to the minor ph differences among these water samples no further insights can be achieved into the impacts of ph on mp removal by ccac and cdp adsorbents in these water samples however it is worth noting that mp removal by cdp can be enhanced at ph values lower than 5 li et al 2018 the conductivity and tds measurements generally demonstrate increasing ionic strength from the relatively clean groundwater matrices to the more complex surface water and wastewater effluent matrices the concentrations of several target inorganic ions also demonstrate an expected increase from groundwater to wastewater with a couple of notable exceptions the nitrate no3 concentration was highest in gw2 and sulfate so4 2 magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 concentrations were more uniform across the water samples the remaining data in table 1 provide the characterization results of the dom mw distributions for each water sample the concentrations of dom i e unfractionated water samples in all water samples fit well into the respective typical ranges of dom in groundwater surface water and wastewater effluent sgroi et al 2018 thurman et al 1982 wagoner et al 1997 with one exception the dom concentration in sw2 was anomalously high we note that the water collected from this site was rather turbid and contained some algae and other planktonic organisms the lowest dom concentrations were measured in the groundwater samples and higher concentrations were measured in surface water and wastewater effluent similar trends were noted among the concentrations of dom fractions with different mw l dom m dom and h dom represent the dom fractions with mw less than 600 da between 600 and 1000 da and over 1000 da respectively it is worth noting that much of the dom measured in sw2 is contained in the largest h dom size bin and that sw2 actually had the lowest l dom concentration 0 33 mg l 1 among the water samples finally the sum of the three dom concentrations measured for the three size bins is consistent with the dom concentrations measured in the original water samples demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the hpsec method employed in this study 3 2 batch experiments of the 90 mps employed in the batch experiments eleven responded erratically to either the experimental poor repeatability or analytical conditions poor limits of quantification therefore we report data from the batch experiments for 79 of the 90 mps we first calculated the removal of each mp r mp on each adsorbent in each water sample after 1 h of contact time as described in equation 1 the data are provided in tables s6 and s7 and the results are summarized in fig 1 which provides plots of r mp on each adsorbent in each real water sample versus the r mp on each adsorbent in nanopure water data for ccac are provided in fig 1a for groundwater fig 1c for surface water and fig 1e for wastewater effluent analogous plots for cdp are provided in fig 1b d and 1f mp removal on ccac was generally good after 1 h of contact time but adsorption was inhibited in real water matrices relative to nanopure water the degree to which r mp was inhibited increased from groundwater to surface water to wastewater effluent for example whereas 75 gw1 and 74 mps gw2 exhibited more than 50 removal in groundwater only 11 ww1 and 2 mps ww2 exhibited more than 50 removal in wastewater effluent among groups of mps delineated by their charge matrix constituents had the largest effect on the r mp of anionic mps but effected mps in other charge groups to varying extents regardless of their charge mp removal on cdp was more variable than on ccac after 1 h of contact time with 34 mps exhibiting less than 20 removal in nanopure water reflecting the greater selectivity of mp adsorption on cdp the mps that were removed to less than 20 in nanopure water were mostly anionic mps or small and neutral mps in agreement with our previous study ling et al 2017 r mp was inhibited to some extent for cdp in real water matrices relative to nanopure water though the extent of adsorption inhibition was less than what was observed for ccac for example of the 45 mps that were removed to greater than 20 by cdp in nanopure water 34 in gw1 and 33 in gw2 30 in sw1 and 40 in sw2 and 21 in ww1 and 28 in ww2 were removed to greater than 20 in real water matrices it is also clear from the data in fig 1 that the adsorption of cationic and zwitterionic mps on cdp is selectively inhibited in the real water samples the adsorption of neutral mps is generally not inhibited in groundwater or surface water and is inhibited only to a limited extent in wastewater effluent whereas anionic mps exhibit low affinity for cdp in all water matrices including nanopure water to explore the selective adsorption inhibition of cationic mps further we calculated the fraction of the adsorption affinity k d values that could be explained by electrostatic interactions by using the coefficients of a previously described qsar model ling et al 2019 we found a significant positive association permutation test p 0 01 between the extent of adsorption inhibition for each cationic mp and the fraction of its adsorption affinity attributed to electrostatic interactions for example the k d values for cationic mps morphine and albuterol on cdp are almost entirely explained by molecular descriptors that relate to electrostatic interactions these two mps exhibit the greatest adsorption inhibition in these experiments in contrast acebutolol and metoprolol are cationic mps with k d values that rely more on molecular descriptors related to hydrophobic interactions and these two mps exhibit the least amount of adsorption inhibition in these experiments therefore we attribute the selective inhibition of cationic mps on cdp to a weakening of electrostatic interactions in real water matrices 3 3 rssct experiments breakthrough curves we selected 15 mps 5 cationic 5 anionic and 5 neutral from among the 90 mps studied in the batch experiments to evaluate mp removal and breakthrough in rssct experiments designed to simulate a pbf with an ebct of 9 6 min we performed the rssct experiments with all six real water samples for cdp cmc and with gw1 sw1 and ww1 for ccac breakthrough curves for all 15 mps for all rssct experiments are provided in figures s2 through s7 of the sd and for representative anionic naproxen cationic venlafaxine and neutral acetochlor mps in fig 2 on an experimental time basis and fig s8 on a throughput bed volumes basis data for ccac are provided in fig 2a c and 2e and data for cdp cmc are provided in fig 2b d and 2f all three mps exhibit gradual breakthrough on ccac in gw1 and sw1 and relatively steep breakthrough in ww1 and the shapes of the breakthrough curves for each mp in each water matrix are similar this observation corroborates previous findings that mp uptake on ccac is relatively slow and non selective ling et al 2017 specifically each mp exhibits continuously increasing breakthrough in gw1 and sw1 until about 50 breakthrough is achieved after 120 h complete breakthrough is observed relatively quickly for each mp in ww1 with over 80 breakthrough observed in less than 20 h the similar shapes of the breakthrough curves in gw1 and sw1 suggest similar adsorption kinetics and capacity of ccac in these matrices while the rapid breakthrough of each mp in the ww1 experiments demonstrate that the fouling caused by the ww1 matrix reduced the adsorption capacity of ccac to a great extent as demonstrated in a previous study dom with mw less than 1000 da can inhibit mp adsorption on ac adsorbents to a much greater extent than dom with mw greater than 1000 da kennedy and summers 2015 therefore the rapid breakthrough can be attributed to the significantly elevated concentration of lm dom in ww1 in contrast to the rssct experiments with ccac all mps exhibited steep breakthrough in the rssct experiments conducted with cdp cmc steep breakthrough curves in pbf processes are a general indication of rapid adsorption kinetics which is a known feature of mp adsorption on cdp and cdp cmc alzate sánchez et al 2019 ling et al 2017 importantly these data demonstrate that rapid adsorption kinetics are preserved in column experiments and in the presence of matrix constituents rapid adsorption kinetics coupled with the high adsorption capacity of cdp adsorbents can be leveraged in pbf processes to increase the throughput of water treatment and the volume of water treated per day when the objective is to achieve low mp concentrations in the effluent further rapid adsorption translates to narrow mass transfer zones within the pbf process implying that only small fractions of unused adsorbent will be wasted when a process reaches its treatment capacity the data in fig 2 also show that the breakthrough time for each of the three mps is shorter in the wastewater effluent matrices than in the groundwater and surface water matrices which could be attributed to the elevated concentration of l dom and the enhanced ionic strength in ww1 and ww2 see further discussion in the following this effect is most pronounced for the cationic mp fig 2d in agreement with observations in batch experiments 3 4 rssct experiments treatment capacity the operational capacity of a pbf process is typically evaluated based on the number of bed volumes treated before a certain level of contaminant breakthrough kennedy et al 2015 kennedy and summers 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 in this study we used the breakthrough curves to calculate the number of bed volumes treated before 10 contaminant breakthrough bv 10 as has been done before in evaluating mp removal in rssct experiments kennedy and summers 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 the bv 10 values of each mp on each adsorbent in each water sample is provided in table s8 and are summarized in fig 3 considering the different densities of ccac 567 g l and cdp cmc 433 g l the use rate of each adsorbent to achieve bv 10 for each mp in each water matrix is also provided in table s9 to provide further insights into the relative adsorption capacity of ccac and cdp cmc in pbf processes the bv 10 values of all 15 mps on ccac were over 60 000 bed volumes in nanopure water table s8 but decreased substantially in real water matrices the degree of bv 10 reduction increased from groundwater to surface water to wastewater effluent in agreement with adsorption inhibition observations in batch experiments though 10 mps exhibited bv 10 values of more than 5 000 bed volumes in gw1 no mp exhibited bv 10 values of more than 5 000 bed volumes in ww1 in addition the bv 10 values of anionic mps were inhibited to the greatest extent whereas cationic and neutral mps exhibited varying degrees of inhibition these data are also consistent with our observations in batch experiments in contrast to the uniformly high bv 10 values of all mps on ccac in nanopure water mp bv 10 values on cdp cmc were more variable in nanopure water due to the selective adsorption on cdp table s8 all 5 cationic mps exhibited bv 10 values over 60 000 bed volumes which we attribute to the negative surface charge of cdp facilitating the adsorption of cationic mps through electrostatic interactions klemes et al 2018 ling et al 2019 whereas anionic and neutral mps exhibited varying treatment capacity interestingly three anionic mps diclofenac gemfibrozil and naproxen and one neutral mp isoproturon which were poorly removed by cdp in batch experiments exhibit high bv 10 values over 55 000 bed volumes on cdp cmc in nanopure water this could be attributed to differences between the morphology of cdp and cdp cmc and or the distinct hydraulic conditions in batch and rssct experiments the inhibition of mp adsorption capacity on cdp cmc was also observed to some extent in real water matrices of the 10 mps that exhibited bv 10 values over 10 000 in nanopure 7 7 and 5 mps exhibit bv 10 values over 10 000 in gw1 sw1 and ww1 respectively additionally as observed in batch experiments the bv 10 values of cationic mps were inhibited to the greatest extent whereas neutral and anionic mps exhibited moderate to limited inhibition in real water matrices though the mp removal on cdp cmc was inhibited in real water matrices the extent of inhibition was lower compared to that on ccac as shown in fig 3 for most mps the bv 10 values on cdp cmc were much higher than that on ccac with the exception of a few anionic and neutral mps in gw1 which exhibited rather poor performance on both types of adsorbents these data corroborate our observations in batch experiments that the extent of mp adsorption inhibition on cdp adsorbents is not as relevant to the complexity of the water matrix as that on ccac demonstrating less adsorption inhibition for cdp relative to ccac further the great treatment capacity of cdp cmc is especially notable when we consider that there was nearly 25 less mass of cdp cmc in the rssct experiments when compared to ccac due to the differences in their densities the data in table s9 demonstrate that the use rate of each adsorbent to achieve bv 10 for each mp in each water matrix is frequently much lower for cdp cmc compared to ccac furthermore approximately 77 of the mass of cdp cmc is attributed to the cellulose microcrystals which have been shown not to contribute to mp removal alzate sánchez et al 2019 3 5 factors contributing to adsorbent fouling the overall extent to which an adsorbent is fouled is generally determined by the composition of matrix constituents in real water matrices to enable further insights on the fouling mechanisms of ccac and cdp we used the r mp data and the bv 10 values to calculate the fsi for each adsorbent in each water sample as described in equations 2 and 3 for batch and rssct experiments respectively because the inhibition of mp adsorption depended on the charge state of mps the fsi of each adsorbent was calculated both for all mps and for mps grouped by their charge states the fsi of each adsorbent in each water sample for batch experiments are summarized in fig 4 and tables s10 and s11 for batch and rssct experiments respectively to quantitatively interpret fouling mechanisms on both adsorbents we investigated the associations between the fsis calculated with mps in different charge groups and all water quality parameters by means of pearson correlations table s12 as presented in fig 4a and tables s10 and s11 the fouling of ccac increases with the complexity of the water matrix i e the fractions of dom and the ionic strength the general adsorption inhibition observed for all mps could be attributed to direct site competition with l dom or m dom and or pore blockage caused by h dom ding et al 2008 li et al 2003 newcombe et al 1997 as seen in the pearson correlation coefficients provided in table s12 all groups of mps exhibit the strongest positive correlations 0 81 p value 0 05 with the concentrations of lm dom i e l dom plus m dom indicating that direct site competition caused by lm dom could be a major contributor to the general adsorption inhibition observed for all mps on ccac further mp removal across all groups was only weakly correlated with h dom concentration 0 27 p value 0 50 indicating that pore blockage caused by h dom might not be a relevant fouling mechanism for ccac it is also worth noting that the anomalously high h dom concentration measured in sw2 did not result in a significant performance difference further demonstrating that pore blockage caused by h dom might not be a relevant fouling mechanism for ccac these findings agree with observations in previous research that dom with mw less than 1000 da inhibits mp adsorption on ac adsorbents to a much greater extent than dom with mw greater than 1000 da kennedy and summers 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 the fouling of ccac is greatest for anionic mps fig 4a tables s8 and s9 the selective adsorption inhibition observed for anionic mps could be attributed to direct site competition with negatively charged l dom or m dom and or to the presence of inorganic anions which screen the positive surface charge of ccac newcombe 1999 summers and roberts 1988 as seen in the correlation coefficients provided in table s12 the fsi calculated with the group of anionic mps exhibit a strong positive correlation 0 85 p value 0 05 with the concentrations of lm dom indicating that lm dom could be a major contributor to the selective adsorption inhibition of anionic mps on ccac further the group of anionic mps exhibit the weakest positive correlation with ionic strength when compared to the other groups of mps as a result although the pearson correlation coefficients alone cannot disentangle the effects of direct site competition and surface charge screening on the selective adsorption inhibition for anionic mps our data suggest that direct site competition with negatively charged lm dom might play an important role cdp and cdp cmc notably exhibit nearly uniform fsis across the water matrices fig 4b tables s10 and s11 these data indicate greater fouling for cdps relative to ccac in the relatively clean groundwater matrices but less fouling for cdps relative to ccac in the more complex surface water and wastewater effluent matrices the data also show significant adsorption inhibition for the group of anionic mps but that result must be interpreted with caution the group of anionic mps are not removed to great extents by cdp in nanopure water fig 1 which inevitably led to great variability in the respective fsi so the influence of matrix constituents on that adsorption cannot be reliably assessed as observed in the data from the batch and rssct experiments and corroborated by the fsis provided in fig 4b the extent of fouling on cdps is greatest for cationic and zwitterionic mps we have previously observed enhanced adsorption affinity for cationic mps on cdps ling et al 2017 and hypothesize that the enhanced adsorption inhibition for the groups of cationic and zwitterionic mps may result from the presence of inorganic cations that screen the negative surface charge of cdp as presented in table s12 the fsi calculated with the group of cationic mps exhibits strong positive correlations with ionic strength for cdp 0 88 p value 0 05 and cdp cmc 0 86 p value 0 05 indicating that ionic species could be major contributors to the enhanced adsorption inhibition of cationic and zwitterionic mps on cdp adsorbents however we observed previously that nacl does not result in significant adsorption inhibition ling et al 2017 and the correlation coefficients in table s12 do not allow us to identify specific inorganic ions that contribute the most to the observed adsorption inhibition finally we observed the least amount of adsorption inhibition for the group of neutral mps on cdp adsorbents mp adsorption on cdp is associated with the formation of host guest complexes in the interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomers which requires adsorbates to fit within a certain size range ling et al 2019 2017 therefore we expect that neutral mps would compete only with neutral dom species within a certain size range the fsis calculated with the group of neutral mps exhibit strong positive correlations with the concentrations of l dom for cdp 0 94 p value 0 05 and cdp cmc 0 91 p value 0 05 providing quantitative support to this proposed fouling mechanism additionally the fsis calculated with all groups of mps exhibit weak or negative correlations with the concentrations of m dom and h dom agreeing with our expectations that large molecules cannot bind to cdp due to size exclusion ling et al 2019 2017 szejtli 1998 this result is particularly important because it corroborates the adsorption mechanism of cdp adsorbents demonstrated in our previous studies validates our hypothesized fouling mechanism of cdp adsorbents and explains the resilience of cdp adsorbents relative to ccac in more complex water matrices 4 conclusions we measured the removal of 79 mps on ccac and cdp adsorbents in simulated ba uf processes with water samples from six different sources overall the extent of mp removal was greater and more consistent on ccac than on cdp which agrees with our previous study with tfn crosslinked cdps we observed increased adsorption inhibition for ccac as the complexity of the water matrix increased and enhanced adsorption inhibition was noted for anionic mps we observed lower extents of adsorption inhibition for cdp relative to ccac and selective adsorption inhibition for cationic mps we measured the breakthrough curves of 15 mps on ccac and cdp cmc in rssct experiments that simulate pfb processes slow and constant breakthrough was observed for all mps in columns packed with ccac though rapid and early breakthrough was observed for all mps in experiments conducted with wastewater effluent rapid and late breakthrough was observed for all mps in columns packed with cdp cmc demonstrating fast adsorption kinetics and narrow mass transfer zones treatment capacity in rssct experiments was greater for cdp cmc than ccac for nearly all mps in nearly all experiments the exceptions are a few mps that exhibited rather poor removal on both adsorbents the general adsorption inhibition observed for ccac was attributed to direct site competition with l dom and m dom the selective inhibition of anionic mps on ccac was attributed to the abundance of negatively charged l dom and m dom the resilience of cdp adsorbents to fouling in complex matrices was attributed to size exclusion only l dom directly competes with mps for the active sites on cdp adsorbents the selective adsorption inhibition of cationic mps on cdp adsorbents was

18099,the performance of adsorbents for the removal of organic micropollutants mps from water can be influenced by the presence of water matrix constituents the objective of this research was to evaluate the influence of water matrix constituents on the performance of coconut shell activated carbon ccac porous β cyclodextrin polymer cdp and cdp coated on cellulose microcrystal cdp cmc adsorbents mp removals were measured in batch experiments for a mixture of 90 mp at 1 μg l 1 and mp breakthrough was measured in rapid small scale column test rssct experiments for a mixture of 15 mp at 500 ng l 1 all experiments were performed first with nanopure water and subsequently with six different water samples collected from two separate groundwater surface water and wastewater effluent sources the results of batch and rssct experiments demonstrate more rapid adsorption kinetics and less adsorption inhibition in the presence of matrix constituents for cdp adsorbents relative to ccac further the treatment capacity of cdp cmc in the rssct experiments was higher than that of ccac particularly in more complex water matrices statistical analyses were performed to investigate associations between adsorption inhibition among groups of mps and the concentrations of specific water matrix constituents for ccac adsorption inhibition was observed for all mps and was primarily attributed to the presence of dissolved organic matter with molar weight less than 1000 da for cdp adsorbents adsorption inhibition was primarily observed for cationic mps and was attributed to the screening of the negative surface charge of cdp by inorganic ions in water samples with high ionic strength these data further demonstrate the value of cdp as an alternative adsorbent to ccac for the removal of mps during water and wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords micropollutant adsorption breakthrough fouling activated carbon β cyclodextrin polymer abbreviations ac

referred to as micropollutants mps due to their typical occurrence at trace levels in the environment carpenter and helbling 2018 carpenter et al 2019 schwarzenbach et al 2006 because of their diverse physicochemical properties and low concentrations mp removal is generally limited in conventional water and wastewater treatment processes benner et al 2013 activated carbon ac adsorption has emerged as a leading technology and has been demonstrated to effectively remove a broad spectrum of mps bonvin et al 2015 kennedy et al 2015 margot et al 2013 however limitations of ac adsorption arise from relatively slow kinetics bonvin et al 2015 poor removal of polar mps kovalova et al 2013 and fouling by dissolved organic matter dom and other matrix constituents kennedy and summers 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 further the expenses of applying ac in water and wastewater treatment processes are generally high because of the significant energy required for ac regeneration margot et al 2013 to address these deficiencies alternative adsorbents such as porous β cyclodextrin polymers cdps alsbaiee et al 2015 ling et al 2017 have been developed for potential implementation in batch adsorption followed by ultrafiltration ba uf processes more recently cdps coated on cellulose microcrystals cdp cmc have been developed by polymerizing cdps in the presence of cmcs resulting in adsorbents with larger particle sizes amenable for packed bed filtration pbf processes alzate sánchez et al 2019 the fouling of ac by water matrix constituents is perhaps the major concern for mp removal in both ba uf and pbf processes bonvin et al 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 mps adsorb to ac materials primarily by means of hydrophobic interactions though charged functional groups on ac surfaces can also facilitate the adsorption of ionic mps by means of electrostatic interactions ling et al 2019 as ac adsorption is non selective both mps and dom which is generally present in all waters from either natural or anthropogenic sources can be adsorbed by means of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions according to previous research the adsorption of mps on ac can be inhibited through direct site competition with low and medium molecular weight mw dom that is similar in size and charge state to mps and through pore blockage caused by high mw dom ding et al 2008 li et al 2003 newcombe et al 1997 in addition the presence of inorganic ions in the bulk water can diminish the surface charge of ac by screening local ionizable functional groups thereby limiting their electrostatic interactions with mps newcombe and drikas 1997 summers and roberts 1988 for example the coconut shell ac ccac employed in this study exhibits a positive surface charge at neutral ph de ridder et al 2013 therefore the adsorption of anionic mps on ccac could be inhibited by negatively charged low mw dom through direct site competition and or by the presence of inorganic anions that screen the positive surface charge newcombe and drikas 1997 summers and roberts 1988 though the mechanisms of adsorption inhibition on ac adsorbents have been evaluated in previous research how adsorbent fouling will influence the removal of diverse groups of mps in ba uf and pbf processes remains less clear because previous studies were either performed with very limited types of mps e g neutral mps or with high concentrations of mps that were not environmentally relevant bonvin et al 2015 kennedy and summers 2015 sgroi et al 2018 zietzschmann et al 2016 in our previous study a tetrafluoroterephthalonitrile tfn crosslinked cdp exhibited rapid adsorption kinetics and efficient removal of a variety of mps and was not fouled by humic acid a surrogate for dom or sodium chloride a surrogate for inorganic ions demonstrating its potential as an alternative adsorbent to ac for mp removal during water and wastewater treatment ling et al 2017 mp adsorption on cdp relies on the formation of host guest complexes in the 0 78 nm interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomer which requires adsorbates to fit within a certain size range ling et al 2019 2017 additionally cdp exhibits a negative surface charge at neutral ph klemes et al 2018 the specific role that the negative surface charge of cdp plays in mp adsorption is unknown though enhanced adsorption affinity for cationic mps has been observed ling et al 2017 while cdp is not fouled by humic acid and nacl we could expect that smaller dom molecules could inhibit mp uptake through direct site competition by binding in the interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomer further positively charged dom and the presence of inorganic cations could screen the negative surface charge of cdp thereby lowering the adsorption affinity for cationic mps to further our understanding of the fouling of ccac and cdp by natural matrix constituents we designed experiments to explore the removal of mps by means of ccac and cdp adsorption in environmentally derived water samples with varying types and amounts of dom and inorganic ions the objectives of the research were to 1 benchmark the performance of ccac and cdp in simulated ba uf processes with water samples from six different sources with 90 mps 2 benchmark the performance of ccac and cdp cmc in rapid small scale column test rssct experiments that simulate pbf processes with water samples from different sources with 15 mps and 3 identify the water matrix constituents contributing most to adsorption inhibition on ccac cdp and cdp cmc our results demonstrate less adsorption inhibition and greater treatment capacity for cdp adsorbents relative to ccac we also identified specific water matrix constituents that are associated with the adsorption inhibition of certain groups of mps these data significantly improve our understanding of the mechanisms by which ccac and cdp adsorbents remove mps from water and support the continued evaluation of cdps as alternative adsorbents for use in ba uf or pbf processes during water and wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and adsorbents all experiments with nanopure water were performed at ph 6 7 the ph was confirmed to be stable by measuring ph throughout each experiment all experiments with real water samples were performed at the original ph of the water samples without adjustment we selected 90 and 15 mps for batch and rssct experiments respectively according to their environmental relevance bradley et al 2017 carpenter and helbling 2018 pochodylo and helbling 2017 their broad range of physiochemical properties and previous studies exploring their adsorption on ccac and cdp ling et al 2019 2017 rossner et al 2009 a list of all mps along with their measured logk d values for ccac and cdp and charge state at neutral ph is provided in table s1 of the supplementary data sd all logk d values were measured experimentally in a previous study for each mp adsorbent pair ling et al 2019 we selected 44 isotope labeled internal standards iliss to account for the matrix effects of different water samples on the quantification of mps a list of all iliss along with their suppliers is provided in table s2 of the sd the preparation of stock solutions for each mp and two analytical mixtures containing the 90 and 15 mps were performed as previously described li et al 2018 for batch experiments ccac and cdp adsorbents were prepared and synthesized according to previously established methods alsbaiee et al 2015 ling et al 2017 briefly the ccac is commercially available aquacarb 1230c westates carbon siemens roseville mn and has an average particle size of 850 μm the as synthesized cdp has an average particle size on the order of 50 60 μm to increase the similarity in particle size between the ccac and cdp the ccac was pulverized with a mortar and pestle until 95 mass passed a 74 μm sieve 200 u s mesh for rssct experiments the ccac was pulverized with a mortar and pestle to achieve an average particle diameter of approximately 125 μm with 100 200 u s standard mesh kennedy and summers 2015 the cdp cmc with an average particle diameter of approximately 125 μm was synthesized according to a previously published method alzate sánchez et al 2019 the particle size surface area and porosity for these adsorbents were previously reported and are provided in table s3

benchmarked each water sample was characterized for its ph dissolved organic carbon doc a surrogate measurement for dom concentration total dissolved solids tds concentration conductivity and inorganic ion concentrations using standard methods baird et al 2017 further to investigate the effect of dom size on mp adsorption we characterized the mw distribution of dom in each water sample through high performance size exclusion chromatography hpsec followed by total organic carbon toc analysis more details are provided in the sd including a description of our procedure and an example chromatogram provided in fig s1 all water samples were pre filtered with a 47 mm gf f glass fiber membrane whatman and a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone syringe filter successively to remove suspended solids before they were employed in adsorption experiments knappe et al 1997 zietzschmann et al 2016 2 3 batch experiments batch experiments to evaluate the fouling of ccac and cdp in ba uf processes were performed in 100 ml of water in 125 ml glass erlenmeyer flasks with magnetic stir bars on a multi position stirrer vwr with a stirring rate of 400 revolutions per minute rpm at 23 c mps were spiked to generate an additional concentration of each adsorbate of 1 μg l 1 to any background concentration of the mps that may have been present experiments investigating ccac and cdp were both performed at an adsorbent dose of 10 mg l 1 these adsorbate and adsorbent doses were selected according to previous research investigating mp removal by ccac and cdp adsorbents ling et al 2019 2017 and previous research regarding the application of ac in ba uf processes bonvin et al 2015 the restoration of the dried adsorbents was performed as previously described to create a suspension of each adsorbent ling et al 2017 briefly 10 mg of adsorbent was added to a 20 ml amber vial containing nanopure water 10 ml to yield a 1 g l suspension the suspension was mixed with a vortex mixer fisher scientific for 30 s sonicated for 1 min to break small aggregates and then stirred on a multiposition stirrer for 30 min at 360 rpm following this restoration procedure appropriate volumes of water samples the analytical mp mixture 90 mps each mp at 100 μg l 1 and the adsorbent suspension 1 g l were added to each flask successively samples were collected in 8 ml volumes after 1 h of contact time and filtered through a 0 22 μm pvdf syringe filter restek this contact time was selected according to previous research exploring mp removal by ccac and cdp adsorbents and typical hydraulic retention times in ba uf processes bonvin et al 2015 ling et al 2019 2017 control experiments to account for other mp losses were performed under the same conditions with no addition of adsorbent all experiments were performed in triplicate the samples were analyzed by means of high performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry hplc ms ms to determine the concentration of each mp in the aqueous phase the removal efficiency of each mp was determined by the following equation equation 1 r m p c 0 c t c 0 100 where r mp is the percent removal of each mp c 0 ng l 1 is the average concentration of a mp in the samples of the control experiments c t ng l 1 is the concentration of a mp in the liquid phase at sampling time t we defined a fouling scale index fsi as a metric to quantify the extent of adsorption inhibition for each mp in each experiment relative to the adsorption in nanopure water the fsi for batch experiments was determined by the following equation equation

column restek with an inside diameter of 0 4 cm a column length of 3 cm and stainless steel frits was employed as the host of packed bed adsorption materials a shimadzu lc 20ad pump with parallel double micro plunger was employed to deliver a constant flow rate of 1 ml min 1 of feed solution for all rssct experiments all rssct experiments were performed with a simulated empty bed contact time ebct of 9 6 min the ccac and cdp cmc tested in the column experiments both had an average particle size of 125 μm the flow rates particle sizes and the dimensions of the rssct column were determined according to the constant diffusivity approach crittenden et al 1991 1986 which has been successfully applied in previous research to simulate pilot scale mp breakthrough knappe et al 1997 detailed information on the rssct experiments and the simulated column can be found in table s4 of the sd we note that rssct experiments were selected as a test system to compare the performance of ccac and cdp cmc under uniform experimental conditions similar to a previous study employing rssct to evaluate the potential of ion exchange resins for the removal of perfluoroalkyl acids schaefer et al 2019 robust extrapolation of the results from the rssct experiments to the simulated system would require further validation particularly for the cdp cmc adsorbent all natural water samples were pre filtered with a 47 mm gf f glass fiber membrane whatman and a 0 45 μm polyethersulfone syringe filter to remove suspended solids then the analytical mp mixture 15 mps each mp at 100 μg l 1 was spiked into each water sample to generate an additional concentration of each mp at 500 ng l 1 to any background concentration of the mps that may have been present though the designed dimensions of the rssct columns for both materials are identical due to their different densities the mass of ccac and cdp cmc packed into the columns to achieve a 1 cm bed depth are 85 mg and 65 mg per column respectively the rssct columns were run continuously until all 15 mps exhibited over 10 breakthrough or the predetermined 60 000 bed volumes of treatment were achieved we selected 60 000 bed volumes of treatment as a conservative threshold for the economical usage of ccac or cdp cmc for drinking water production which is often cited as 15 000 bed volumes of treatment kennedy et al 2015 samples were collected in 8 ml volumes on an hourly basis and filtered through a 0 22 μm pvdf syringe filter before they were analyzed by means of hplc ms ms to confirm that influent concentrations of all mps remained constant throughout each rssct experiment samples were collected at the influent of the column every 24 h for each test these samples were also filtered and analyzed by means of the same method the adsorbent use rate of ccac and cdp cmc for each mp was determined by the following equation equation 3 a d s o r b e n t u s e r a t e ρ a d s o r b e n t b v 10 where bv 10 is the 10 breakthrough bed volumes of each mp on each adsorbent in each water matrix and ρ adsorbent is the density of each adsorbent mg l 1 the fsi for rssct experiments was determined by the following equation equation 4 f o u l i n g s c a l e i n d e x b v 10 i n n p b v 10 i n a w a t e r s a m p l e b v 10 i n n p 100 we selected bv 10 as the metric to evaluate adsorption inhibition based on previous research kennedy and summers 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 2 5 analytical methods the quantification of analytes in samples from the batch experiments and rssct experiments was performed by means of hplc ms ms qexactive thermofisher scientific the analytical method is described in the sd and analytical details used for the detection and quantification of each analyte can be found in table s5 of the sd 3 results and discussion 3 1 water characterization the six environmentally derived water samples were selected for their diverse matrix compositions and their relevance for water and wastewater treatment each water sample was characterized for general water quality parameters including ph doc concentration a surrogate measurement for dom conductivity tds concentration and the concentrations of several target inorganic ions all water characterization data are provided in table 1 the ph of the six water samples were all between 8 1 and 8 3 which is consistent with ph measurements of water samples from the same region reported in previous research carpenter et al 2019 due to the minor ph differences among these water samples no further insights can be achieved into the impacts of ph on mp removal by ccac and cdp adsorbents in these water samples however it is worth noting that mp removal by cdp can be enhanced at ph values lower than 5 li et al 2018 the conductivity and tds measurements generally demonstrate increasing ionic strength from the relatively clean groundwater matrices to the more complex surface water and wastewater effluent matrices the concentrations of several target inorganic ions also demonstrate an expected increase from groundwater to wastewater with a couple of notable exceptions the nitrate no3 concentration was highest in gw2 and sulfate so4 2 magnesium mg2 and calcium ca2 concentrations were more uniform across the water samples the remaining data in table 1 provide the characterization results of the dom mw distributions for each water sample the concentrations of dom i e unfractionated water samples in all water samples fit well into the respective typical ranges of dom in groundwater surface water and wastewater effluent sgroi et al 2018 thurman et al 1982 wagoner et al 1997 with one exception the dom concentration in sw2 was anomalously high we note that the water collected from this site was rather turbid and contained some algae and other planktonic organisms the lowest dom concentrations were measured in the groundwater samples and higher concentrations were measured in surface water and wastewater effluent similar trends were noted among the concentrations of dom fractions with different mw l dom m dom and h dom represent the dom fractions with mw less than 600 da between 600 and 1000 da and over 1000 da respectively it is worth noting that much of the dom measured in sw2 is contained in the largest h dom size bin and that sw2 actually had the lowest l dom concentration 0 33 mg l 1 among the water samples finally the sum of the three dom concentrations measured for the three size bins is consistent with the dom concentrations measured in the original water samples demonstrating the robustness and reliability of the hpsec method employed in this study 3 2 batch experiments of the 90 mps employed in the batch experiments eleven responded erratically to either the experimental poor repeatability or analytical conditions poor limits of quantification therefore we report data from the batch experiments for 79 of the 90 mps we first calculated the removal of each mp r mp on each adsorbent in each water sample after 1 h of contact time as described in equation 1 the data are provided in tables s6 and s7 and the results are summarized in fig 1 which provides plots of r mp on each adsorbent in each real water sample versus the r mp on each adsorbent in nanopure water data for ccac are provided in fig 1a for groundwater fig 1c for surface water and fig 1e for wastewater effluent analogous plots for cdp are provided in fig 1b d and 1f mp removal on ccac was generally good after 1 h of contact time but adsorption was inhibited in real water matrices relative to nanopure water the degree to which r mp was inhibited increased from groundwater to surface water to wastewater effluent for example whereas 75 gw1 and 74 mps gw2 exhibited more than 50 removal in groundwater only 11 ww1 and 2 mps ww2 exhibited more than 50 removal in wastewater effluent among groups of mps delineated by their charge matrix constituents had the largest effect on the r mp of anionic mps but effected mps in other charge groups to varying extents regardless of their charge mp removal on cdp was more variable than on ccac after 1 h of contact time with 34 mps exhibiting less than 20 removal in nanopure water reflecting the greater selectivity of mp adsorption on cdp the mps that were removed to less than 20 in nanopure water were mostly anionic mps or small and neutral mps in agreement with our previous study ling et al 2017 r mp was inhibited to some extent for cdp in real water matrices relative to nanopure water though the extent of adsorption inhibition was less than what was observed for ccac for example of the 45 mps that were removed to greater than 20 by cdp in nanopure water 34 in gw1 and 33 in gw2 30 in sw1 and 40 in sw2 and 21 in ww1 and 28 in ww2 were removed to greater than 20 in real water matrices it is also clear from the data in fig 1 that the adsorption of cationic and zwitterionic mps on cdp is selectively inhibited in the real water samples the adsorption of neutral mps is generally not inhibited in groundwater or surface water and is inhibited only to a limited extent in wastewater effluent whereas anionic mps exhibit low affinity for cdp in all water matrices including nanopure water to explore the selective adsorption inhibition of cationic mps further we calculated the fraction of the adsorption affinity k d values that could be explained by electrostatic interactions by using the coefficients of a previously described qsar model ling et al 2019 we found a significant positive association permutation test p 0 01 between the extent of adsorption inhibition for each cationic mp and the fraction of its adsorption affinity attributed to electrostatic interactions for example the k d values for cationic mps morphine and albuterol on cdp are almost entirely explained by molecular descriptors that relate to electrostatic interactions these two mps exhibit the greatest adsorption inhibition in these experiments in contrast acebutolol and metoprolol are cationic mps with k d values that rely more on molecular descriptors related to hydrophobic interactions and these two mps exhibit the least amount of adsorption inhibition in these experiments therefore we attribute the selective inhibition of cationic mps on cdp to a weakening of electrostatic interactions in real water matrices 3 3 rssct experiments breakthrough curves we selected 15 mps 5 cationic 5 anionic and 5 neutral from among the 90 mps studied in the batch experiments to evaluate mp removal and breakthrough in rssct experiments designed to simulate a pbf with an ebct of 9 6 min we performed the rssct experiments with all six real water samples for cdp cmc and with gw1 sw1 and ww1 for ccac breakthrough curves for all 15 mps for all rssct experiments are provided in figures s2 through s7 of the sd and for representative anionic naproxen cationic venlafaxine and neutral acetochlor mps in fig 2 on an experimental time basis and fig s8 on a throughput bed volumes basis data for ccac are provided in fig 2a c and 2e and data for cdp cmc are provided in fig 2b d and 2f all three mps exhibit gradual breakthrough on ccac in gw1 and sw1 and relatively steep breakthrough in ww1 and the shapes of the breakthrough curves for each mp in each water matrix are similar this observation corroborates previous findings that mp uptake on ccac is relatively slow and non selective ling et al 2017 specifically each mp exhibits continuously increasing breakthrough in gw1 and sw1 until about 50 breakthrough is achieved after 120 h complete breakthrough is observed relatively quickly for each mp in ww1 with over 80 breakthrough observed in less than 20 h the similar shapes of the breakthrough curves in gw1 and sw1 suggest similar adsorption kinetics and capacity of ccac in these matrices while the rapid breakthrough of each mp in the ww1 experiments demonstrate that the fouling caused by the ww1 matrix reduced the adsorption capacity of ccac to a great extent as demonstrated in a previous study dom with mw less than 1000 da can inhibit mp adsorption on ac adsorbents to a much greater extent than dom with mw greater than 1000 da kennedy and summers 2015 therefore the rapid breakthrough can be attributed to the significantly elevated concentration of lm dom in ww1 in contrast to the rssct experiments with ccac all mps exhibited steep breakthrough in the rssct experiments conducted with cdp cmc steep breakthrough curves in pbf processes are a general indication of rapid adsorption kinetics which is a known feature of mp adsorption on cdp and cdp cmc alzate sánchez et al 2019 ling et al 2017 importantly these data demonstrate that rapid adsorption kinetics are preserved in column experiments and in the presence of matrix constituents rapid adsorption kinetics coupled with the high adsorption capacity of cdp adsorbents can be leveraged in pbf processes to increase the throughput of water treatment and the volume of water treated per day when the objective is to achieve low mp concentrations in the effluent further rapid adsorption translates to narrow mass transfer zones within the pbf process implying that only small fractions of unused adsorbent will be wasted when a process reaches its treatment capacity the data in fig 2 also show that the breakthrough time for each of the three mps is shorter in the wastewater effluent matrices than in the groundwater and surface water matrices which could be attributed to the elevated concentration of l dom and the enhanced ionic strength in ww1 and ww2 see further discussion in the following this effect is most pronounced for the cationic mp fig 2d in agreement with observations in batch experiments 3 4 rssct experiments treatment capacity the operational capacity of a pbf process is typically evaluated based on the number of bed volumes treated before a certain level of contaminant breakthrough kennedy et al 2015 kennedy and summers 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 in this study we used the breakthrough curves to calculate the number of bed volumes treated before 10 contaminant breakthrough bv 10 as has been done before in evaluating mp removal in rssct experiments kennedy and summers 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 the bv 10 values of each mp on each adsorbent in each water sample is provided in table s8 and are summarized in fig 3 considering the different densities of ccac 567 g l and cdp cmc 433 g l the use rate of each adsorbent to achieve bv 10 for each mp in each water matrix is also provided in table s9 to provide further insights into the relative adsorption capacity of ccac and cdp cmc in pbf processes the bv 10 values of all 15 mps on ccac were over 60 000 bed volumes in nanopure water table s8 but decreased substantially in real water matrices the degree of bv 10 reduction increased from groundwater to surface water to wastewater effluent in agreement with adsorption inhibition observations in batch experiments though 10 mps exhibited bv 10 values of more than 5 000 bed volumes in gw1 no mp exhibited bv 10 values of more than 5 000 bed volumes in ww1 in addition the bv 10 values of anionic mps were inhibited to the greatest extent whereas cationic and neutral mps exhibited varying degrees of inhibition these data are also consistent with our observations in batch experiments in contrast to the uniformly high bv 10 values of all mps on ccac in nanopure water mp bv 10 values on cdp cmc were more variable in nanopure water due to the selective adsorption on cdp table s8 all 5 cationic mps exhibited bv 10 values over 60 000 bed volumes which we attribute to the negative surface charge of cdp facilitating the adsorption of cationic mps through electrostatic interactions klemes et al 2018 ling et al 2019 whereas anionic and neutral mps exhibited varying treatment capacity interestingly three anionic mps diclofenac gemfibrozil and naproxen and one neutral mp isoproturon which were poorly removed by cdp in batch experiments exhibit high bv 10 values over 55 000 bed volumes on cdp cmc in nanopure water this could be attributed to differences between the morphology of cdp and cdp cmc and or the distinct hydraulic conditions in batch and rssct experiments the inhibition of mp adsorption capacity on cdp cmc was also observed to some extent in real water matrices of the 10 mps that exhibited bv 10 values over 10 000 in nanopure 7 7 and 5 mps exhibit bv 10 values over 10 000 in gw1 sw1 and ww1 respectively additionally as observed in batch experiments the bv 10 values of cationic mps were inhibited to the greatest extent whereas neutral and anionic mps exhibited moderate to limited inhibition in real water matrices though the mp removal on cdp cmc was inhibited in real water matrices the extent of inhibition was lower compared to that on ccac as shown in fig 3 for most mps the bv 10 values on cdp cmc were much higher than that on ccac with the exception of a few anionic and neutral mps in gw1 which exhibited rather poor performance on both types of adsorbents these data corroborate our observations in batch experiments that the extent of mp adsorption inhibition on cdp adsorbents is not as relevant to the complexity of the water matrix as that on ccac demonstrating less adsorption inhibition for cdp relative to ccac further the great treatment capacity of cdp cmc is especially notable when we consider that there was nearly 25 less mass of cdp cmc in the rssct experiments when compared to ccac due to the differences in their densities the data in table s9 demonstrate that the use rate of each adsorbent to achieve bv 10 for each mp in each water matrix is frequently much lower for cdp cmc compared to ccac furthermore approximately 77 of the mass of cdp cmc is attributed to the cellulose microcrystals which have been shown not to contribute to mp removal alzate sánchez et al 2019 3 5 factors contributing to adsorbent fouling the overall extent to which an adsorbent is fouled is generally determined by the composition of matrix constituents in real water matrices to enable further insights on the fouling mechanisms of ccac and cdp we used the r mp data and the bv 10 values to calculate the fsi for each adsorbent in each water sample as described in equations 2 and 3 for batch and rssct experiments respectively because the inhibition of mp adsorption depended on the charge state of mps the fsi of each adsorbent was calculated both for all mps and for mps grouped by their charge states the fsi of each adsorbent in each water sample for batch experiments are summarized in fig 4 and tables s10 and s11 for batch and rssct experiments respectively to quantitatively interpret fouling mechanisms on both adsorbents we investigated the associations between the fsis calculated with mps in different charge groups and all water quality parameters by means of pearson correlations table s12 as presented in fig 4a and tables s10 and s11 the fouling of ccac increases with the complexity of the water matrix i e the fractions of dom and the ionic strength the general adsorption inhibition observed for all mps could be attributed to direct site competition with l dom or m dom and or pore blockage caused by h dom ding et al 2008 li et al 2003 newcombe et al 1997 as seen in the pearson correlation coefficients provided in table s12 all groups of mps exhibit the strongest positive correlations 0 81 p value 0 05 with the concentrations of lm dom i e l dom plus m dom indicating that direct site competition caused by lm dom could be a major contributor to the general adsorption inhibition observed for all mps on ccac further mp removal across all groups was only weakly correlated with h dom concentration 0 27 p value 0 50 indicating that pore blockage caused by h dom might not be a relevant fouling mechanism for ccac it is also worth noting that the anomalously high h dom concentration measured in sw2 did not result in a significant performance difference further demonstrating that pore blockage caused by h dom might not be a relevant fouling mechanism for ccac these findings agree with observations in previous research that dom with mw less than 1000 da inhibits mp adsorption on ac adsorbents to a much greater extent than dom with mw greater than 1000 da kennedy and summers 2015 zietzschmann et al 2016 the fouling of ccac is greatest for anionic mps fig 4a tables s8 and s9 the selective adsorption inhibition observed for anionic mps could be attributed to direct site competition with negatively charged l dom or m dom and or to the presence of inorganic anions which screen the positive surface charge of ccac newcombe 1999 summers and roberts 1988 as seen in the correlation coefficients provided in table s12 the fsi calculated with the group of anionic mps exhibit a strong positive correlation 0 85 p value 0 05 with the concentrations of lm dom indicating that lm dom could be a major contributor to the selective adsorption inhibition of anionic mps on ccac further the group of anionic mps exhibit the weakest positive correlation with ionic strength when compared to the other groups of mps as a result although the pearson correlation coefficients alone cannot disentangle the effects of direct site competition and surface charge screening on the selective adsorption inhibition for anionic mps our data suggest that direct site competition with negatively charged lm dom might play an important role cdp and cdp cmc notably exhibit nearly uniform fsis across the water matrices fig 4b tables s10 and s11 these data indicate greater fouling for cdps relative to ccac in the relatively clean groundwater matrices but less fouling for cdps relative to ccac in the more complex surface water and wastewater effluent matrices the data also show significant adsorption inhibition for the group of anionic mps but that result must be interpreted with caution the group of anionic mps are not removed to great extents by cdp in nanopure water fig 1 which inevitably led to great variability in the respective fsi so the influence of matrix constituents on that adsorption cannot be reliably assessed as observed in the data from the batch and rssct experiments and corroborated by the fsis provided in fig 4b the extent of fouling on cdps is greatest for cationic and zwitterionic mps we have previously observed enhanced adsorption affinity for cationic mps on cdps ling et al 2017 and hypothesize that the enhanced adsorption inhibition for the groups of cationic and zwitterionic mps may result from the presence of inorganic cations that screen the negative surface charge of cdp as presented in table s12 the fsi calculated with the group of cationic mps exhibits strong positive correlations with ionic strength for cdp 0 88 p value 0 05 and cdp cmc 0 86 p value 0 05 indicating that ionic species could be major contributors to the enhanced adsorption inhibition of cationic and zwitterionic mps on cdp adsorbents however we observed previously that nacl does not result in significant adsorption inhibition ling et al 2017 and the correlation coefficients in table s12 do not allow us to identify specific inorganic ions that contribute the most to the observed adsorption inhibition finally we observed the least amount of adsorption inhibition for the group of neutral mps on cdp adsorbents mp adsorption on cdp is associated with the formation of host guest complexes in the interior cavity of the β cyclodextrin monomers which requires adsorbates to fit within a certain size range ling et al 2019 2017 therefore we expect that neutral mps would compete only with neutral dom species within a certain size range the fsis calculated with the group of neutral mps exhibit strong positive correlations with the concentrations of l dom for cdp 0 94 p value 0 05 and cdp cmc 0 91 p value 0 05 providing quantitative support to this proposed fouling mechanism additionally the fsis calculated with all groups of mps exhibit weak or negative correlations with the concentrations of m dom and h dom agreeing with our expectations that large molecules cannot bind to cdp due to size exclusion ling et al 2019 2017 szejtli 1998 this result is particularly important because it corroborates the adsorption mechanism of cdp adsorbents demonstrated in our previous studies validates our hypothesized fouling mechanism of cdp adsorbents and explains the resilience of cdp adsorbents relative to ccac in more complex water matrices 4 conclusions we measured the removal of 79 mps on ccac and cdp adsorbents in simulated ba uf processes with water samples from six different sources overall the extent of mp removal was greater and more consistent on ccac than on cdp which agrees with our previous study with tfn crosslinked cdps we observed increased adsorption inhibition for ccac as the complexity of the water matrix increased and enhanced adsorption inhibition was noted for anionic mps we observed lower extents of adsorption inhibition for cdp relative to ccac and selective adsorption inhibition for cationic mps we measured the breakthrough curves of 15 mps on ccac and cdp cmc in rssct experiments that simulate pfb processes slow and constant breakthrough was observed for all mps in columns packed with ccac though rapid and early breakthrough was observed for all mps in experiments conducted with wastewater effluent rapid and late breakthrough was observed for all mps in columns packed with cdp cmc demonstrating fast adsorption kinetics and narrow mass transfer zones treatment capacity in rssct experiments was greater for cdp cmc than ccac for nearly all mps in nearly all experiments the exceptions are a few mps that exhibited rather poor removal on both adsorbents the general adsorption inhibition observed for ccac was attributed to direct site competition with l dom and m dom the selective inhibition of anionic mps on ccac was attributed to the abundance of negatively charged l dom and m dom the resilience of cdp adsorbents to fouling in complex matrices was attributed to size exclusion only l dom directly competes with mps for the active sites on cdp adsorbents the selective adsorption inhibition of cationic mps on cdp adsorbents was
