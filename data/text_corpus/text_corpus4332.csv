21660,sloshing of liquid in partially filled tanks under high excitation amplitude is always a complicated phenomenon for shallow water condition this complication arises due to nonlinear behaviour of liquid free surface motion when the excitation amplitude is sufficiently large due to nonlinearity the sloshing resonant frequency also gets affected and so the performance of several devices developed based on linear sloshing concept is disturbed one widely studied and used such device is tuned liquid damper tld in the present study a series of experiments has been conducted to investigate the nonlinear shallow water sloshing in detail experimental tests were carried out for tanks of different base aspect ratios length to width of tank different water depths wide range of excitation amplitudes and frequencies nonlinear characteristics such as frequency jump phenomenon shift in resonant frequency super harmonic resonance responses at higher harmonics and fractional harmonics of forcing frequency have been reported it has been found that the resonant frequency is sensitive to the excitation amplitude and dispersion parameter ratio of water depth to tank length for a tank of large aspect ratio under high excitation amplitude it is also found that the resonance frequency increases about 45 in comparison to the linear sloshing frequency keywords shallow water sloshing nonlinear resonant frequency jump phenomenon super harmonic resonance dispersion parameter 1 introduction sloshing and its effect is associated with several engineering fields liquid motion in large ballast tanks of ships liquid fuel motion in space vehicles trucks transporting liquid and liquid metal cooled reactor vessels in nuclear industry sloshing is often encountered in the field of ocean engineering for instance the roll stabilizer tanks of ships floating protection storage and offloading fpso units with different types of cargo filled with liquids and storage containers used in offshore oil industries sloshing response in shallow liquid tanks may cause large dynamic loads on the tank walls and on the primary structures which may affect the structure in many ways a comprehensive review of sloshing dynamics can be referred in ibrahim 2005 and faltinsen and timokha 2009 shallow water sloshing exhibits different nonlinear phenomena the free surface response abruptly changes between the stable solutions at a certain frequency commonly known as frequency jump phenomenon gardarsson and yeh 2007 it has been experimentally demonstrated that the jump frequency of shallow water sloshing is dependent on forcing amplitude sun 1991 koh et al 1994 reed et al 1998 yu et al 1999 bouscasse et al 2013 hysteresis is another important phenomenon occurs in shallow water sloshing response it represents the history dependence of liquid motion which exhibits a distinct response for the same forcing conditions depending on direction of the frequency tuning lower to resonant frequency or higher to resonant frequency several researchers ockendon and ockendon 1973 2001 have reported the hysteresis effects in sloshing tanks there have been many studies focused on resonant water waves in containers chester 1968 theoretically studied the resonant sloshing and verified the experimental results of fultz 1962 by incorporating the effects of dispersion and dissipation ockendon and ockendon 1973 have theoretically obtained the sloshing frequency response curve similar to that of un damped duffing oscillator and this analogy has also been reported by tadjbakhsh and keller 1960 cox and mortell 1986 have theoretically proved the experimental observation of chester and bones 1968 and illustrated the evolution of two solutions for the fundamental resonance frequency ockendon et al 1986 have studied the resonant shallow water sloshing and showed that the frequency response diagram was similar to that of duffing oscillator many researchers kit et al 1987 hashimoto and sudo 1988 sawada et al 1999 gardarsson and yeh 2007 have reported the shift in first resonant frequency from their experimental investigations even though resonant sloshing tank has adverse effects on structural dynamics it can be intelligently used as liquid dampers for structural vibration control the tlds has been used for vibration control of structures and offshore structures such as fixed offshore platforms lee and reddy 1982 jacket offshore platform jin et al 2007 spar type floating structure ha and cheong 2016 and fpso saravanan and kumar 2019 for enhancing the effectiveness of tld it is required to increase the damping by some means so several researchers warnitchai and pinkaew 1998 biswal et al 2003 tait et al 2005 wei et al 2015 tsao and hwang 2018 liting et al 2019 used energy dissipating devices such as slat screens baffles nets porous media inside the sloshing containers to improve the damping of liquid motion for designing better tlds shallow water tanks can be preferred than the deep tanks due to inherent dissipating mechanisms breaking wave run up liquid impacts on tank walls and roof often in offshore oil and gas industries cargo containers may have different base aspect ratios and so it is of practical importance to study the nonlinear sloshing behaviour for tanks of different aspect ratios lepelletier and raichlen 1988 investigated the nonlinear liquid oscillations in rectangular tanks of two different aspect ratios 2 65 and 9 7916 and found that the jump frequency changes with respect to dispersion parameter yu 1997 conducted experimental study using rectangular tanks of three aspect ratios 1 6502 1 7611 and 2 6865 with different dispersion parameters and had obtained an empirical relation between the jump frequency ratio and the non dimensional excitation amplitude from numerical studies cox et al 2005 have showed that the number of solitons in the resonant sloshing response changes as the tank length is slowly altered faltinsen et al 2006 have recognized that the frequency range for stable wave motion changes considerably even with small perturbations in the aspect ratio from 1 to 1 1 chern et al 2012 have considered four different tank base aspect ratios 10 2 1 1111 and 1 with dispersion parameter 0 1 and reported that the wave regimes were strongly dependent on the aspect ratio although the nonlinear characteristics of shallow water sloshing have been well investigated by means of experiments and numerical models studies on the effect of large amplitude of excitation and liquid depth on shift in resonant frequency and jump frequency are not reported in detail investigations on the influence of tank base aspect ratio and dispersion parameter on free surface response resonant and jump frequencies are also limited further the effect of excitation amplitude on super harmonic resonance and harmonics in the sloshing response is not yet reported in the literature as per author s best knowledge therefore the present experimental study is aimed to investigate the nonlinear sloshing characteristics in seven different water tanks of lengths l 1163 mm 1064 mm 951 mm 844 mm 720 mm 510 mm and 398 mm for a range of excitation amplitudes shake table displacement amplitudes a 2 5 mm 5 mm 15 mm 20 mm 25 mm 30 mm 35 mm 40 mm 45 mm and 50 mm according to authors probably this is the first experimental study conducted on shallow water sloshing for a wide range of excitation amplitudes and a broad range of dispersion parameters from 0 0343 to 0 1256 the main objectives of the present study are as follows to conduct extensive experimental tests for identifying nonlinear resonant frequency shift in resonance frequency and jump frequency of shallow water sloshing tanks under the effect of excitation amplitude water depth and tank base aspect ratio to identify the influence of high excitation amplitude on free surface response harmonics of sloshing and super harmonic resonance to establish the effect of dispersion parameter on resonant and jump frequencies of sloshing for a wide range of excitation amplitudes 2 theoretical background on sloshing frequency using the linear wave theory faltinsen and timokha 2009 for a rectangular tank of length l and water depth h the linear sloshing modal frequencies fn for deep water can be written as in equation 1 in shallow water as h l is very small the approximate relation for f1 from equation 1 can be obtained as in equation 2 further the relationship between f1 and fn for n 1 in shallow water range can be obtained as in equation 3 1 f n 1 2 π g n π l tanh n π h l n 1 2 3 2 lim h l 0 f 1 lim h l 0 1 2 π g π l tanh π h l g h 2 l 3 f n n f 1 for all n 1 from equation 3 it is clear that the shallow water sloshing frequencies are nearly commensurate with the fundamental frequency f1 further it is the fact that the qualitative form of the sloshing response depends mainly on the commensurability of natural frequencies ockendon and ockendon 2001 hence the frequency relation in equation 3 is an essential factor in understanding the nonlinear response of shallow water sloshing for characterizing the nonlinear sloshing frequency bauer 1967 have used perturbation method and derived the amplitude dependent natural frequency of a rectangular liquid system as in equation 4 in this relation η denotes the amplitude of free surface elevation and l denotes the wave length the relation is derived under the hypothesis of potential flow theory and it is valid for nonlinear waves on intermediate and deep water ranges further cassolato et al 2010 have found in their experimental study that relation 4 over predicts the resonant frequency for shallow water sloshing tank 4 f n o n l i n e a r f 1 1 η l 2 π 2 64 9 tanh 4 π h l 12 tanh 2 π h l 2 tanh 2 π h l 5 based on one dimensional gas dynamics analogy to shallow water theory for the case of a compressible flow involving only one spatial variable stoker 1957 have expressed the local speed c of a wave which advances relative to the water as a function of water depth h and free surface elevation from the undisturbed state η as in equation 5 5 c g h η the wave length of the fundamental mode of sloshing motion in a rigid rectangular tank of length l is 2l hence the frequency of sloshing in shallow water tank fshallow can be approximated as follows yu 1997 6 f s h a l l o w c 2 l g h η 2 l g h 2 l 1 η h 7 f s h a l l o w f 1 1 η h for shallow water sloshing equation 7 gives the frequency relation as a function of amplitude of free surface elevation which essentially depends on the forcing amplitude the relation in equation 7 can be used to validate the resonant frequencies measured experimentally from the present study 3 experimental set up and procedure the experiments have been conducted in the dynamics laboratory department of ocean engineering at indian institute of technology madras india to carry out the experimental tests a unidirectional shake table is used to excite the rectangular water tank which is mounted on the shake table the shake table is capable of generating sinusoidal excitation at varying frequencies and amplitudes fig 1 shows the experimental setup along with other required devices a full rectangular tank with internal dimensions of length l 1 163 m width b 0 288 m and height h 0 375 m is shown in fig 1 and the tank is prepared of acrylic material with 12 mm thickness to avoid the hydro elastic effects on the tank walls while conducting the experiments several slots are made in the tank walls to change the length of tank by using vertical slabs this helps in preparing the tanks of different aspect ratios the slots for putting the vertical slabs are made small and placed well above the water level so that it should not affect the global sloshing phenomena a twin wire wave probe is used at end of tank as shown in fig 1 the wave probe is placed at 10 mm away from the tank wall to avoid catching of elevated amplitude due to reflection from the wall the wave probe is connected to data acquisition system spider 8 through wave meter the wave meter provides the voltage to wave probe which is captured by data acquisition system the captured voltage by data acquisition system has modulation due to change in water depth in the tank the sampling frequency of data acquisition system is kept at 100 hz to ensure that sharp fluctuation in wave elevation is not missed acquired data from the data acquisition system are stored in the computer the shake table is excited at different amplitudes and frequencies for conducting the various tests as given in table 1 to ensure the accuracy of amplitude and frequency of the shake table a linear variable differential transformer lvdt is also used at the edge of the shake table to catch its excitation amplitude the captured time history ensures the excitation frequency almost all experimental tests are video recorded with frame rate 30 frames per second table 1 shows the experimental test cases which are conducted for different tank lengths with constant tank width b 0 288 m water depths excitation frequencies and amplitudes of shake table displacement low water depth ratio h l or dispersion parameter ensures the test cases are limited to shallow water conditions the acquired data of sloshing amplitude time history of all test cases are processed in matlab using fft fast fourier transform for identifying the frequency contents of the sloshing and also the resonance frequencies the forward sweep test incrementally increasing the excitation frequency from low to beyond primary resonance by discrete test cases is adapted to identify the resonant frequency and jump phenomenon 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 two dimensional sloshing wave systems let β denote the excitation frequency ratio obtained by normalizing the excitation frequency fe by the linear sloshing frequency f1 for larger tank base aspect ratios one can expect two dimensional sloshing waves as the tank length is larger than tank width the natural frequency of free surface oscillation along tank length is far away from the natural frequency of free surface oscillation along tank width as the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of free surface oscillation along tank length only waves along the tank length 2d sloshing are being excited as the excitation frequency varies from very low to high frequency range the following 2d sloshing waves are observed in the present experimental study 1 planar standing wave moves vertically up and down 2 planar progressive waves with breaking and without breaking travelling back and forth in the tank 3 hydraulic jumps travelling back and forth in the tank and impacts on the end walls 4 solitary like waves travelling back and forth in the tank and impacts on the end walls this major classification of shallow water sloshing waves can be compared with the classification reported in faltinsen and timokha 2009 among the above systems the hydraulic jumps and solitary like waves are noticed around the resonant region for the experimental test cases from 1 to 10 shown in table 1 for l b 4 0381 3 6944 3 3020 2 9305 and 2 5 2d sloshing wave systems are observed the images of the 2d wave systems are shown in fig 2 a b c d and e 4 2 three dimensional sloshing wave systems for small aspect ratios nearly square tanks one can expect three dimensional sloshing phenomena in fact for a small aspect ratio the natural frequencies of free surface oscillation along tank length and width become relatively close due to nearly square base predominant sloshing modes along tank length and width simultaneously emerge even if the external excitation directly excites only one mode when the excitation frequency is close to one of the dominant natural frequencies 3d sloshing wave systems emerge this is because of auto parametric interaction between the predominant sloshing modes along tank length and width for l b 1 7708 and 1 3819 under relatively large excitation amplitudes the following 3d sloshing wave systems are observed in the resonant region i diagonal like wave travelling between two opposite corners of the tank ii swirling like wave travelling along the walls of the tank the wave front rotates along the four walls table 2 shows the parameter range for diagonal wave in case of l b 1 7708 and h l 0 0980 similarly table 3 shows the parameter range for existence of diagonal and swirling like wave in case of l b 1 3819 and h l 0 1256 further it should be noted that even for tanks of small aspect ratios l b 1 7708 and 1 3819 under relatively small excitation amplitudes the three dimensional wave systems do not exist at all the reason is that the auto parametric interaction between the sloshing modes is poor for relatively small excitation amplitudes in order to visualize the 2d and 3d sloshing responses the images of different wave systems are shown in fig 2 for the tank of aspect ratio l b 3 6944 under small excitation amplitude a l 0 00469 fig 2 a b and c shows that the planar standing wave planar progressive waves and solitary like wave respectively for l b 3 6944 and a l 0 04699 fig 2 d and e shows that hydraulic jump and solitary like wave breaking near the wall respectively for the tank of aspect ratio l b 1 3819 and a l 0 12562 fig 2 f shows the local 3d effects near the wall for l b 1 3819 and a l 0 06281 fig 2 g and h shows the diagonal like wave which travels from one corner to the opposite corner of the tank for l b 1 3819 and a l 0 12562 fig 2 i and j shows that the swirling like response which has wave front travelling along the four walls 4 3 sloshing response in a tank of large base aspect ratio under small excitation amplitude fig 3 shows that the steady state time histories of free surface response denoted as η at different excitation frequencies for the experimental test case no 2 with tank base aspect ratio l b 4 0381 dispersion parameter h l 0 0429 first natural frequency f1 0 3002 hz and non dimensional excitation amplitude a l 0 0043 in fig 3 for β 0 8298 the free surface response is a planar standing wave as the excitation frequency increases β 0 9294 a group of travelling waves is observed the surface profile gets more deformation however the wave form is still periodic and high frequency components emerge which is evident from the multiple peaks present in each cycle of the wave form a further increase in excitation frequency leads to resonance at β 1 0290 where two solitary wave like response develops this is visible while conducting the experiment that only two hump shaped waves travels back and forth in the tank at this frequency ratio the response achieves its maximum amplitude the resonance frequency identified at βresonance 1 0290 further increase in excitation frequency β 1 0953 shows that there is a sudden reduction in the response amplitude a small change in excitation frequency causes drastic change in dynamic response of free surface and this phenomenon is known as frequency jump phenomenon or jump discontinuity gardarsson et al 2007 and the corresponding frequency ratio βjump 1 0953 is denoted as jump frequency ratio the jump phenomenon has been reported by many researchers lepelletier and raichlen 1988 sun 1991 koh et al 1994 reed et al 1998 yu et al 1999 grotle et al 2017 fig 4 shows the fourier amplitude versus frequency content of the signals shown in fig 3 the logarithmic scale is used to represent the fourier amplitudes in the vicinity of resonance it is observed that fe and its positive integer multiples are the dominant response frequencies in the steady state response this is due to the fact that higher natural frequencies fn of shallow water sloshing are nearly commensurate with the fundamental frequency f1 as in equation 3 hence when β close to unity the higher harmonics nfe excite responses at higher natural frequencies fn the similar observation on magnetic fluid sloshing in a rectangular container has been reported by sawada et al 1999 further fig 4 shows that for β 0 8298 the excitation frequency fe is dominant and other frequencies are negligible the excitation frequency and its positive integer multiples also visible in case of β 0 9294 further increase in excitation frequency ratio β 1 0290 shows the maximum energy and so it is identified as the resonance frequency ratio it is seen that even for small excitation amplitude a comparable energy distribution among the higher harmonics can also take place in the resonance zone the same resonance frequency can be referred in time history plots in fig 3 a further increase in excitation frequency β 1 0953 leads to a sudden change in the fourier amplitude envelope for frequency ratios β 1 0953 1 1949 and 1 2615 the excitation frequency is alone dominant and the energy content is drastically reduced 4 4 sloshing response in a tank of large base aspect ratio under high excitation amplitude fig 5 shows the steady state time histories of free surface response of sloshing tank for the experimental case no 2 with l b 4 0381 h l 0 0429 f1 0 3002 hz and a l 0 043 in this case the non dimensional excitation amplitude becomes close to the dispersion parameter for relatively low frequency ratios β 0 7635 and 0 8298 standing wave form and a group of travelling waves are observed respectively as fe increased further a lumped like water mass emerges and travels back and forth in the tank this response is known as hydraulic jump and it breaks approximately in the middle part of the tank the breaking hydraulic jump is noticed for a range of β s from 0 9294 to 1 1949 for relatively high excitation frequency ratios β 1 2615 1 3610 and 1 4274 the sloshing response evolves into a solitary like wave form travelling back and forth in the tank and impacts on the end walls the resonance occurs at βresonance 1 4274 which is much greater than the unity implying that for high excitation amplitude the resonance zone shifts more towards the high frequency range moreover comparison of figs 3 and 5 reveals the effect of excitation amplitude on free surface response fig 6 shows the fourier amplitude of free surface responses plotted in fig 5 as seen in fig 6 for small excitation frequency ratio β 0 7635 the peak is observed only at fe and the contribution of high frequency components is small as fe increases gradually the peaks at multiples of fe are visible in the fourier amplitude plots in general it is noticed that fourier amplitude at low frequency range are of large magnitude than that of high frequency range fourier amplitude plots for β 0 8298 0 9294 1 0290 and 1 1949 have fluctuating envelopes and provide general view of energy distribution over the frequency range the reason for these fluctuating envelopes is the secondary resonance faltinsen and timokha 2009 where one of the multiples of excitation frequency is close to any one of the sloshing modal frequencies for example as in fig 6 for β 1 1949 6fe 2 0928 hz which is close to the eighth modal frequency f8 2 0641 hz similarly 7fe 2 4416 hz is close to f10 2 4224 hz and 8fe 2 7904 hz is close to f12 2 7292 hz the more the closeness the more the energy in the secondary resonance can be noticed similarly the secondary resonance can be noticed in other sub plots further in fig 6 for β 1 0953 1 1949 1 2615 1 3610 and 1 4274 it can be observed that there is considerable contribution of higher harmonics of forcing frequency fe 2fe 7fe and 8fe this infers that energy distribution from low frequency range to high frequency range takes place as fe reaches towards the resonant region the fourier amplitude for βresonance 1 4274 shows the maximum value in comparison to other β s for β 1 5933 though the fourier amplitude has dominant peak at fe it also contains peaks at f1 f3 f5 and f1 fe at high frequency range fourier amplitudes are small it may be because of higher modal frequencies are not close to any of the integer multiples of fe 4 5 sloshing response in a tank of small base aspect ratio under small excitation amplitude the steady state time histories of free surface response in a tank for the experimental case no 12 with l b 1 3819 h l 0 1256 f1 0 8580 hz and a l 0 01256 are shown in fig 7 for relatively small β s 0 4413 0 5573 0 6735 0 7432 and 0 7896 a small amplitude standing wave system has been noticed for increased excitation frequency ratios β 0 8593 and 0 9058 a non breaking progressive wave system emerges at β 0 9755 a beating phenomenon was observed a further increase in excitation frequency ratio β 1 0219 leads to formation of a solitary wave which travels back and forth between the tank walls moreover the resonance can be identified at βresonance 1 08 fig 8 shows that the fourier amplitude of free surface responses plotted in fig 7 for relatively small β s 0 4413 0 5573 0 6735 and 0 7432 the fourier amplitude at f1 is also clearly visible together with the amplitude at fe further increase in excitation frequency shows that fourier amplitude at f1 is not clearly visible this is due to near mergence of fe with f1 for β 0 8593 a secondary resonance due to f3 is observed here 3fe 2 2118 hz is close to f3 2 2082 hz it is further observed that the fourier amplitude at 3fe is little higher than that of fe a peak between fe and 3fe is also visible at 2fe the fourier amplitude at 2fe is obviously lower than 3fe because f3 is nearly matching to 3fe but 2fe is neither close to f2 nor to any other modal frequencies hence there is no significant secondary resonance peak due to f2 exists for β 0 9755 around each primary peak two or more closely spaced frequencies emerge the reason is the beating phenomenon with dominant frequencies fe fb fe fe fb 2fe fb 2fe 2fe fb where fb is the beat frequency of free surface motion as seen in fig 7 further the resonance is identified at the frequency ratio βresonance 1 08 where the fourier amplitude has the maximum value beyond βresonance further increase in fe results in significant decrease in fourier amplitudes 4 6 sloshing response in a tank of small base aspect ratio under high excitation amplitude fig 9 shows the results for the same input parameters as shown in fig 7 but for the excitation amplitude of a l 0 1256 which equals to the dispersion parameter at β 0 5342 a super harmonic resonance can be recognized here 2fe 0 9166 hz which is close to f1 0 8580 hz in this case a single solitary like wave with relatively large amplitude travels back and forth between the tank walls after this resonance a distinct decrease in response amplitude is noticed for β 0 5573 and 0 6155 further increase in excitation frequency ratio β 0 6735 results in a group of travelling waves the breaking hydraulic jump has emerged for frequency ratios β 0 7896 and 0 9058 for β 0 7896 the snapshot of hydraulic jump with spilling breakers is shown in fig 11 further it is also observed from the experiments that the location of breaking shifts from the middle approximately to the end of the tank wall as fe increases in fig 9 for a range of excitation frequency ratios β 1 0219 1 1729 it is visibly noticed that almost the entire bulk of water mass travels back and forth between the tank walls this travelling lumped like water mass with irregular plunging type breaking front impacts and runs up on the tank walls also it is noticed that the diagonal like wave with breaking front develops for a range of frequency ratios β 1 1961 and 1 289 further the swirling like response with breaking front for a range of frequency ratios β 1 3123 and 1 5212 develops for increased excitation frequency ratios β 1 5561 and 1 6142 the swirling like response switches into a nonlinear wave motion with irregular breaking near the tank walls along the plane of excitation the key reason for swirling like wave systems is the tank base aspect ratio the lowest natural frequency 1 1608 hz of free surface oscillation along tank width and the lowest natural frequency 0 8580 hz of free surface oscillation along tank length become relatively close this causes auto parametric interaction between the sloshing modes and so swirling like response emerges fig 10 shows the fourier amplitude of time histories of free surface response as plotted in fig 9 in general fe and its multiples are the dominant response frequencies the fourier amplitude in fig 8 in subplots for β 0 4413 0 5573 0 6735 and 0 7432 displays the peaks at f1 whereas the fourier amplitudes in fig 10 a do not show peaks corresponding to f1 it may be because of shift of the first modal frequency due to nonlinearity developed by high excitation amplitude in fig 10 for frequency ratios β 0 4413 0 4761 0 4993 and 0 5342 the response frequency 2fe is dominant than fe in particular at β 0 5342 the response frequency 2fe is very close to f1 so the energy content at 2fe is larger than those of other response frequencies for better understanding of super harmonic resonance at β 0 5342 the time histories can also be referred in fig 9 a at β 0 4761 4fe 1 6339 hz is very close to f2 1 6066 hz and so the secondary resonance due to second modal frequency is also observed by comparing figs 8 and 10 a for β 0 4413 one can identify the absence of secondary resonance in fig 8 in the other responses the secondary resonance effects can also be seen in fig 10 a so it is confirmed that the excitation frequency and excitation amplitude are responsible for activation of the secondary resonance the fourier amplitude for β 0 6155 1 5561 and 1 6142 as can be seen in fig 10 exhibits the dominant responses at the rational multiples 1 2 3 2 5 2 of fe too this indicates the richness of the harmonics present in the nonlinear sloshing response 4 7 effect of water depth on frequency response of sloshing fig 12 plots the normalised peak sloshing response ηmax h for a range of β here ηmax denotes the maximum free surface elevation the frequency response curves are not symmetric about β 1 and the primary resonance peaks shift towards the high frequency range the curves display the hardening spring type response of shallow water sloshing results have been presented for different water depth ratios h l in case of tanks of different aspect ratios l b 4 0381 3 6944 and 3 3020 for low and high excitation amplitudes in fig 12 a it is seen that the variation in water depth does not influence the response curves significantly for low excitation amplitude a l 0 00429 however the resonance frequency slightly increases with decrease in water depth ratio for high excitation amplitude a l 0 04299 as in fig 12 b the increase in water depth ratio increases the magnitude of response regardless of water depth ratio the jump phenomenon occurs even for a l 0 04299 in fig 12 c the frequency response curve for h l 0 04699 has peak magnitude in the resonance zone than those of other two water depth conditions the same trend is noticed for high excitation amplitude a l 0 04699 as in fig 12 d this implies that increase in water depth ratio does not increase the magnitude of response and it shows a non linear phenomenon which is observed for l b 3 6944 the possible reason is that the effect of filling level varies with excitation amplitude yucen lu et al 2018 referring to fig 12 d the variation in the resonance frequency is not significant for different water depth ratios further a clear jump phenomenon occurs for h l 0 03759 and 0 04699 but it disappears in case of h l 0 05639 the dispersive effect together with nonlinearity due to high excitation amplitude prevents the occurrence of jump phenomenon hence it is apparent that the jump phenomenon depends at least on the tank length l water depth h and excitation amplitude a for relatively small aspect ratio l b 3 3020 and low excitation amplitude a l 0 00525 as in fig 12 e the magnitude of frequency response curves differ significantly in the resonance zone the response curves for high excitation amplitude a l 0 05257 as in fig 12 f differ significantly around the resonance zone however the resonant frequencies do not change remarkably for the two water depth ratios considered 4 8 effect of excitation amplitude on frequency response of sloshing fig 13 shows that the effect of excitation amplitude on frequency response ηmax h of sloshing in tanks of different aspect ratios as the aspect ratio changes for a constant water depth and tank width the dispersion parameter h l will also change from fig 13 it is apparent that the frequency response curves are not symmetric about β 1 and they show hardening spring type nonlinear behaviour of shallow water sloshing for large aspect ratio l b 4 0381 all the response curves exhibit the jump phenomenon as in fig 13 a as l b decreases the jump phenomenon disappears for high excitation amplitudes for l b 1 7708 and 1 3819 a clear jump phenomenon does not occur for high excitation amplitudes as seen in fig 13 e f this is because when the aspect ratio decreases 3d wave motion emerges around the resonance region for instance diagonal and swirling like wave occur for a l 0 07537 and 0 12562 in case of l b 1 3819 regardless of aspect ratio as the excitation amplitude increases the response curves do not follow a smooth pattern and it is evident from the local peaks in fig 13 this is because of sloshing response which shows different wave systems such as planar standing wave planar travelling wave hydraulic jump solitary like wave diagonal and swirling like wave for small l b for different excitation frequencies and amplitudes so the response measured at 10 mm away from the tank wall shows non smooth response curves for large excitation amplitudes interestingly for l b 2 5 1 7708 and 1 3819 as in fig 13 d e f the response curves exhibit the super harmonic resonance around β 0 5 this observation ensures that the super harmonic resonance is an inherent non linear characteristic of shallow water sloshing in case of l b 2 5 the super harmonic resonance is more pronounced for a l 0 06944 in comparison to a relatively low excitation amplitude a l 0 04166 further the super harmonic resonance is not clearly visible for very small excitation amplitude a l 0 01388 for l b 1 3819 the magnitude of response curves in fig 13 f a l 0 07537 and 0 12562 is relatively smaller than those of other tanks the possible reason is the swirling like response around the resonance region and so the surface elevation at tank walls and corners is significantly larger than the other locations but the surface elevation has been measured at 10 mm away from the tank wall and hence the measured amplitude is smaller than the actual one in all above study as shown in fig 13 it is visible that the resonance frequency changes with increase in excitation amplitude also the frequency range for violent sloshing motion enlarges as the excitation amplitude increases from experiments it is observed that the shallow water sloshing exhibits hard spring type nonlinearity and further the resonant frequency and the jump frequency of sloshing increases with increase in excitation amplitude in fact the excitation amplitude causes breaking waves around the resonant region and the period of sloshing decreases with wave breaking the possible reason is the amount of liquid mass participation in the oscillatory motion in case of sloshing tank subjected to small excitation amplitudes the entire mass may not participate in the oscillatory motion a part of liquid mass at the tank bottom will undergo a rigid body motion as the shake table moves back and forth however for a given dispersion parameter h l the effective mass participation for resonant sloshing waves increases with increase in excitation amplitude this observation on effective mass participation has been seen through video experiments similar discussion on mass participation reported in yu et al 1999 4 9 effect of water depth on resonant frequency fig 14 shows the resonance frequency ratio ratio of nonlinear resonant frequency to f1 as a function of a l for different water depths and aspect ratios l b 4 0381 3 6944 and 3 3020 for l b 4 0381 as in fig 14 a irrespective of water depths considered the resonance frequency ratio increases with increase in excitation amplitude however at low and high excitation amplitude ranges it is observed that the resonant frequency ratio clearly increases with decrease in water depth ratio in case of tank with l b 3 6944 as in fig 14 b it is seen that the resonance frequency ratio increases with decrease in water depth ratio at high amplitude range in the low amplitude range the frequency ratios do not show much difference for all three water depth cases but in general the resonance frequency is not significantly affected by small variation in water depth ratios similar phenomena are visible for l b 3 3020 as can be seen fig 14 c for very low water depth ratios the resonant frequency ratio becomes higher in most of the cases however the resonant frequency is not significantly affected by water depths considered for the study 4 10 effect of dispersion parameter on resonant frequency the experiments have been conducted with tanks of different lengths l and water depths h as shown in table 1 for different dispersion parameters h l the measured nonlinear resonant frequency ratio βresonance is plotted as a function of a l in fig 15 with log log scale lepelletier and raichlen 1988 have also reported that the effects of dispersion parameter h l on nonlinear sloshing in rectangular tanks for dispersion parameter h l ranging from 0 03439 to 0 06944 the amplitude dependent resonant frequency curves follow more or less the same trend regardless of h l for very small excitation amplitude the resonant frequency deviates from f1 slightly at high excitation amplitude the nonlinear resonant frequency increases considerably the maximum increase in nonlinear resonant frequency is about 45 from f1 when h l 0 03759 and a l 0 04699 generally it is observed that as h l increases the measured resonant frequency decreases for given excitation amplitude regardless of h l the resonant frequency increases with increase in amplitude in the range of small excitation amplitudes interestingly for h l 0 12562 the corresponding tank base aspect ratio l b 1 3819 close to unity the resonance frequency curve follows a trend that differs from the other cases at high excitation amplitude as in fig 15 the frequency increases with increase in a l up to 0 05 and decreases a bit at 0 06 and then continues to be the same up to 0 12 the reason for this trend is the swirling like wave response around the resonance region for l b 1 3819 and a l ranges from 0 006 up to 0 05 the planar motion along the plane of excitation is predominant and there are no significant 3d effects in the sloshing response however the increase in a l from 0 05 to 0 12 results in diagonal and swirling like wave systems which occur for a range of excitation frequencies around the resonance region due to swirling like response in the vicinity of resonance it is hard to identify the exact resonant frequency from the measured time series for particular excitation amplitude therefore the excitation frequency is identified as a resonant frequency for which the corresponding time signal has the maximum root mean square rms value besides the excitation frequency at which the swirling response switches to a motion along the plane of excitation is identified as the jump frequency 4 11 comparison of measured resonant frequency with theoretical relation the approximate theoretical relation f s h a l l o w f 1 1 η h as in eq 7 is used to compare the measured resonant frequencies the measured value of η is used in eq 7 to get the approximate resonant frequency for all test cases as in table 1 fig 16 compares the measured resonant frequencies with theoretical relation for different values of h l for low value of a l the measured frequencies match very well with the theoretical relation regardless of h l as the excitation amplitude increases gradually the variation between the two curves becomes large the theoretical curves have more fluctuations than the experimental one this is because as the excitation amplitude increases strong nonlinear phenomena such as wave run up breaking hydraulic jump solitary wave and swirling like wave emerge and the corresponding measured surface elevation has fluctuating magnitude which affects the strict monotonic increasing trend in relation 7 even though the agreement between the curves is fairly good the theoretical relation over estimates the resonant frequency at high excitation amplitudes this is because the theoretical relation is derived based on the analogy of one dimensional ideal gas dynamic equations with adiabatic law hence it does not account strong breaking or discontinuity of free surface profile and so damping in the sloshing tank has not been taken into the account therefore the theoretical relation overestimates the resonant frequency than the one measured experimentally 4 12 qualitative comparison with the study of yu 1997 yu 1997 have also studied the nonlinear shallow water sloshing in three different tanks l b 1 6502 1 7611 2 6865 with h l varying from 0 029 to 0 079 for a l ranging from 0 003 to 0 068 and developed an empirical relation for jump frequency the present experimental results are compared with the study of yu 1997 the measured values of jump frequency ratio βjump are plotted as a function of λ a l in fig 17 for the purpose of comparison h l is taken up to 0 06944 and the data of jump frequency ratios of experimental test cases from 1 to 10 as given in table 1 are presented in fig 17 an approximate regression curve for the data of jump frequency ratio is obtained using nonlinear least squares method as in equation 8 yu 1997 have also proposed a regression line as in equation 9 for jump frequency ratio from their experimental study 8 β j u m p 1 959 λ 0 1031 for λ 0 0268 2 214 λ 0 1369 for λ 0 0268 9 β j u m p 1 85 λ 0 095 for λ 0 03 2 89 λ 0 222 for λ 0 03 at low excitation amplitude range the two curves are close to each other however for large excitation amplitudes the deviation between these two curves is slightly high the present proposed curve changes its slope approximately at λ 0 0268 whereas the curve obtained by yu 1997 changes its slope at λ 0 03 the regression lines as in equations 8 and 9 indicate that the jump frequency ratio βjump increases with excitation amplitude the slope of curve becomes large at high excitation amplitude in comparison to low excitation amplitude this is because of strong nonlinear phenomena exist for high excitation amplitude the deviation between the curves in equations 8 and 9 may be due to the variation in water depth tank base aspect ratio and the range of excitation amplitudes adopted in both studies moreover reed et al 1998 have also reported from their experimental studies that when the excitation amplitude goes beyond the value of approximately λ 0 025 the slope of the regression curve increases hence for small excitation amplitudes it is seen that the present experimental results on jump frequency qualitatively agrees with the studies in the literature fig 18 shows the jump frequency ratio as a function of λ a l for all the experimental cases from 1 to 12 as in table 1 for the experimental cases 11 and 12 the corresponding tanks have the aspect ratios l b 1 7708 and 1 3819 respectively the non dimensional excitation amplitude λ a l increases up to 0 1256 and h l rises up to 0 1256 for the case no 12 based on jump frequencies obtained from all test cases a regression curve is proposed as follows in equation 10 10 β j u m p 1 957 λ 0 1035 for the purpose of comparison the best fitted curve as in equation 10 of present experimental results and the regression curve proposed by yu 1997 are plotted in fig 18 it can be seen that the two curves deviate considerably for high excitation amplitudes however in general the data points of jump frequency ratio for higher values of h l fall near or below the fitted curve whereas the jump frequency ratios corresponding to small values of h l lie near or above the fitted curve this implies that as h l decreases the jump frequency increases for given excitation amplitude and this observation also agrees with that of lepelletier and raichlen 1988 5 conclusions the present experimental investigation is an attempt to understand the nonlinear behaviour of sloshing in shallow water tanks identification of resonant frequency under the effect of excitation amplitude is one of the primary goals of the present study the effects of excitation amplitude and dispersion parameter on jump phenomenon have also been highlighted from the study the following important conclusions are made 1 for the tanks of relatively large aspect ratio under high excitation amplitudes shallow water sloshing response develops the planar standing wave planar progressive waves breaking hydraulic jumps solitary like wave in sequence as the excitation frequency increases from very low to high frequency range 2 diagonal like wave and swirling like phenomenon emerge around the resonant region for the tank of small aspect ratio l b 1 3819 under high excitation amplitudes 3 regardless of tank base aspect ratio and excitation amplitude the dominant response frequencies are the excitation frequency and its positive integer multiples 4 the fractional multiples 1 2 3 2 5 2 of excitation frequency have also been excited in case of tank with aspect ratio l b 1 3819 under high excitation amplitude a l 0 12562 5 the occurrence of jump phenomenon of shallow water sloshing depends on both the tank base aspect ratio and excitation amplitude a under small excitation amplitude for tanks with relatively large aspect ratio l b 4 0381 3 6944 and 3 3020 the jump phenomenon is very clear from the frequency response curves b as the excitation amplitude increases the jump phenomenon disappears for the tanks with aspect ratio l b 3 3020 2 9305 2 5 1 7708 and 1 3819 6 increase in excitation amplitude shifts the resonant frequency and also activates the super harmonic resonance further the frequency response curves of shallow water sloshing show the hard spring type nonlinear behaviour the frequency range for violent sloshing motion enlarges as the excitation amplitude increases 7 in the range of high excitation amplitudes as the dispersion parameter increases the resonant frequency decreases for given excitation amplitude 8 at high excitation amplitude a l 0 04699 the resonant frequency increases about 45 in comparison to the linear sloshing frequency f1 for the tank of base aspect ratio l b 3 6944 and dispersion parameter h l 0 03759 9 for small tank base aspect ratio l b 1 3819 and large dispersion parameter h l 0 12562 the resonant frequency curve follows a trend that differs from the other curves due to the occurrence of swirling like phenomenon around the resonance region

21660,sloshing of liquid in partially filled tanks under high excitation amplitude is always a complicated phenomenon for shallow water condition this complication arises due to nonlinear behaviour of liquid free surface motion when the excitation amplitude is sufficiently large due to nonlinearity the sloshing resonant frequency also gets affected and so the performance of several devices developed based on linear sloshing concept is disturbed one widely studied and used such device is tuned liquid damper tld in the present study a series of experiments has been conducted to investigate the nonlinear shallow water sloshing in detail experimental tests were carried out for tanks of different base aspect ratios length to width of tank different water depths wide range of excitation amplitudes and frequencies nonlinear characteristics such as frequency jump phenomenon shift in resonant frequency super harmonic resonance responses at higher harmonics and fractional harmonics of forcing frequency have been reported it has been found that the resonant frequency is sensitive to the excitation amplitude and dispersion parameter ratio of water depth to tank length for a tank of large aspect ratio under high excitation amplitude it is also found that the resonance frequency increases about 45 in comparison to the linear sloshing frequency keywords shallow water sloshing nonlinear resonant frequency jump phenomenon super harmonic resonance dispersion parameter 1 introduction sloshing and its effect is associated with several engineering fields liquid motion in large ballast tanks of ships liquid fuel motion in space vehicles trucks transporting liquid and liquid metal cooled reactor vessels in nuclear industry sloshing is often encountered in the field of ocean engineering for instance the roll stabilizer tanks of ships floating protection storage and offloading fpso units with different types of cargo filled with liquids and storage containers used in offshore oil industries sloshing response in shallow liquid tanks may cause large dynamic loads on the tank walls and on the primary structures which may affect the structure in many ways a comprehensive review of sloshing dynamics can be referred in ibrahim 2005 and faltinsen and timokha 2009 shallow water sloshing exhibits different nonlinear phenomena the free surface response abruptly changes between the stable solutions at a certain frequency commonly known as frequency jump phenomenon gardarsson and yeh 2007 it has been experimentally demonstrated that the jump frequency of shallow water sloshing is dependent on forcing amplitude sun 1991 koh et al 1994 reed et al 1998 yu et al 1999 bouscasse et al 2013 hysteresis is another important phenomenon occurs in shallow water sloshing response it represents the history dependence of liquid motion which exhibits a distinct response for the same forcing conditions depending on direction of the frequency tuning lower to resonant frequency or higher to resonant frequency several researchers ockendon and ockendon 1973 2001 have reported the hysteresis effects in sloshing tanks there have been many studies focused on resonant water waves in containers chester 1968 theoretically studied the resonant sloshing and verified the experimental results of fultz 1962 by incorporating the effects of dispersion and dissipation ockendon and ockendon 1973 have theoretically obtained the sloshing frequency response curve similar to that of un damped duffing oscillator and this analogy has also been reported by tadjbakhsh and keller 1960 cox and mortell 1986 have theoretically proved the experimental observation of chester and bones 1968 and illustrated the evolution of two solutions for the fundamental resonance frequency ockendon et al 1986 have studied the resonant shallow water sloshing and showed that the frequency response diagram was similar to that of duffing oscillator many researchers kit et al 1987 hashimoto and sudo 1988 sawada et al 1999 gardarsson and yeh 2007 have reported the shift in first resonant frequency from their experimental investigations even though resonant sloshing tank has adverse effects on structural dynamics it can be intelligently used as liquid dampers for structural vibration control the tlds has been used for vibration control of structures and offshore structures such as fixed offshore platforms lee and reddy 1982 jacket offshore platform jin et al 2007 spar type floating structure ha and cheong 2016 and fpso saravanan and kumar 2019 for enhancing the effectiveness of tld it is required to increase the damping by some means so several researchers warnitchai and pinkaew 1998 biswal et al 2003 tait et al 2005 wei et al 2015 tsao and hwang 2018 liting et al 2019 used energy dissipating devices such as slat screens baffles nets porous media inside the sloshing containers to improve the damping of liquid motion for designing better tlds shallow water tanks can be preferred than the deep tanks due to inherent dissipating mechanisms breaking wave run up liquid impacts on tank walls and roof often in offshore oil and gas industries cargo containers may have different base aspect ratios and so it is of practical importance to study the nonlinear sloshing behaviour for tanks of different aspect ratios lepelletier and raichlen 1988 investigated the nonlinear liquid oscillations in rectangular tanks of two different aspect ratios 2 65 and 9 7916 and found that the jump frequency changes with respect to dispersion parameter yu 1997 conducted experimental study using rectangular tanks of three aspect ratios 1 6502 1 7611 and 2 6865 with different dispersion parameters and had obtained an empirical relation between the jump frequency ratio and the non dimensional excitation amplitude from numerical studies cox et al 2005 have showed that the number of solitons in the resonant sloshing response changes as the tank length is slowly altered faltinsen et al 2006 have recognized that the frequency range for stable wave motion changes considerably even with small perturbations in the aspect ratio from 1 to 1 1 chern et al 2012 have considered four different tank base aspect ratios 10 2 1 1111 and 1 with dispersion parameter 0 1 and reported that the wave regimes were strongly dependent on the aspect ratio although the nonlinear characteristics of shallow water sloshing have been well investigated by means of experiments and numerical models studies on the effect of large amplitude of excitation and liquid depth on shift in resonant frequency and jump frequency are not reported in detail investigations on the influence of tank base aspect ratio and dispersion parameter on free surface response resonant and jump frequencies are also limited further the effect of excitation amplitude on super harmonic resonance and harmonics in the sloshing response is not yet reported in the literature as per author s best knowledge therefore the present experimental study is aimed to investigate the nonlinear sloshing characteristics in seven different water tanks of lengths l 1163 mm 1064 mm 951 mm 844 mm 720 mm 510 mm and 398 mm for a range of excitation amplitudes shake table displacement amplitudes a 2 5 mm 5 mm 15 mm 20 mm 25 mm 30 mm 35 mm 40 mm 45 mm and 50 mm according to authors probably this is the first experimental study conducted on shallow water sloshing for a wide range of excitation amplitudes and a broad range of dispersion parameters from 0 0343 to 0 1256 the main objectives of the present study are as follows to conduct extensive experimental tests for identifying nonlinear resonant frequency shift in resonance frequency and jump frequency of shallow water sloshing tanks under the effect of excitation amplitude water depth and tank base aspect ratio to identify the influence of high excitation amplitude on free surface response harmonics of sloshing and super harmonic resonance to establish the effect of dispersion parameter on resonant and jump frequencies of sloshing for a wide range of excitation amplitudes 2 theoretical background on sloshing frequency using the linear wave theory faltinsen and timokha 2009 for a rectangular tank of length l and water depth h the linear sloshing modal frequencies fn for deep water can be written as in equation 1 in shallow water as h l is very small the approximate relation for f1 from equation 1 can be obtained as in equation 2 further the relationship between f1 and fn for n 1 in shallow water range can be obtained as in equation 3 1 f n 1 2 π g n π l tanh n π h l n 1 2 3 2 lim h l 0 f 1 lim h l 0 1 2 π g π l tanh π h l g h 2 l 3 f n n f 1 for all n 1 from equation 3 it is clear that the shallow water sloshing frequencies are nearly commensurate with the fundamental frequency f1 further it is the fact that the qualitative form of the sloshing response depends mainly on the commensurability of natural frequencies ockendon and ockendon 2001 hence the frequency relation in equation 3 is an essential factor in understanding the nonlinear response of shallow water sloshing for characterizing the nonlinear sloshing frequency bauer 1967 have used perturbation method and derived the amplitude dependent natural frequency of a rectangular liquid system as in equation 4 in this relation η denotes the amplitude of free surface elevation and l denotes the wave length the relation is derived under the hypothesis of potential flow theory and it is valid for nonlinear waves on intermediate and deep water ranges further cassolato et al 2010 have found in their experimental study that relation 4 over predicts the resonant frequency for shallow water sloshing tank 4 f n o n l i n e a r f 1 1 η l 2

stoker 1957 have expressed the local speed c of a wave which advances relative to the water as a function of water depth h and free surface elevation from the undisturbed state η as in equation 5 5 c g h η the wave length of the fundamental mode of sloshing motion in a rigid rectangular tank of length l is 2l hence the frequency of sloshing in shallow water tank fshallow can be approximated as

surface elevation which essentially depends on the forcing amplitude the relation in equation 7 can be used to validate the resonant frequencies measured experimentally from the present study 3 experimental set up and procedure the experiments have been conducted in the dynamics laboratory department of ocean engineering at indian institute of technology madras india to carry out the experimental tests a unidirectional shake table is used to excite the rectangular water tank which is mounted on the shake table the shake table is capable of generating sinusoidal excitation at varying frequencies and amplitudes fig 1 shows the experimental setup along with other required devices a full rectangular tank with internal dimensions of length l 1 163 m width b 0 288 m and height h 0 375 m is shown in fig 1 and the tank is prepared of acrylic material with 12 mm thickness to avoid the hydro elastic effects on the tank walls while conducting the experiments several slots are made in the tank walls to change the length of tank by using vertical slabs this helps in preparing the tanks of different aspect ratios the slots for putting the vertical slabs are made small and placed well above the water level so that it should not affect the global sloshing phenomena a twin wire wave probe is used at end of tank as shown in fig 1 the wave probe is placed at 10 mm away from the tank wall to avoid catching of elevated amplitude due to reflection from the wall the wave probe is connected to data acquisition system spider 8 through wave meter the wave meter provides the voltage to wave probe which is captured by data acquisition system the captured voltage by data acquisition system has modulation due to change in water depth in the tank the sampling frequency of data acquisition system is kept at 100 hz to ensure that sharp fluctuation in wave elevation is not missed acquired data from the data acquisition system are stored in the computer the shake table is excited at different amplitudes and frequencies for conducting the various tests as given in table 1 to ensure the accuracy of amplitude and frequency of the shake table a linear variable differential transformer lvdt is also used at the edge of the shake table to catch its excitation amplitude the captured time history ensures the excitation frequency almost all experimental tests are video recorded with frame rate 30 frames per second table 1 shows the experimental test cases which are conducted for different tank lengths with constant tank width b 0 288 m water depths excitation frequencies and amplitudes of shake table displacement low water depth ratio h l or dispersion parameter ensures the test cases are limited to shallow water conditions the acquired data of sloshing amplitude time history of all test cases are processed in matlab using fft fast fourier transform for identifying the frequency contents of the sloshing and also the resonance frequencies the forward sweep test incrementally increasing the excitation frequency from low to beyond primary resonance by discrete test cases is adapted to identify the resonant frequency and jump phenomenon 4 experimental results and discussion 4 1 two dimensional sloshing wave systems let β denote the excitation frequency ratio obtained by normalizing the excitation frequency fe by the linear sloshing frequency f1 for larger tank base aspect ratios one can expect two dimensional sloshing waves as the tank length is larger than tank width the natural frequency of free surface oscillation along tank length is far away from the natural frequency of free surface oscillation along tank width as the excitation frequency is close to the natural frequency of free surface oscillation along tank length only waves along the tank length 2d sloshing are being excited as the excitation frequency varies from very low to high frequency range the following 2d sloshing waves are observed in the present experimental study 1 planar standing wave moves vertically up and down 2 planar progressive waves with breaking and without breaking travelling back and forth in the tank 3 hydraulic jumps travelling back and forth in the tank and impacts on the end walls 4 solitary like waves travelling back and forth in the tank and impacts on the end walls this major classification of shallow water sloshing waves can be compared with the classification reported in faltinsen and timokha 2009 among the above systems the hydraulic jumps and solitary like waves are noticed around the resonant region for the experimental test cases from 1 to 10 shown in table 1 for l b 4 0381 3 6944 3 3020 2 9305 and 2 5 2d sloshing wave systems are observed the images of the 2d wave systems are shown in fig 2 a b c d and e 4 2 three dimensional sloshing wave systems for small aspect ratios nearly square tanks one can expect three dimensional sloshing phenomena in fact for a small aspect ratio the natural frequencies of free surface oscillation along tank length and width become relatively close due to nearly square base predominant sloshing modes along tank length and width simultaneously emerge even if the external excitation directly excites only one mode when the excitation frequency is close to one of the dominant natural frequencies 3d sloshing wave systems emerge this is because of auto parametric interaction between the predominant sloshing modes along tank length and width for l b 1 7708 and 1 3819 under relatively large excitation amplitudes the following 3d sloshing wave systems are observed in the resonant region i diagonal like wave travelling between two opposite corners of the tank ii swirling like wave travelling along the walls of the tank the wave front rotates along the four walls table 2 shows the parameter range for diagonal wave in case of l b 1 7708 and h l 0 0980 similarly table 3 shows the parameter range for existence of diagonal and swirling like wave in case of l b 1 3819 and h l 0 1256 further it should be noted that even for tanks of small aspect ratios l b 1 7708 and 1 3819 under relatively small excitation amplitudes the three dimensional wave systems do not exist at all the reason is that the auto parametric interaction between the sloshing modes is poor for relatively small excitation amplitudes in order to visualize the 2d and 3d sloshing responses the images of different wave systems are shown in fig 2 for the tank of aspect ratio l b 3 6944 under small excitation amplitude a l 0 00469 fig 2 a b and c shows that the planar standing wave planar progressive waves and solitary like wave respectively for l b 3 6944 and a l 0 04699 fig 2 d and e shows that hydraulic jump and solitary like wave breaking near the wall respectively for the tank of aspect ratio l b 1 3819 and a l 0 12562 fig 2 f shows the local 3d effects near the wall for l b 1 3819 and a l 0 06281 fig 2 g and h shows the diagonal like wave which travels from one corner to the opposite corner of the tank for l b 1 3819 and a l 0 12562 fig 2 i and j shows that the swirling like response which has wave front travelling along the four walls 4 3 sloshing response in a tank of large base aspect ratio under small excitation amplitude fig 3 shows that the steady state time histories of free surface response denoted as η at different excitation frequencies for the experimental test case no 2 with tank base aspect ratio l b 4 0381 dispersion parameter h l 0 0429 first natural frequency f1 0 3002 hz and non dimensional excitation amplitude a l 0 0043 in fig 3 for β 0 8298 the free surface response is a planar standing wave as the excitation frequency increases β 0 9294 a group of travelling waves is observed the surface profile gets more deformation however the wave form is still periodic and high frequency components emerge which is evident from the multiple peaks present in each cycle of the wave form a further increase in excitation frequency leads to resonance at β 1 0290 where two solitary wave like response develops this is visible while conducting the experiment that only two hump shaped waves travels back and forth in the tank at this frequency ratio the response achieves its maximum amplitude the resonance frequency identified at βresonance 1 0290 further increase in excitation frequency β 1 0953 shows that there is a sudden reduction in the response amplitude a small change in excitation frequency causes drastic change in dynamic response of free surface and this phenomenon is known as frequency jump phenomenon or jump discontinuity gardarsson et al 2007 and the corresponding frequency ratio βjump 1 0953 is denoted as jump frequency ratio the jump phenomenon has been reported by many researchers lepelletier and raichlen 1988 sun 1991 koh et al 1994 reed et al 1998 yu et al 1999 grotle et al 2017 fig 4 shows the fourier amplitude versus frequency content of the signals shown in fig 3 the logarithmic scale is used to represent the fourier amplitudes in the vicinity of resonance it is observed that fe and its positive integer multiples are the dominant response frequencies in the steady state response this is due to the fact that higher natural frequencies fn of shallow water sloshing are nearly commensurate with the fundamental frequency f1 as in equation 3 hence when β close to unity the higher harmonics nfe excite responses at higher natural frequencies fn the similar observation on magnetic fluid sloshing in a rectangular container has been reported by sawada et al 1999 further fig 4 shows that for β 0 8298 the excitation frequency fe is dominant and other frequencies are negligible the excitation frequency and its positive integer multiples also visible in case of β 0 9294 further increase in excitation frequency ratio β 1 0290 shows the maximum energy and so it is identified as the resonance frequency ratio it is seen that even for small excitation amplitude a comparable energy distribution among the higher harmonics can also take place in the resonance zone the same resonance frequency can be referred in time history plots in fig 3 a further increase in excitation frequency β 1 0953 leads to a sudden change in the fourier amplitude envelope for frequency ratios β 1 0953 1 1949 and 1 2615 the excitation frequency is alone dominant and the energy content is drastically reduced 4 4 sloshing response in a tank of large base aspect ratio under high excitation amplitude fig 5 shows the steady state time histories of free surface response of sloshing tank for the experimental case no 2 with l b 4 0381 h l 0 0429 f1 0 3002 hz and a l 0 043 in this case the non dimensional excitation amplitude becomes close to the dispersion parameter for relatively low frequency ratios β 0 7635 and 0 8298 standing wave form and a group of travelling waves are observed respectively as fe increased further a lumped like water mass emerges and travels back and forth in the tank this response is known as hydraulic jump and it breaks approximately in the middle part of the tank the breaking hydraulic jump is noticed for a range of β s from 0 9294 to 1 1949 for relatively high excitation frequency ratios β 1 2615 1 3610 and 1 4274 the sloshing response evolves into a solitary like wave form travelling back and forth in the tank and impacts on the end walls the resonance occurs at βresonance 1 4274 which is much greater than the unity implying that for high excitation amplitude the resonance zone shifts more towards the high frequency range moreover comparison of figs 3 and 5 reveals the effect of excitation amplitude on free surface response fig 6 shows the fourier amplitude of free surface responses plotted in fig 5 as seen in fig 6 for small excitation frequency ratio β 0 7635 the peak is observed only at fe and the contribution of high frequency components is small as fe increases gradually the peaks at multiples of fe are visible in the fourier amplitude plots in general it is noticed that fourier amplitude at low frequency range are of large magnitude than that of high frequency range fourier amplitude plots for β 0 8298 0 9294 1 0290 and 1 1949 have fluctuating envelopes and provide general view of energy distribution over the frequency range the reason for these fluctuating envelopes is the secondary resonance faltinsen and timokha 2009 where one of the multiples of excitation frequency is close to any one of the sloshing modal frequencies for example as in fig 6 for β 1 1949 6fe 2 0928 hz which is close to the eighth modal frequency f8 2 0641 hz similarly 7fe 2 4416 hz is close to f10 2 4224 hz and 8fe 2 7904 hz is close to f12 2 7292 hz the more the closeness the more the energy in the secondary resonance can be noticed similarly the secondary resonance can be noticed in other sub plots further in fig 6 for β 1 0953 1 1949 1 2615 1 3610 and 1 4274 it can be observed that there is considerable contribution of higher harmonics of forcing frequency fe 2fe 7fe and 8fe this infers that energy distribution from low frequency range to high frequency range takes place as fe reaches towards the resonant region the fourier amplitude for βresonance 1 4274 shows the maximum value in comparison to other β s for β 1 5933 though the fourier amplitude has dominant peak at fe it also contains peaks at f1 f3 f5 and f1 fe at high frequency range fourier amplitudes are small it may be because of higher modal frequencies are not close to any of the integer multiples of fe 4 5 sloshing response in a tank of small base aspect ratio under small excitation amplitude the steady state time histories of free surface response in a tank for the experimental case no 12 with l b 1 3819 h l 0 1256 f1 0 8580 hz and a l 0 01256 are shown in fig 7 for relatively small β s 0 4413 0 5573 0 6735 0 7432 and 0 7896 a small amplitude standing wave system has been noticed for increased excitation frequency ratios β 0 8593 and 0 9058 a non breaking progressive wave system emerges at β 0 9755 a beating phenomenon was observed a further increase in excitation frequency ratio β 1 0219 leads to formation of a solitary wave which travels back and forth between the tank walls moreover the resonance can be identified at βresonance 1 08 fig 8 shows that the fourier amplitude of free surface responses plotted in fig 7 for relatively small β s 0 4413 0 5573 0 6735 and 0 7432 the fourier amplitude at f1 is also clearly visible together with the amplitude at fe further increase in excitation frequency shows that fourier amplitude at f1 is not clearly visible this is due to near mergence of fe with f1 for β 0 8593 a secondary resonance due to f3 is observed here 3fe 2 2118 hz is close to f3 2 2082 hz it is further observed that the fourier amplitude at 3fe is little higher than that of fe a peak between fe and 3fe is also visible at 2fe the fourier amplitude at 2fe is obviously lower than 3fe because f3 is nearly matching to 3fe but 2fe is neither close to f2 nor to any other modal frequencies hence there is no significant secondary resonance peak due to f2 exists for β 0 9755 around each primary peak two or more closely spaced frequencies emerge the reason is the beating phenomenon with dominant frequencies fe fb fe fe fb 2fe fb 2fe 2fe fb where fb is the beat frequency of free surface motion as seen in fig 7 further the resonance is identified at the frequency ratio βresonance 1 08 where the fourier amplitude has the maximum value beyond βresonance further increase in fe results in significant decrease in fourier amplitudes 4 6 sloshing response in a tank of small base aspect ratio under high excitation amplitude fig 9 shows the results for the same input parameters as shown in fig 7 but for the excitation amplitude of a l 0 1256 which equals to the dispersion parameter at β 0 5342 a super harmonic resonance can be recognized here 2fe 0 9166 hz which is close to f1 0 8580 hz in this case a single solitary like wave with relatively large amplitude travels back and forth between the tank walls after this resonance a distinct decrease in response amplitude is noticed for β 0 5573 and 0 6155 further increase in excitation frequency ratio β 0 6735 results in a group of travelling waves the breaking hydraulic jump has emerged for frequency ratios β 0 7896 and 0 9058 for β 0 7896 the snapshot of hydraulic jump with spilling breakers is shown in fig 11 further it is also observed from the experiments that the location of breaking shifts from the middle approximately to the end of the tank wall as fe increases in fig 9 for a range of excitation frequency ratios β 1 0219 1 1729 it is visibly noticed that almost the entire bulk of water mass travels back and forth between the tank walls this travelling lumped like water mass with irregular plunging type breaking front impacts and runs up on the tank walls also it is noticed that the diagonal like wave with breaking front develops for a range of frequency ratios β 1 1961 and 1 289 further the swirling like response with breaking front for a range of frequency ratios β 1 3123 and 1 5212 develops for increased excitation frequency ratios β 1 5561 and 1 6142 the swirling like response switches into a nonlinear wave motion with irregular breaking near the tank walls along the plane of excitation the key reason for swirling like wave systems is the tank base aspect ratio the lowest natural frequency 1 1608 hz of free surface oscillation along tank width and the lowest natural frequency 0 8580 hz of free surface oscillation along tank length become relatively close this causes auto parametric interaction between the sloshing modes and so swirling like response emerges fig 10 shows the fourier amplitude of time histories of free surface response as plotted in fig 9 in general fe and its multiples are the dominant response frequencies the fourier amplitude in fig 8 in subplots for β 0 4413 0 5573 0 6735 and 0 7432 displays the peaks at f1 whereas the fourier amplitudes in fig 10 a do not show peaks corresponding to f1 it may be because of shift of the first modal frequency due to nonlinearity developed by high excitation amplitude in fig 10 for frequency ratios β 0 4413 0 4761 0 4993 and 0 5342 the response frequency 2fe is dominant than fe in particular at β 0 5342 the response frequency 2fe is very close to f1 so the energy content at 2fe is larger than those of other response frequencies for better understanding of super harmonic resonance at β 0 5342 the time histories can also be referred in fig 9 a at β 0 4761 4fe 1 6339 hz is very close to f2 1 6066 hz and so the secondary resonance due to second modal frequency is also observed by comparing figs 8 and 10 a for β 0 4413 one can identify the absence of secondary resonance in fig 8 in the other responses the secondary resonance effects can also be seen in fig 10 a so it is confirmed that the excitation frequency and excitation amplitude are responsible for activation of the secondary resonance the fourier amplitude for β 0 6155 1 5561 and 1 6142 as can be seen in fig 10 exhibits the dominant responses at the rational multiples 1 2 3 2 5 2 of fe too this indicates the richness of the harmonics present in the nonlinear sloshing response 4 7 effect of water depth on frequency response of sloshing fig 12 plots the normalised peak sloshing response ηmax h for a range of β here ηmax denotes the maximum free surface elevation the frequency response curves are not symmetric about β 1 and the primary resonance peaks shift towards the high frequency range the curves display the hardening spring type response of shallow water sloshing results have been presented for different water depth ratios h l in case of tanks of different aspect ratios l b 4 0381 3 6944 and 3 3020 for low and high excitation amplitudes in fig 12 a it is seen that the variation in water depth does not influence the response curves significantly for low excitation amplitude a l 0 00429 however the resonance frequency slightly increases with decrease in water depth ratio for high excitation amplitude a l 0 04299 as in fig 12 b the increase in water depth ratio increases the magnitude of response regardless of water depth ratio the jump phenomenon occurs even for a l 0 04299 in fig 12 c the frequency response curve for h l 0 04699 has peak magnitude in the resonance zone than those of other two water depth conditions the same trend is noticed for high excitation amplitude a l 0 04699 as in fig 12 d this implies that increase in water depth ratio does not increase the magnitude of response and it shows a non linear phenomenon which is observed for l b 3 6944 the possible reason is that the effect of filling level varies with excitation amplitude yucen lu et al 2018 referring to fig 12 d the variation in the resonance frequency is not significant for different water depth ratios further a clear jump phenomenon occurs for h l 0 03759 and 0 04699 but it disappears in case of h l 0 05639 the dispersive effect together with nonlinearity due to high excitation amplitude prevents the occurrence of jump phenomenon hence it is apparent that the jump phenomenon depends at least on the tank length l water depth h and excitation amplitude a for relatively small aspect ratio l b 3 3020 and low excitation amplitude a l 0 00525 as in fig 12 e the magnitude of frequency response curves differ significantly in the resonance zone the response curves for high excitation amplitude a l 0 05257 as in fig 12 f differ significantly around the resonance zone however the resonant frequencies do not change remarkably for the two water depth ratios considered 4 8 effect of excitation amplitude on frequency response of sloshing fig 13 shows that the effect of excitation amplitude on frequency response ηmax h of sloshing in tanks of different aspect ratios as the aspect ratio changes for a constant water depth and tank width the dispersion parameter h l will also change from fig 13 it is apparent that the frequency response curves are not symmetric about β 1 and they show hardening spring type nonlinear behaviour of shallow water sloshing for large aspect ratio l b 4 0381 all the response curves exhibit the jump phenomenon as in fig 13 a as l b decreases the jump phenomenon disappears for high excitation amplitudes for l b 1 7708 and 1 3819 a clear jump phenomenon does not occur for high excitation amplitudes as seen in fig 13 e f this is because when the aspect ratio decreases 3d wave motion emerges around the resonance region for instance diagonal and swirling like wave occur for a l 0 07537 and 0 12562 in case of l b 1 3819 regardless of aspect ratio as the excitation amplitude increases the response curves do not follow a smooth pattern and it is evident from the local peaks in fig 13 this is because of sloshing response which shows different wave systems such as planar standing wave planar travelling wave hydraulic jump solitary like wave diagonal and swirling like wave for small l b for different excitation frequencies and amplitudes so the response measured at 10 mm away from the tank wall shows non smooth response curves for large excitation amplitudes interestingly for l b 2 5 1 7708 and 1 3819 as in fig 13 d e f the response curves exhibit the super harmonic resonance around β 0 5 this observation ensures that the super harmonic resonance is an inherent non linear characteristic of shallow water sloshing in case of l b 2 5 the super harmonic resonance is more pronounced for a l 0 06944 in comparison to a relatively low excitation amplitude a l 0 04166 further the super harmonic resonance is not clearly visible for very small excitation amplitude a l 0 01388 for l b 1 3819 the magnitude of response curves in fig 13 f a l 0 07537 and 0 12562 is relatively smaller than those of other tanks the possible reason is the swirling like response around the resonance region and so the surface elevation at tank walls and corners is significantly larger than the other locations but the surface elevation has been measured at 10 mm away from the tank wall and hence the measured amplitude is smaller than the actual one in all above study as shown in fig 13 it is visible that the resonance frequency changes with increase in excitation amplitude also the frequency range for violent sloshing motion enlarges as the excitation amplitude increases from experiments it is observed that the shallow water sloshing exhibits hard spring type nonlinearity and further the resonant frequency and the jump frequency of sloshing increases with increase in excitation amplitude in fact the excitation amplitude causes breaking waves around the resonant region and the period of sloshing decreases with wave breaking the possible reason is the amount of liquid mass participation in the oscillatory motion in case of sloshing tank subjected to small excitation amplitudes the entire mass may not participate in the oscillatory motion a part of liquid mass at the tank bottom will undergo a rigid body motion as the shake table moves back and forth however for a given dispersion parameter h l the effective mass participation for resonant sloshing waves increases with increase in excitation amplitude this observation on effective mass participation has been seen through video experiments similar discussion on mass participation reported in yu et al 1999 4 9 effect of water depth on resonant frequency fig 14 shows the resonance frequency ratio ratio of nonlinear resonant frequency to f1 as a function of a l for different water depths and aspect ratios l b 4 0381 3 6944 and 3 3020 for l b 4 0381 as in fig 14 a irrespective of water depths considered the resonance frequency ratio increases with increase in excitation amplitude however at low and high excitation amplitude ranges it is observed that the resonant frequency ratio clearly increases with decrease in water depth ratio in case of tank with l b 3 6944 as in fig 14 b it is seen that the resonance frequency ratio increases with decrease in water depth ratio at high amplitude range in the low amplitude range the frequency ratios do not show much difference for all three water depth cases but in general the resonance frequency is not significantly affected by small variation in water depth ratios similar phenomena are visible for l b 3 3020 as can be seen fig 14 c for very low water depth ratios the resonant frequency ratio becomes higher in most of the cases however the resonant frequency is not significantly affected by water depths considered for the study 4 10 effect of dispersion parameter on resonant frequency the experiments have been conducted with tanks of different lengths l and water depths h as shown in table 1 for different dispersion parameters h l the measured nonlinear resonant frequency ratio βresonance is plotted as a function of a l in fig 15 with log log scale lepelletier and raichlen 1988 have also reported that the effects of dispersion parameter h l on nonlinear sloshing in rectangular tanks for dispersion parameter h l ranging from 0 03439 to 0 06944 the amplitude dependent resonant frequency curves follow more or less the same trend regardless of h l for very small excitation amplitude the resonant frequency deviates from f1 slightly at high excitation amplitude the nonlinear resonant frequency increases considerably the maximum increase in nonlinear resonant frequency is about 45 from f1 when h l 0 03759 and a l 0 04699 generally it is observed that as h l increases the measured resonant frequency decreases for given excitation amplitude regardless of h l the resonant frequency increases with increase in amplitude in the range of small excitation amplitudes interestingly for h l 0 12562 the corresponding tank base aspect ratio l b 1 3819 close to unity the resonance frequency curve follows a trend that differs from the other cases at high excitation amplitude as in fig 15 the frequency increases with increase in a l up to 0 05 and decreases a bit at 0 06 and then continues to be the same up to 0 12 the reason for this trend is the swirling like wave response around the resonance region for l b 1 3819 and a l ranges from 0 006 up to 0 05 the planar motion along the plane of excitation is predominant and there are no significant 3d effects in the sloshing response however the increase in a l from 0 05 to 0 12 results in diagonal and swirling like wave systems which occur for a range of excitation frequencies around the resonance region due to swirling like response in the vicinity of resonance it is hard to identify the exact resonant frequency from the measured time series for particular excitation amplitude therefore the excitation frequency is identified as a resonant frequency for which the corresponding time signal has the maximum root mean square rms value besides the excitation frequency at which the swirling response switches to a motion along the plane of excitation is identified as the jump frequency 4 11 comparison of measured resonant frequency with theoretical relation the approximate theoretical relation f s h a l l o w f 1 1 η h as in eq 7 is used to compare the measured resonant frequencies the measured value of η is used in eq 7 to get the approximate resonant frequency for all test cases as in table 1 fig 16 compares the measured resonant frequencies with theoretical relation for different values of h l for low value of a l the measured frequencies match very well with the theoretical relation regardless of h l as the excitation amplitude increases gradually the variation between the two curves becomes large the theoretical curves have more fluctuations than the experimental one this is because as the excitation amplitude increases strong nonlinear phenomena such as wave run up breaking hydraulic jump solitary wave and swirling like wave emerge and the corresponding measured surface elevation has fluctuating magnitude which affects the strict monotonic increasing trend in relation 7 even though the agreement between the curves is fairly good the theoretical relation over estimates the resonant frequency at high excitation amplitudes this is because the theoretical relation is derived based on the analogy of one dimensional ideal gas dynamic equations with adiabatic law hence it does not account strong breaking or discontinuity of free surface profile and so damping in the sloshing tank has not been taken into the account therefore the theoretical relation overestimates the resonant frequency than the one measured experimentally 4 12 qualitative comparison with the study of yu 1997 yu 1997 have also studied the nonlinear shallow water sloshing in three different tanks l b 1 6502 1 7611 2 6865 with h l varying from 0 029 to 0 079 for a l ranging from 0 003 to 0 068 and developed an empirical relation for jump frequency the present experimental results are compared with the study of yu 1997 the measured values of jump frequency ratio βjump are plotted as a function of λ a l in fig 17 for the purpose of comparison h l is taken up to 0 06944 and the data of jump frequency ratios of experimental test cases from 1 to 10 as given in table 1 are presented in fig 17 an approximate regression curve for the data of jump frequency ratio is obtained using nonlinear least squares method as in equation 8 yu 1997 have also proposed a regression line as in equation 9 for jump frequency ratio from their experimental study 8 β j u m p 1 959 λ 0 1031 for λ 0 0268 2 214 λ 0 1369 for λ 0 0268 9 β j u m p 1 85 λ 0 095 for λ 0 03 2 89 λ 0 222 for λ 0 03 at low excitation amplitude range the two curves are close to each other however for large excitation amplitudes the deviation between these two curves is slightly high the present proposed curve changes its slope approximately at λ 0 0268 whereas the curve obtained by yu 1997 changes its slope at λ 0 03 the regression lines as in equations 8 and 9 indicate that the jump frequency ratio βjump increases with excitation amplitude the slope of curve becomes large at high excitation amplitude in comparison to low excitation amplitude this is because of strong nonlinear phenomena exist for high excitation amplitude the deviation between the curves in equations 8 and 9 may be due to the variation in water depth tank base aspect ratio and the range of excitation amplitudes adopted in both studies moreover reed et al 1998 have also reported from their experimental studies that when the excitation amplitude goes beyond the value of approximately λ 0 025 the slope of the regression curve increases hence for small excitation amplitudes it is seen that the present experimental results on jump frequency qualitatively agrees with the studies in the literature fig 18 shows the jump frequency ratio as a function of λ a l for all the experimental cases from 1 to 12 as in table 1 for the experimental cases 11 and 12 the corresponding tanks have the aspect ratios l b 1 7708 and 1 3819 respectively the non dimensional excitation amplitude λ a l increases up to 0 1256 and h l rises up to 0 1256 for the case no 12 based on jump frequencies obtained from all test cases a regression curve is proposed as follows in equation 10 10 β j u m p 1 957 λ 0 1035 for the purpose of comparison the best fitted curve as in equation 10 of present experimental results and the regression curve proposed by yu 1997 are plotted in fig 18 it can be seen that the two curves deviate considerably for high excitation amplitudes however in general the data points of jump frequency ratio for higher values of h l fall near or below the fitted curve whereas the jump frequency ratios corresponding to small values of h l lie near or above the fitted curve this implies that as h l decreases the jump frequency increases for given excitation amplitude and this observation also agrees with that of lepelletier and raichlen 1988 5 conclusions the present experimental investigation is an attempt to understand the nonlinear behaviour of sloshing in shallow water tanks identification of resonant frequency under the effect of excitation amplitude is one of the primary goals of the present study the effects of excitation amplitude and dispersion parameter on jump phenomenon have also been highlighted from the study the following important conclusions are made 1 for the tanks of relatively large aspect ratio under high excitation amplitudes shallow water sloshing response develops the planar standing wave planar progressive waves breaking hydraulic jumps solitary like wave in sequence as the excitation frequency increases from very low to high frequency range 2 diagonal like wave and swirling like phenomenon emerge around the resonant region for the tank of small aspect ratio l b 1 3819 under high excitation amplitudes 3 regardless of tank base aspect ratio and excitation amplitude the dominant response frequencies are the excitation frequency and its positive integer multiples 4 the fractional multiples 1 2 3 2 5 2 of excitation frequency have also been excited in case of tank with aspect ratio l b 1 3819 under high excitation amplitude a l 0 12562 5 the occurrence of jump phenomenon of shallow water sloshing depends on both the tank base aspect ratio and excitation amplitude a under small excitation amplitude for tanks with relatively large aspect ratio l b 4 0381 3 6944 and 3 3020 the jump phenomenon is very clear from the frequency response curves b as the excitation amplitude increases the jump phenomenon disappears for the tanks with aspect ratio l b 3 3020 2 9305 2 5 1 7708 and 1 3819 6 increase in excitation amplitude shifts the resonant frequency and also activates the super harmonic resonance further the frequency response curves of shallow water sloshing show the hard spring type nonlinear behaviour the frequency range for violent sloshing motion enlarges as the excitation amplitude increases 7 in the range of high excitation amplitudes as the dispersion parameter increases the resonant frequency decreases for given excitation amplitude 8 at high excitation amplitude a l 0 04699 the resonant frequency increases about 45 in comparison to the linear sloshing frequency f1 for the tank of base aspect ratio l b 3 6944 and dispersion parameter h l 0 03759 9 for small tank base aspect ratio l b 1 3819 and large dispersion parameter h l 0 12562 the resonant frequency curve follows a trend that differs from the other curves due to the occurrence of swirling like phenomenon around the resonance region

21661,balance measurements performed by testing sub scaled ship models determine the global forces and moments acting on the ship which allows knowing the power required for the ship s movement and provides insight to be applied in the design of the control systems used to steer the ship and to avoid instabilities while sailing the ship superstructure may produce large separated regions and high air wake turbulence levels resulting in a set of fluctuations of the flow parameters usually determined by measuring velocity or pressure this paper presents the balance measurement of the aerodynamic forces acting on the ship hull aerodynamic forces and moments produced on the ship can be interpreted as an integration of the flow parameters velocity and pressure distributions over the ship surface wetted by the air balance method provides averaged values and fluctuations of forces coefficients aerodynamic environment in the vicinity of a ship is influenced by a large number of factors atmospheric wind sea state ship superstructure masts stacks antennas affecting helicopter operations on board ships and their safety during the take off and landing manoeuvres keywords forces and moments ship stability flight deck air wake balance measurements balance spectra 1 introduction global actions over the ship s hull are the forces and moments which are experimentally measured by means of balances the loads acting on the ship have effect on the required power for the ship motion and for its stability during the ocean navigation usually measurement campaigns are carried out in water channels to determine the hydrodynamic forces and moments that are exerted on the part of the ship that is underwater for different navigation configurations although the density of air is much lower than that of water and consequently the aerodynamic loads are much less than the hydrodynamic ones it is also interesting to determine the aerodynamic actions on the ship which have effects on the part above the waterline since they contribute to the consumption of mechanical power provided by the power plant of the ship when they are against the advance of the ship apart from this the most important effect due to the aerodynamic actions is that can cause oscillations and instabilities on the ship during navigation that is justified for example by analyzing the case of crosswind navigation when the effects of the wind produce loads that results into a roll over moment on the ship that will have to be compensated to guarantee the integrity and safety of the ship and the crew additionally the knowledge of these aerodynamic actions will allow a more robust design of the control systems to avoid instabilities produced during the navigation of the ship on the other hand the global aerodynamic forces acting upon the ship are a consequence of the local forces exerted on its surfaces which are determined by the air flow field around the ship the flow field around the ship has been studied during the last decades because of its interaction with the operations of aircraft onboard shipboard helicopter operations are performed in a very adverse and turbulent environment ship superstructure produces large separated regions and high air wake turbulence levels so that the airflow above the ship s flight deck is characterized by complex flow structures having very adverse effects on aircraft operations at sea findlay and ghee 2006 the flow field over the flight deck is largely dependent on the ship landing platform structure commonly a bluff body having a massive separated flow region in its wake platt 1998 fig 1 shows the typical flow encountered on the flight deck similar to that of a backwards facing step with a closed recirculation zone bounded by an unsteady shear layer emanating from the top of the hangar and reattaching on the flight deck greenwell and barret 2006 as observed in fig 1 the flow incoming from the roof and the sides of the ship to the flight deck produces a large recirculation region behind the step thus causing counter rotating vortices on each side of the recirculation region this results in an unsteady horseshoe vortex structure zan 2001 that may grow dissipate or move spatially in an unpredictable manner shafer and ghee 2005 the flow field on some general type of ships as the simple frigate ship bardera mora 2014a or the generic frigate ship kääriä et al 2012 have been investigated by wind tunnel testing in order to obtain information of a general ship geometry to establish comparative analysis with computational simulations as the case presented by yuan et al 2018 the interaction of the atmospheric wind and sea state with the ship creates the operational environment for the helicopter resulting in a slightly different flow for every type of ship geyer et al 2003 regarding to this aspect several computational and experimental studies were performed on specific ship geometries such as the us navy destroyer ddg polsky et al 2007 or some others bardera mora et al 2018a finally a specific frigate was also investigated in wind tunnel by means of piv bardera mora 2014b and lda bardera mora et al 2015 2017 and compared to on board measurements used for validation the experimental and numerical results in order to study the flow field in the recirculated region on the flight deck and the flow frequencies involved that affect helicopters operation wind tunnel test experiments have been performed the most common non intrusive experimental techniques for measuring the flow field velocity is the particle image velocimetry piv bardera and meseguer 2015 bardera mora et al 2017 2018 which allows the obtention of velocity maps in this region and the laser doppler anemometry lda bardera mora et al 2015 2017 which leads to the calculus of the flow frequencies involved which are extremely important to know the pilot workload other classical techniques such as oil film visualization of the deck bardera mora 2014a or pressure measurements buonaccorso et al 2011 bardera and meseguer 2015 have also been employed on the other hand some recent studies have proposed either some aerodynamic modifications kääira et al 2013 and bardera et al 2015 or passive flow control devices findlay and ghee 2006 bardera mora et al 2016 in the superstructures to reduce the turbulence level however neither of them have been applied by the ship manufacturers recently an instrumented model scaled helicopter for measuring unsteady aerodynamic loading in ships airwakes known as airdyn have been developed wang et al 2011 and used to compare to cfd results kääriä et al 2012 also a rotor flight simulation by cfd computations was performed to obtain an assessment of rotor ship coupling effects tang et al 2012 in this context wind loads acting on the ship model were measured in this work by means of a strain gauge balance as global aerodynamic forces and moment coefficients acting on the ship model additionally the spectral analysis of the balance signal provides the frequencies forcing the ship model structure the frigate used in this work is the one used in bardera et al 2015 and the frequencies obtained are compared to the main vortex shedding frequencies in the wake of the frigate model as obtained previously by lda measurements showing good agreement 2 material and methods 2 1 wind tunnel the experiments were conducted in a low speed wind tunnel at inta spain the wind tunnel used is a close circuit tunnel type with an open test section of 2 3 m2 and a maximum airspeed of 60 m s different wind velocities from 5 to 60 m s were tested to reproduce different reynolds numbers in the wind tunnel flow the wind tunnel has a platform with streamlined leading and trailing edges to minimize the interference of the platform in the flow field in this case this platform simulates the surface of the sea and the model only represents the part of the ship above the waterline subjected to aerodynamic air flow fig 2 shows the ship model on the platform located in the test section of the wind tunnel 2 2 ship model the ship model used in this study is a scaled 1 50th specific frigate with a flight helicopter deck located on the stern where helicopters operate the ship model has a hangar in the superstructure for helicopters the superstructure also includes the bridge radars antennas and the exhaust funnels the most representative details of the ship model construction are given in fig 3 where all dimensions are in millimetres 2 3 balance measurements balance measurement is a classical wind tunnel technique used for a global assessment of the wind loads acting over vehicles or buildings balances are usually fabricated with high tensile steel operating in the elastic range of deformation so that when the loads stop the balance material comes back to the original position without plastic deformation when the balance is loaded strain gauges installed over the balance get a measure of deformation and produce an electric signal as the strain gauges are connected to a wheatstone bridge the unbalanced electric signal provides a measurement of the balance deformation which can be related with the load that produced this deformation for this experiment a six components strain gauge balance fx2 6 sixaxes model orlhac 2009 was installed outside the model as an external balance to measure the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the ship model balance was calibrated before proceeding with the tests following the calibration procedure provided by the manufacturer orlhac 2009 the ship model was fastened to the balance face by means of four screws in a classical manner of wind tunnel models in this kind of tests balance measurements are expressed in the axes balance with origin fixed to the balance centre of gravity fig 4 depicts the axes system associated to the balance where x is the wind velocity direction positive upstream the z axis is the vertical axis positive upward and the y axis is perpendicular to both x and z axes and directed according to the right hand rule so positive starboard as shown in fig 4 the balance centre of gravity was located 35 mm below the base of the ship model the model was fixed to the balance allowing a small gap 5 mm height between both platform and model base no contact between the model and the platform was assured to avoid fictitious forces and moments in case deformations and vibrations occurred in addition the balance was fastened to an electro mechanic rotary system allowing the model to rotate around the z axis this mechanism allows angles between 0 bow wind and 180 stern wind so different incident wind angles are possible during the test campaign 2 3 1 data acquisition fig 5 shows the components of the balance measurement system sketch balance was fed with a regulated power supply and data were acquired and recorded by using quantum x software of hbm hottinger baldwin messtechnik gmbh the data acquisition of the balance was performed automatically at a sampling frequency of 2400 hz large enough to detect the present frequencies in the airflow a low pass butterworth filter with cut off frequency of 500 hz was used to avoid aliasing and the recording time was 16 s considered both sampling frequency and recording time as adequate to get a correct signal reconstruction following the nyquist shannon kotelnikov theorem applied to a discrete sequence of samples of a real continuous time process values of forces and moments measurements have been averaged on the acquisition time so that mean force and moment measured by the balance are given by the following expression 1 f v c where f is the force and moment matrix c is the calibration matrix previously determined by means of calibration tests and v is the matrix of signals output corrected for zero offsets matrix v is given by the following expression 2 v v r v 0 where vr is the signals output readings matrix and v 0 is the signals output zero offsets matrix averaged of the initial and final zero offset finally the corresponding non dimensional coefficients of force and moment are calculated by 3 c f i f i q a i x y z 4 c m i m i q a l i x y z where c fi and c mi are the coefficients of force and moment respectively along the i balance axis i x y z f i and m i are the force and moment along the i balance axis respectively and a is the reference surface a 0 094 m2 taken as the front surface for zero incident wind angle l is the reference length l is the beam when i x z and the whole length of the ship model when i y and q is the dynamic pressure given by 5 q 1 2 ρ u 2 where ρ is the air density and u is the free stream velocity at the wind tunnel test section finally an axes rotation matrix allows changing from forces coefficients measured on axes fixed to balance body axes to wind axes forces as given by the following expression barlow et al 1999 6 c f w c f x w c f y w c d c s cos ϕ sin ϕ sin ϕ cos ϕ c f x c f y where only x and y components are to be accounted for w indicates wind axes c d and c s are the aerodynamic drag and side forces coefficients and c fx and c fy are the forces coefficients along the x and y axes fixed to the balance respectively the incident wind angle is denoted as φ force and moment measurements from the balance located at the base of ship model experienced value fluctuations and the analysis of the signal spectra allowed the determination of the involved frequencies the spectra were calculated by means of the fourier transform of the balance signals using the fft algorithm fast fourier transform the dynamic balance response was previously calibrated by a step response test following an analogous procedure to that exposed in tanno et al 2005 3 results 3 1 balance measurements results the main results obtained from the balance measurements are presented in graphical form fig 6 shows drag and side force coefficients versus incident wind angle when the wind tunnel velocity was 30 m s and a reynolds number re 5 5 105 for an incident wind angle of 90 the drag coefficient has a maximum cdmáx 3 8 and the side force coefficient is zero in wind axes cs 0 the drag coefficient for 0 is 0 6 cd 0 0 6 and approximately the same as the 180 case fig 7 shows moment coefficients expressed in balance axes versus incident wind angle when the reynolds number is 5 5 105 when the incident wind angle is in the range from 45 to 120 c mx is approximately constant c mx 2 this is the moment affecting the rolling attitude of the ship that is usually compensated by a great mass of water located in the ship hold as a dead weight fig 8 shows aerodynamic drag force coefficient c d versus flow reynolds number re for different incident wind angles graph indicates that drag force coefficient c d is approximately independent of the reynolds number as long as re is above 1 0 105 showing slight ripple for some angles of wind incidence until reynolds is rising to 8 0 105 the analysis of the balance signal spectra yielded the phenomenon frequencies power spectral density psd of forces and moments was calculated from balance data following press et al 2007 spectra were estimated by time averaged periodograms that were obtained by computing the fast fourier transform fft following the welch s method welch 1967 after the procedure detailed in bardera mora et al 2015 fig 9 shows the power spectral density psd of the forces fx and fy spectra denoted by s fx and s fy forces were measured by means of the balance when wind tunnel velocity was 30 m s corresponding to a reynolds number of 5 5 105 horizontal axis represents the frequency values in hz and vertical axis corresponds to the intensity of forces psd in newtons2 hertz the first peak of the spectrum occurring at a frequency of about 10 hz corresponds to the natural frequency of the ship model that was detected during a previous step response test following an analogous procedure to that exposed in tanno et al 2005 and without tunnel airflow when the model was joined to the balance the model was loaded with a step load using a calibrated weight of 5 kg of mass in order to characterize it which was hung from the model by a wire the wire was cut at a certain moment to obtain the balance s response taking into account that strouhal number represents a non dimensional frequency defined by st f l u where f is the flow frequency l is a body characteristic length and u the flow velocity the second peak that occurs at about 20 hz corresponds to the hangar vortex shedding finally several higher frequencies 50 70 hz range correspond to smaller devices such as the bridge antennas and masts assuming the flow velocity u and the strouhal number st are constant for bodies with similar geometry to a square cylinder higher frequencies multiplied by 3 corresponds to smaller devices with lower sizes divided by 3 fig 10 shows the power spectral density psd of the balance moments signal s mx s my and s mz when freestream velocity of wind tunnel was 30 m s re 5 5 105 now vertical axis corresponds to the intensity of moments psd in newtons m 2 hertz the first peak of psd spectrum corresponds to the natural frequency of the ship model frequency of about 10 hz detected during the previous step response test without airflow when the model was joined to the balance the second peak of the spectrum is located about 20 hz probably same as detected in the forces spectra see fig 9 but the moment spectra exhibits very low signal level for harmonics into the frequency band from 50 to 70 hz so that moment measurements results less sensitive for spectral analysis on the other hand flow velocity was measured by means of laser doppler anemometry lda inside the air wake on the spot p see fig 3 the lda used is a commercial system from dantec it consisted of a continuous 10 mw he ne laser a bsa f60 flow processor the bsa flow software and a laskin atomizer to seed the flow this atomizer generates olive oil droplets with a diameter of the order of one micron which are small enough to follow the flow fig 11 shows the wind velocity spectrum of v component along y axis denoted by svv following the results shown in reference bardera mora et al 2015 peak frequency obtained in this experiment was 17 hz when testing at wind tunnel airspeed of 20 m s in the most representative point spot p indicated in fig 3 spot p2 in the reference fig 12 shows the power spectral density psd comparison between the balance signal and the flow velocity into the airwake as measured by lda the y component indicated in figs 3 and 4 was represented in both cases force fy moment my and velocity v component flow velocity psd denoted as svv represents the kinetic energy divided by frequency with units in international system is of m s 2 hz on the other hand force psd denoted by sfy in n2 hz is shown in vertical axis joined to smy n m 2 hz and svv as observed in fig 12 the force spectrum exhibits more intensity than flow velocity spectrum but they are different quantities with different physics units the force spectrum has a main frequency peak located at 20 hz on the other hand moment spectrum shows two peaks the first one is due to natural frequency of the model and it is located at 10 hz and the second peak is located at 18 hz close to the peak detected in the velocity spectrum located at 17 hz higher frequencies show the turbulent kinetic energy represented by svv is decaying as expected in a turbulent flow and fig 11 shows how it trends to the force spectrum curve see figs 11 and 12 frequency peak at 17 hz detected in flow velocity spectrum corresponds to the hangar vortex shedding frequency same as found in a previous work bardera mora et al 2015 this value is near the force spectrum frequency of 20 hz discrepancies found could be due the small differences found in the reynolds number since as shown before the independency of the reynolds number is not fully attained until reynolds above 8 0 105 4 conclusions a sub scaled model of a frigate type ship was built and tested in a low speed wind tunnel in order to perform force and moment measurements by means of a strain gauge balance located in the base of the ship model corresponding force and moment coefficients were calculated and plotted additionally the variation of the drag coefficient with reynolds number of the flow was studied showing reynolds number independency when the flow reynolds number is above 1 0 105 with some slight ripple for some incident wind angles until 8 0 105 consequently the wind tunnel test reproduces adequately the full scale ship airflow structure at reynolds number of order of 1 0 107 roll moment coefficient was determined as a relative wind angle function 0 180 range an estimate of the roll moment on the full scale ship can be calculated using this coefficient and consequently the dead load to equilibrate it the analysis of the balance signal spectra allowed the determination of the main frequencies affecting to the ship model structure as these located around 20 hz and other secondary peaks in the range from 50 to 70 hz with a very low intensity the frequencies present in the flow were determined from wind velocities measured by means of laser doppler anemometry the spectrum exhibits the classical shape of turbulent flow with typical decaying after higher peak located in 17 hz for the studied flow a comparative analysis of balance and lda spectra reveals that lda frequency peak is located closed to this of balance peak finally we can conclude that the balance measurements method provide information about the aerodynamics loads acting on the ship that can be used in the computation of the required power for the ship s movement and improving the design of the control systems in order to steer the ship in a more safe manner maintaining the ship s stability while sailing on the other hand the analysis of the balance signal spectra has been proved to be valid to determine ship frequencies acting on the frigate ship tested

21661,balance measurements performed by testing sub scaled ship models determine the global forces and moments acting on the ship which allows knowing the power required for the ship s movement and provides insight to be applied in the design of the control systems used to steer the ship and to avoid instabilities while sailing the ship superstructure may produce large separated regions and high air wake turbulence levels resulting in a set of fluctuations of the flow parameters usually determined by measuring velocity or pressure this paper presents the balance measurement of the aerodynamic forces acting on the ship hull aerodynamic forces and moments produced on the ship can be interpreted as an integration of the flow parameters velocity and pressure distributions over the ship surface wetted by the air balance method provides averaged values and fluctuations of forces coefficients aerodynamic environment in the vicinity of a ship is influenced by a large number of factors atmospheric wind sea state ship superstructure masts stacks antennas affecting helicopter operations on board ships and their safety during the take off and landing manoeuvres keywords forces and moments ship stability flight deck air wake balance measurements balance spectra 1 introduction global actions over the ship s hull are the forces and moments which are experimentally measured by means of balances the loads acting on the ship have effect on the required power for the ship motion and for its stability during the ocean navigation usually measurement campaigns are carried out in water channels to determine the hydrodynamic forces and moments that are exerted on the part of the ship that is underwater for different navigation configurations although the density of air is much lower than that of water and consequently the aerodynamic loads are much less than the hydrodynamic ones it is also interesting to determine the aerodynamic actions on the ship which have effects on the part above the waterline since they contribute to the consumption of mechanical power provided by the power plant of the ship when they are against the advance of the ship apart from this the most important effect due to the aerodynamic actions is that can cause oscillations and instabilities on the ship during navigation that is justified for example by analyzing the case of crosswind navigation when the effects of the wind produce loads that results into a roll over moment on the ship that will have to be compensated to guarantee the integrity and safety of the ship and the crew additionally the knowledge of these aerodynamic actions will allow a more robust design of the control systems to avoid instabilities produced during the navigation of the ship on the other hand the global aerodynamic forces acting upon the ship are a consequence of the local forces exerted on its surfaces which are determined by the air flow field around the ship the flow field around the ship has been studied during the last decades because of its interaction with the operations of aircraft onboard shipboard helicopter operations are performed in a very adverse and turbulent environment ship superstructure produces large separated regions and high air wake turbulence levels so that the airflow above the ship s flight deck is characterized by complex flow structures having very adverse effects on aircraft operations at sea findlay and ghee 2006 the flow field over the flight deck is largely dependent on the ship landing platform structure commonly a bluff body having a massive separated flow region in its wake platt 1998 fig 1 shows the typical flow encountered on the flight deck similar to that of a backwards facing step with a closed recirculation zone bounded by an unsteady shear layer emanating from the top of the hangar and reattaching on the flight deck greenwell and barret 2006 as observed in fig 1 the flow incoming from the roof and the sides of the ship to the flight deck produces a large recirculation region behind the step thus causing counter rotating vortices on each side of the recirculation region this results in an unsteady horseshoe vortex structure zan 2001 that may grow dissipate or move spatially in an unpredictable manner shafer and ghee 2005 the flow field on some general type of ships as the simple frigate ship bardera mora 2014a or the generic frigate ship kääriä et al 2012 have been investigated by wind tunnel testing in order to obtain information of a general ship geometry to establish comparative analysis with computational simulations as the case presented by yuan et al 2018 the interaction of the atmospheric wind and sea state with the ship creates the operational environment for the helicopter resulting in a slightly different flow for every type of ship geyer et al 2003 regarding to this aspect several computational and experimental studies were performed on specific ship geometries such as the us navy destroyer ddg polsky et al 2007 or some others bardera mora et al 2018a finally a specific frigate was also investigated in wind tunnel by means of piv bardera mora 2014b and lda bardera mora et al 2015 2017 and compared to on board measurements used for validation the experimental and numerical results in order to study the flow field in the recirculated region on the flight deck and the flow frequencies involved that affect helicopters operation wind tunnel test experiments have been performed the most common non intrusive experimental techniques for measuring the flow field velocity is the particle image velocimetry piv bardera and meseguer 2015 bardera mora et al 2017 2018 which allows the obtention of velocity maps in this region and the laser doppler anemometry lda bardera mora et al 2015 2017 which leads to the calculus of the flow frequencies involved which are extremely important to know the pilot workload other classical techniques such as oil film visualization of the deck bardera mora 2014a or pressure measurements buonaccorso et al 2011 bardera and meseguer 2015 have also been employed on the other hand some recent studies have proposed either some aerodynamic modifications kääira et al 2013 and bardera et al 2015 or passive flow control devices findlay and ghee 2006 bardera mora et al 2016 in the superstructures to reduce the turbulence level however neither of them have been applied by the ship manufacturers recently an instrumented model scaled helicopter for measuring unsteady aerodynamic loading in ships airwakes known as airdyn have been developed wang et al 2011 and used to compare to cfd results kääriä et al 2012 also a rotor flight simulation by cfd computations was performed to obtain an assessment of rotor ship coupling effects tang et al 2012 in this context wind loads acting on the ship model were measured in this work by means of a strain gauge balance as global aerodynamic forces and moment coefficients acting on the ship model additionally the spectral analysis of the balance signal provides the frequencies forcing the ship model structure the frigate used in this work is the one used in bardera et al 2015 and the frequencies obtained are compared to the main vortex shedding frequencies in the wake of the frigate model as obtained previously by lda measurements showing good agreement 2 material and methods 2 1 wind tunnel the experiments were conducted in a low speed wind tunnel at inta spain the wind tunnel used is a close circuit tunnel type with an open test section of 2 3 m2 and a maximum airspeed of 60 m s different wind velocities from 5 to 60 m s were tested to reproduce different reynolds numbers in the wind tunnel flow the wind tunnel has a platform with streamlined leading and trailing edges to minimize the interference of the platform in the flow field in this case this platform simulates the surface of the sea and the model only represents the part of the ship above the waterline subjected to aerodynamic air flow fig 2 shows the ship model on the platform located in the test section of the wind tunnel 2 2 ship model the ship model used in this study is a scaled 1 50th specific frigate with a flight helicopter deck located on the stern where helicopters operate the ship model has a hangar in the superstructure for helicopters the superstructure also includes the bridge radars antennas and the exhaust funnels the most representative details of the ship model construction are given in fig 3 where all dimensions are in millimetres 2 3 balance measurements balance measurement is a classical wind tunnel technique used for a global assessment of the wind loads acting over vehicles or buildings balances are usually fabricated with high tensile steel operating in the elastic range of deformation so that when the loads stop the balance material comes back to the original position without plastic deformation when the balance is loaded strain gauges installed over the balance get a measure of deformation and produce an electric signal as the strain gauges are connected to a wheatstone bridge the unbalanced electric signal provides a measurement of the balance deformation which can be related with the load that produced this deformation for this experiment a six components strain gauge balance fx2 6 sixaxes model orlhac 2009 was installed outside the model as an external balance to measure the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on the ship model balance was calibrated before proceeding with the tests following the calibration procedure provided by the manufacturer orlhac 2009 the ship model was fastened to the balance face by means of four screws in a classical manner of wind tunnel models in this kind of tests balance measurements are expressed in the axes balance with origin fixed to the balance centre of gravity fig 4 depicts the axes system associated to the balance where x is the wind velocity direction positive upstream the z axis is the vertical axis positive upward and the y axis is perpendicular to both x and z axes and directed according to the right hand rule so positive starboard as shown in fig 4 the balance centre of gravity was located 35 mm below the base of the ship model the model was fixed to the balance allowing a small gap 5 mm height between both platform and model base no contact between the model and the platform was assured to avoid fictitious forces and moments in case deformations and vibrations occurred in addition the balance was fastened to an electro mechanic rotary system allowing the model to rotate around the z axis this mechanism allows angles between 0 bow wind and 180 stern wind so different incident wind angles are possible during the test campaign 2 3 1 data acquisition fig 5 shows the components of the balance measurement system sketch balance was fed with a regulated power supply and data were acquired and recorded by using quantum x software

get a correct signal reconstruction following the nyquist shannon kotelnikov theorem applied to a discrete sequence of samples of a real continuous time process values of forces and moments

where vr is the signals output readings matrix and v 0 is the signals output zero offsets matrix averaged of the initial and final zero offset finally the corresponding non dimensional coefficients of force and moment are calculated by 3 c f i f i q a i x y z 4 c m i m i q a l i x y z where c fi and c mi are the coefficients of force and moment respectively along the i balance axis i x y z f i and

hangar vortex shedding frequency same as found in a previous work bardera mora et al 2015 this value is near the force spectrum frequency of 20 hz discrepancies found could be due the small differences found in the reynolds number since as shown before the independency of the reynolds number is not fully attained until reynolds above 8 0 105 4 conclusions a sub scaled model of a frigate

wavelet particle swarm optimization extreme learning machine 1 introduction the change of significant wave height hs is one of the crucial segments of surface oceans or seas components wave heights are influenced by the environmental changes and earth system particularly the waves that generated because of climate changes earle and malahoff 1979 molland 2008 james 2017 accurate and reliable prediction of hs is an important task for maritime and engineering applications such as fishing prospecting and coastal requirements molland 2008 gotoh and khayyer 2016 ghorbani et al 2017 as such physical and statistical strategies are used to estimate the hs casas prat et al 2014 the physical strategies consider that the waves are mainly generated by the action of wind on the water surface and the waves development follows the duration and fetch limited growth laws hwang 2006 while the statistical imperial techniques have been used to discover the relationship between climate waves and atmospheric variables wang et al 2012 although hs models are driven by surface winds the climate waves should be considered in hs prediction therefore wind speed as a physical parameter and climate change variables as a statistical approach have been widely used to design the prediction models of hs using nonlinear mathematical models casas prat et al 2014 mafi and amirinia 2017 kumar et al 2018 the non stationarity and non linearity of the time series of ocean characteristics i e hs wave periods and the natural change effects i e wind temperature affect the forecasting accuracy the input

various prediction methods to estimate short and long period terms of hs such as wave energy balance based models mase et al 2005 yasuda et al 2020 numerical models chun and suh 2019 time series models duan and huang 2016 an artificial intelligent technique based linear and nonlinear models kagemoto 2020 and hybrid models zhao and wang 2019 also soft computing techniques such as the artificial neural network ann fuzzy systems and support vector machine svm have been applied to the hs modeling asma et al 2012 ghorbani et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 mafi and amirinia 2017 despite the fact that the accuracy of soft computing techniques for hs prediction is higher than that of the traditional methods they are still having some limitations for example the wind speed as one parameter storm duration and wave periods are mostly used to estimate the hs in the traditional or recent development methods wilson 1965 yueh et al 2015 wang et al 2017 choi et al 2019 on the other hand anns have a solid equal handling capacity yet that have number of issues such as generalization power and gradient based parameter learning liu et al 2018 thus to overcome these issues extreme learning machine elm has been introduced and presented by huang et al 2015 the elm is another type of single hidden layer feedforward neural network araújo et al 2006 for that it has been used in the prediction of hs and different applications kumar et al 2018 liu et al 2018 eshtay et al 2019 however hs is a complicated non linear dynamic system and it is impacted by various components valamanesh et al 2016 the time series prediction of non stationarity data by using elm method only will lead to the homogenization of the different characteristics of the original input data which could affect the prediction accuracy liu et al 2018 accordingly the non stationarity of the time series of hs and input variables should be reduced the wavelet analysis is a good tool that can be used for the non stationary data rhif et al 2019 it is applied for analysis of the signals in time and frequency domains and the important derivative of the fourier transform deka and prahlada 2012 the wavelet transform wt utilizes to estimate the low and high frequencies of the signals so it is used to smooth out the time series rhif et al 2019 the data can be represented by using different resolution intervals by discrete wavelet transform dwt thus the complex signals of meteorological data including hs can be decomposed into several simple time series in different frequencies in other words decomposed time series can handle non stationarity and nonlinearity of signals by using it as input variables for the elm so high accurate hs may be obtained predictions are more accurate than those obtained by original signals due to the fact that the features of the subseries are obvious deka and prahlada 2012 the application of wt with elm and other methods have been employed in different applications for instance deka and prahlada 2012 established a prediction model for the time series of wave height using wt ann and the results outperformed that of the ann model ghaemi et al 2019 used wt and regression methods to predict evaporation time series and they concluded that combining both the wt and regression accomplished good results applications of wavelet decomposition to improve the accuracy of hs and water level predictions can be found in quilty and adamowski 2018 altunkaynak 2019 altunkaynak and kartal 2019 chen et al 2019 tür 2020 in addition particle swarm optimization pso is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm by updating the distance between the current and best locations it is proposed by kennedy and elberhart 1995 the optimization of input weights and hidden biases of elm are adapted by pso to improve the prediction accuracy of a single elm liu et al 2018 integrating the pso with the elm have been used to improve the accuracy of prediction models pso was used for estimating temperature changes and the results showed its performance was better than the ann esfandeh and sedighizadeh 2011 in addition it was outperformed backpropagation ann in the prediction model of water consumption by integrated with svm lu et al 2009 moreover the hybrid model of the pso adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system pso anfis was applied to improve the anfis model for the reflection coefficient of the semicircular breakwater kundapura and hegde 2018 pso elm significantly outperformed higher prediction accuracy than pso ann and kernel elm klem into modeling resilient modulus of pavement material kaloop et al 2019 the pso ann outperformed the conventional ann accuracy for modeling historical length values of hs gopinath and dwarakish 2016 recently there are limited applications of elm to model hs while other methods accuracies were higher than elm to predict the hs of ocean waves for instance kumar et al 2017 compared elm and minimal resource allocation network mran and they found the mran accuracy is higher than elm to predict the hs furthermore the ensemble of elm ens elm was compared by kumar et al 2018 with elm online sequential elm and svm and the results showed that the ens elm outperformed other models for hs prediction of ocean waves fan et al 2020 compared long short term memory network lstm svm elm residual network resnet random forest rf and backpropagation ann bpnn and found that the performance of lstm was high to model hs herein the combined models improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition method with adaptive noise elm iceemdan elm ali and prasad 2019 empirical mode decomposition svm emd svm zhao and wang 2019 were applied to estimate the time series of hs and the results showed that these models can be used to improve the standalone models in this paper a hybrid wpso elm model to predict the hs was developed for this purpose the authors selected two points in the south east of the usa since many storms were observed previously in this area valamanesh et al 2016 coastal and deep sea zones are chosen to validate the proposed model in various meteorological characteristics the modeling of hs at this area can be considered as a reference for the management of onshore and offshore applications for that this study aims to accomplish the following objectives i design a pso elm prediction model of regional hs using dwt and different lead times ii evaluate the performance of the wpso elm model by contrasting it by elm and kelm models and results of previous studies and iii analyze the input variables effects on hs modeling 2 study area and data the significant wave height and meteorological series were downloaded from noaa s national data buoy center https www ndbc noaa gov two stations were utilized in this study fig 1 p1 station 41 025 35 025 n 75 363 w in the coastal zone water depth 59 4 m and p2 station 41 048 31 838 n 69 585 w in the deep sea zone water depth 5340 m https www nws noaa gov om marine zone off offnt2mz htm these stations were selected as they have unimpaired and long series of recorded wave height and metrological data

data recorded for each station is given in table 1 the obtained number of data records for points p1 and p2 are 6680 and 8727 respectively the data were divided into training 80 and testing for model approval 20 1336 and 1746 data records for points p1 and p2 respectively the independent testing data were used for model approval fig 2 shows the hs records of both points 3 methods 3 1 wavelet analysis the dwt or simply wavelet analysis is more useful than fourier transformation for the frequencies contents analysis of signals in the time domain without redundant components and it is a suitable tool for the elimination different noises ramos et al 2017 sayed et al 2017 in addition different cut off frequencies are utilized to analyze the signal at different scales in dwt deka and prahlada 2012 further information on wavelet analysis theory and applications can be found in alzaq and üstündağ 2018 rhif et al 2019 tikhamarine et al 2019 in the current study the dwt was used to improve the designed prediction models in this method the signal s divides into two parts using low and high pass filters which are approximations a and details d components respectively deka and prahlada 2012 sayed et al 2017 the decomposition of the original signal into j decompositions levels can be expressed as follows 1 s j t a j 1 t d j 1 t these decomposition levels are generally defined as a set of basic functions ψ c b t that can be generated by translating and scaling dilation which called mother wavelet 2 ψ c b t c 0 5 ψ t b c where c and b are dilation and translation factors respectively in dwt the c 2 j and b k2 j where k is a location index running from 1 to 2 j n n is the number of observations and j runs from 0 to j thus the dwt can be expressed as follows 3 ψ j k t 2 j 2 ψ 2 j t k from the above the main factors in dwt are the decomposition levels and mother wavelet in this study daubechies wavelet order 4 db4 was selected as a mother wavelet since it is suitable for the properties of signals measurements deka and prahlada 2012 and 6 levels were chosen as decomposition levels as more decomposition levels will not change obviously on the wavelet coefficients these selections were also based on the deka and prahlada 2012 study and results of using dwt to predict wave height in the current study the reconstructed wavelet decomposition coefficients were used to design the proposed model the low and high frequencies components of original signals were considered with the same length of the original data to avoid the dwt prediction errors quilty and adamowski 2018 3 2 particle swarm optimization pso the pso simulates movement behavior and calls each bird a particle its rationale is to continuously update the distance between the best position and current position of the optimization value le et al 2019 sun and duan 2019 hence a particle is used to optimize the solution of prediction problems the particles possess an initial velocity and position and fitness value the best position for the optimal solution can be recorded for each particle the direction and distance of the particle movements are determined using their velocity the fitness value of the particle is calculated by the fitness function the velocity and position of the particle in each iterative prediction process updates by contrasting the fitness value the velocity v and position x of the particles are updated using the following equations liu et al 2018 4 v i t 1 w v i t c 1 r 1 p i q t x i t c 2 r 2 p g q t x i t 5 x i t 1 x i t v t 1 where t is the iteration number w is the iteration weight r 1 and r 2 distribution 0 1 p i q t is the historical optimal position of the ith particle p g q t is the best position of group history c 1 and c 2 are nonnegative constant herein the velocity and position are usually limited to a certain interval v m a x v m a x and x m a x x m a x respectively in this study the pso is used to improve the input variables of elm method for predicting hs 3 3 extreme learning machine elm and kernel elm klem elm is a development algorithm for ann randomly produces the connection weights and neuron thresholds of the input and hidden layers ding et al 2015 huang et al 2015 in addition this method does not need adjusting the training processing the optimal solution can be obtained by setting the number of neurons in the hidden layer huang et al 2015 for n training samples x i y i x i r n y i r m i 1 2 n where m and n are the number of output and input variables respectively the output of elm can be calculated as follows 6 i 1 l β i f w i x i b i t j j 1 2 n where l is the number of hidden layers β i are the output weight that connects the ith hidden nodes to the output neurons w i are the input weight that connects the ith hidden layers to the input neurons b i are the threshold of the ith hidden layer nodes and t j are the output value of the jth training observations with zero error of the training process the elm can be expressed as follows 7 i 1 l β i f w i x i b i y j j 1 2 n here the moore penrose generalized inverse method mpm dou and zhou 2015 is used to estimate the model parameters the adjust weight of the output neurons based on mpm solution can be expressed as follows 8 β ˆ h y where h is the hidden layer output matrix of the elm h is the moore penrose generalized inverse of h and y denotes the optimum values of elm in the kelm the mercer s condition is applied to define the kernel matrix of kelm as follows lu et al 2017 9 ω n h n h n t ω n i j h x i h x j k x i x j where ω n is the kernel matrix i j 1 2 n and k x i x j are the kernel functions in this study the radial based function rbf kernel was chosen which can be expressed as follows 10 k x y exp γ x y 2 γ 0 where γ is the kernel parameter 3 4 wavelet based pso elm in the training stage the parameters of elm are tuned through the pso algorithm based on the final global best solution found by pso the elm output weights are generated by the moore penrose inverse method the final pso optimized elm is used to predict unknown hs value using test dataset the interested reader can find more details about pso elm in liu et al 2018 and kaloop et al 2019 the various input combinations and wavelet based hs prediction are conducted which will be discussed in section 4 in this study several input combinations are tested in pso elm for improvement in the hs prediction task the whole dataset is truncated into training and testing sets the training set is utilized in the pso elm calibration period the pso is sensitive to its intrinsic parameter values which are determined by the trial process the final values of pso parameters are set based on the good prediction performance of pso elm for several input combinations without wavelet the social and cognitive parameters of pso are set to c1 1 and c2 2 respectively and the population size is set to 30 for wavelet based models the social and cognitive parameters of pso are set to c1 1 7 and c2 2 respectively and the population size is set to 50 the inertia weight is set to w 0 9 and damping ration is 0 98 the iteration number for pso was 100 the performance of elm is sensitive to the number of hidden neurons which is determined by the trial process here mother wavelet db4 with 6 levels are used whereas this wavelet function is suitable for the meteorological data and after level 6 the decomposition coefficients are not changed obviously for the three input features gs ap and at the counting hidden neurons of the pso elm is 15 and the counting of elm parameter is 50 3 15 15 which are tuned using pso algorithm then the optimized elm parameters are set in the pso elm and output weights are determined by the moore penrose inverse method this calibrated pso elm is used to predict the test data set whereas for single elm the counting hidden neuron is 150 for rbf elm users do not require to specify the hidden numbers neuron the number of kernel parameter is set to one hundred for all cases the sig activation function is used in the hidden neurons for this study in the case of four input features gs ap at hs the counting hidden neurons of the pso elm is 6 and the counting of the elm parameter is 30 whereas for single elm the counting hidden neuron is 150 for wavelet decomposed input the counting hidden neurons of the pso elm is 50 and the counting of the elm parameter is 1450 28 50 50 whereas for single elm the counting hidden neuron is 150 fig 3 illustrates the wpso elm model for hs prediction herein according to quilty and adamowski 2018 the main forecasting error of hydrological applications occurs due to the decimation of dwt in the decomposition levels thus the reconstructed signals with the same length of the original data without lost any frequencies components were used in this study as presented in fig 3 3 5 models performance assessments in the current study three models with and without wavelet impact at two different depths of water are evaluated and compared elm welm kelm wkelm pso elm and wpso elm are designed and evaluated using different input variables at points p1 and p2 four statistical indices are used to evaluate the prediction models which are coefficient of determination r2 willmott s index of agreement d root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae the r2 ranges between 1 and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship between observed and predicted values and 1 means a perfect negative linear correlation and 0 demonstrates no relationship d ranges from to 1 closer values to 1 indicate better agreement between observed and predicted values the low values of rmse and mae reveal the acceptable accuracy of the models the four indices can be presented as follows 11 r 2 1 o i p i 2 o i o 2 12 d 1 o i p i 2 o i o p i p 2 13 r m s e 1 n o i p i 2 14 m a e 1 n o i p i where o and p are the observed and predicted values of hs respectively o a n d p are the mean values of the observed and predicted values respectively n is the number of the observation 4 results and discussions 4 1 input variables impacts according to the previous accuracies of the input output models that presented in table 2 r3 and r12 represent the pearson correlation coefficient r at 3 and 12 h lead times respectively the types and numbers of the input variables obviously affected the model s performance and accuracy and this also was reported and discussed in mafi and amirinia 2017 from table 2 it can be seen that the wind as a physical parameter is the fundamental variable impacts the accuracy of hs prediction values at that point different elements such as atmospheric variables and ocean conditions partly influence the hs prediction precision based on the data available and study area in the current study the physical and statistical approaches were employed to design the proposed models for predicting hs the available data are divided into four parameters wind wave water pressure and temperature and each parameter includes one or more variables as presented in table 3 in other words from table 3 the wind parameter contains three variables that are wind speed wind gust speed and wind direction whereas the wave characteristics possess the dominant and average wave periods and wave direction and the temperature properties comprises air surface and deep water temperatures and the water level pressure represents the measured water pressure from table 2 these parameters affect the model s accuracy here a non complex model that considers all data available was designed by using a significant variable from each parameter herein it should be mentioned that most previous studies utilized limited parameters or select variables that should improve the models while ignoring the impacts of other variables see table 2 furthermore the time delay of input variables was utilized to improve the models in this study a linear relationship is considered more details about models design for the wave height prediction can be found in chen 1995 akbarifard and radmanesh 2018 to estimate a simple nonlinear model can be applied at coastal and deep sea zones thus the significant linear correlation of one variable of each parameter with hs was selected to design the proposed models in other words one variable for each four parameters was used in this study the r and p value at a significant level 5 p5 were calculated in table 3 for the points p1 and p2 to evaluate the correlation and hypothesis of each variable on hs at different water depth zones from table 3 it can be seen that all variables significantly affect the prediction accuracy of hs at the deep depth water point while the wind direction at shallow depth water is not significant at level 5 this indicates that the wind direction can be ignored to estimate a general model of hs for both points the wind speed and wind gust speed are seen as highly correlated than other variables at both points so the higher linearity correlation at both points is considered thus the wind gust speed should be used for the wave parameter the average wave period shows higher correlation at both points in addition the dominant wave period and wave direction significantly affect the hs prediction at deep depth point than the shallow one so the average wave period is considered the significance of sea level pressure is lower than other parameters on the linearity correlation with hs and its impact is higher at deep depth point so it is considered in the model design finally the temperature effect is lower than wind and wave parameters on the linearity correlation with hs the hs prediction of both points are significantly affected by the air temperature effect while the water surface effect is high on the linearity correlation at shallow points and the deep water temperature is more important at the deep points thus the air temperature is considered in the model design fig 4 illustrates the relationship between the selected variables and hs in time and frequency domains at point p1 the time analysis of data shows that a high positive correlation between hs and wind speeds and the same for the average wave period with hs the most 95 cumulative probability of the data of hs ap and gs data are skewed left while the temperature data are skewed right since the pressure is seen distributed normally this indicates that the low number of gs and ap data can improve the prediction accuracy of hs while a huge number of data is needed from temperature parameter to improve the hs prediction models furthermore the effect of pressure in hs prediction is in between temperature and wind speed effects see table 2 this reveals that the impact of delay time or time lag of wind speed and wave period is high on the accuracy of the prediction hs özger and şen 2007 asma et al 2012 on the other hand fig 4 d shows the wavelet power of the input data signals and hs the dominant frequencies of hs ap and gs are equal while a small shift is observed between dominant frequencies of hs and pr and at in addition the correlation between wavelet power of data is seen high in the high frequency zone while in low frequency zone the wavelet power of gs and ap is high this means that the impact of gs and ap on predicting hs is higher than the impact of pr and at the fact discussed by mafi and amirinia 2017 is concluded with increasing the input variables the model accuracy increases thus wavelet decomposition is utilized to improve the accuracy of the input variables based on the distribution of elm weight matrix relative to the impact of decomposition coefficients of the input variables furthermore to study the impact of input variables five different forms of the pso elm model are evaluated using different inputs as presented in table 4 the evaluation of the different forms of the model show that the accuracy of forms 4 and 5 are high the results of both forms are approximately the same to predict the hs of point p1 here the error ratio er was implemented for the sensitivity analysis of the input variables the er of the models can be computed as ali et al 2015 15 e r o p e s t 2 o p e s t a l l 2 where o is observed hs p e s t is the predicted values of hs with particular variables p e s t a l l is the estimated values with all input selected variables from table 4 the error ratio of form 2 of the model reveals that the impact of other variables can be ignored to forecast hs also the 1 h time lag of input data was improved form 2 accuracy by 67 6 and 52 8 in training and testing stage respectively in terms of model error ratio while the accuracy of from 3 is improved by 78 3 and 54 2 in training and testing stages respectively this indicates that models forms 4 and 5 can be used accurately to estimate the hs of coastal zones to investigate the impact of wind speed only for hs modeling as a physical model the wind peak gust speed was used as an input variable in the pso elm model the r2 and rmse of this model were found 0 556 and 0 380 m respectively in the training stage while in the testing stage that were 0 550 and 0 311 m respectively this indicates the integrated physical and statistical approaches can be used for hs prediction moreover for extra evaluation of models 4 and 5 both models are assessed in training and testing stages at 3 12 36 and 72 h lead times as presented in fig 5 the figure shows that the accuracy of both models is approximately the same up to lead time 12 h after that model 4 performance is higher in terms of r2 d and mae in training and testing stages the rmse of model 5 is small at 36 and 72 h lead times in training and testing stages this indicates that the pressure time lag may affect model 4 accuracy at this point due to the nonlinearity correlation between hs and pr table 4 thus the following section discusses the evaluation of design models and the accuracy of both models at coastal and deep sea zones 4 2 models evaluations the model design strategy is based on the evaluation and comparison between elm kelm and pso elm models to select the best one that can be used to estimate an accurate hs the wavelet used with these models to assess the performance of wavelet impact on the model design thus point p1 is used to evaluate the three proposed models with and without wavelet decomposition using input variables of models 4 and 5 table 4 previous studies concluded that the wavelet improves the model s accuracy if the predictions are performed after the decomposition of both predictors and predictand series ozger 2010 here three algorithms are combined to improve the model s outputs in the hybrid wavelet models welm wkelm and wpso elm the reconstructed wavelet decomposition s coefficients were selected as inputs variables for elm welm and pso elm models to study the impact of wavelet in the model s accuracy the dwt and daubechies wavelet order 4 db4 were used the functional shape of db4 is similar with time series signals deka and prahlada 2012 evaluated the decomposition level of hs time series they studied 7 levels over different lead times of hs measurements and they found that with high lead times the models accuracy with high decomposition levels increased furthermore the decomposition level 6 shows the best level for 48 h lead times herein the increasing of decomposition level increases the number of inputs layers and increases the network complexity in training and testing accordingly thus in this study decomposition level 6 was selected to decrease the complexity of the model design fig 6 presents the decomposition levels of hs of point p2 to avoid the forecasting errors due to wdt errors the frequencies content of the original and reconstructed signals were determined and evaluated each signal used to build the model is presented in appendix a section of supplementary material sm from the sm no information losses were detected from the reconstructed signals of input variables this indicates that the reconstructed wavelet decompositions can be used for modeling the hs fig 7 and table 5 illustrate the statistical properties of the models at point p1 in the training and testing stages fig 7 presents a comparison between the designed models 4 and 5 with and without wavelet in the training stage at 1 h lead time from fig 7 in the case of input variables for model 4 the errors of models elm and welm are high the rmse of models elm and welm are 0 381 and 0 376 m respectively in the training stage the accuracy of the kelm model is approximately the same with and without wavelet the rmse of the kelm and wkelm are 0 149 and 0 147 m respectively while the wavelet improved the accuracy of the pso elm model the rmse of pso elm and wpso elm are 0 133 and 0 097 m respectively meanwhile in the case of model 5 the wavelet has decreased the accuracy of the elm and kelm models the rmse of elm and kelm are 0 167 and 0 142 respectively while for welm and wkelm are 0 303 and 0 152 m respectively nevertheless the wavelet improved the pso elm accuracy for model 5 also the rmse of pso elm and wpso elm are 0 128 and 0 096 m respectively the pso technique is the main factor in improving the predicted values for the hs this means that the wavelet improvement is based on the methods used not on the number of inputs the combination of the three methods improved the prediction values here in the training stage the results reveal that both models can be used to estimate the hs the comparison between the performances of models in testing stage table 5 shows that the kelm pso elm and wpso elm models outperform other models when using input variables of model 4 meanwhile the elm kelm pso elm and wpso elm models can be used to estimate the hs when using input variables of model 5 the wavelet has decreased the accuracy of the elm and kelm models in the testing stage while it improved the accuracy of the pso elm model the accuracy of the wpso elm model is approximately the same for both models 4 and 5 thus the pr impact is small in predicting the hs at coastal zones also in the case of using the elm model to predict hs it is recommended to use model 5 to estimate the hs the accuracy of the wpso elm model was assessed at different lead times in the training and testing stages as presented in table 6 fig 8 illustrates the scatter plot of models 4 and 5 performances at 12 h lead time and fig 9 shows the performance of the models at 36 h lead time in the testing stage in the training stage both models approximately give similar exhibitions for predicting hs at different lead times up to time lead 36 h the performance of model 5 is slightly higher than model 4 in addition a high correlation is observed between predicted and observed hs up to 72 h lead time r 0 68 at 72 h lead team for model 4 while in the testing stage the accuracy of model 4 is slightly higher than model 5 up to 36 h lead time but still both models can be used to estimate the hs of point p1 the correlation between observed and predicted hs values at 36 h lead time is 0 76 for model 5 furthermore from figs 8 and 9 it can be seen that the slope of linear fitting of model 5 at 12 and 36 h lead times is slightly higher or approximately equal that for model 4 consequently both models can be used to estimate the hs at coastal zones up to 36 h lead time in addition the models results indicate that the sea level pressure effect is small in predicting hs at coastal zones to a profound understanding of the input variables impacts point p2 was used to evaluate the performance of models 4 and 5 as presented in table 3 the impact of pr is high at point p2 table 7 presents the statistical evaluation of both models with different lead times at point p2 in the training and testing stages in addition figs 8 and 9 illustrate the predicted hs with observed hs at lead times 12 and 36 h respectively in the training stage models 4 and 5 performances are almost the same meanwhile model 4 slightly outperforms model 5 up to 72 h lead times the correlation and rmse of model 4 are 0 67 and 0 571 m respectively at 72 h lead times as the same the results of the testing stage show that the accuracy of model 4 is also slightly higher than model 5 at point p2 up to 36 h lead time the correlation and rmse at 36 h lead time of model 4 are 0 66 and 0 570 m respectively while the correlation and rmse of model 5 are 0 64 and 0 485 m furthermore from figs 8 and 9 the linear fitting slope of model 4 at 12 and 36 h lead times is slightly higher than that for model 5 thus both models can be used to predict the hs at the deep sea area and the results reveal that the impact of pr is still small when predicting the hs at deep sea zones on the other hand the pso elm and wpso elm models are evaluated with different lead times at point p2 fig 10 a illustrates the r2 and d statistical performances of both models by using input variables of models 5 in the testing stage the performances of both models are almost the same with slight high accuracy for the wpso elm model up to 3 h lead times after that the performance of the wpso elm model is high this indicates that in general the performance of the wpso elm model is high and can be used to estimate the hs at coastal and deep sea zones furthermore from table 2 and our results the correlation coefficients are calculated for wpso elm at point p2 and compared with previous studies results as presented in fig 10 b from this figure it can be concluded that the performance of the wpso elm model is better than ann mafi and amirinia 2017 with lower complexity and input variables furthermore this model can be used to detect the hs up to 36 h lead times with r 0 641 rmse 0 485 m and mae 0 512 m according to the above results wpso elm with gs ap pr at hs gives the best results among the others in parallel to the results of the wpso elm hs was estimated accurately when comparing r values in fig 10 b the hs predicted by wpso elm using the metrological data have commonly higher correlations than other models especially at high lead times and the models applied with and without pressure data have approximately same errors tables 6 and 7 and figs 8 and 9 in other words the classical and parametric methods have general remarks similar to the wpso elm model however the wpso elm model developed in this study have better results than those methods thus for more approval the developed wpso elm model 4 was evaluated at two different available time periods for the points p1 and p2 the independent measurements of the periods were from 12 april to december 31 2015 t1 and from december 31 2016 to october 28 2017 t2 for point p1 and at periods from december 31 2014 to december 31 2015 t1 and from december 31 2016 to april 8 2017 t2 for point p2 the data records of point p1 for t1 and t2 periods are 4875 and 5440 respectively while that for point p2 are 6967 and 1872 for time periods t1 and t2 respectively time leads up to 72 h were evaluated and tabulated in table 8 in addition fig 11 illustrates the performance of the model at 36 h lead times at the two water depth zones at the time period t1 from table 8 and fig 11 it is observed that the performance of model wpso elm is high and can be applied to predict the hs up to 36 h lead times in average the agreement between observed and predicted hs appears to be high the overall maximum and minimum correlation were 0 859 and 0 666 respectively for points p1 and p2 at the time leads 36 h in addition the quantity of data and point position were affected the model accuracy the precision of the model was indicated high at deep zones area the average correlation of the model was 0 573 at the 72 h lead times consequently the developed wpso elm model can be precisely used to estimate the wave height at coastal and deep sea zones 5 conclusions this paper managed to develop a wavelet pso elm wpso elm for a significant wave height prediction model the meteorological data of coastal and deep sea zones are used and evaluated the elm kelm and pso elm with and without wavelet were assessed and compared in addition the methods were evaluated at hourly and daily lead times 1 3 12 36 and 72 h the evaluations showed that the wpso elm had high prediction accuracy which could use for supporting some maritime applications and researches the modeling accuracy and performance of wpso elm are shown better than pso elm and previous studies methods for coastal and deep sea zones pso enhanced the fitting ability of elm more than the single elm and kelm and the testing precision of pso elm obviously improved the performance of pso elm was shown slightly lower than the accuracy of wpso elm at hourly lead times while the wavelet was enhanced the accuracy of it at daily lead times the performance of wpso elm was better than ann mafi and amirinia 2017 with lower complexity and input variables furthermore this model can be used to detect the significant wave height up to 36 h with r 0 641 rmse 0 485 m and mae 0 512 m the evaluation of input variables showed that the selected variables the time lag of wind gust speed average wave period air temperature water surface pressure and significant wave height can be used to estimate an accurate significant wave height at various lead times and the impact of water surface pressure is slightly small and can be neglected at coastal and deep sea zones credit

21662,predictions of significant wave height hs of oceans is highly required in advance for coastal and ocean engineering applications therefore this study aims to precisely predict the ocean wave height via developing a novel hybrid algorithm wavelet particle swarm optimization pso and extreme learning machine elm methods were used and integrated to design the wavelet pso elm wpso elm model for estimating the wave height belongs to coastal and deep sea stations a comparative analysis among the elm kernel elm kelm and pso elm models were performed with and without wavelet integration in addition wave height prediction time leads up to 72 h were assessed the meteorological data including wave height for one year have been utilized and evaluated to design and validate the proposed model the data obtained from buoys situated off the south east coast of the us the results demonstrated that the wpso elm outperforms other models to predict the wave height in both hourly and daily lead times in addition the wavelet increased the accuracy of the prediction models with the goal that coefficient of determination r2 willmott s index of agreement d root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae were obtained for the lead time 12 h equivalent 0 794 0 784 0 374 m and 0 297 m respectively for the wpso elm and 0 643 0 736 0 495 m and 0 363 m respectively for the pso elm comparing the obtained results revealed the better performance of the wpso elm model in predicting wave height for coastal and deep sea regions up to 36 h lead times keywords wave height prediction wavelet particle swarm optimization extreme learning machine 1 introduction the change of significant wave height hs is one of the crucial segments of surface oceans or seas components wave heights are influenced by the environmental changes and earth system particularly the waves that generated because of climate changes earle and malahoff 1979 molland 2008 james 2017 accurate and reliable prediction of hs is an important task for maritime and engineering applications such as fishing prospecting and coastal requirements molland 2008 gotoh and khayyer 2016 ghorbani et al 2017 as such physical and statistical strategies are used to estimate the hs casas prat et al 2014 the physical strategies consider that the waves are mainly generated by the action of wind on the water surface and the waves development follows the duration and fetch limited growth laws hwang 2006 while the statistical imperial techniques have been used to discover the relationship between climate waves and atmospheric variables wang et al 2012 although hs models are driven by surface winds the climate waves should be considered in hs prediction therefore wind speed as a physical parameter and climate change variables as a statistical approach have been widely used to design the prediction models of hs using nonlinear mathematical models casas prat et al 2014 mafi and amirinia 2017 kumar et al 2018 the non stationarity and non linearity of the time series of ocean characteristics i e hs wave periods and the natural change effects i e wind temperature affect the forecasting accuracy the input output and forecast time leads for time series models are almost insignificant especially with expanding the forecast time leads kumar et al 2017 mafi and amirinia 2017 akbarifard and radmanesh 2018 kumar et al 2018 moreover meucci et al 2020 established the relationship between ocean characteristics and natural changes based on the guidance of wave modeling and evaluation wmo 1998 there are various prediction methods to estimate short and long period terms of hs such as wave energy balance based models mase et al 2005 yasuda et al 2020 numerical models chun and suh 2019 time series models duan and huang 2016 an artificial intelligent technique based linear and nonlinear models kagemoto 2020 and hybrid models zhao and wang 2019 also soft computing techniques such as the artificial neural network ann fuzzy systems and support vector machine svm have been applied to the hs modeling asma et al 2012 ghorbani et al 2017 kumar et al 2017 mafi and amirinia 2017 despite the fact that the accuracy of soft computing techniques for hs prediction is higher than that of the traditional methods they are still having some limitations for example the wind speed as one parameter storm duration and wave periods are mostly used to estimate the hs in the traditional or recent development methods wilson 1965 yueh et al 2015 wang et al 2017 choi et al 2019 on the other hand anns have a solid equal handling capacity yet that have number of issues such as generalization power and gradient based parameter learning liu et al 2018 thus to overcome these issues extreme learning machine elm has been introduced and presented by huang et al 2015 the elm is another type of single hidden layer feedforward neural network araújo et al 2006 for that it has been used in the prediction of hs and different applications kumar et al 2018 liu et al 2018 eshtay et al 2019 however hs is a complicated non linear dynamic system and it is impacted by various components valamanesh et al 2016 the time series prediction of non stationarity data by using elm method only will lead to the homogenization of the different characteristics of the original input data which could affect the prediction accuracy liu et al 2018 accordingly the non stationarity of the time series of hs and input variables should be reduced the wavelet analysis is a good tool that can be used for the non stationary data rhif et al 2019 it is applied for analysis of the signals in time and frequency domains and the important derivative of the fourier transform deka and prahlada 2012 the wavelet transform wt utilizes to estimate the low and high frequencies of the signals so it is used to smooth out the time series rhif et al 2019 the data can be represented by using different resolution intervals by discrete wavelet transform dwt thus the complex signals of meteorological data including hs can be decomposed into several simple time series in different frequencies in other words decomposed time series can handle non stationarity and nonlinearity of signals by using it as input variables for the elm so high accurate hs may be obtained predictions are more accurate than those obtained by original signals due to the fact that the features of the subseries are obvious deka and prahlada 2012 the application of wt with elm and other methods have been employed in different applications for instance deka and prahlada 2012 established a prediction model for the time series of wave height using wt ann and the results outperformed that of the ann model ghaemi et al 2019 used wt and regression methods to predict evaporation time series and they concluded that combining both the wt and regression accomplished good results applications of wavelet decomposition to improve the accuracy of hs and water level predictions can be found in quilty and adamowski 2018 altunkaynak 2019 altunkaynak and kartal 2019 chen et al 2019 tür 2020 in addition particle swarm optimization pso is a swarm intelligence optimization algorithm by updating the distance between the current and best locations it is proposed by kennedy and elberhart 1995 the optimization of input weights and hidden biases of elm are adapted by pso to improve the prediction accuracy of a single elm liu et al 2018 integrating the pso with the elm have been used to improve the accuracy of prediction models pso was used for estimating temperature changes and the results showed its performance was better than the ann esfandeh and sedighizadeh 2011 in addition it was outperformed backpropagation ann in the prediction model of water consumption by integrated with svm lu et al 2009 moreover the hybrid model of the pso adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system pso anfis was applied to improve the anfis model for the reflection coefficient of the semicircular breakwater kundapura and hegde 2018 pso elm significantly outperformed higher prediction accuracy than pso ann and kernel elm klem into modeling resilient modulus of pavement material kaloop et al 2019 the pso ann outperformed the conventional ann accuracy for modeling historical length values of hs gopinath and dwarakish 2016 recently there are limited applications of elm to model hs while other methods accuracies were higher than elm to predict the hs of ocean waves for instance kumar et al 2017 compared elm and minimal resource allocation network mran and they found the mran accuracy is higher than elm to predict the hs furthermore the ensemble of elm ens elm was compared by kumar et al 2018 with elm online sequential elm and svm and the results showed that the ens elm outperformed other models for hs prediction of ocean waves fan et al 2020 compared long short term memory network lstm svm elm residual network resnet random forest rf and backpropagation ann bpnn and found that the performance of lstm was high to model hs herein the combined models improved complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition method with adaptive noise elm iceemdan elm ali and prasad 2019 empirical mode decomposition svm emd svm zhao and wang 2019 were applied to estimate the time series of hs and the results showed that these models can be used to improve the standalone models in this paper a hybrid wpso elm model to predict the hs was developed for this purpose the authors selected two points in the south east of the usa since many storms were observed previously in this area valamanesh et al 2016 coastal and deep sea zones are chosen to validate the proposed model in various meteorological characteristics the modeling of hs at this area can be considered as a reference for the management of onshore and offshore applications for that this study aims to accomplish the following objectives i design a pso elm prediction model of regional hs using dwt and different lead times ii evaluate the performance of the wpso elm model by contrasting it by elm and kelm models and results of previous studies and iii analyze the input variables effects on hs modeling 2 study area and data the significant wave height and meteorological series were downloaded from noaa s national data buoy center https www ndbc noaa gov two stations were utilized in this study fig 1 p1 station 41 025 35 025 n 75 363 w in the coastal zone water depth 59 4 m and p2 station 41 048 31 838 n 69 585 w in the deep

data recorded for each station is given in table 1 the obtained number of data records for points p1 and p2 are 6680 and 8727 respectively the data were divided into training 80 and testing for model approval 20 1336 and 1746 data records for points p1 and p2 respectively the independent testing data were used for model approval fig 2 shows the hs records of both points 3 methods 3 1 wavelet analysis the dwt or simply wavelet analysis is more useful than fourier transformation for the frequencies contents analysis of signals in the time domain without redundant components and it is a suitable tool for the elimination different noises ramos et al 2017 sayed et al 2017 in addition different cut off frequencies are utilized to analyze the signal at different scales in dwt deka and prahlada 2012 further information on wavelet analysis theory and applications can be found in alzaq and üstündağ 2018 rhif et al 2019 tikhamarine et al 2019 in the current study the dwt was used to improve the designed prediction models in this method the signal s divides into two parts using low and high pass filters which are approximations a and details d components respectively deka and prahlada 2012 sayed et al 2017 the decomposition of the original signal into j decompositions levels can be expressed as follows 1 s j t a j 1 t d j 1 t these decomposition levels are generally defined as a set of basic functions ψ c b t that can be generated by translating and scaling dilation which called mother wavelet 2 ψ c b t c 0 5 ψ t b c where c and b are dilation and translation factors respectively in dwt the c 2 j and b k2 j where k is a location index running from 1 to 2 j n n is the number of observations and j runs from 0 to j thus the dwt can be expressed as follows 3 ψ j k t 2 j 2 ψ 2 j t k from the above the main factors in dwt are the decomposition levels and mother wavelet in this study daubechies wavelet order 4 db4 was selected as a mother wavelet since it is suitable for the properties of signals measurements deka and prahlada 2012 and 6 levels were chosen as decomposition levels as more decomposition levels will not change obviously on the wavelet coefficients these selections were also based on the deka and prahlada 2012 study and results of using dwt to predict wave height in the current study the reconstructed wavelet decomposition coefficients were used to design the proposed model the low and high frequencies components of original signals were considered with the same length of the original data to avoid the dwt prediction errors quilty and adamowski 2018 3 2 particle swarm optimization pso the pso simulates movement behavior and calls each bird a particle its rationale is to continuously update the distance between the best position and current position of the optimization value le et al 2019 sun and duan 2019 hence a particle is used to optimize the solution of prediction problems the particles possess an initial velocity and position and fitness value the best position for the optimal solution can be recorded for each particle the direction and distance of the particle movements are determined using their velocity the fitness value of the particle is calculated by the fitness function the velocity and position of the particle in each iterative prediction process updates by contrasting the fitness value the velocity v and position x of the particles are updated using the following equations liu et al 2018 4 v i t 1 w v i t c 1 r 1 p i q t x i t c 2 r 2 p g q t x i t 5 x i t 1 x i t v t 1 where t is the iteration number w is the iteration weight r 1 and r 2 distribution 0 1 p i q t is the historical optimal position of the ith particle p g q t is the best position of group history c 1 and c 2 are nonnegative constant herein the velocity and position are usually limited to a certain interval v m a x v m a x and x m a x x m a x respectively in this study the pso is used to improve the input variables of elm method for predicting hs 3 3 extreme learning machine elm and kernel elm klem elm is a development algorithm for ann randomly produces the connection weights and neuron thresholds of the input and hidden layers ding et al 2015 huang et al 2015 in addition this method does not need adjusting the training processing the optimal solution can be obtained by setting the number of neurons in the hidden layer huang et al 2015 for n training samples x i y i x i r n y i r m i 1 2 n where m and n are the number of output and input variables respectively the output of elm can be calculated as follows 6 i 1 l β i f w i x i b i t j j 1 2 n where l is the number of hidden layers β i are the output weight that connects the ith hidden nodes to the output neurons w i are the input weight that connects the ith hidden layers to the input neurons b i are the threshold of the ith hidden layer nodes and t j are the output value of the jth training observations with zero error of the training process the elm can be expressed as follows 7 i 1 l β i f w i x i b i y j j 1 2 n here the moore penrose generalized inverse method mpm dou and zhou 2015 is used to estimate the model parameters the adjust weight of the output neurons based on mpm solution can be expressed as follows 8 β ˆ h y where h is the hidden layer output matrix of the elm h is the moore penrose generalized inverse of h and y denotes the optimum values of elm in the kelm the mercer s condition is applied to define the kernel matrix of kelm as follows lu et al 2017 9 ω n h n h n t ω n i j h x i h x j k x i x j where ω n is the kernel matrix i j 1 2 n and k x i x j are the kernel functions in this study the radial based function rbf kernel was chosen which can be expressed as follows 10 k x y exp γ x y 2 γ 0 where γ is the kernel parameter 3 4 wavelet based pso elm in the training stage the parameters of elm are tuned through the pso algorithm based on the final global best solution found by pso the elm output weights are generated by the moore penrose inverse method the final pso optimized elm is used to predict unknown hs value using test dataset the interested reader can find more details about pso elm in liu et al 2018 and kaloop et al 2019 the various input combinations and wavelet based hs prediction are conducted which will be discussed in section 4 in this study several input combinations are tested in pso elm for improvement in the hs prediction task the whole dataset is truncated into training and testing sets the training set is utilized in the pso elm calibration period the pso is sensitive to its intrinsic parameter values which are determined by the trial process the final values of pso parameters are set based on the good prediction performance of pso elm for several input combinations without wavelet the social and cognitive parameters of pso are set to c1 1 and c2 2 respectively and the population size is set to 30 for wavelet based models the social and cognitive parameters of pso are set to c1 1 7 and c2 2 respectively and the population size is set to 50 the inertia weight is set to w 0 9 and damping ration is 0 98 the iteration number for pso was 100 the performance of elm is sensitive to the number of hidden neurons which is determined by the trial process here mother wavelet db4 with 6 levels are used whereas this wavelet function is suitable for the meteorological data and after level 6 the decomposition coefficients are not changed obviously for the three input features gs ap and at the counting hidden neurons of the pso elm is 15 and the counting of elm parameter is 50 3 15 15 which are tuned using pso algorithm then the optimized elm parameters are set in the pso elm and output weights are determined by the moore penrose inverse method this calibrated pso elm is used to predict the test data set whereas for single elm the counting hidden neuron is 150 for rbf elm users do not require to specify the hidden numbers neuron the number of kernel parameter is set to one hundred for all cases the sig activation function is used in the hidden neurons for this study in the case of four input features gs ap at hs the counting hidden neurons of the pso elm is 6 and the counting of the elm parameter is 30 whereas for single elm the counting hidden neuron is 150 for wavelet decomposed input the counting hidden neurons of the pso elm is 50 and the counting of the elm parameter is 1450 28 50 50 whereas for single elm the counting hidden neuron is 150 fig 3 illustrates the wpso elm model for hs prediction herein according to quilty and adamowski 2018 the main forecasting error of hydrological applications occurs due to the decimation of dwt in the decomposition levels thus the reconstructed signals with the same length of the original data without lost any frequencies components were used in this study as presented in fig 3 3 5 models performance assessments in the current study three models with and without wavelet impact at two different depths of water are evaluated and compared elm welm kelm wkelm pso elm and wpso elm are designed and evaluated using different input variables at points p1 and p2 four statistical indices are used to evaluate the prediction models which are coefficient of determination r2 willmott s index of agreement d root mean square error rmse and mean absolute error mae the r2 ranges between 1 and 1 where 1 indicates a perfect positive linear relationship between observed and predicted values and 1 means a perfect negative linear correlation and 0 demonstrates no relationship d ranges from to 1 closer values to 1 indicate better agreement between observed and predicted values the low values of rmse and mae reveal the acceptable accuracy of the models the four indices can be presented as follows 11 r 2 1 o i p i 2 o i o 2 12 d 1 o i p i 2 o i o p i p 2 13 r m s e 1 n o i p i 2 14 m a e 1 n o i p i where o and p are the observed and predicted values of hs respectively o a n d p are the mean values of the observed and predicted values respectively n is the number of the observation 4 results and discussions 4 1 input variables impacts according to the previous accuracies of the input output models that presented in table 2 r3 and r12 represent the pearson correlation coefficient r at 3 and 12 h lead times respectively the types and numbers of the input variables obviously affected the model s performance and accuracy and this also was reported and discussed in mafi and amirinia 2017 from table 2 it can be seen that the wind as a physical parameter is the fundamental variable impacts the accuracy of hs prediction values at that point different elements such as atmospheric variables and ocean conditions partly influence the hs prediction precision based on the data available and study area in the current study the physical and statistical approaches were employed to design the proposed models for predicting hs the available data are divided into four parameters wind wave water pressure and temperature and each parameter includes one or more variables as presented in table 3 in other words from table 3 the wind parameter contains three variables that are wind speed wind gust speed and wind direction whereas the wave characteristics possess the dominant and average wave periods and wave direction and the temperature properties comprises air surface and deep water temperatures and the water level pressure represents the measured water pressure from table 2 these parameters affect the model s accuracy here a non complex model that considers all data available was designed by using a significant variable from each parameter herein it should be mentioned that most previous studies utilized limited parameters or select variables that should improve the models while ignoring the impacts of other variables see table 2 furthermore the time delay of input variables was utilized to improve the models in this study a linear relationship is considered more details about models design for the wave height prediction can be found in chen 1995 akbarifard and radmanesh 2018 to estimate a simple nonlinear model can be applied at coastal and deep sea zones thus the significant linear correlation of one variable of each parameter with hs was selected to design the proposed models in other words one variable for each four parameters was used in this study the r and p value at a significant level 5 p5 were calculated in table 3 for the points p1 and p2 to evaluate the correlation and hypothesis of each variable on hs at different water depth zones from table 3 it can be seen that all variables significantly affect the prediction accuracy of hs at the deep depth water point while the wind direction at shallow depth water is not significant at level 5 this indicates that the wind direction can be ignored to estimate a general model of hs for both points the wind speed and wind gust speed are seen as highly correlated than other variables at both points so the higher linearity correlation at both points is considered thus the wind gust speed should be used for the wave parameter the average wave period shows higher correlation at both points in addition the dominant wave period and wave direction significantly affect the hs prediction at deep depth point than the shallow one so the average wave period is considered the significance of sea level pressure is lower than other parameters on the linearity correlation with hs and its impact is higher at deep depth point so it is considered in the model design finally the temperature effect is lower than wind and wave parameters on the linearity correlation with hs the hs prediction of both points are significantly affected by the air temperature effect while the water surface effect is high on the linearity correlation at shallow points and the deep water temperature is more important at the deep points thus the air temperature is considered in the model design fig 4 illustrates the relationship between the selected variables and hs in time and frequency domains at point p1 the time analysis of data shows that a high positive correlation between hs and wind speeds and the same for the average wave period with hs the most 95 cumulative probability of the data of hs ap and gs data are skewed left while the temperature data are skewed right since the pressure is seen distributed normally this indicates that the low number of gs and ap data can improve the prediction accuracy of hs while a huge number of data is needed from temperature parameter to improve the hs prediction models furthermore the effect of pressure in hs prediction is in between temperature and wind speed effects see table 2 this reveals that the impact of delay time or time lag of wind speed and wave period is high on the accuracy of the prediction hs özger and şen 2007 asma et al 2012 on the other hand fig 4 d shows the wavelet power of the input data signals and hs the dominant frequencies of hs ap and gs are equal while a small shift is observed between dominant frequencies of hs and pr and at in addition the correlation between wavelet power of data is seen high in the high frequency zone while in low frequency zone the wavelet power of gs and ap is high this means that the impact of gs and ap on predicting hs is higher than the impact of pr and at the fact discussed by mafi and amirinia 2017 is concluded with increasing the input variables the model accuracy increases thus wavelet decomposition is utilized to improve the accuracy of the input variables based on the distribution of elm weight matrix relative to the impact of decomposition coefficients of the input variables furthermore to study the impact of input variables five different forms of the pso elm model are evaluated using different inputs as presented in table 4 the evaluation of the different forms of the model show that the accuracy of forms 4 and 5 are high the results of both forms are approximately the same to predict the hs of point p1 here the error ratio er was implemented for the sensitivity analysis of the input variables the er of the models can be computed as ali et al 2015 15 e r o p e s t 2 o p e s t a l l 2 where o is observed hs p e s t is the predicted values of hs with particular variables p e s t a l l is the estimated values with all input selected variables from table 4 the error ratio of form 2 of the model reveals that the impact of other variables can be ignored to forecast hs also the 1 h time lag of input data was improved form 2 accuracy by 67 6 and 52 8 in training and testing stage respectively in terms of model error ratio while the accuracy of from 3 is improved by 78 3 and 54 2 in training and testing stages respectively this indicates that models forms 4 and 5 can be used accurately to estimate the hs of coastal zones to investigate the impact of wind speed only for hs modeling as a physical model the wind peak gust speed was used as an input variable in the pso elm model the r2 and rmse of this model were found 0 556 and 0 380 m respectively in the training stage while in the testing stage that were 0 550 and 0 311 m respectively this indicates the integrated physical and statistical approaches can be used for hs prediction moreover for extra evaluation of models 4 and 5 both models are assessed in training and testing stages at 3 12 36 and 72 h lead times as presented in fig 5 the figure shows that the accuracy of both models is approximately the same up to lead time 12 h after that model 4 performance is higher in terms of r2 d and mae in training and testing stages the rmse of model 5 is small at 36 and 72 h lead times in training and testing stages this indicates that the pressure time lag may affect model 4 accuracy at this point due to the nonlinearity correlation between hs and pr table 4 thus the following section discusses the evaluation of design models and the accuracy of both models at coastal and deep sea zones 4 2 models evaluations the model design strategy is based on the evaluation and comparison between elm kelm and pso elm models to select the best one that can be used to estimate an accurate hs the wavelet used with these models to assess the performance of wavelet impact on the model design thus point p1 is used to evaluate the three proposed models with and without wavelet decomposition using input variables of models 4 and 5 table 4 previous studies concluded that the wavelet improves the model s accuracy if the predictions are performed after the decomposition of both predictors and predictand series ozger 2010 here three algorithms are combined to improve the model s outputs in the hybrid wavelet models welm wkelm and wpso elm the reconstructed wavelet decomposition s coefficients were selected as inputs variables for elm welm and pso elm models to study the impact of wavelet in the model s accuracy the dwt and daubechies wavelet order 4 db4 were used the functional shape of db4 is similar with time series signals deka and prahlada 2012 evaluated the decomposition level of hs time series they studied 7 levels over different lead times of hs measurements and they found that with high lead times the models accuracy with high decomposition levels increased furthermore the decomposition level 6 shows the best level for 48 h lead times herein the increasing of decomposition level increases the number of inputs layers and increases the network complexity in training and testing accordingly thus in this study decomposition level 6 was selected to decrease the complexity of the model design fig 6 presents the decomposition levels of hs of point p2 to avoid the forecasting errors due to wdt errors the frequencies content of the original and reconstructed signals were determined and evaluated each signal used to build the model is presented in appendix a section of supplementary material sm from the sm no information losses were detected from the reconstructed signals of input variables this indicates that the reconstructed wavelet decompositions can be used for modeling the hs fig 7 and table 5 illustrate the statistical properties of the models at point p1 in the training and testing stages fig 7 presents a comparison between the designed models 4 and 5 with and without wavelet in the training stage at 1 h lead time from fig 7 in the case of input variables for model 4 the errors of models elm and welm are high the rmse of models elm and welm are 0 381 and 0 376 m respectively in the training stage the accuracy of the kelm model is approximately the same with and without wavelet the rmse of the kelm and wkelm are 0 149 and 0 147 m respectively while the wavelet improved the accuracy of the pso elm model the rmse of pso elm and wpso elm are 0 133 and 0 097 m respectively meanwhile in the case of model 5 the wavelet has decreased the accuracy of the elm and kelm models the rmse of elm and kelm are 0 167 and 0 142 respectively while for welm and wkelm are 0 303 and 0 152 m respectively nevertheless the wavelet improved the pso elm accuracy for model 5 also the rmse of pso elm and wpso elm are 0 128 and 0 096 m respectively the pso technique is the main factor in improving the predicted values for the hs this means that the wavelet improvement is based on the methods used not on the number of inputs the combination of the three methods improved the prediction values here in the training stage the results reveal that both models can be used to estimate the hs the comparison between the performances of models in testing stage table 5 shows that the kelm pso elm and wpso elm models outperform other models when using input variables of model 4 meanwhile the elm kelm pso elm and wpso elm models can be used to estimate the hs when using input variables of model 5 the wavelet has decreased the accuracy of the elm and kelm models in the testing stage while it improved the accuracy of the pso elm model the accuracy of the wpso elm model is approximately the same for both models 4 and 5 thus the pr impact is small in predicting the hs at coastal zones also in the case of using the elm model to predict hs it is recommended to use model 5 to estimate the hs the accuracy of the wpso elm model was assessed at different lead times in the training and testing stages as presented in table 6 fig 8 illustrates the scatter plot of models 4 and 5 performances at 12 h lead time and fig 9 shows the performance of the models at 36 h lead time in the testing stage in the training stage both models approximately give similar exhibitions for predicting hs at different lead times up to time lead 36 h the performance of model 5 is slightly higher than model 4 in addition a high correlation is observed between predicted and observed hs up to 72 h lead time r 0 68 at 72 h lead team for model 4 while in the testing stage the accuracy of model 4 is slightly higher than model 5 up to 36 h lead time but still both models can be used to estimate the hs of point p1 the correlation between observed and predicted hs values at 36 h lead time is 0 76 for model 5 furthermore from figs 8 and 9 it can be seen that the slope of linear fitting of model 5 at 12 and 36 h lead times is slightly higher or approximately equal that for model 4 consequently both models can be used to estimate the hs at coastal zones up to 36 h lead time in addition the models results indicate that the sea level pressure effect is small in predicting hs at coastal zones to a profound understanding of the input variables impacts point p2 was used to evaluate the performance of models 4 and 5 as presented in table 3 the impact of pr is high at point p2 table 7 presents the statistical evaluation of both models with different lead times at point p2 in the training and testing stages in addition figs 8 and 9 illustrate the predicted hs with observed hs at lead times 12 and 36 h respectively in the training stage models 4 and 5 performances are almost the same meanwhile model 4 slightly outperforms model 5 up to 72 h lead times the correlation and rmse of model 4 are 0 67 and 0 571 m respectively at 72 h lead times as the same the results of the testing stage show that the accuracy of model 4 is also slightly higher than model 5 at point p2 up to 36 h lead time the correlation and rmse at 36 h lead time of model 4 are 0 66 and 0 570 m respectively while the correlation and rmse of model 5 are 0 64 and 0 485 m furthermore from figs 8 and 9 the linear fitting slope of model 4 at 12 and 36 h lead times is slightly higher than that for model 5 thus both models can be used to predict the hs at the deep sea area and the results reveal that the impact of pr is still small when predicting the hs at deep sea zones on the other hand the pso elm and wpso elm models are evaluated with different lead times at point p2 fig 10 a illustrates the r2 and d statistical performances of both models by using input variables of models 5 in the testing stage the performances of both models are almost the same with slight high accuracy for the wpso elm model up to 3 h lead times after that the performance of the wpso elm model is high this indicates that in general the performance of the wpso elm model is high and can be used to estimate the hs at coastal and deep sea zones furthermore from table 2 and our results the correlation coefficients are calculated for wpso elm at point p2 and compared with previous studies results as presented in fig 10 b from this figure it can be concluded that the performance of the wpso elm model is better than ann mafi and amirinia 2017 with lower complexity and input variables furthermore this model can be used to detect the hs up to 36 h lead times with r 0 641 rmse 0 485 m and mae 0 512 m according to the above results wpso elm with gs ap pr at hs gives the best results among the others in parallel to the results of the wpso elm hs was estimated accurately when comparing r values in fig 10 b the hs predicted by wpso elm using the metrological data have commonly higher correlations than other models especially at high lead times and the models applied with and without pressure data have approximately same errors tables 6 and 7 and figs 8 and 9 in other words the classical and parametric methods have general remarks similar to the wpso elm model however the wpso elm model developed in this study have better results than those methods thus for more approval the developed wpso elm model 4 was evaluated at two different available time periods for the points p1 and p2 the independent measurements of the periods were from 12 april to december 31 2015 t1 and from december 31 2016 to october 28 2017 t2 for point p1 and at periods from december 31 2014 to december 31 2015 t1 and from december 31 2016 to april 8 2017 t2 for point p2 the data records of point p1 for t1 and t2 periods are 4875 and 5440 respectively while that for point p2 are 6967 and 1872 for time periods t1 and t2 respectively time leads up to 72 h were evaluated and tabulated in table 8 in addition fig 11 illustrates the performance of the model at 36 h lead times at the two water depth zones at the time period t1 from table 8 and fig 11 it is observed that the performance of model wpso elm is high and can be applied to predict the hs up to 36 h lead times in average the agreement between observed and predicted hs appears to be high the overall maximum and minimum correlation were 0 859 and 0 666 respectively for points p1 and p2 at the time leads 36 h in addition the quantity of data and point position were affected the model accuracy the precision of the model was indicated high at deep zones area the average correlation of the model was 0 573 at the 72 h lead times consequently the developed wpso elm model can be precisely used to estimate the wave height at coastal and deep sea zones 5 conclusions this paper managed to develop a wavelet pso elm wpso elm for a significant wave height prediction model the meteorological data of coastal and deep sea zones are used and evaluated the elm kelm and pso elm with and without wavelet were assessed and compared in addition the methods were evaluated at hourly and daily lead times 1 3 12 36 and 72 h the evaluations showed that the wpso elm had high prediction accuracy which could use for supporting some maritime applications and researches the modeling accuracy and performance of wpso elm are shown better than pso elm and previous studies methods for coastal and deep sea zones pso enhanced the fitting ability of elm more than the single elm and kelm and the testing precision of pso elm obviously improved the performance of pso elm was shown slightly lower than the accuracy of wpso elm at hourly lead times while the wavelet was enhanced the accuracy of it at daily lead times the performance of wpso elm was better than ann mafi and amirinia 2017 with lower complexity and input variables furthermore this model can be used to detect the significant wave height up to 36 h with r 0 641 rmse 0 485 m and mae 0 512 m the evaluation of input variables showed that the selected variables the time lag of wind gust speed average wave period air temperature water surface pressure and significant wave height can be used to estimate an accurate significant wave height at various lead times and the impact of water surface pressure is slightly small and can be neglected at coastal and deep sea zones credit

21663,in the present study the effect of collar on temporal scour depth variation at the base of a collar protected circular pier was investigated experimental results revealed that a collar performs efficiently by reducing the rate of temporal scour depth variation around the pier the efficiency of a collar for different diameters and elevations has been studied through flume experiments under clear water scour condition analysis of obtained experimental results indicates that a collar performs efficiently and reduces maximum equilibrium scour at undisturbed bed level further the observations of the study revealed that the effectiveness of a collar increases with increase in collar diameter and decreases with the elevation of collar finally an empirical equation has been proposed to compute the time dependent scour depth at the front of the collar protected piers the proposed equation has been validated and proven to be applicable to a wide range of variables under the effect of non contraction flow a sensitivity analysis has been done and it indicates that the collar diameter and its elevation are the most influencing parameters keywords scour depth collar

distribution ρ fluid density ρ s sediment density ν kinematic viscosity of fluid 1 introduction local scour around the bridge pier is mainly caused by the perturbation of flow field at the upstream face of the obstruction and upstream horseshoe vortex system with wake vortices at downstream caused flow separation around the pier kumar et al 1999 tafarojnoruz et al 2010 several bridges were failed due to the local scour around the bridge elements such as piers and abutments and a huge budget is spending each financial year to reconstruct or repair the bridge elements kumcu et al 2007 in recent decades scour hazards throughout the world have attracted extensive attention kumcu et al 2007 heidarpour et al 2010 jueyi et al 2010 tafarojnoruz et al 2010 lanca et al 2013 pandey et al 2018 a b choufu et al 2019 ghaderi and abbasi 2019 because of failures several researchers have worked on it during the past few years melville and coleman 2000 kothyari et al 2007 kumcu et al 2007 and pu and lim 2014 the scour processes and flow pattern near the bridge piers are so complicated that it is difficult to use a single scour depth relationship azamathulla 2012 azamathulla et al 2014 qi and gao 2014 qi et al 2016 therefore field engineers use alternative methods to protect the piers against scour problem there are two approaches for reducing the local scour around the bridge elements i e i bed armoring melville 1988 dey and raikar 2007 and ii flow altering method kumcu et al 2007 tafarojnoruz et al 2010 in the first method the scour process is reduced by armor particles or by providing an appropriate riprap around the bridge elements in the second method scour processes are reduced using different pier scour protection devices viz collars slots fins bed sills etc principally these devices reduce the scour rate by reducing the impact of horseshoe vortex kumcu et al 2007 tafarojnoruz et al 2010 fig 1 shows a definition sketch of scour around the circular pier with a collar several bridges have been built over seabed and researchers have also investigated scour associated with anthropogenic activities in the marine environment continues to be governed by uncertainty related to the complexity of different foundations as well as the ocean waves bateni and jeng 2007 zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 and many more under unsteady condition it is clearly stated by researchers that the waves and current action are equally responsible for the seabed scour bateni and jeng 2007 zhang et al 2017 but for the steady flow waves and current actions are not the key parameters that initiate or affect the scouring and erosion processes at the base of any erected hydraulic structure yuan et al 2017 yang et al 2020 present research wok deals with the pier scour protection work under steady flow so it must be beneficial for the design of bridge piers over seabed under non current action previous studies on pier scour protection devices especially slots and collars are inspired by the need to reduce the vortex system the scour depth is high in front of the pier and the scouring hole develops along the pier tafarojnoruz et al 2010 if a collar provides with a pier at the bed level or near the bed it separates the extreme downflow and shows the maximum efficiency kumar et al 1999 it has been found by the previous investigators that providing a slot in a pier can reduce the scour processes however it depends on its location chiew 1992 kumar et al 1999 for reducing local scour the collars are more efficient than the slots tafarojnoruz et al 2010 for field problems slots in the piers are usually obstructed by floating debris and could be inefficient for field problems several studies have been completed for pier scour with and without pier scour protection devices kumar et al 1999 oliveto and hager 2002 kothyari et al 2007 kumcu et al 2007 tafarojnoruz et al 2010 pandey et al 2017 and many more however there are very few studies available on temporal scour depth variation in the presence of pier scour protection devices kumcu et al 2007 kumcu et al 2007 conducted a temporal scour depth study around the abutments in the presence of collar and stated that collar can reduce the scour up to 80 however it depends on its location previous investigators conducted experiments for pier scour in the presence of collars and found collars reduced the scour effectively chiew 1992 kumar et al 1999 zarrati et al 2004 moncada m et al 2009 however no one was considered the importance of temporal scour depth variation however for piers without protection devices several studies have been completed for temporal scour depth variation melville and coleman 2000 oliveto and hager 2002 kothyari et al 2007 lanca et al 2013 pandey et al 2017 2018a and many more outcomes of these studies have been showed that temporal scour depth variation are very important for the realistic and economical design of bridge foundations kothyari et al 2007 in the present study a series of experiments have been conducted to investigate the temporal scour depth variation around the pier with and without a collar also the influence of collar diameters and its location on piers has been analyzed to understand the reduction in temporal scour depth variation literature survey reveals that there is no such relationship available to compute the temporal and final equilibrium scour depth around the collar protected pier a new relationship for the temporal variation of the scour depth at pier with collar has been derived in this study 2 temporal scour around non protected piers for a certain flow and sediment properties time dependent or temporal scour depth d t around the non protected pier is a function of several parameters and written as 1 d t f u h ρ d σ g u c r ρ s b b t t e u is the average flow velocity h is approach flow depth ρ is the fluid density d is the median diameter of streambed particles σ g is the geometric standard deviation of the particle distribution u cr is threshold velocity for the initiation of entrainment of the bed material ρ s is the density of sediment b is the pier diameter b is the channel width t is the time since the start of the scouring process and t e is the equilibrium scour time for uniform sediment σ g 1 4 the influence of geometric standard deviation of particle size distribution can be ignored pandey et al 2017 there are numerous relationships are available to calculate the time dependent scour depth around a non protected pier authors used four relationships proposed by melville and chiew 1999 oliveto and hager 2002 kothyari et al 2007 and lança et al 2013 to check the quality of raw data these relationships are listed below melville and chiew 1999

re organizing the terms and using dimensional analysis eq 5 can be written as 6 d c t d t f b c b h h t 4 experimental work all experiments were carried out in a rectangular flume 24 0 m long 1 0 m wide and 0 3 m wide the working test section was 4 0 m long 1 0 m wide and 0 25 m deep it started 12 0 m from the flume inlet fig 2 a illustrates a sketch of the experimental setup for each experimental test the working test section of the flume was entirely filled with the uniform sand of 0 27 mm median diameter d and geometric standard deviation σ g of 1 22 for preparing test section a linear profiler has been used to manually level the sediment bed up to the flume bed level two circular piers having diameters b of 6 6 cm and 8 4 cm which were made by cast iron hollow pipes were used in this study three different circular collars having diameters b c of 1 5b 2 0b 2 3b which were made by 3 mm thick cast iron plate were used in this study under the non contraction effect the maximum size of the collar diameter must be taken under 20 of the flume width kothyari et al 2007 to neglect the effect of flume wall contraction we used maximum size of collar under 20 i e 19 3 of the flume width the collar was fixed at four different elevations i e at bed level h 3 h 2 and 3 h 4 above the bed level the discharge of flume was measured by a sharp crested pre calibrated weir which was provided at the end of flume this discharge data was verified by an ultra sonic flow meter which was provided at the flume entrance pipe for each test the pier was placed normal to the flume bed at the center of the working test section the working section was perfectly leveled with respect to the flume bed and covered with a transparent perspex sheet once the fixed flow was established the transparent sheet was removed sensibly so that no scour occurred due to this process for each test flow sediment and scour depth data at equilibrium scour condition are given in tables 1 2 at the initial stage of the experiments the scour depth is more at side walls and downstream side of the pier but after few minutes the maximum scour depth shifts at upstream side of the pier therefore scour depth was measured at the upstream side of the pier with different time interval table 3 provides the experimental ranges of kumar 1996 experimental data all experiments are referred to clear water scour conditions u u cr 1 fig 2 b and c shows scour profile along the flume length and flume width at equilibrium scour condition experiments were carried out for two cases case i experiments around non protected pier and the scour depth d t was measured at different time intervals scour depths were measured with a point gauge at different time intervals i e t 3 5 10 15 30 and 60 min up to several hours until an equilibrium scour geometry was reached demonstrated by the invariance of any measurable scour depth with the passage of time each experiment in the present study conducted for 20 h however equilibrium time varied in the range of 15 18 h for checking the equilibrium scour authors measured scour depth with time at nose of the pier at every 30 min after equilibrium time with an accuracy of 1 mm temporal scour depth variation around a non protected pier was also calculated by using previous relationships as can be seen in fig 3 equations by melville and chiew 1999 and oliveto and hager 2002 show good agreements with experimental values of d t while other equation proposed by lanca et al 2013 large errors the truth behind it is that the conditions between the experiments here reported and those reported by lanca et al 2013 are significantly different i e u u c 1 b d 50 60 and h b 0 5 case ii experiments around a collar protected pier and the scour depths d ct around the pier with different time intervals were measured with respect to the primary bed level using a vernier point gauge at upstream nose of the collar this process was done by very carefully so that the negligible influence on static scour was imposed due to this process maximum scour depths d e and d ce for non protected and protected piers at equilibrium scour state respectively was also measured with vernier point gauge variation of d ct with respect to d t was analyzed to check the scour reduction percentage with time 5 effect of collar diameter and elevation on time dependent scour depth to study the impact of collar dimension and elevation on time dependent scour depth experimental measurements were analyzed in terms of percentage reduction of scour depth with different time intervals for different collar elevations fig 4 illustrates the comparison of time dependent scour depth variation along with non protected time dependent scour depths fig 4a shows that the temporal scour variation around the pier is always higher for non protected pier and temporal scour depth variation increases with collar elevation it has been calculated that the temporal scour depth rate increases with collar elevation and it is minimum when the collar is at the bed level as can be seen in fig 4b fig 4b also shows that around 75 of scour was done under 10 of equilibrium scour time while for collar protected pier it took around 25 of equilibrium scour time fig 4 clearly indicates that scour at the initial stage was more rapid for non protected pier than collar s case fig 4 illustrates that the collar reduces temporal scour depth variation as well as the equilibrium scour furthermore it can also be concluded that the collar performs effectively at streambed level or near the bed for actual field problems it is realistic and cost effective to provide a collar at the bed level in fig 4b temporal scour depths were normalized by equilibrium scour depths corresponding to the each experimental run similarly time term was normalized using corresponding equilibrium scour time of each experimental run fig 5 a c shows the effect of pier and collar diameter on temporal scour depth variation it is well defined in the literature that temporal scour depth variation increases with pier diameter oliveto and hager 2002 pandey et al 2017 and it plays an important role on pier scour as can be seen in fig 5a however collar protected piers with different pier diameters showed a negligible effect on temporal scour depth variation fig 5b shows the reduction in temporal scour depth variation with two different pier diameters for the fixed collar diameter pier diameter ratio i e b c b 2 3 and provided at streambed it can be concluded that collar reduced scour depth variation with a similar rate as can be seen in fig 5b fig 5a and b shows that the temporal trends of the scour depths are nearly same for b c b 2 3 but temporal trends of the scour depths also depend on collar diameter and reduce with increase in b c b as can be seen in fig 5c however a collar at bed level with b c b 2 3 shows maximum reduction in temporal scour depth variation as can be seen in figs 4 and 5 fig 6 shows the comparison of reduced percentage temporal scour depth variation d ct with respect to d t while fig 7 shows similar plots for kumar s 1996 study flow and sediment properties of kumar s 1996 study are mentioned in table 3 to check the efficiency e of collar protected pier the following relationship is used 7 e d t d c t d t 100 in fig 6 a b for collar diameter 1 5 b c b 2 3 which was provided at bed level showed e 45 75 when the ratio of b c b is equal to 1 5 the minimum reduction rate in temporal scour depth variation is about e 30 55 for b c 2b the reduction rate of temporal scour depth variation is about 60 65 the maximum efficiency of a collar is noted when b c b 2 3 and the reduction rate of temporal scour depth variation is about 68 75 as can be seen in fig 6a and b furthermore fig 6a and b shows that both the piers with different diameters reduce the temporal scour depth variation with the approximately similar rate for a fixed diameter of collar fig 6c shows the scour reduction efficiency of a collar for different elevation when the collar is provided at bed level it gives maximum efficiency i e 70 75 it can be noted from fig 6c the rate of scour depth reduction decreases with increase in normalized collar elevation z h and e 30 40 25 30 and 10 14 for normalized collar elevation 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 respectively fig 7a c illustrate the scour reduction efficiency for different collar diameter and elevations using kumar s 1996 data kumar 1996 used a wide range of collar diameters i e 1 5 b c b 4 but they did not consider the importance of contraction effect as per kumar s 1996 the reduction rate of temporal scour depth variation increases with pier diameter however b c b 2 5 the reduction rate of temporal scour depth variation is less than the case of b c b 2 5 as can be seen in fig 7a c it can be noted from fig 7a c the rate of scour depth reduction decreases with increase in collar elevation it has been found from kumar s data that a larger diameter collar b c b 2 5 reduces scour depth sufficiently but it needs to check under non contraction effect hence analysis of this study specifies that the best location for providing is at bed level z 0 with 1 5 b c b 2 5 6 a new relationship for the temporal variation of the scour depth at pier with collar the temporal scour depth variation around the collar protected pier is the function of collar diameter and its elevation in addition to parameters affecting the temporal scour without collar protected pier as mentioned in eqs 5 and 6 however there is no relationship is available in the literature to compute the temporal scour depth around the collar protected pier kumar et al 1999 proposed a relationship to compute the maximum equilibrium scour depth around a collar protected pier but they did not consider the importance of temporal scour depth several investigators have been considered the importance of temporal scour around the non protected piers melville and chiew 1999 oliveto and hager 2002 2005 kothyari et al 2007 kothyari and kumar 2012 pandey et al 2017 and many more these investigators stated that temporal scour depth variation is an important parameter for reducing the bridge hazards in the present study authors have been shown a collar can be reduced temporal sour variation adequately further authors also realize the importance of temporal scour depth relationship therefore a new relationship has been derived to calculate the temporal scour depth variation using present experimental data 130 datasets eq 8 has been proposed after a non linear regression analysis this equation has also verified by using kumar s 1996 experimental data 8 d c t d t 0 23 b c b 0 82 h h 0 58 l o g t c where t c is the dimensionless time factor for collar protected pier and defined by t c s 1 g d b c 2 h 1 3 t above equation is only applicable when collar is fixed around the pier or z 0 for z 0 h h will be one and equation can be written as d c t d t 0 23 b c b 0 82 l o g t c eq 8 also checked by kumar s 1996 experimental data as can be seen in fig 8 b fig 8b shows eq 8 gives a large amount of error for b c b 2 5 the reason behind it is that contraction effect due to collar diameter on scour processes no doubt scour is always affected by contraction effect melville and chiew 1999 eq 8 shows good agreements between experimental and calculated values of time dependent scour depths as can be seen in fig 8a and b fig 9 shows data frequency versus percentage error for present and kumar s 1996 data fig 9 clearly indicates that present equation performs well under the non contraction effect for both experimental data the value of regression factor r 2 for eq 8 is 0 86 however eq 8 has some limitations i e it is only applicable when collar is provided at bed level or above the bed level under non contraction effect eq 8 is subjected to the limitations mentioned below i channel geometry is rectangular in section and straight in plan ii approach flow produces essentially a clear water scour condition iii it is valid under non contracted scour condition iv it is only applicable when collar is fixed at bed level or above the bed level 7 sensitivity and statistical analysis a sensitivity analysis has also been performed for eq 8 to classify the most critical parameter which affects the time dependent scour depth around the collar protected pier sensitivity analysis has been done by taking the average values of dependent and independent variables an assumption has been assumed i e each variable is error independent the average values of b c b h h and t c for present experimental data are 1 98 0 85 and 6316 14 correspondingly if a percentage error δϵ in the output is defined as the difference between values of output calculated for inputs x and x δx then the error might be calculated as the absolute sensitivity as δϵ δx ahmad 2013 the output quantity is defined as ϵ d ct d t and input quantity b c b h h and t c δϵ also can be indicated in a relative form i e re δϵ ϵ δϵ in output is necessarily the deviation sensitivity with δx being the error the relative sensitivity rs can be defined as rs x δϵ ϵ δx ahmad 2013 the sensitivity analysis is done by varying 10 20 30 40 and 50 in each input variable tables 4 5 represent the results of sensitivity analysis and it can be noted that b c b and h hare the most sensitive parameters followed by t c for 10 to 50 and 10 to 50 change in input variables as is maximum for h h parameter while re and rs are maximum for b c b parameter as can be seen in tables 4 and 5 parameter t c shows negligible influence than other two parameters as can be seen in fig 10 thus it can be said that the time dependent scour around collar protected pier significantly depends on b c b h h followed by t c as can be seen in tables 4 5 and fig 10 accuracy of presently proposed relationship i e eq 8 has also been checked statistically if d ct d t indicates the observed non dimensional temporal scour depth and d ct d t is corresponding non dimensional calculated value of temporal scour depth around a collar protected pier these statistical indices are well defined as 9a c c m d c t d t d c t d t d c t d t d c t d t m d c t d t 2 d c t d t 2 m d c t d t 2 d c t d t 2 9b r m s e i 1 m d c t d t i d c t d t i 2 m 9c m a p e 100

mean absolute percentage error table 6 displays outcomes of statistical indices for different collar diameters the values of cc for collar diameter pier diameter ratio 1 5 b c b 2 5 are maximum for both present and kumar s 1996 experimental data maximum values of statistical indices indicate that under the non contraction effect eq 8 performs well while for b c b 2 5 statistical indices give worst results this indicates that the contraction effect plays an important role around a collar protected pier 8 conclusions an experimental study has been carried out to examine the influence of collar on time dependent scour depth variation temporal scour depth variation around the circular pier with and without collar of different diameters and elevations was studied it has been calculated that the temporal scour depth rate increases with collar elevation and it is minimum when the collar is at the bed level increasing the collar diameter also affects the scour depth variation with time using collar is very effective in slowing down the development of temporal scour depth processes as floods often last much shorter times than the equilibrium time this property of collars becomes important in practice to prevent the bridge piers against scour those are erected mostly on fine sand to silt bed near to sea mouth results of the present study show that a collar reduces time

21663,in the present study the effect of collar on temporal scour depth variation at the base of a collar protected circular pier was investigated experimental results revealed that a collar performs efficiently by reducing the rate of temporal scour depth variation around the pier the efficiency of a collar for different diameters and elevations has been studied through flume experiments under clear water scour condition analysis of obtained experimental results indicates that a collar performs efficiently and reduces maximum equilibrium scour at undisturbed bed level further the observations of the study revealed that the effectiveness of a collar increases with increase in collar diameter and decreases with the elevation of collar finally an empirical equation has been proposed to compute the time dependent scour depth at the front of the collar protected piers the proposed equation has been validated and proven to be applicable to a wide range of variables under the effect of non contraction flow a sensitivity analysis has been done and it indicates that the collar diameter and its elevation are the most influencing parameters keywords scour depth collar

face of the obstruction and upstream horseshoe vortex system with wake vortices at downstream caused flow separation around the pier kumar et al 1999 tafarojnoruz et al 2010 several bridges were failed due to the local scour around the bridge elements such as piers and abutments and a huge budget is spending each financial year to reconstruct or repair the bridge elements kumcu et al 2007 in recent decades scour hazards throughout the world have attracted extensive attention kumcu et al 2007 heidarpour et al 2010 jueyi et al 2010 tafarojnoruz et al 2010 lanca et al 2013 pandey et al 2018 a b choufu et al 2019 ghaderi and abbasi 2019 because of failures several researchers have worked on it during the past few years melville and coleman 2000 kothyari et al 2007 kumcu et al 2007 and pu and lim 2014 the scour processes and flow pattern near the bridge piers are so complicated that it is difficult to use a single scour depth relationship azamathulla 2012 azamathulla et al 2014 qi and gao 2014 qi et al 2016 therefore field engineers use alternative methods to protect the piers against scour problem there are two approaches for reducing the local scour around the bridge elements i e i bed armoring melville 1988 dey and raikar 2007 and ii flow altering method kumcu et al 2007 tafarojnoruz et al 2010 in the first method the scour process is reduced by armor particles or by providing an appropriate riprap around the bridge elements in the second method scour processes are reduced using different pier scour protection devices viz collars slots fins bed sills etc principally these devices reduce the scour rate by reducing the impact of horseshoe vortex kumcu et al 2007 tafarojnoruz et al 2010 fig 1 shows a definition sketch of scour around the circular pier with a collar several bridges have been built over seabed and researchers have also investigated scour associated with anthropogenic activities in the marine environment continues to be governed by uncertainty related to the complexity of different foundations as well as the ocean waves bateni and jeng 2007 zhang et al 2017 yang et al 2020 and many more under unsteady condition it is clearly stated by researchers that the waves and current action are equally responsible for the seabed scour bateni and jeng 2007 zhang et al 2017 but for the steady flow waves and current actions are not the key parameters that initiate or affect the scouring and erosion processes at the base of any erected hydraulic structure yuan et al 2017 yang et al 2020 present research wok deals with the pier scour protection work under steady flow so it must be beneficial for the design of bridge piers over seabed under non current action previous studies on pier scour protection devices especially slots and collars are inspired by the need to reduce the vortex system the scour depth is high in front of the pier and the scouring hole develops along the pier tafarojnoruz et al 2010 if a collar provides with a pier at the bed level or near the bed it separates the extreme downflow and shows the maximum efficiency kumar et al 1999 it has been found by the previous investigators that providing a slot in a pier can reduce the scour processes however it depends on its location chiew 1992 kumar et al 1999 for reducing local scour the collars are more efficient than the slots tafarojnoruz et al 2010 for field problems slots in the piers are usually obstructed by floating debris and could be inefficient for field problems several studies have been completed for pier scour with and without pier scour protection devices kumar et al 1999 oliveto and hager 2002 kothyari et al 2007 kumcu et al 2007 tafarojnoruz et al 2010 pandey et al 2017 and many more however there are very few studies available on temporal scour depth variation in the presence of pier scour protection devices kumcu et al 2007 kumcu et al 2007 conducted a temporal scour depth study around the abutments in the presence of collar and stated that collar can reduce the scour up to 80 however it depends on its location previous investigators conducted experiments for pier scour in the presence of collars and found collars reduced the scour effectively chiew 1992 kumar et al 1999 zarrati et al 2004 moncada m et al 2009 however no one was considered the importance of temporal scour depth variation however for piers without protection devices several studies have been completed for temporal scour depth variation melville and coleman 2000 oliveto and hager 2002 kothyari et al 2007 lanca et al 2013 pandey et al 2017 2018a and many more outcomes of these studies have been showed that temporal scour depth variation are very important for the realistic and economical design of bridge foundations kothyari et al 2007 in the present study a series of experiments have been conducted to investigate the temporal scour depth variation around the pier with and without a collar also the influence of collar diameters and its location on piers has been analyzed to understand the reduction in temporal scour depth variation literature survey reveals that there is no such relationship available to compute the temporal and final equilibrium scour depth around the collar protected pier a new relationship for the temporal variation of the scour depth at pier with collar has been derived in this study 2 temporal scour around non protected piers for a certain flow and sediment properties time dependent or temporal scour depth d t around the non protected pier is a function of several parameters and written as 1 d t f u h ρ d σ g u c r ρ s b b t t e u is the average flow velocity h is approach flow depth ρ is the fluid density d is the median diameter of streambed particles σ g is the geometric standard deviation of the particle distribution u cr is threshold velocity for the initiation of entrainment of the bed material ρ s is the density of sediment b is the pier diameter b is the channel width t is the time since the start of the scouring process and t e is the equilibrium scour time for uniform sediment σ g 1 4 the influence of geometric standard deviation of particle size distribution can be ignored pandey et al 2017 there are numerous relationships are available to calculate the time dependent scour depth around a non protected pier authors used four relationships proposed by melville and chiew 1999 oliveto and hager 2002 kothyari et al 2007 and lança et al 2013 to check the quality of raw data these relationships are listed below melville and chiew 1999

be written as 5 d c t f d t b c b h h t where b c is the collar diameter h is the distance from collar elevation to water surface h h z with z is the collar elevation with respect to the streambed by re organizing the terms and using dimensional analysis eq 5 can be written as 6 d c t d t f b c b h h t 4 experimental work all experiments were carried out in a rectangular flume 24 0 m long 1 0 m wide and 0 3 m wide the working test section was 4 0 m long 1 0 m wide and 0 25 m deep it started 12 0 m from the flume inlet fig 2 a illustrates a sketch of the experimental setup for each experimental test the working test section of the flume was entirely filled with the uniform sand of 0 27 mm median diameter d and geometric standard deviation σ g of 1 22 for preparing test section a linear profiler has been used to manually level the sediment bed up to the flume bed level two circular piers having diameters b of 6 6 cm and 8 4 cm which were made by cast iron hollow pipes were used in this study three different circular collars having diameters b c of 1 5b 2 0b 2 3b which were made by 3 mm thick cast iron plate were used in this study under the non contraction effect the maximum size of the collar diameter must be taken under 20 of the flume width kothyari et al 2007 to neglect the effect of flume wall contraction we used maximum size of collar under 20 i e 19 3 of the flume width the collar was fixed at four different elevations i e at bed level h 3 h 2 and 3 h 4 above the bed level the discharge of flume was measured by a sharp crested pre calibrated weir which was provided at the end of flume this discharge data was verified by an ultra sonic flow meter which was provided at the flume entrance pipe for each test the pier was placed normal to the flume bed at the center of the working test section the working section was perfectly leveled with respect to the flume bed and covered with a transparent perspex sheet once the fixed flow was established the transparent sheet was removed sensibly so that no scour occurred due to this process for each test flow sediment and scour depth data at equilibrium scour condition are given in tables 1 2 at the initial stage of the experiments the scour depth is more at side walls and downstream side of the pier but after few minutes the maximum scour depth shifts at upstream side of the pier therefore scour depth was measured at the upstream side of the pier with different time interval table 3 provides the experimental ranges of kumar 1996 experimental data all experiments are referred to clear water scour conditions u u cr 1 fig 2 b and c shows scour profile along the flume length and flume width at equilibrium scour condition experiments were carried out for two cases case i experiments around non protected pier and the scour depth d t was measured at different time intervals scour depths were measured with a point gauge at different time intervals i e t 3 5 10 15 30 and 60 min up to several hours until an equilibrium scour geometry was reached demonstrated by the invariance of any measurable scour depth with the passage of time each experiment in the present study conducted for 20 h however equilibrium time varied in the range of 15 18 h for checking the equilibrium scour authors measured scour depth with time at nose of the pier at every 30 min after equilibrium time with an accuracy of 1 mm temporal scour depth variation around a non protected pier was also calculated by using previous relationships as can be seen in fig 3 equations by melville and chiew 1999 and oliveto and hager 2002 show good agreements with experimental values of d t while other equation proposed by lanca et al 2013 large errors the truth behind it is that the conditions between the experiments here reported and those reported by lanca et al 2013 are significantly different i e u u c 1 b d 50 60 and h b 0 5 case ii experiments around a collar protected pier and the scour depths d ct around the pier with different time intervals were measured with respect to the primary bed level using a vernier point gauge at upstream nose of the collar this process was done by very carefully so that the negligible influence on static scour was imposed due to this process maximum scour depths d e and d ce for non protected and protected piers at equilibrium scour state respectively was also measured with vernier point gauge variation of d ct with respect to d t was analyzed to check the scour reduction percentage with time 5 effect of collar diameter and elevation on time dependent scour depth to study the impact of collar dimension and elevation on time dependent scour depth experimental measurements were analyzed in terms of percentage reduction of scour depth with different time intervals for different collar elevations fig 4 illustrates the comparison of time dependent scour depth variation along with non protected time dependent scour depths fig 4a shows that the temporal scour variation around the pier is always higher for non protected pier and temporal scour depth variation increases with collar elevation it has been calculated that the temporal scour depth rate increases with collar elevation and it is minimum when the collar is at the bed level as can be seen in fig 4b fig 4b also shows that around 75 of scour was done under 10 of equilibrium scour time while for collar protected pier it took around 25 of equilibrium scour time fig 4 clearly indicates that scour at the initial stage was more rapid for non protected pier than collar s case fig 4 illustrates that the collar reduces temporal scour depth variation as well as the equilibrium scour furthermore it can also be concluded that the collar performs effectively at streambed level or near the bed for actual field problems it is realistic and cost effective to provide a collar at the bed level in fig 4b temporal scour depths were normalized by equilibrium scour depths corresponding to the each experimental run similarly time term was normalized using corresponding equilibrium scour time of each experimental run fig 5 a c shows the effect of pier and collar diameter on temporal scour depth variation it is well defined in the literature that temporal scour depth variation increases with pier diameter oliveto and hager 2002 pandey et al 2017 and it plays an important role on pier scour as can be seen in fig 5a however collar protected piers with different pier diameters showed a negligible effect on temporal scour depth variation fig 5b shows the reduction in temporal scour depth variation with two different pier diameters for the fixed collar diameter pier diameter ratio i e b c b 2 3 and provided at streambed it can be concluded that collar reduced scour depth variation with a similar rate as can be seen in fig 5b fig 5a and b shows that the temporal trends of the scour depths are nearly same for b c b 2 3 but temporal trends of the scour depths also depend on collar diameter and reduce with increase in b c b as can be seen in fig 5c however a collar at bed level with b c b 2 3 shows maximum reduction in temporal scour depth variation as can be seen in figs 4 and 5 fig 6 shows the comparison of reduced percentage temporal scour depth variation d ct with respect to d t while fig 7 shows similar plots for kumar s 1996 study flow and sediment properties of kumar s 1996 study are mentioned in table 3 to check the efficiency e of collar protected pier the following relationship is used 7 e d t d c t d t 100 in fig 6 a b for collar diameter 1 5 b c b 2 3 which was provided at bed level showed e 45 75 when the ratio of b c b is equal to 1 5 the minimum reduction rate in temporal scour depth variation is about e 30 55 for b c 2b the reduction rate of temporal scour depth variation is about 60 65 the maximum efficiency of a collar is noted when b c b 2 3 and the reduction rate of temporal scour depth variation is about 68 75 as can be seen in fig 6a and b furthermore fig 6a and b shows that both the piers with different diameters reduce the temporal scour depth variation with the approximately similar rate for a fixed diameter of collar fig 6c shows the scour reduction efficiency of a collar for different elevation when the collar is provided at bed level it gives maximum efficiency i e 70 75 it can be noted from fig 6c the rate of scour depth reduction decreases with increase in normalized collar elevation z h and e 30 40 25 30 and 10 14 for normalized collar elevation 0 25 0 50 and 0 75 respectively fig 7a c illustrate the scour reduction efficiency for different collar diameter and elevations using kumar s 1996 data kumar 1996 used a wide range of collar diameters i e 1 5 b c b 4 but they did not consider the importance of contraction effect as per kumar s 1996 the reduction rate of temporal scour depth variation increases with pier diameter however b c b 2 5 the reduction rate of temporal scour depth variation is less than the case of b c b 2 5 as can be seen in fig 7a c it can be noted from fig 7a c the rate of scour depth reduction decreases with increase in collar elevation it has been found from kumar s data that a larger diameter collar b c b 2 5 reduces scour depth sufficiently but it needs to check under non contraction effect hence analysis of this study specifies that the best location for providing is at bed level z 0 with 1 5 b c b 2 5 6 a new relationship for the temporal variation of the scour depth at pier with collar the temporal scour depth variation around the collar protected pier is the function of collar diameter and its elevation in addition to parameters affecting the temporal scour without collar protected pier as mentioned in eqs 5 and 6 however there is no relationship is available in the literature to compute the temporal scour depth around the collar protected pier kumar et al 1999 proposed a relationship to compute the maximum equilibrium scour depth around a collar protected pier but they did not consider the importance of temporal scour depth several investigators have been considered the importance of temporal scour around the non protected piers melville and chiew 1999 oliveto and hager 2002 2005 kothyari et al 2007 kothyari and kumar 2012 pandey et al 2017 and many more these investigators stated that temporal scour depth variation is an important parameter for reducing the bridge hazards in the present study authors have been shown a collar can be reduced temporal sour variation adequately further authors also realize the importance of temporal scour depth relationship therefore a new relationship has been derived to calculate the temporal scour depth variation using present experimental data 130 datasets eq 8 has been proposed after a non linear regression analysis this equation has also verified by using kumar s 1996 experimental data 8 d c t d t 0 23 b c b 0 82 h h 0 58 l o g t c where t c is the dimensionless time factor for collar protected pier and defined by t c s 1 g d b c 2 h 1 3 t above equation is only applicable when collar is fixed around the pier or z 0 for z 0 h h will be one and equation can be written as d c t d t 0 23 b c b 0 82 l o g t c eq 8 also checked by kumar s 1996 experimental data as can be seen in fig 8 b fig 8b shows eq 8 gives a large amount of error for b c b 2 5 the reason behind it is that contraction effect due to collar diameter on scour processes no doubt scour is always affected by contraction effect melville and chiew 1999 eq 8 shows good agreements between experimental and calculated values of time dependent scour depths as can be seen in fig 8a and b fig 9 shows data frequency versus percentage error for present and kumar s 1996 data fig 9 clearly indicates that present equation performs well under the non contraction effect for both experimental data the value of regression factor r 2 for eq 8 is 0 86 however eq 8 has some limitations i e it is only applicable when collar is provided at bed level or above the bed level under non contraction effect eq 8 is subjected to the limitations mentioned below i channel geometry is rectangular in section and straight in plan ii approach flow produces essentially a clear water scour condition iii it is valid under non contracted scour condition iv it is only applicable when collar is fixed at bed level or above the bed level 7 sensitivity and statistical analysis a sensitivity analysis has also been performed for eq 8 to classify the most critical parameter which affects the time dependent scour depth around the collar protected pier sensitivity analysis has been done by taking the average values of dependent and independent variables an assumption has been assumed i e each variable is error independent the average values of b c b h h and t c for present experimental data are 1 98 0 85 and 6316 14 correspondingly if a percentage error δϵ in the output is defined as the difference between values of output calculated for inputs x and x δx then the error might be calculated as the absolute sensitivity as δϵ δx ahmad 2013 the output quantity is defined as ϵ d ct d t and input quantity b c b h h and t c δϵ also can be indicated in a relative form i e re δϵ ϵ δϵ in output is necessarily the deviation sensitivity with δx being the error the relative sensitivity rs can be defined as rs x δϵ ϵ δx ahmad 2013 the sensitivity analysis is done by varying 10 20 30 40 and 50 in each input variable tables 4 5 represent the results of sensitivity analysis and it can be noted that b c b and h hare the most sensitive parameters followed by t c for 10 to 50 and 10 to 50 change in input variables as is maximum for h h parameter while re and rs are maximum for b c b parameter as can be seen in tables 4 and 5 parameter t c shows negligible influence than other two parameters as can be seen in fig 10 thus it can be said that the time dependent scour around collar protected pier significantly depends on b c b h h followed by t c as can be seen in tables 4 5 and fig 10 accuracy of presently proposed relationship i e eq 8 has also been checked statistically if d ct d t indicates the observed non dimensional temporal scour depth and d ct d t is corresponding non dimensional calculated value of temporal scour depth around a collar protected pier these statistical indices are well defined as 9a c c m d c t d t d c t d t d c t d t d c t d t m d c t d t 2 d c t d t 2 m d c t d t 2 d c t d t 2 9b r m s e i 1 m d c t d t i d c t d t i 2 m 9c m a p e 100 m i 1 m d c t d t i d c t d t i d c t d t i in eq 9 a d m is the total number of datasets statistical indices cc coefficient of correlation rmse root mean square error mae mean absolute error and mape mean absolute percentage error table 6 displays outcomes of statistical indices for different collar diameters the values of cc for collar diameter pier diameter ratio 1 5 b c b 2 5 are maximum for both present and kumar s 1996 experimental data maximum values of statistical indices indicate that under the non contraction effect eq 8 performs well while for b c b 2 5 statistical indices give worst results this indicates that the contraction effect plays an important role around a collar protected pier 8 conclusions an experimental study has been carried out to examine the influence of collar on time dependent scour depth variation temporal scour depth variation around the circular pier with and without collar of different diameters and elevations was studied it has been calculated that the temporal scour depth rate increases with collar elevation and it is minimum when the collar is at the bed level increasing the collar diameter also affects the scour depth variation with time using collar is very effective in slowing down the development of temporal scour depth processes as floods often last much shorter times than the equilibrium time this property of collars becomes important in practice to prevent the bridge piers against scour those are erected mostly on fine sand to silt bed near to sea mouth results of the present study show that a collar reduces time dependent scour depth significantly it has also been checked that the influence of collar diameter and its elevation on time dependent scour depth variation and analysis shows that a collar works efficiently when it provides at bed level with it has been found that the maximum reduction in time dependent scour depth variation when collar diameter was b c b 2 3 and b c b 2 5 for present and kumar s 1996 experimental data respectively a new time dependent scour depth equation around collar protected pier has been proposed and this equation verified using kumar s 1996 experimental data a sensitivity analysis has been done for presently proposed relationship and outcomes of sensitivity analysis show b c b and h h are the most influencing parameters for collar protected time dependent scour depth variation this equation also checked by using different statistical analysis statistically it has been found that equation gives good agreements b c b 2 3 and b c b 2 5 for present and kumar s 1996 experimental data respectively however for b c b 2 5 equation did not give good agreement between experimental and calculated values of time dependent scour depths just because of the

21664,the wall pressure caused by underwater explosion is always a key problem in the anti explosion design of naval ships notably the accurate wall pressure caused by underwater explosion bubble is one of the most difficult parts due to the significant nonlinear deformation of the bubble in present study the dynamics of an underwater explosion bubble near a rigid wall are captured by high speed camera and the wall pressure in the wall center are measured by a pressure transducer the wall pressure with standoff distance parameter γ d r m from 0 38 to 1 54 are recorded where d represents the vertical distance from the explosive charge center to the wall center and r m is the maximum radius of bubble according to the previous study and the experimental data in this paper when γ 1 2 the load on the wall center has obvious double peak phenomenon that is the composition of the re entrant jet load and the bubble collapse load to obtain the quantitative law of wall pressure caused by mini charge underwater explosion bubble we proposed a mathematical model to describe the time pressure curve when γ 1 2 and according to the conclusion in our previous study chen et al 2018 based on the boundary element method bem the space distribution of the wall pressure was obtained keywords underwater explosion bubble wall pressure quantitative law 1 introduction accurately obtaining the wall pressure caused by underwater explosion bubble plays a key role in ship design experimental method has been recognized worldwide as the authoritative means of studying the near field explosion bubble load a large number of researchers carried out experiments on bubble dynamics and its impact load among these studies scholars have developed many experimental methods to study underwater bubbles such as laser bubbles lauterborn 1998 lindau and lauterborn 2003 shaw et al 1999 zhao et al 2007 y et al 1991 electrode discharge bubbles c g et al 1995 cui et al 2016a fong et al 2009 gong et al 2018 luo et al 2018 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a underwater explosion bubbles klaseboer et al 2005 cui et al 2016b the measurement of the bubble load on the wall surface can be traced back to 1980 s tong tong et al 1999 conducted a series of studies on the wall pressure caused by laser bubble with standoff distance parameters between 0 8 and 1 2 using experiments and numerical methods studies have shown that the first peak of the bubble load has an inflection point as the standoff distance parameters increases and the decay time corresponding to this pressure peak inflection point is prolonged tomita et al shima et al 1983 tomita and shima 1986 used the wall pressure sensor system to study the load characteristics of laser bubble and its damage to soft structures wang et al wang and chen 2007 used pvdf sensors to measure the impulse of bubble loads and the law of load characteristics are given with the development of the small charge underwater explosion test mu et al jin lei et al 2010 used wall pressure sensors to measure the horizontal vertical and inclined wall pressure caused by bubble motion by using pressure transducer a number of experiments near a vertical wall and between a free surface and a bottom have been conducted jayaprakash et al 2010 2012 to study the wall pressure caused by spark generated bubble the experimental results indicated the jet characteristics as function of standoff distance by using hopkinson bar yao et al cui et al 2018 yao et al 2019a 2019b proposed a new pressure measure methodology to assess the pressure loading on the rigid planar boundary due to spark generated bubble or micro charge explosive through the above test results we can find that the standoff distance parameter is one of the important parameter to the bubble dynamics whether the explosion source is laser bubble electric spark bubble or under explosion bubble when γ 1 2 two pressure peaks of bubble load acted on the wall is a very obvious feature however many experimental results only provide qualitative analysis from these qualitative researches the bubble load on the wall center has obvious double peak phenomenon that is the composition of the re entrant jet load and the bubble collapse load unfortunately based on the present public studies there is no concrete expression of the wall pressure caused by underwater explosion bubble the specific waveform distribution form in time and space and quantitative relationship between the impact load and bubble deformation are not clearly given as an effective numerical method boundary element method bem klaseboer et al 2005 wang and khoo 2004 jin et al 2018 2019 has been one of the most salient methods to calculate the bubble dynamics and its impact load li et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b 2019 used the bem to simulate the near wall bubble dynamics and combined the auxiliary function to solve the wall pressure when γ 1 2 the phenomenon of bimodal load near the wall is revealed in the results of different calculation methods by many different authors for example liu et al 2017 used the front tracking method ftm to simulate the shape and load characteristics of incompressible bubble near the wall chahine et al hsiao et al 2014 used a hybrid solution to solve the high efficiency boundary element method and the finite difference method considering compressibility similar to chahine s hybrid solution wang et al wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018b combined with the discontinuous galerkin method jin et al 2017 and the boundary element method to numerically simulate the load characteristics of spark generated bubble in tian s tian et al 2020 work the eulerian finite element method efem is introduced to continuously simulate the shock wave and non spherical bubble evolution stages near a horizontal solid wall to sum up these studies have mentioned the evolution characteristics and loading characteristics of bubble but they rarely show the quantitative rules

mechanism of bubble re entrant jet and shrinkage collapse load of bubble near a rigid wall was studied by means of experimental test and numerical method the mini charge underwater explosion bubble test was systematically carried out to obtain the bubble jet and shrinkage collapse load near a rigid wall to obtain the quantitative law of wall pressure caused by mini charge we proposed a mathematical model to describe the time pressure curve when γ 1 2 and according to the conclusion in our previous study chen et al 2018 based on the boundary element method bem the space distribution of the wall pressure was obtained 2 experimental details 2 1 experiment apparatus in this study experiments were performed using mini charge explosive beneath a target plate in a tank of quiescent

plate made of 304 stainless steel its thickness and diameter are 12 mm and 250 mm respectively in order to measure the wall pressure at the center of the target plate a through threaded hole was drilled and the pressure transducer was embedded in the center of the target plate by means of bolt connection during the process of installing the pressure transducer we needed to pay attention to keep the measurement surface of the pressure transducer and the surface of the target plate on the same plane the details installation arrangement of pressure transducer was shown in fig 2 the target plate and the waterproof cylindrical tube were connected by bolts and waterproof gaskets and then fixed above the water tank in this paper a mini charge of powder of fire cracker was used as the explosive source the powder of fire cracker consists of 55 65 of potassium perchlorate powder 18 23 of aluminium powder 10 15 of ferrotitanium powder and about 5 of manganese dioxide powder supported by the 3d fixator the bubble was generated by ignited the explosive charge below the target plate with different standoff distances 2 2 experimental measuring device images of the bubble dynamics were

1 the camera was placed directly in front of the water tank and the led lamp used as the background light was placed directly behind the water tank the pressure transducer used in this paper is the piezoelectricity type pressure transducer of sinocera piezotronics inc http www china yec com together with a ye5853 low noise charge amplifier this pressure transducer cy yd 205 had a diameter of 10

with the ignition of mini charge through the oscilloscope and the simultaneous recording of the oscilloscope 3 results and discussion bubble dynamics in the free field with a charge of 0 2 g is shown in fig 3 during the first two cycles of bubble s expansion and collapse the maximum radius of the underwater explosion bubble in the first cycle was 78 0 mm bubble dynamics nearby a rigid wall varied in mass of charge and standoff distance here we focus on the influence of standoff distance on wall pressure by using the same explosive source with a charge of 0 2 0 001 g 7 test cases of underwater explosion bubble near a rigid wall were carried out the details was listed in table 1 here the non dimensional standoff distance is defined as γ d r m where d represents the standoff distance from the explosive charge center to the wall center and r m is the maximum radius of underwater explosion bubble in all experiments the water depth in the water tank was kept at 550 mm and the target plate was placed 30 mm beneath the free surface 3 1 wall pressures at different γ the wall pressure measured by pressure transducer with γ 0 38 was shown in fig 4 a five significant pressure peaks are tagged in fig 4 a respectively the time corresponding to these pressure peaks respectively are 0 02 ms 14 56 ms 15 11 ms 22 68 ms and 27 75 ms with the help of the high speed camera we analyzed the bubble dynamics closest to these moments fig 5 shows three cycles of bubble oscillation from charge was ignited to the third time of bubble collapse according to the high speed camera records fig 5 and the time history of pressure fig 4 as the explosive charge was ignited t 0 fig 5 a a shock wave was generated and reached the target plate after 0 02 ms then the first pressure peak shock wave p s was recorded at the wall center during the first cycle of bubble oscillation as the bubble re entrant jet acted on the target plate fig 5 i and bubble turned to minimum volume fig 5 j the second and the third pressure peak occurred here we defined the pressure peaks caused by re entrant jet impact and bubble collapse during the first cycle of bubble oscillation as p b 1 j and p b 1 c the third and the four pressure peak at t 22 68 ms and t 27 75 ms in fig 4 a referred to maximum of the bubble collapse load during the second and the third cycle of bubble oscillation which were defined as p b 2 c and p b 3 c for the case of γ 0 38 fig 4 a shows the pressure peak and the impulse of the bubble load during the first cycle of bubble oscillation are significantly larger than that of the shock wave fig 4 b shows the bubble load during the first cycle of bubble oscillation has several pressure peaks the first pressure peak at t 14 56 ms at the moment of the re entrant jet impact hsiao et al 2014 a plurality of bubble collapse load peaks at t 15 11 ms and t 15 16 ms correspond to bubble ring collapse after the bubble re entrant jet impact the wall the speed of the time decay of the re entrant jet load is slowed down due to the splashing effect chen et al 2018 li et al 2015 and then the plurality of bubble collapse peaks occurs after the bubble re entrant jet load similarly in the study of mu et al jin lei et al 2010 it is found that the distribution of the bubble load during the first cycle of bubble oscillation at the center of the nearby rigid wall has similar characteristics the distribution waveform of the bubble load in this phase is called as saddle type saddle type can be described as the superposition of the bubble re entrant jet load and the bubble collapse load on the time distribution with the second and the third collapse of the bubble the corresponding bubble collapse loads with a large pressure peak and a narrow pulse width were measured at the center of the nearby rigid wall in fig 4 a we observe that the bubble load impulse of the second and the third cycle of bubble oscillation are only about 20 and 12 of that of the first cycle of bubble oscillation it shows that the bubble load in the first cycle of bubble oscillation is mainly evaluated when assessing the bubble load and the impulse of the bubble re entrant jet load in the first cycle of bubble oscillation is much larger than the component of the bubble collapse load these details are specifically analyzed in the next section it can be seen from fig 6 and fig 7 that the pressure time history of γ 0 51 and γ 0 67 have a similar characteristics with the case of γ 0 38 that is during the first cycle of bubble oscillation the main distribution law is the superposition of the bubble re entrant jet load and the multiple contraction collapse load of bubble fig 6 b and fig 7 b it is worth mentioning that these multiple contraction collapse loads of bubble was recorded in detail in the experiment compared with the experiment study of bubble load carried out by other scholars luo et al 2018 cui et al 2016b jin lei et al 2010 jayaprakash et al 2012 most of the experimental records of explosive bubble rarely have such detailed records on the bubble collapse load at present by using a new measurement based on hopkinson bar multiple contraction collapse load during the bubble collapsing in first cycle also can be captured in cui s cui et al 2018 experimental records from the study of literature lindau and lauterborn 2003 we suspect these multiple peaks with narrow pulse width in the first pulsation phase may be due to the formation of annular bubble when the bubble shrinks to the minimum volume owing to the asymmetric motion the annular bubble will be broken into more than two independent tiny bubbles then these multi independent tiny bubbles will further shrink to their minimum volume and radiate high pressure shock waves these shock waves are superimposed at the center point of the rigid wall to create a special phenomenon which show as multi pressure peaks after bubble re entrant jet load when γ 0 90 fig 8 b this special phenomenon disappeared which mean the asymmetric motion might not appear in this case when γ 1 06 fig 9 we can clearly distinguish the pressure peaks of bubble re entrant jet load and the bubble collapse load and the time difference between them according to the conclusion in the literature tomita and shima 1986 when γ 1 2 the time moment of bubble re entrant jet acts on the nearby rigid wall was later than the time moment of the bubble shrinks to the minimum volume the same time sequence of these two pressure peaks is shown in γ 1 54 the first peak of bubble load during the first cycle of bubble oscillation is the bubble collapse load and the following pressure peak is caused by the bubble re entrant jet for a better understanding on what happens during near field underwater explosion by comparing the images and the pressure time history images of underwater explosion bubble s expansion and collapse near the solid wall for γ 0 51 γ 1 54 are given in appendix a statistical analysis was carried out on the pressure peaks and impulse of the above seven stand off parameters shown in table 2 for the convenience of discussion the impulse of the shock wave is defined as i s and the impulses of the bubble loads during the first and the second cycle of bubble oscillation are defined as i b 1 and i b 2 respectively it can be seen from the impulse time history curves in fig 4 11 and table 2 that the impulses of bubble load in the second and third cycle of bubble oscillation are much smaller than the impulse of bubble load in the first pulsation phase 3 2 mathematical models for bubble load during the first cycle of bubble oscillation from the results show in fig 4 9 the impulse of bubble load during the first bubble pulsation phase are larger than the second and the third phase the time history of pressure have very significant characteristics when γ 1 2 in this section we focus on the characteristics in the first bubble pulsation phase when γ 1 2 fig 12 shows the water jet velocity on the bubble jet tip measured by high speed camera it can be seen from the figure that the velocity of the bubble jet tip is generally between 100 and 150 m s and there is a minimum value near the stand off parameter of γ 0 6 these are consistent with the other studies lauterborn 1998 tomita and shima 1986 the bubble load characteristics in case of γ 0 51 has similar trend with the case of γ 0 38 during the first bubble pulsation phase the bubble load consists two parts they are bubble re entrant jet load with a large pulse width and bubble contraction collapse load with a sharp pulse width although the pressure peak of the bubble re entrant jet load is smaller than that of the bubble contraction collapse load owing to its large pulse width the bubble re entrant jet load still keeps as the main factor causing larger deformation of the elastoplastic structure based on this pressure time distribution characteristics we can define the mathematical expression of the bubble re entrant jet load as 1 p b 1 j δ τ u t t c δ τ u t c δ τ u t t c p b 1 j exp t t c θ b 1 j t c t where δ τ u is the rising time of the bubble jet load from time moment of t 0 to t c here we define t 0 as t c δ τ u and θ b 1 j is the fitting time decay of the bubble re entrant jet load for a better description the relevant annotations are given in the fig 13 when the bubble collapses to the minimum volume the bubble contraction collapse load with multi peaks will appear in the time distribution compared to the bubble re entrant jet load the pulse width of the bubble contraction collapse load is extremely narrow to simplify the mathematical model referring to the research results of cole s cole 1948 we can defined the mathematical expression of the bubble contraction collapse load as 2 p b 1 c exp t t c 1 θ b 1 c t t c 1 p b 1 c exp t t c 1 θ b 1 c t t c 1 where p b 1 c and θ b 1 c are the pressure peak and the fitting time decay of the bubble contraction collapse load during the first cycle of the bubble pulsation as the same definition in reference tomita and shima 1986 t c and t c 1 represent the time moment of the bubble reentrant jet acted on the rigid wall and that of bubble collapsing to the minimal volume respectively the relationship between t c and t c 1 can be expressed as 3 t c 1 t c δ τ t where t is the time period of the bubble pulsation to define the pulse width or the time decay of the bubble load the idea of average impulse was used in this paper for the exponentially decaying form load the impulse can be expressed as 4 i 0 t p t d t p m θ therefore during the first bubble pulsation phase the pressure peaks of bubble load e g p b 1 j and p b 1 c the parameters of t c and t c 1 can be directly extracted from the experimental data and the fitted parameters θ b 1 j and θ b 1 c are obtained by the impulse data and equation 4 respectively the calculated values are counted in table 3 and their load curves were plotted as shown in fig 13 17 it is worth mentioning that due to the defects of the acquisition instrument two test cases of γ 0 90 and γ 1 06 have obvious peak clipping phenomenon in order to better reflect the bubble load characteristics the experimental data was adjusted by means of compensation as shown by the black dashed line in fig 16 and fig 17 the experimental data and the fitting results show that the fitted curve and the test value have a good agreement that is the pressure at the center point of the wall pressure can be described by the superposition of the formula 1 and the formula 2 that is to say the wall pressure caused by the first pulsation phase of the bubble is composed of two parts the first part is the bubble reentrant jet load which is mainly divided into the load rising phase and the exponential decay phase the second part is the bubble contraction collapse load which is mainly in the form of symmetrical exponential rise and decay it is obvious that when γ 0 51 the bubble contraction collapse load peak is greater than that of the bubble reentrant jet load at γ 0 38 the impulse of the bubble contraction load accounted for 14 of the total impulse of the bubble load during the first bubble pulsation phase at this time the impulse caused by the bubble contraction collapse load cannot be ignored as γ increases when γ 0 64 the impulse of the bubble contraction collapse load accounts for only about 3 of the total impulse it shows that the main impulse of the bubble load on the structure is derived from the near structure bubble re entrant jet load it can be seen from table 3 that the impulse of the fitted load curve and the actual impulse error are controlled within 3 5 except for the case of γ 0 90 with 11 error the main error of this case may be due to the rising phase of the bubble jet load however the matching degree for the exponential decay phase of the bubble jet load and the bubble shrinkage collapse stage still meets the fitting requirements it can be clearly seen from the data in table 3 that the jet load is closely related to the bubble characteristic amount when the bubble collapses it is worth mentioning that since the bubble contraction collapse load peak p b 1 c in the test result is the superposition value of the re entrant jet load at time t c 1 and the actual pulsation peak p b 1 c the pressure peak p b 1 c is corrected if the tip velocity of the bubble jet is v t i p the peak of the bubble re entrant jet load can be predicted as 1 2 ρ v 2 t i p it can be seen from the data in the table 3 except for the case of γ 0 90 the error of the impulse and the peak of bubble re entrant jet load between the experimental data and other forecasts are controlled within 3 75 for the time parameter δ τ u of the rising phase of the bubble jet load when γ 0 38 we have δ τ u 0 0 1 m s when 0 51 γ 0 90 then we have δ τ u 0 1 0 2 m s this can be explained by the fact that the smaller the γ the smaller the thickness of the water layer between the bubble and the wall surface as the bubble en entrant jet directly acting on the wall the rise time of bubble jet load will be shorter when γ 1 06 the bubble jet will travel a long distance to reach the wall so δ τ u reaches 0 4 ms it can be seen from table 3 that for the wall pressure caused by the first pulsation stage of bubble if the time parameters δ τ u δ τ θ b 1 j θ b 1 c and the load peaks of p b 1 j p b 1 c can be determined the wall pressure characteristics of the bubble can be uniquely determined that means we have relationship as p b w a l l f δ τ u δ τ t θ b 1 j θ b 1 c p b 1 j p b 1 c according to the test data the variation law of p b 1 c with the stand off parameter γ is shown in fig 18 to obtain the wall pressure caused by a nearby bubble p b w a l l p b 1 j can predict by 1 2 ρ v 2 t i p and p b 1 c shrinks as γ 3 increase to perform a dimensionless analysis on time parameters the dimensionless factor of time can be taken as 0 915 r m ρ p and the results are summarized in table 4 where ρ and p are the ambient density and pressure of the liquid at inception point of the underwater explosion bubble respectively it can be seen from the table 4 that when γ 0 38 δ τ is taken as δ τ 0 0 014 t when 0 51 γ 0 90 we have δ τ 0 028 t 0 03 t and as γ 1 06 then we have δ τ 0 058 t when δ τ is between 0 1 and 0 2 its trend with distance γ is consistent with that given in the literature tomita and shima 1986 the value of θ b 1 j ranges from 0 043 to 0 089 the value of θ b 1 c ranges from 0 003 to 0 013 θ b 1 j is almost ten times that of θ b 1 c see table 4 fig 19 shows the tendency of these parameters due to the distance changes theoretically the parameters of δ τ u δ τ θ b 1 j and θ b 1 c under a certain stand off parameter γ can be obtained by interpolation and the wall pressure of the bubble load can be obtained by combining equations 1 and 2 the wall pressure of bubble load that is the mathematical expression of the explosion bubble load model in order to obtain quantitative law of wall pressure under mini charge explosion bubble from the experimental data the parameters shown in fig 19 are fitted and the parameter values can be quickly obtained by fitting the formula given in table 4 it is worth mentioning that the main variable of this quantitative law is the stand off parameter γ which is closely related to the maximum radius of the bubble r m therefore there is also a direct relationship with the size of the charge the purpose of this study is to adopt an equivalent explosive source close to the explosion bubble that is mini charge explosion and the summarized law is only applicable to the loading law of small charge further studies are needed on the wall pressure loading under the influence of different mass large charge explosion and type of detonation source 3 3 relationship between bubble quantities and bubble load using the means of experimentation the time distribution law of the wall pressure at the center point was obtained in the previous section in order to carry out a more profound analysis of the load space distribution of the first cycle of bubble pulsation this section combines the numerical method to systematically analyze the flow field and wall pressure of the bubble pulsation process and predict the spatial distribution of the bubble load under the premise of ensuring certain accuracy the numerical method has great advantages in analyzing the spatial distribution of wall pressure in the previous test because the diameter of the sensor used was relatively large 1 3 to 1 2 times the width of the bubble jet there were few measurable points and irregularities in measuring the pressure space distribution in addition for the feature quantity of the bubble jet there may be some error by the discrimination of the high speed image so it is difficult to find the feature law therefore this section reveals these problems by means of numerical means which are the spatial distribution characteristics of the bubble jet load on the wall surface and the variation law of the characteristic quantities of the near surface bubble jet in this paper five main geometric quantities used to define the bubble re entrant jet characteristics were selected as in chen et al 2018 jayaprakash et al 2012 they are the width of the bubble re entrant jet w the height of the bubble re entrant jet h the equivalent cylinder radius of the bubble re entrant jet r e q ν j e t π h the velocity of on the top tip of the liquid jet v t i p and the momentum of re entrant jet velocity v m o m where ν j e t is the volume of the re entrant within the bubble v m o m satisfy v m o m 1 ν j e t ν v d ν the schematic of the jet quantities in different time period are shown in fig 20 the study of using the boundary element method to solve the time and spatial distribution characteristics of pressure near the wall surface has been clarified in our another published literature chen et al 2018 and we will not be repeated here in this study the axisymmetric boundary element bem model is used and the influence of water depth is considered to generalize the analysis results the problem is non dimensionalized with respect to p r m p 0 g and ρ where p is the ambient pressure of the liquid at the inception point of the bubble and ρ is the density of the liquid p 0 is the pressure on the bubble surface and g is the gravity acceleration therefore the initial condition of the bubble motion is given by the strength parameter ε p 0 p and the buoyancy parameter δ 2 ρ g r m p therefore according to the water depth and stand off parameters can be calculated the initial condition of the bubble motion based on the conclusions of the literature chen et al 2018 the following relationships are obtained as follow firstly the bubble jet load is directly related to the bubble jet velocity and the bubble jet velocity is directly related to the bubble stand off parameter secondly the spatial distribution of the bubble load satisfies the relationship of p r p r 0 exp 1 2 r r e q 2 so only the solution r e q is required therefore this section mainly looks for the variation law of bubble characteristic quantities with stand off parameter and then obtains the spatial distribution relationship of bubble load by using the boundary element method we can calculate the physical characteristics of the bubble under different stand off parameters the quantities includes the bubble jet tip velocity v t i p the bubble jet flow equivalent velocity v m o m the dimensionless equivalent bubble jet width r e q r m the details can refer to table 5 fig 21 shows the variation of bubble characteristic quantities at different distance parameters γ when γ 0 35 s it can be found that v t i p decreases almost linearly as γ decreases while r e q r m and h v m o m increases linearly when 0 35 γ 1 1 there is a minimum velocity value nearby γ 0 6 and the value of the bubble jet equivalent width parameter r e q r m is maintained between 0 15 and 0 2 for the convenience of application each parameter is fitted with the change of the distance parameter γ 5 v t i p γ 1854 γ 5 7914 γ 4 12800 γ 3 9644 γ 2 3349 γ 321 6 r e q r m γ 4 92 γ 5 18 55 γ 4 27 γ 3 18 99 γ 2 6 24 γ 0 92 as can be seen from the data in the table 6 except for the case of γ 0 90 the error between the fitting value and the experimental value of v t i p are all controlled within 9 as v t i p from the experiment mainly depends on the image extraction there is error due to the limited number of image frames therefore in this paper the v t i p from experimental extraction is mainly used to obtain the law features while the v t i p from numerical calculation that can reflect the detail features is used as the main value source of the quantitative law in the next section therefore based on the selected parameter γ and the interpolation in fig 21 or the corresponding fitting formula 5 6 the spatial distribution of the bubble load can be uniquely determined 3 4 quantitative law of wall pressure based on the discussion mentioned above this section discusses how to forecast the mini charge underwater explosion bubble re entrant jet load and the bubble contraction collapse load that is try to answer the question how to predict the wall pressure caused by nearby mini charge undex bubble according to the empirical formula the maximum radius of the bubble r m can be written as wang and khoo 2004 7 r m 3 38 w h 10 1 3 where w k g and h m s are the weight and the depth of explosive charge respectively the time period of the bubble pulsation t is 8 t 0 915 r m ρ p 0 p where p 0 is the initial bubble pressure and p is the ambient pressure of the liquid at inception point of the underwater explosion bubble therefore the mathematical form of bubble loading proposed by the above discussion can be expressed as 9 p b w a l l f δ τ u δ τ θ b 1 j θ b 1 c v t i p γ if the time at which the bubble re entrant jet load starts is marked as 0 the time and spatial distribution of the near wall bubble load can be simplified as 10 p r 0 t t c δ τ u 1 2 ρ v t i p 2 t δ τ u t 0 t δ τ u t 1 2 ρ v t i p 2 exp t δ τ u t θ b 1 j t δ τ u t t p b 1 c exp t δ τ t θ b 1 c t t δ τ t p b 1 c exp t δ τ t θ b 1 c t t δ τ t and 11 p r t p r 0 t exp 1 2 r r e q 2 where t c 2 t δ τ t 4 conclusion in present paper the wall pressure with different standoff distance parameters subject to near field underwater explosion are experimentally investigated with the recording of the pressure transducer and the observations by the high speed camera we can conduct that the bubble generated by mini charge explosion is an adaptive way to study the interaction between the bubble and the structure the following conclusions are drawn 1 combined with experimental data and numerical results a three stage mathematical model of wall pressure caused by a nearby bubble is first proposed which is a double peak superposition model with linear growth exponential attenuation of bubble re entrant jet load and symmetrical exponential attenuation of bubble collapse load in our study for the first time the bubble load is quantitatively described in mathematical form 2 the control parameters of wall pressure caused by bubble movement are given on this basis the quantitative law of wall pressure caused by mini charge are given it is worth mentioning that the quantitative law of wall pressure proposed in this paper is only applicable to the loading law of mini charge further studies are needed on the wall pressure loading under the influence of different mass large

21664,the wall pressure caused by underwater explosion is always a key problem in the anti explosion design of naval ships notably the accurate wall pressure caused by underwater explosion bubble is one of the most difficult parts due to the significant nonlinear deformation of the bubble in present study the dynamics of an underwater explosion bubble near a rigid wall are captured by high speed camera and the wall pressure in the wall center are measured by a pressure transducer the wall pressure with standoff distance parameter γ d r m from 0 38 to 1 54 are recorded where d represents the vertical distance from the explosive charge center to the wall center and r m is the maximum radius of bubble according to the previous study and the experimental data in this paper when γ 1 2 the load on the wall center has obvious double peak phenomenon that is the composition of the re entrant jet load and the bubble collapse load to obtain the quantitative law of wall pressure caused by mini charge underwater explosion bubble we proposed a mathematical model to describe the time pressure curve when γ 1 2 and according to the conclusion in our previous study chen et al 2018 based on the boundary element method bem the space distribution of the wall pressure was obtained keywords underwater explosion bubble wall pressure quantitative law 1 introduction accurately obtaining the wall pressure caused by underwater explosion bubble plays a key role in ship design experimental method has been recognized worldwide as the authoritative means of studying the near field explosion bubble load a large number of researchers carried out experiments on bubble dynamics and its impact load among these studies scholars have developed many experimental methods to study underwater bubbles such as laser bubbles lauterborn 1998 lindau and lauterborn 2003 shaw et al 1999 zhao et al 2007 y et al 1991 electrode discharge bubbles c g et al 1995 cui et al 2016a fong et al 2009 gong et al 2018 luo et al 2018 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2018a underwater explosion bubbles klaseboer et al 2005 cui et al 2016b the measurement of the bubble load on the wall surface can be traced back to 1980 s tong tong et al 1999 conducted a series of studies on the wall pressure caused by laser bubble with standoff distance parameters between 0 8 and 1 2 using experiments and numerical methods studies have shown that the first peak of the bubble load has an inflection point as the standoff distance parameters increases and the decay time corresponding to this pressure peak inflection point is prolonged tomita et al shima et al 1983 tomita and shima 1986 used the wall pressure sensor system to study the load characteristics of laser bubble and its damage to soft structures wang et al wang and chen 2007 used pvdf sensors to measure the impulse of bubble loads and the law of load characteristics are given with the development of the small charge underwater explosion test mu et al jin lei et al 2010 used wall pressure sensors to measure the horizontal vertical and inclined wall pressure caused by bubble motion by using pressure transducer a number of experiments near a vertical wall and between a free surface and a bottom have been conducted jayaprakash et al 2010 2012 to study the wall pressure caused by spark generated bubble the experimental results indicated the jet characteristics as function of standoff distance by using hopkinson bar yao et al cui et al 2018 yao et al 2019a 2019b proposed a new pressure measure methodology to assess the pressure loading on the rigid planar boundary due to spark generated bubble or micro charge explosive through the above test results we can find that the standoff distance parameter is one of the important parameter to the bubble dynamics whether the explosion source is laser bubble electric spark bubble or under explosion bubble when γ 1 2 two pressure peaks of bubble load acted on the wall is a very obvious feature however many experimental results only provide qualitative analysis from these qualitative researches the bubble load on the wall center has obvious double peak phenomenon that is the composition of the re entrant jet load and the bubble collapse load unfortunately based on the present public studies there is no concrete expression of the wall pressure caused by underwater explosion bubble the specific waveform distribution form in time and space and quantitative relationship between the impact load and bubble deformation are not clearly given as an effective numerical method boundary element method bem klaseboer et al 2005 wang and khoo 2004 jin et al 2018 2019 has been one of the most salient methods to calculate the bubble dynamics and its impact load li et al 2015 2016 2018a 2018b 2019 used the bem to simulate the near wall bubble dynamics and combined the auxiliary function to solve the wall pressure when γ 1 2 the phenomenon of bimodal load near the wall is revealed in the results of different calculation methods by many different authors for example liu et al 2017 used the front tracking method ftm to simulate the shape and load characteristics of incompressible bubble near the wall chahine et al hsiao et al 2014 used a hybrid solution to solve the high efficiency boundary element method and the finite difference method considering compressibility similar to chahine s hybrid solution wang et al wang et al 2015 zhang et al 2018b combined with the discontinuous galerkin method jin et al 2017 and the boundary element method to numerically simulate the load characteristics of spark generated bubble in tian s tian et al 2020 work the eulerian finite element method efem is introduced to continuously simulate the shock wave and non spherical bubble evolution stages near a horizontal solid wall to sum up these studies have mentioned the evolution characteristics and loading characteristics of bubble but they rarely show the quantitative rules therefore this study intends to carry out a series of tests and show the quantitative relationship between the wall pressure and the bubble deformation by combining numerical methods in this paper the mechanism of bubble re entrant jet and shrinkage collapse load of bubble near a rigid wall was studied by means of experimental test and numerical method the mini charge underwater explosion bubble test was systematically carried out to obtain the bubble jet and shrinkage collapse load near a rigid wall to obtain the quantitative law of wall pressure caused by mini charge we proposed a mathematical model to describe the time pressure curve when γ 1 2 and according to the conclusion in our previous study chen et al 2018 based on the boundary element method bem the space distribution of the wall pressure was obtained 2 experimental details 2 1 experiment apparatus in this study experiments were performed using mini charge explosive beneath a target plate in a tank of quiescent water as shown in fig 1 the measurement apparatus of this experiment system consists of a waterproof tube a target plate an aluminum alloy frame and a water tank as the experiment base an aluminum alloy frame was 0 75 m long 0 75 m wide and 1 8 m height the transparent glass tank with 0 6 m long 0 6 m wide and 0 6 m deep was located on the aluminum alloy frame the target plate is a circular plate made of 304 stainless steel its thickness and diameter are 12 mm and 250 mm respectively in order to measure the wall pressure at the center of the target plate a through threaded hole was drilled and the pressure transducer was embedded in the center of the target plate by means of bolt connection during the process of installing the pressure transducer we needed to pay attention to keep the measurement surface of the pressure transducer and the surface of the target plate on the same plane the details installation arrangement of pressure transducer was shown in fig 2 the target plate and the waterproof cylindrical tube were connected by bolts and waterproof gaskets and then fixed above the water tank in this paper a mini charge of powder of fire cracker was used as the explosive source the powder of fire cracker consists of 55 65 of potassium perchlorate powder 18 23 of aluminium powder 10 15 of ferrotitanium powder and about 5 of manganese dioxide powder supported by the 3d fixator the bubble was generated by ignited the explosive charge below the target plate with different standoff distances 2 2 experimental measuring device images of the bubble dynamics were

works at a rate of 6000 fps with 1024 by 768 pixels the exposure time was 90 μs per frame a 25 mm f 2 8 lens canon with a fully open aperture was used for all experiments in this study as shown in fig 1 the camera was placed directly in front of the water tank and the led lamp used as the background light was placed directly behind the water tank the pressure transducer used in this paper is the piezoelectricity type pressure transducer of sinocera piezotronics inc http www china yec com together with a ye5853 low noise charge amplifier this pressure transducer cy yd 205 had a diameter of 10

signals it worked with a sampling rate of 125 ksa s and a sampling accuracy of 8 bits by simultaneously outputting the trigger signal through the oscilloscope the high speed camera was synched in time with the ignition of mini charge through the oscilloscope and the simultaneous recording of the oscilloscope 3 results and discussion bubble dynamics in the free field with a charge of 0 2 g is shown in fig 3 during the first two cycles of bubble s expansion and collapse the maximum radius of the underwater explosion bubble in the first cycle was 78 0 mm bubble dynamics nearby a rigid wall varied in mass of charge and standoff distance here we focus on the influence of standoff distance on wall pressure by using the same explosive source with a charge of 0 2 0 001 g 7 test cases of underwater explosion bubble near a rigid wall were carried out the details was listed in table 1 here the non dimensional standoff distance is defined as γ d r m where d represents the standoff distance from the explosive charge center to the wall center and r m is the maximum radius of underwater explosion bubble in all experiments the water depth in the water tank was kept at 550 mm and the target plate was placed 30 mm beneath the free surface 3 1 wall pressures at different γ the wall pressure measured by pressure transducer with γ 0 38 was shown in fig 4 a five significant pressure peaks are tagged in fig 4 a respectively the time corresponding to these pressure peaks respectively are 0 02 ms 14 56 ms 15 11 ms 22 68 ms and 27 75 ms with the help of the high speed camera we analyzed the bubble dynamics closest to these moments fig 5 shows three cycles of bubble oscillation from charge was ignited to the third time of bubble collapse according to the high speed camera records fig 5 and the time history of pressure fig 4 as the explosive charge was ignited t 0 fig 5 a a shock wave was generated and reached the target plate after 0 02 ms then the first pressure peak shock wave p s was recorded at the wall center during the first cycle of bubble oscillation as the bubble re entrant jet acted on the target plate fig 5 i and bubble turned to minimum volume fig 5 j the second and the third pressure peak occurred here we defined the pressure peaks caused by re entrant jet impact and bubble collapse during the first cycle of bubble oscillation as p b 1 j and p b 1 c the third and the four pressure peak at t 22 68 ms and t 27 75 ms in fig 4 a referred to maximum of the bubble collapse load during the second and the third cycle of bubble oscillation which were defined as p b 2 c and p b 3 c for the case of γ 0 38 fig 4 a shows the pressure peak and the impulse of the bubble load during the first cycle of bubble oscillation are significantly larger than that of the shock wave fig 4 b shows the bubble load during the first cycle of bubble oscillation has several pressure peaks the first pressure peak at t 14 56 ms at the moment of the re entrant jet impact hsiao et al 2014 a plurality of bubble collapse load peaks at t 15 11 ms and t 15 16 ms correspond to bubble ring collapse after the bubble re entrant jet impact the wall the speed of the time decay of the re entrant jet load is slowed down due to the splashing effect chen et al 2018 li et al 2015 and then the plurality of bubble collapse peaks occurs after the bubble re entrant jet load similarly in the study of mu et al jin lei et al 2010 it is found that the distribution of the bubble load during the first cycle of bubble oscillation at the center of the nearby rigid wall has similar characteristics the distribution waveform of the bubble load in this phase is called as saddle type saddle type can be described as the superposition of the bubble re entrant jet load and the bubble collapse load on the time distribution with the second and the third collapse of the bubble the corresponding bubble collapse loads with a large pressure peak and a narrow pulse width were measured at the center of the nearby rigid wall in fig 4 a we observe that the bubble load impulse of the second and the third cycle of bubble oscillation are only about 20 and 12 of that of the first cycle of bubble oscillation it shows that the bubble load in the first cycle of bubble oscillation is mainly evaluated when assessing the bubble load and the impulse of the bubble re entrant jet load in the first cycle of bubble oscillation is much larger than the component of the bubble collapse load these details are specifically analyzed in the next section it can be seen from fig 6 and fig 7 that the pressure time history of γ 0 51 and γ 0 67 have a similar characteristics with the case of γ 0 38 that is during the first cycle of bubble oscillation the main distribution law is the superposition of the bubble re entrant jet load and the multiple contraction collapse load of bubble fig 6 b and fig 7 b it is worth mentioning that these multiple contraction collapse loads of bubble was recorded in detail in the experiment compared with the experiment study of bubble load carried out by other scholars luo et al 2018 cui et al 2016b jin lei et al 2010 jayaprakash et al 2012 most of the experimental records of explosive bubble rarely have such detailed records on the bubble collapse load at present by using a new measurement based on hopkinson bar multiple contraction collapse load during the bubble collapsing in first cycle also can be captured in cui s cui et al 2018 experimental records from the study of literature lindau and lauterborn 2003 we suspect these multiple peaks with narrow pulse width in the first pulsation phase may be due to the formation of annular bubble when the bubble shrinks to the minimum volume owing to the asymmetric motion the annular bubble will be broken into more than two independent tiny bubbles then these multi independent tiny bubbles will further shrink to their minimum volume and radiate high pressure shock waves these shock waves are superimposed at the center point of the rigid wall to create a special phenomenon which show as multi pressure peaks after bubble re entrant jet load when γ 0 90 fig 8 b this special phenomenon disappeared which mean the asymmetric motion might not appear in this case when γ 1 06 fig 9 we can clearly distinguish the pressure peaks of bubble re entrant jet load and the bubble collapse load and the time difference between them according to the conclusion in the literature tomita and shima 1986 when γ 1 2 the time moment of bubble re entrant jet acts on the nearby rigid wall was later than the time moment of the bubble shrinks to the minimum volume the same time sequence of these two pressure peaks is shown in γ 1 54 the first peak of bubble load during the first cycle of bubble oscillation is the bubble collapse load and the following pressure peak is caused by the bubble re entrant jet for a better understanding on what happens during near field underwater explosion by comparing the images and the pressure time history images of underwater explosion bubble s expansion and collapse near the solid wall for γ 0 51 γ 1 54 are given in appendix a statistical analysis was carried out on the pressure peaks and impulse of the above seven stand off parameters shown in table 2 for the convenience of discussion the impulse of the shock wave is defined as i s and the impulses of the bubble loads during the first and the second cycle of bubble oscillation are defined as i b 1 and i b 2 respectively it can be seen from the impulse time history curves in fig 4 11 and table 2 that the impulses of bubble load in the second and third cycle of bubble oscillation are much smaller than the impulse of bubble load in the first pulsation phase 3 2 mathematical models for bubble load during the first cycle of bubble oscillation from the results show in fig 4 9 the impulse of bubble load during the first bubble pulsation phase are larger than the second and the third phase the time history of pressure have very significant characteristics when γ 1 2 in this section we focus on the characteristics in the first bubble pulsation phase when γ 1 2 fig 12 shows the water jet velocity on the bubble jet tip measured by high speed camera it can be seen from the figure that the velocity of the bubble jet tip is generally between 100 and 150 m s and there is a minimum value near the stand off parameter of γ 0 6 these are consistent with the other studies lauterborn 1998 tomita and shima 1986 the bubble load characteristics in case of γ 0 51 has similar trend with the case of γ 0 38 during the first bubble pulsation phase the bubble load consists two parts they are bubble re entrant jet load with a large pulse width and bubble contraction collapse load with a sharp pulse width although the pressure peak of the bubble re entrant jet load is smaller than that of the bubble contraction collapse load owing to its large pulse width the bubble re entrant jet load still keeps as the main factor causing larger deformation of the elastoplastic structure based on this pressure time distribution characteristics we can define the mathematical expression of the bubble re entrant jet load as 1 p b 1 j δ τ u t t c δ τ u t c δ τ u t t c p b 1 j exp t t c θ b 1 j t c t where δ τ u is the rising time of the bubble jet load from time moment of t 0 to t c here we define t 0 as t c δ τ u and θ b 1 j is the fitting time decay of the bubble re entrant jet load for a better description the relevant annotations are given in the fig 13 when the bubble collapses to the minimum volume the bubble contraction collapse load with multi peaks will appear in the time distribution compared to the bubble re entrant jet load the pulse width of the bubble contraction collapse load is extremely narrow to simplify the mathematical model referring to the research results of cole s cole 1948 we can defined the mathematical expression of the bubble contraction collapse load as 2 p b 1 c exp t t c 1 θ b 1 c t t c 1 p b 1 c exp t t c 1 θ b 1 c t t c 1 where p b 1 c and θ b 1 c are the pressure peak and the fitting time decay of the bubble contraction collapse load during the first cycle of the bubble pulsation as the same definition in reference tomita and shima 1986 t c and t c 1 represent the time moment of the bubble reentrant jet acted on the rigid wall and that of bubble collapsing to the minimal volume respectively the relationship between t c and t c 1 can be expressed as 3 t c 1 t c δ τ t where t is the time period of the bubble pulsation to define the pulse width or the time decay of the bubble load the idea of average impulse was used in this paper for the exponentially decaying form load the impulse can be expressed as 4 i 0 t p t d t p m θ therefore during the first bubble pulsation phase the pressure peaks of bubble load e g p b 1 j and p b 1 c the parameters of t c and t c 1 can be directly extracted from the experimental data and the fitted parameters θ b 1 j and θ b 1 c are obtained by the impulse data and equation 4 respectively the calculated values are counted in table 3 and their load curves were plotted as shown in fig 13 17 it is worth mentioning that due to the defects of the acquisition instrument two test cases of γ 0 90 and γ 1 06 have obvious peak clipping phenomenon in order to better reflect the bubble load characteristics the experimental data was adjusted by means of compensation as shown by the black dashed line in fig 16 and fig 17 the experimental data and the fitting results show that the fitted curve and the test value have a good agreement that is the pressure at the center point of the wall pressure can be described by the superposition of the formula 1 and the formula 2 that is to say the wall pressure caused by the first pulsation phase of the bubble is composed of two parts the first part is the bubble reentrant jet load which is mainly divided into the load rising phase and the exponential decay phase the second part is the bubble contraction collapse load which is mainly in the form of symmetrical exponential rise and decay it is obvious that when γ 0 51 the bubble contraction collapse load peak is greater than that of the bubble reentrant jet load at γ 0 38 the impulse of the bubble contraction load accounted for 14 of the total impulse of the bubble load during the first bubble pulsation phase at this time the impulse caused by the bubble contraction collapse load cannot be ignored as γ increases when γ 0 64 the impulse of the bubble contraction collapse load accounts for only about 3 of the total impulse it shows that the main impulse of the bubble load on the structure is derived from the near structure bubble re entrant jet load it can be seen from table 3 that the impulse of the fitted load curve and the actual impulse error are controlled within 3 5 except for the case of γ 0 90 with 11 error the main error of this case may be due to the rising phase of the bubble jet load however the matching degree for the exponential decay phase of the bubble jet load and the bubble shrinkage collapse stage still meets the fitting requirements it can be clearly seen from the data in table 3 that the jet load is closely related to the bubble characteristic amount when the bubble collapses it is worth mentioning that since the bubble contraction collapse load peak p b 1 c in the test result is the superposition value of the re entrant jet load at time t c 1 and the actual pulsation peak p b 1 c the pressure peak p b 1 c is corrected if the tip velocity of the bubble jet is v t i p the peak of the bubble re entrant jet load can be predicted as 1 2 ρ v 2 t i p it can be seen from the data in the table 3 except for the case of γ 0 90 the error of the impulse and the peak of bubble re entrant jet load between the experimental data and other forecasts are controlled within 3 75 for the time parameter δ τ u of the rising phase of the bubble jet load when γ 0 38 we have δ τ u 0 0 1 m s when 0 51 γ 0 90 then we have δ τ u 0 1 0 2 m s this can be explained by the fact that the smaller the γ the smaller the thickness of the water layer between the bubble and the wall surface as the bubble en entrant jet directly acting on the wall the rise time of bubble jet load will be shorter when γ 1 06 the bubble jet will travel a long distance to reach the wall so δ τ u reaches 0 4 ms it can be seen from table 3 that for the wall pressure caused by the first pulsation stage of bubble if the time parameters δ τ u δ τ θ b 1 j θ b 1 c and the load peaks of p b 1 j p b 1 c can be determined the wall pressure characteristics of the bubble can be uniquely determined that means we have relationship as p b w a l l f δ τ u δ τ t θ b 1 j θ b 1 c p b 1 j p b 1 c according to the test data the variation law of p b 1 c with the stand off parameter γ is shown in fig 18 to obtain the wall pressure caused by a nearby bubble p b w a l l p b 1 j can predict by 1 2 ρ v 2 t i p and p b 1 c shrinks as γ 3 increase to perform a dimensionless analysis on time parameters the dimensionless factor of time can be taken as 0 915 r m ρ p and the results are summarized in table 4 where ρ and p are the ambient density and pressure of the liquid at inception point of the underwater explosion bubble respectively it can be seen from the table 4 that when γ 0 38 δ τ is taken as δ τ 0 0 014 t when 0 51 γ 0 90 we have δ τ 0 028 t 0 03 t and as γ 1 06 then we have δ τ 0 058 t when δ τ is between 0 1 and 0 2 its trend with distance γ is consistent with that given in the literature tomita and shima 1986 the value of θ b 1 j ranges from 0 043 to 0 089 the value of θ b 1 c ranges from 0 003 to 0 013 θ b 1 j is almost ten times that of θ b 1 c see table 4 fig 19 shows the tendency of these parameters due to the distance changes theoretically the parameters of δ τ u δ τ θ b 1 j and θ b 1 c under a certain stand off parameter γ can be obtained by interpolation and the wall pressure of the bubble load can be obtained by combining equations 1 and 2 the wall pressure of bubble load that is the mathematical expression of the explosion bubble load model in order to obtain quantitative law of wall pressure under mini charge explosion bubble from the experimental data the parameters shown in fig 19 are fitted and the parameter values can be quickly obtained by fitting the formula given in table 4 it is worth mentioning that the main variable of this quantitative law is the stand off parameter γ which is closely related to the maximum radius of the bubble r m therefore there is also a direct relationship with the size of the charge the purpose of this study is to adopt an equivalent explosive source close to the explosion bubble that is mini charge explosion and the summarized law is only applicable to the loading law of small charge further studies are needed on the wall pressure loading under the influence of different mass large charge explosion and type of detonation source 3 3 relationship between bubble quantities and bubble load using the means of experimentation the time distribution law of the wall pressure at the center point was obtained in the previous section in order to carry out a more profound analysis of the load space distribution of the first cycle of bubble pulsation this section combines the numerical method to systematically analyze the flow field and wall pressure of the bubble pulsation process and predict the spatial distribution of the bubble load under the premise of ensuring certain accuracy the numerical method has great advantages in analyzing the spatial distribution of wall pressure in the previous test because the diameter of the sensor used was relatively large 1 3 to 1 2 times the width of the bubble jet there were few measurable points and irregularities in measuring the pressure space distribution in addition for the feature quantity of the bubble jet there may be some error by the discrimination of the high speed image so it is difficult to find the feature law therefore this section reveals these problems by means of numerical means which are the spatial distribution characteristics of the bubble jet load on the wall surface and the variation law of the characteristic quantities of the near surface bubble jet in this paper five main geometric quantities used to define the bubble re entrant jet characteristics were selected as in chen et al 2018 jayaprakash et al 2012 they are the width of the bubble re entrant jet w the height of the bubble re entrant jet h the equivalent cylinder radius of the bubble re entrant jet r e q ν j e t π h the velocity of on the top tip of the liquid jet v t i p and the momentum of re entrant jet velocity v m o m where ν j e t is the volume of the re entrant within the bubble v m o m satisfy v m o m 1 ν j e t ν v d ν the schematic of the jet quantities in different time period are shown in fig 20 the study of using the boundary element method to solve the time and spatial distribution characteristics of pressure near the wall surface has been clarified in our another published literature chen et al 2018 and we will not be repeated here in this study the axisymmetric boundary element bem model is used and the influence of water depth is considered to generalize the analysis results the problem is non dimensionalized with respect to p r m p 0 g and ρ where p is the ambient pressure of the liquid at the inception point of the bubble and ρ is the density of the liquid p 0 is the pressure on the bubble surface and g is the gravity acceleration therefore the initial condition of the bubble motion is given by the strength parameter ε p 0 p and the buoyancy parameter δ 2 ρ g r m p therefore according to the water depth and stand off parameters can be calculated the initial condition of the bubble motion based on the conclusions of the literature chen et al 2018 the following relationships are obtained as follow firstly the bubble jet load is directly related to the bubble jet velocity and the bubble jet velocity is directly related to the bubble stand off parameter secondly the spatial distribution of the bubble load satisfies the relationship of p r p r 0 exp 1 2 r r e q 2 so only the solution r e q is required therefore this section mainly looks for the variation law of bubble characteristic quantities with stand off parameter and then obtains the spatial distribution relationship of bubble load by using the boundary element method we can calculate the physical characteristics of the bubble under different stand off parameters the quantities includes the bubble jet tip velocity v t i p the bubble jet flow equivalent velocity v m o m the dimensionless equivalent bubble jet width r e q r m the details can refer to table 5 fig 21 shows the variation of bubble characteristic quantities at different distance parameters γ when γ 0 35 s it can be found that v t i p decreases almost linearly as γ decreases while r e q r m and h v m o m increases linearly when 0 35 γ 1 1 there is a minimum velocity value nearby γ 0 6 and the value of the bubble jet equivalent width parameter r e q r m is maintained between 0 15 and 0 2 for the convenience of application each parameter is fitted with the change of the distance parameter γ 5 v t i p γ 1854 γ 5 7914 γ 4 12800 γ 3 9644 γ 2 3349 γ 321 6 r e q r m γ 4 92 γ 5 18 55 γ 4 27 γ 3 18 99 γ 2 6 24 γ 0 92 as can be seen from the data in the table 6 except for the case of γ 0 90 the error between the fitting value and the experimental value of v t i p are all controlled within 9 as v t i p from the experiment mainly depends on the image extraction there is error due to the limited number of image frames therefore in this paper the v t i p from experimental extraction is mainly used to obtain the law features while the v t i p from numerical calculation that can reflect the detail features is used as the main value source of the quantitative law in the next section therefore based on the selected parameter γ and the interpolation in fig 21 or the corresponding fitting formula 5 6 the spatial distribution of the bubble load can be uniquely determined 3 4 quantitative law of wall pressure based on the discussion mentioned above this section discusses how to forecast the mini charge underwater explosion bubble re entrant jet load and the bubble contraction collapse load that is try to answer the question how to predict the wall pressure caused by nearby mini charge undex bubble according to the empirical formula the maximum radius of the bubble r m can be written as wang and khoo 2004 7 r m 3 38 w h 10 1 3 where w k g and h m s are the weight and the depth of explosive charge respectively the time period of the bubble pulsation t is 8 t 0 915 r m ρ p 0 p where p 0 is the initial bubble pressure and p is the ambient pressure of the liquid at inception point of the underwater explosion bubble therefore the mathematical form of bubble loading proposed by the above discussion can be expressed as 9 p b w a l l f δ τ u δ τ θ b 1 j θ b 1 c v t i p γ if the time at which the bubble re entrant jet load starts is marked as 0 the time and spatial distribution of the near wall bubble load can be simplified as 10 p r 0 t t c δ τ u 1 2 ρ v t i p 2 t δ τ u t 0 t δ τ u t 1 2 ρ v t i p 2 exp t δ τ u t θ b 1 j t δ τ u t t p b 1 c exp t δ τ t θ b 1 c t t δ τ t p b 1 c exp t δ τ t θ b 1 c t t δ τ t and 11 p r t p r 0 t exp 1 2 r r e q 2 where t c 2 t δ τ t 4 conclusion in present paper the wall pressure with different standoff distance parameters subject to near field underwater explosion are experimentally investigated with the recording of the pressure transducer and the observations by the high speed camera we can conduct that the bubble generated by mini charge explosion is an adaptive way to study the interaction between the bubble and the structure the following conclusions are drawn 1 combined with experimental data and numerical results a three stage mathematical model of wall pressure caused by a nearby bubble is first proposed which is a double peak superposition model with linear growth exponential attenuation of bubble re entrant jet load and symmetrical exponential attenuation of bubble collapse load in our study for the first time the bubble load is quantitatively described in mathematical form 2 the control parameters of wall pressure caused by bubble movement are given on this basis the quantitative law of wall pressure caused by mini charge are given it is worth mentioning that the quantitative law of wall pressure proposed in this paper is only applicable to the loading law of mini charge further studies are needed on the wall pressure loading under the influence of different mass large
