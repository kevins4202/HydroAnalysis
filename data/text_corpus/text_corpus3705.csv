18525,dissolved organic matter dom in river water dynamically changes with respect to its major sources during heavy rain events however there has been no established tool to estimate the relative contributions of different organic sources to river water dom in this study the evolution in the contributions of ten different organic matter om sources to storm water dom was explored with a selected urban river the geumho river in south korea during storm events via an end member mixing analysis emma based on fluorescence indices and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms the om source materials included treated effluent road runoff groundwater topsoil deep soil leaves reeds riparian plants attached algae and suspended algae the emma results provided quantitative estimates of the variations in the dominant om sources with the progress of storms treated effluent was the prevailing source at the beginning period of the storm while topsoil leaves riparian plants and groundwater predominated during and after the peak period the fluorescence indices based evaluation was consistent with the statistical comparison of the molecular formulas derived from ft icr ms conducted on the ten potential om sources and the storm samples the observed variations in the om sources agreed with the typical characteristics of urban rivers in connection with anthropogenic inputs and the impact of surrounding impervious surfaces this study demonstrates the application of intuitive and facile tools in estimating the relative impacts of om sources in urban watersheds graphical abstract image 1 keywords source tracking fluorescence indices end member mixing analysis fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms storm event 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a key player in global and local carbon cycles because of its high mobility and biogeochemical reactivity the source of dom in water environment can be allochthonous such as terrestrial and anthropogenic materials or autochthonous such as algae macrophytes and sediments chen and jaff√© 2014 tank et al 2010 especially during heavy rainfall events large amounts of organic matter om from various sources in upstream areas may inflow into rivers which is also called non point sources dhillon and inamdar 2013 jeong et al 2012 lee et al 2016 2014 lloret et al 2013 the om sources that dominantly affect river dom depend strongly on land use types and rainfall intensity duration the classic om sources in urban areas are of anthropogenic origin such as the effluent from industry and or wastewater treatment plants and road runoff vystavna et al 2013 even though natural sources such as leaves and groundwater are also present nguyen and hur 2011 yang et al 2015a 2015b the chemical composition of dom is intimately related to its source and the natural modifying processes which may be hydrological geochemical and or physical along its flow paths bauer and bianchi 2011 bolan et al 2011 in an effort to identify the predominant om sources during storm events mostly in non urban watersheds many previous studies have qualitatively compared the chemical composition between storm dom and the potential sources or end members using fluorescence spectroscopy and or isotope abundance bass et al 2011 inamdar et al 2012 2011 johnson et al 2011a lee et al 2016 singh et al 2014 yang et al 2015a in watershed scales the water flow paths during storm events are constantly being altered as the preferential flows shift from macropores into surface runoff or lateral flow and finally into a stream the process is mainly driven by the infiltration of precipitation and the rising water table katsuyama and ohte 2002 kim et al 2010 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 which ultimately lead to variations in the contributions of different sources to the river dom based on previous studies the extent of terrestrial derived dom signatures in non urban rivers tend to rise with increasing input from leaves and top soil i e the upper soil layer and the forest floors during storm events chen et al 2016a inamdar et al 2011 yang et al 2015a however the dynamic variations of the relative contributions from many other potential sources to storm dom have been rarely explored particularly for urban watersheds in addition to the classical om source tracking tools such as fluorescence spectroscopy and isotope carbon and nitrogen abundance other advanced analyses have been applied in the past studies which included size exclusion chromatography with online organic carbon detector sec ocd chen et al 2016a quang et al 2015 and high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms derrien et al 2018b thieme et al 2018 in particular ft icr ms has a strong merit because it fully resolves the molecular composition of complex dom mixtures stenson et al 2002 by assigning molecular formulas to thousands of peaks detected in the mass spectrum of the mixtures sleighter and hatcher 2008 as ft icr ms has become an important feature for recent dom studies derrien et al 2018b thieme et al 2018 it is advantageous to further extend its applications to om source tracking considering the global trend of increasing urbanization and a growing demand for high water quality urban rivers it is very important to identify major storm om sources and estimate their relative contributions to river water dom which will help the efficient and sustainable management of urban watersheds and water quality this is more so since a more diverse om sources exist in urban watersheds than in forested and or non urban watersheds inamdar et al 2011 yang et al 2015a however there has been no established methodology for a quantitative estimation of the relative importance of different om sources in urban river water in this context this study mainly aimed i to compare the dom characteristics of various potential om end member sources distributed in a selected urban watershed the geumho river watershed ii to investigate the dynamic variations in the chemical molecular composition of dom in storm water during heavy rain events using fluorescence spectroscopy and ft icr ms and iii to estimate the relative contributions of the potential om sources to storm dom via the so called end member mixing analysis emma which has been proven to be a simple and effective method to quantify the relative contributions of different sources to the storm dom inamdar et al 2011 yang et al 2015a to this end it was hypothesized that the combinations of om characteristics from all possible om sources or om end members existing in the selected watersheds can represent the measured signatures of collected water samples the main novelty of the present communication partly rests on the fact that there has been no previous published attempt at using emma to quantitatively estimate the relative contributions of different om sources to the dom of an urban river water at different periods of a storm event and partly on the fact that this is the first study to demonstrate the applicability of ft icr ms analysis for om source tracking on storm water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the geumho river belongs to the first tributary of the nakdong river which is one of the four major rivers in south korea the geumho river watershed extends from 35 42 to 35 17 n and from 128 28 to 129 23 e fig s1 the watershed has a total catchment area of 2092 km2 and a river length of 119 km na et al 2016 park et al 2016 the geumho river watershed is located in the central east region of the nakdong river which constitutes 8 8 of the total nakdong river basin the land use of the geumho river watershed consists of forests 63 5 agricultural fields 21 8 urban areas 8 5 and other areas 6 2 park et al 2016 although the watershed area is still covered by forests and agriculture fields it does represent a typical urban watershed as the main channel of the river passes through daegu metropolitan city which is populated by 2 5 million people the average recorded temperature was 27 6 3 5 c at an automatic weather station in daegu city area during the summer monsoon in 2018 korean meteorological administration www kma go kr the east asian summer monsoon usually accounts for 50 60 of the total annual precipitation park et al 2010 from 2014 to 2018 in the daegu area the rainfall amount of the summer monsoon 344 5 601 8 mm is equivalent to 33 8 53 4 of the annual rainfall www kma go kr table s5 water samples were collected using a customized auto sampler robochem autosampler s3 1224r centennial technology co korea which was installed at the lowest point of the river 35 52 12 77 n 128 27 45 25 e during a heavy storm event two liters of water samples were collected at an interval of 2 or 4 h depending on the variation of turbidity which was measured on site by a portable hach turbidimeter storms occurred in the summer monsoon period from late june to august in 2018 fig 1 the total rainfall amount recorded in the summer season from june to august 2018 was 592 5 mm based on the nearest on site monitoring stations in the studied area the rainfall amount on the 25th to the 31st day of august was 267 mm the discharge was calculated using the water level data which was measured every hour and a constructed stage recharge relationship from the website of nakdong river flood control office www nakdongriver go kr sumun wllist do total 27 storm water samples were collected the samples were acidified using sulfuric acid at the field to minimize deterioration and then transported to the laboratory for filtration through a pre ashed gf f whatman filter after ph adjustment to 7 0 to recover the field ph condition all the potential om source materials were taken before the monsoon season to avoid possible rainfall distortion several organic source materials which included top soil 0 2 cm depth n 5 deep soil 15 20 cm depth n 4 weeds n 5 riverside plants n 2 fallen leaves n 2 reeds n 1 suspended algae n 1 and attached algae n 4 were collected from the upstream areas of the geumho river treated effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment facility n 1 groundwater n 1 and road runoff from a large parking lot n 1 were also included as potential om source materials suspended algae was collected in concentrate with a plankton net to take into account the potential in stream om source the details on the sampling sites are presented in table s1 the materials of plants and algae were softly washed with deionized water to remove extraneous substances dried plants were cut into pieces of about 1 cm2 before grinding soil materials were oven dried at 45 c for 3 days and filtered with a 2 mm seive and the algae materials were freeze dried water soluble organic matter wsom or dom for each organic material was prepared by mixing the samples with milli q water at a solid to solution ratio of 1 10 for the dried soil and at 1 20 for other materials for 24 h at 130 rpm at room temperature 25 c without any antibacterial chemicals to avoid interference before filtration all wsom samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min the supernatants were filtered through pre ashed 0 7 Œºm glass fiber filters whatman gf f and analyzed for dom properties within 24 h the dom extraction was conducted in duplicate for the ft icr ms analysis the materials under the same category were combined into one composite sample to represent a single end member for example suspended algae and attached algae were combined as a representative source for algae while riparian plants and weeds were taken into account as a source for riparian plants table 1 before the ft icr ms analyses the solid phase extraction was conducted using ppl cartridges bondelut 1g sorbent agilent inc which is a styrene divinylvenzene polymer modified with proprietary non polar surface following the procedure described in chen et al 2016b the dom retained in the ppl cartridge was immediately extracted with methanol and stored in a freezer until analyzed 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 doc concentrations and uv visible spectroscopy the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc were measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan absorption spectra from 200 to 600 nm were scanned at 1 nm intervals using a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan with a 1 cm quartz cell hellma germany specific uv absorbance suva was calculated based on the 100 fold uv absorption coefficient at 254 nm normalized by the doc concentration the analytical precision of the instruments is presented in the supplementary information table s2 2 2 2 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems was recorded with a luminescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan the eems were scanned at the emission wavelengths em of 280 550 nm with 1 nm increments and over an excitation wavelength ex range of 220 500 nm with a stepwise increase of 5 nm excitation and emission slits were both adjusted to 10 nm the samples were diluted until the uv absorption coefficient at 254 nm dropped below 0 05 cm 1 in order to avoid the inner filter effects ohno 2002 the luminescence spectrometer was adjusted by correcting the ex lamp and the em detector the fluorescence responses for the blank i e milli q water were subtracted from the original eem data the fluorescence intensities of all samples were normalized to raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 the commonly used dom optical indices were calculated from the eem data which included fluorescence index fi humification index hix and biological index bix values the details of the definitions the calculations and related references are available in table s3 2 2 3 ft icr ms analyses ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry measurements were performed with a 15 t ft icr ms interfaced with an apollo ii electrospray ionization source 15t ft icr ms bruker daltonik germany located at the korea basic science institute in ochang south korea a negative ion mode nanomate was used as dom was generally negatively charged the instrument was operated in a broadband mode between 150 and 1200 m z the samples were injected using a hamilton syringe with a flow rate of 2 Œºl min 1 the spray current was set to 3 0 kv and the drying gas temperature was 180 c with a 4 0 l min 1 flow rate the skimmer voltage was set at 30 v one hundred transient scans which were collected with a 4 mword time domain were co added to one mass spectrum the external calibration with arginine clusters and internal recalibration with suwannee river fulvic acid standard srfa 200 900 a built in mixture were adopted to achieve a mass accuracy of 0 050 ppm procedural blanks were run and subtracted from each corresponding sample a conservative magnitude threshold was set to an s n ratio of 10 to avoid potential false positives all ions were singly charged as confirmed by the isotopic spacing pattern 1 00335 da of the corresponding 12cn and 13c12cn 1 mass peak the spectra were evaluated in the mass range of 200 800 m z the mass accuracy threshold was Œ¥m 2 ppm the nitrogen rule and double bond equivalent dbe 1 1 2 2c h n rule permitting only positive integers were applied the criteria of elemental ratios were implemented such as 2 25 h c 0 3 o c 1 2 n c 0 5 s c 0 2 several selected indices such as intensity weighted average wa molecular masses elemental ratios modified aromatic index aimod 1 c 0 5o s 0 5h c 0 5o s n p and dbe were calculated from the normalized peak intensities the assigned formulas were categorized into eight compound groups which included lignin cram carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules proteins carbohydrates lipid unsathydrocarbon unsaturated hydrocarbon cas condensed aromatic structures tannin and aromatic formula the detail criteria of the implemented elemental ratio of the eight groups are displayed in table s4 2 3 statistical analyses a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was conducted to select from the ft icr ms analyses appropriate parameters that can adequately represent the changes of the om sources or the molecular composition corresponding to shifts in periods during the storm event event 2 from the nmds several ft icr ms parameters were chosen from those that were highly associated with five individual storm periods namely the beginning the rising the peak the falling and the ending periods fig 1 the selected parameters were m zwa dbewa hwa nwa owa cho chon chos chons lignin cram proteins cas tannin and aromatic formula af fig s3 and their values were compared as computed from the end members versus storm samples all statistical analyses were performed using a freeware software r version 3 4 3 with factoextra and vegan packages 2 4 end member mixing analysis emma using isosource program the assignments of the relative contributions of the selected om sources to the storm samples were conducted using isosource program version 1 3 1 although this software has been used mostly in the analysis of stable isotope ratios it is not restricted to this application because the fundamental calculation rest on the general principle of mass balance phillips et al 2005 derrien et al 2018a in the present study emma was applied to the spectroscopic indices of the different end members which are the ten om sources table 1 and the storm dom samples table s6 to apply the emma model the appropriate optical indices were selected by 1 excluding the indices that exhibit the values of the storm samples beyond the ranges of the end members and 2 preferentially choosing indices with a high capacity to discriminate between contrasting om sources in the literature derrien et al 2018a yang et al 2015a based on these criteria the bix and fi were chosen for the emma table s7 in the isosource program the source increment and the value for mass balance tolerance were set at 3 and 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of end member dom the ten end members were divided into their respective om sources namely water soils plants and algae as shown in table 1 in the water group the doc concentration was higher for road runoff 4 51 mg l 1 and treated effluent 4 09 mg l 1 than for groundwater 0 26 mg l 1 more doc amounts per gram of end member material were observed for the om groups of plants 7858 56 076 mg c g 1 n 18 and algae 15 200 19 367 mg c g 1 n 9 than for the soil group 122 620 mg c g 1 n 18 the treated effluent exhibited the highest bix and the second highest fi values but low suva254 and hix which indicated that this end member was enriched with microbial sources that were probably generated by the biological treatment processes adopted in the facility groundwater dom showed relatively low suva254 hix and bix values previous studies have reported that the groundwater collected from forested watersheds showed lower suva254 0 97 1 7 l mg c 1 m 1 and hix 0 52 0 78 but higher bix 0 89 and fi 1 47 1 74 values compared to those of plant derived or soil derived dom inamdar et al 2012 yang et al 2015a some of the differences in the dom indices of groundwater observed in this study compared to the cited references in particular the bix might have been caused by differences in regional characteristics such as soil profiles because preferential adsorption of aromatic compounds during downward percolation in soil is known to be a determinant of the optical properties of dom from soil leachates to deeper groundwater inamdar et al 2012 yang et al 2015a road runoff dom was characterized by the highest hix but a relatively low fi which was similar to typical allochthonous dom characteristics soil dom properties were different between topsoil and deep soil with relatively higher doc and hix and a lower suva254 shown for topsoil versus deep soil previous studies have presented a decreasing trend of doc suva254 fr√∂berg et al 2011 inamdar et al 2012 sanderman et al 2008 and hix values bi et al 2013 corvasce et al 2006 inamdar et al 2012 with deeper forest soil which suggested more enrichment of aromatic and humic structures in the upper soil layer the dom from riparian plants had the lowest suva254 and relatively low hix and bix values indicating relatively less humified dom property with a low aromatic content consistent with the previous findings of yang et al 2015a leaf dom presented the lowest bix low suva254 and fi values but a relatively high hix which indicates that this end member had undergone a degree of humification inamdar et al 2012 yang et al 2015a reed dom properties were similar to those of the leaves table 1 algal dom properties differed between the attached and the suspended algae with relatively higher suva254 and bix and lower hix and fi values presented for the former 3 2 temporal variation in dom during a storm event 3 2 1 rainfall and storm event the rainfall event under study occurred from 0 00 on the 26th of august to 18 00 on the 27th august with short interim breaks fig 1 the levels of turbidity and suspended solid peaked after the maximum rainfall intensity fig s2 the variations of discharge and water level generally followed the trends of turbidity and suspended solid fig s2 the immediate reflection of rainfall on the discharge implied a convergent watershed and a relatively short water residence time in the watershed which are typical of urban watersheds that are largely covered with impervious surface jennings and jarnagin 2002 mitchell et al 2001 walsh et al 2012 in this study the rainfall event was separated into five different periods that included the beginning the rising the peak the falling and the ending periods which were based on the turbidity data fig 1 and fig s2 3 2 2 variations in river dom during a storm event maximum doc concentration for the rainfall event was observed during the falling period 5 68 mg l 1 fig 1c many previous studies suggested that increased doc concentrations during storm events could be ascribed to the input of allochthonous om from the organic rich layer as a result of hydrological flushing of potential doc pools dhillon and inamdar 2013 jeong et al 2012 lee et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 yang et al 2015a a flushing effect has often been observed in the rising period of the first storm event in a storm season rusjan et al 2008 however this effect does not seem to be pronounced for the studied event because it is not the first storm event in the summer monsoon suva254 values which represent the aromatic content of dom peaked at the peak period of the event reaching a 1 7 fold increase compared to the initial values at the beginning period meanwhile the highest hix values were observed at the falling period increasing suva and hix values during storm events have been frequently reported and have been attributed to a large and continued input of aromatic structured and humified dom during storm events inamdar et al 2011 lee et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 yang et al 2015b bix and fi decreased during the storm event until the ending period fig 1b which may be interpreted as the reduction of the contribution of autochthonous or microbial sources to the river dom and or the increased input of terrestrial fulvic acid 1 4 the opposing trends in the temporal variations between hix and fi values agreed with other literatures inamdar et al 2011 nguyen et al 2013 yang et al 2015b 2015a the overall variations of the optical dom indices implied a strong influence of terrestrial derived dom during the event many previous studies have suggested that terrestrial om present in topsoil is a predominant source of storm dom inamdar et al 2012 2011 johnson et al 2011b lee et al 2016 yang et al 2015a however as previously discussed such a qualitative evaluation of the om sources of the dom in storm samples insufficiently elucidates the dynamic changes in the relative contributions of the different sources furthermore it is rare to find in past studies discussions that focused on the impacts of the diverse om sources on storm dom in urban watersheds 3 3 end member mixing analyses emma based on selected spectroscopic indices emma models were applied with the two selected optical indices bix and fi on the ten different dom end members and five storm dom samples that individually represented different storm periods the plot of bix against fi fig 2 may be considered a validation of the proposal that the values of the two optical indices i e bix and fi discriminated well the different end members and also that those of the storm samples were placed within the range of both indices of the end members fig 2 the results confirmed the validity of using emma in detail the bix values of all the storm samples 0 70 1 12 were higher than those of leaves 0 5 0 01 and reeds 0 58 0 005 but lower than those of treated effluent 1 27 on the contrary the fi values of all the storm samples 1 74 2 06 were larger than those of reeds 1 45 0 01 road runoff 1 52 riparian plants 1 58 0 03 and attached algae 1 61 0 02 but were positioned below the suspended algae 2 77 in the plot relative contributions of the ten end members to storm dom were estimated for five different periods of the event using the isosource program fig 3 table s8 as a result the dominant contributions to the river dom during the storm event were found to be made by treated effluent 60 5 4 1 for the beginning period and treated effluent 20 2 6 9 groundwater 13 3 12 topsoil 10 5 10 5 and attached algae 11 1 10 7 for the rising period for the other periods of the event which includes the peak the falling and the ending periods more diverse om sources appeared to have contributed to the dom in the storm samples as expected treated effluent did not make a great contribution to storm samples for the latter three storm periods the common trends in the variations from the beginning to the ending period can be characterized by the decreased contribution of treated effluent from 60 5 4 1 to 6 3 5 1 and the increased contributions of leaves from 2 9 3 6 to 9 8 8 5 reeds from 2 7 3 6 to 10 1 8 9 riparian plants from 3 5 4 4 to 11 8 11 road runoff from 3 2 3 9 to 11 3 10 4 and deep soil 4 1 4 7 to 12 6 12 2 in general the om end members with dominant contributions to storm dom shifted from treated effluent and topsoil before the peak period to more diverse sources which included leaves reeds road runoff and deep soil after the peak period the dominant sources after the peak period were closely related to typical non point sources in urban watersheds such as surface runoff and various om materials placed in the catchment surface the estimates of the present work are comparable to those of the previous studies that reported shifts in the dominant dom sources from deeper soil to upper soil layer during heavy storm events even though they were mostly based on non urban watersheds chen et al 2016a inamdar et al 2011 lee et al 2016 yang et al 2015a 3 4 molecular composition from ft icr ms analysis the ft icr ms data of the end members and the storm samples figs s4 s5 1 s5 2 which included elemental ratios molecular formula and compound groups are summarized in tables s9 1 and s9 2 3 4 1 characteristics of the end members modified aromatic index aimod which is a proxy for dom aromaticity ranged from 0 11 algae to 0 42 road runoff suggesting prevalent aliphatic structures in all dom end members willoughby et al 2014 the aimod of the algae end member 0 11 was lower than those of the plant extracts riparian plants 0 13 leaves 0 17 reeds 0 21 a similar trend was observed for dbe values between algae 3 6 versus other end members waters 7 4 14 3 soils 6 2 10 4 plants 4 4 5 3 which indicated a higher degree of unsaturation in dom structures of the algae group in contrast the high values of dbe 10 for road runoff and topsoil suggested relatively high abundance of aromatic compounds among the end members the molecular composition of the algae end member was in line with previous studies that reported on the hydrophilic nature and the low aromatic content of algal extracts chen et al 2016b nicolau et al 2015 plus the enrichment of s containing lipids proteinaceous compounds and unsaturated hydrocarbons bittar et al 2015 the results of the present study are also consistent with chen and jaff√© 2014 which reported lower aromaticity of fresh plant derived dom versus surface waters and soil dom in a wetland area among the eight categorized molecular groups table s9 2 the lignin cram was the most dominant for the end member groups of water 41 9 71 1 soil 38 6 52 4 plants 39 4 54 3 and algae 36 4 lignin is a well known component of the cell wall of vascular plants the other major components being cellulose and semi cellulose turner and somerville 1997 some previous studies also observed lignin cram type compounds in algal extracts chen et al 2016c d andrilli et al 2013 the second dominant compound group was protein for treated effluent 14 7 topsoil 17 2 and riparian plants 30 2 it was lipid for riparian plants 30 8 and algae 22 1 it was unsathydrocarbon for road runoff 27 6 and cas for groundwater 15 27 4 deep soil 33 6 leaves 28 2 and reeds 18 7 the relatively high abundance of protein in topsoil and treated effluent seems to be associated with plant residues and microbes respectively derrien et al 2017 hur et al 2009 cas was previously reported as the most dominant compound in humic acid which relates to the degree of humidification derrien et al 2017 ohno et al 2010 the carbohydrate group constituted a small portion of all end members 0 1 5 tannin was the second lowest group which ranged from 0 3 to 5 4 for most of the end members except for treated effluent cas 1 9 tannin 3 9 and riparian plants cas 0 9 tannin 0 9 although tannin is enriched in leachate from leaf litter as a major constituent of vascular plants along with cellulose hemicellulose and lignin roth et al 2014 it could be lost during the solid phase extraction process as previously demonstrated chen et al 2016c lv et al 2016 both the unique and the common formulas of the end members can be utilized to track or at least confirm the variations in the relative contributions of different om sources during storm events fig s5 1 3 4 2 characteristics of storm dom as previously remarked due to the shortage of sample for the ft icr ms analysis several storm samples were mixed together to make composite samples representing the five individual storm periods which included the beginning the rising the peak the falling and the ending periods n 5 fig s5 2 the number of assigned molecular formulas ranged from 1510 to 4149 with the highest and the lowest number corresponding to the rising and the beginning period samples respectively table s8 1 the aimod and dbe values of the storm samples varied from 0 17 to 0 25 and 4 4 8 0 respectively both parameters showed an increasing trend before the storm ending period which implied that a relatively high degree of saturation and enriched aromatic compounds were associated with the storm event the changes in the relative distributions of the categorized compound groups were also observed during the storm before the peak period the groups of lignin cram proteins carbohydrates lipid and tannin were abundant while unsathydrocarbon and cas were not the trends were reversed after the peak period which agreed in general with our earlier findings regarding the optical indices this consistency suggested that the molecular composition revealed by the ft icr ms could reasonably reflect the temporal shift in the dominant om sources supplying the storm dom again to date no previous study has used ft icr ms to explore the evolution of the dominant om sources during storm events 3 4 3 molecular similarity between storm and end member dom to assign dominant om sources to storm samples from the molecular composition point of view all the formulas from the ft icr ms were compared with those of each end member and the results were displayed in terms of the so called molecular similarity fig 4 the percentage of the molecular similarity was calculated based on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix which has been widely used in ecology derrien et al 2018b hawkes et al 2016 in the van krevelen diagram the common formulas between the storm and the end member dom were primarily placed on the central part of the plot which corresponded mostly to the lignin cram group fig s6 the molecular similarity of the storm samples to each end member varied during the storm events fig 4 during the time period from the beginning to the ending period the molecular similarity of the storm samples was on a downtrend with the end members of treated effluent 21 8 9 4 topsoil 28 2 15 9 groundwater 25 7 14 3 and riparian plants 20 5 10 7 while the similarity increased for the sources of deep soil 18 5 30 3 and reeds 20 7 26 2 the general trends in the molecular similarity were in line with our previous findings based on the emma results using optical indices even though the same quantitative estimates could not be given from the ft icr ms data previous studies have itemized the main limitations of ft icr ms namely i missing organic constituents particularly relatively large sized molecules such as tannin group o c ratios 0 7 aliphatics group h c ratio 1 5 some part of lignin cram and heteroatomic formulas after ppl spe ii inconsistency of the ionization efficiencies among different sample matrices and iii potential errors in the justification for the exact structural information or the isomers of these formulas which solely depend on o c and h c ratios chen et al 2016b lv et al 2016 despite these limitations it is promising that the results of the source tracking by ft icr ms were consistent with those of the optical indices 3 4 4 statistical comparison between storm and end member dom in order to provide further insight into the association of end members with storm samples the molecular formula and compound groups were compared between the storm and the end member samples using an nmds analysis fig 5 the statistical tool allowed the identification of the dominant om sources for each period of the storm event an nmds analysis was performed with the selected parameters on the ft icr ms data n 15 the storm periods were distinctly separated by two clusters as the before versus during after peak period in the plot fig 5 the storm phases of the beginning and the rising periods were clustered within the ranges of groundwater reeds topsoil treated effluent and riparian plants while the rest of the storm phases which included peak falling and ending periods were roughly located within the range of leaves deep soil and reeds based on the two statistical analysis on the ft icr ms data namely similarity and nmds the om sources in their order of dominance during storms can be summarized as topsoil groundwater and treated effluent for the beginning period topsoil for the rising period deep soil and leaves for the peak period and deep soil and reeds for the falling and ending periods 3 5 comparison between spectroscopic indices based emma and ft icr ms results in general the dominant end members estimated by the emma using the two optical indices were in a good correspondence with those by the statistical analyses based on the ft icr ms data the common observation from both source tracking tools was that the major om source of the storm dom was treated effluent for the beginning period topsoil for the rising period and leaves or deep soil for the other three periods i e peak falling and ending periods the prevailing contributions of treated effluent in the initial period of the storm event coincided with the typical feature of urban rivers which is why the river water quality is heavily affected by the effluent from wastewater treatment plants during low flow seasons hur et al 2008 however the decreasing contributions of topsoil for the falling period of storm contrasted with the findings of previous studies which suggested that terrestrial dom from top soil is the dominant om source throughout storm events in forested watersheds dhillon and inamdar 2013 jeong et al 2012 lee et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 yang et al 2015a possible reasons for the differences will be briefly presented i since the previously studied areas are mostly covered by forests which is characterized by organic rich forest floors the organic content and composition of the soil would thus differ between these areas and the urban watershed that is the focus of the present work ii considering the wider distribution of impervious areas of urban versus non urban watersheds the om from the topsoil is more likely to immediately impact the storm water during the initial period of rain events in urban watersheds via surface runoff otherwise known as the flushing effect 4 conclusions this study clearly demonstrated dynamic variations in the contributions of several potential om sources to storm dom using optical indices based emma and ft icr ms among several optical indices tested for emma fi and bix were found to be the most robust proxies to estimate the contribution of the om sources to storm dom in an urban watershed the optical indices based emma showed that treated effluent was the most dominant om source supplying dom to storm samples at the beginning period 61 while the contributions from a more diverse sources which included treated effluent 20 topsoil 13 and groundwater 14 became pronounced for the rising period the om sources from leaves and reeds became more important 28 for the other storm periods namely peaks falling and ending periods the emma results were roughly consistent with the statistical interpretations of the data from ft icr ms in which the topsoil groundwater riparian plants and treated effluent played roles as the major contributors to storm samples before the peak period while the deep soil reeds and leaves explained most of the river dom during and after the peak period the dynamic variations of the dominant sources were well explained by the expected trends of typical urban watersheds under the influence of municipal wastewater facilities this study provides an in depth understanding of the changes in chemical composition of river dom during storm events in urban watersheds and it also broadened the applicability of fluorescence spectroscopy and ft icr ms as source tracking tools for storm dom declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18525,dissolved organic matter dom in river water dynamically changes with respect to its major sources during heavy rain events however there has been no established tool to estimate the relative contributions of different organic sources to river water dom in this study the evolution in the contributions of ten different organic matter om sources to storm water dom was explored with a selected urban river the geumho river in south korea during storm events via an end member mixing analysis emma based on fluorescence indices and fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms the om source materials included treated effluent road runoff groundwater topsoil deep soil leaves reeds riparian plants attached algae and suspended algae the emma results provided quantitative estimates of the variations in the dominant om sources with the progress of storms treated effluent was the prevailing source at the beginning period of the storm while topsoil leaves riparian plants and groundwater predominated during and after the peak period the fluorescence indices based evaluation was consistent with the statistical comparison of the molecular formulas derived from ft icr ms conducted on the ten potential om sources and the storm samples the observed variations in the om sources agreed with the typical characteristics of urban rivers in connection with anthropogenic inputs and the impact of surrounding impervious surfaces this study demonstrates the application of intuitive and facile tools in estimating the relative impacts of om sources in urban watersheds graphical abstract image 1 keywords source tracking fluorescence indices end member mixing analysis fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms storm event 1 introduction dissolved organic matter dom is a key player in global and local carbon cycles because of its high mobility and biogeochemical reactivity the source of dom in water environment can be allochthonous such as terrestrial and anthropogenic materials or autochthonous such as algae macrophytes and sediments chen and jaff√© 2014 tank et al 2010 especially during heavy rainfall events large amounts of organic matter om from various sources in upstream areas may inflow into rivers which is also called non point sources dhillon and inamdar 2013 jeong et al 2012 lee et al 2016 2014 lloret et al 2013 the om sources that dominantly affect river dom depend strongly on land use types and rainfall intensity duration the classic om sources in urban areas are of anthropogenic origin such as the effluent from industry and or wastewater treatment plants and road runoff vystavna et al 2013 even though natural sources such as leaves and groundwater are also present nguyen and hur 2011 yang et al 2015a 2015b the chemical composition of dom is intimately related to its source and the natural modifying processes which may be hydrological geochemical and or physical along its flow paths bauer and bianchi 2011 bolan et al 2011 in an effort to identify the predominant om sources during storm events mostly in non urban watersheds many previous studies have qualitatively compared the chemical composition between storm dom and the potential sources or end members using fluorescence spectroscopy and or isotope abundance bass et al 2011 inamdar et al 2012 2011 johnson et al 2011a lee et al 2016 singh et al 2014 yang et al 2015a in watershed scales the water flow paths during storm events are constantly being altered as the preferential flows shift from macropores into surface runoff or lateral flow and finally into a stream the process is mainly driven by the infiltration of precipitation and the rising water table katsuyama and ohte 2002 kim et al 2010 mcglynn and mcdonnell 2003 which ultimately lead to variations in the contributions of different sources to the river dom based on previous studies the extent of terrestrial derived dom signatures in non urban rivers tend to rise with increasing input from leaves and top soil i e the upper soil layer and the forest floors during storm events chen et al 2016a inamdar et al 2011 yang et al 2015a however the dynamic variations of the relative contributions from many other potential sources to storm dom have been rarely explored particularly for urban watersheds in addition to the classical om source tracking tools such as fluorescence spectroscopy and isotope carbon and nitrogen abundance other advanced analyses have been applied in the past studies which included size exclusion chromatography with online organic carbon detector sec ocd chen et al 2016a quang et al 2015 and high resolution fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ft icr ms derrien et al 2018b thieme et al 2018 in particular ft icr ms has a strong merit because it fully resolves the molecular composition of complex dom mixtures stenson et al 2002 by assigning molecular formulas to thousands of peaks detected in the mass spectrum of the mixtures sleighter and hatcher 2008 as ft icr ms has become an important feature for recent dom studies derrien et al 2018b thieme et al 2018 it is advantageous to further extend its applications to om source tracking considering the global trend of increasing urbanization and a growing demand for high water quality urban rivers it is very important to identify major storm om sources and estimate their relative contributions to river water dom which will help the efficient and sustainable management of urban watersheds and water quality this is more so since a more diverse om sources exist in urban watersheds than in forested and or non urban watersheds inamdar et al 2011 yang et al 2015a however there has been no established methodology for a quantitative estimation of the relative importance of different om sources in urban river water in this context this study mainly aimed i to compare the dom characteristics of various potential om end member sources distributed in a selected urban watershed the geumho river watershed ii to investigate the dynamic variations in the chemical molecular composition of dom in storm water during heavy rain events using fluorescence spectroscopy and ft icr ms and iii to estimate the relative contributions of the potential om sources to storm dom via the so called end member mixing analysis emma which has been proven to be a simple and effective method to quantify the relative contributions of different sources to the storm dom inamdar et al 2011 yang et al 2015a to this end it was hypothesized that the combinations of om characteristics from all possible om sources or om end members existing in the selected watersheds can represent the measured signatures of collected water samples the main novelty of the present communication partly rests on the fact that there has been no previous published attempt at using emma to quantitatively estimate the relative contributions of different om sources to the dom of an urban river water at different periods of a storm event and partly on the fact that this is the first study to demonstrate the applicability of ft icr ms analysis for om source tracking on storm water samples 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and sample collection the geumho river belongs to the first tributary of the nakdong river which is one of the four major rivers in south korea the geumho river watershed extends from 35 42 to 35 17 n and from 128 28 to 129 23 e fig s1 the watershed has a total catchment area of 2092 km2 and a river length of 119 km na et al 2016 park et al 2016 the geumho river watershed is located in the central east region of the nakdong river which constitutes 8 8 of the total nakdong river basin the land use of the geumho river watershed consists of forests 63 5 agricultural fields 21 8 urban areas 8 5 and other areas 6 2 park et al 2016 although the watershed area is still covered by forests and agriculture fields it does represent a typical urban watershed as the main channel of the river passes through daegu metropolitan city which is populated by 2 5 million people the average recorded temperature was 27 6 3 5

128 27 45 25 e during a heavy storm event two liters of water samples were collected at an interval of 2 or 4 h depending on the variation of turbidity which was measured on site by a portable hach turbidimeter storms occurred in the summer monsoon period from late june to august in 2018 fig 1 the total rainfall amount recorded in the summer season from june to august 2018 was 592 5 mm based on the nearest on site monitoring stations in the studied area the rainfall amount on the 25th to the 31st day of august was 267 mm the discharge was calculated using the water level data which was measured every hour and a constructed stage recharge relationship from the website of nakdong river flood control office www nakdongriver go kr sumun wllist do total 27 storm water samples were collected the samples were acidified using sulfuric acid at the field to minimize deterioration and then transported to the laboratory for filtration through a pre ashed gf f whatman filter after ph adjustment to 7 0 to recover the field ph condition all the potential om source materials were taken before the monsoon season to avoid possible rainfall distortion several organic source materials which included top soil 0 2 cm depth n 5 deep soil 15 20 cm depth n 4 weeds n 5 riverside plants n 2 fallen leaves n 2 reeds n 1 suspended algae n 1 and attached algae n 4 were collected from the upstream areas of the geumho river treated effluent from a municipal wastewater treatment facility n 1 groundwater n 1 and road runoff from a large parking lot n 1 were also included as potential om source materials suspended algae was collected in concentrate with a plankton net to take into account the potential in stream om source the details on the sampling sites are presented in table s1 the materials of plants and algae were softly washed with deionized water to remove extraneous substances dried plants were cut into pieces of about 1 cm2 before grinding soil materials were oven dried at 45 c for 3 days and filtered with a 2 mm seive and the algae materials were freeze dried water soluble organic matter wsom or dom for each organic material was prepared by mixing the samples with milli q water at a solid to solution ratio of 1 10 for the dried soil and at 1 20 for other materials for 24 h at 130 rpm at room temperature 25 c without any antibacterial chemicals to avoid interference before filtration all wsom samples were centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 10 min the supernatants were filtered through pre ashed 0 7 Œºm glass fiber filters whatman gf f and analyzed for dom properties within 24 h the dom extraction was conducted in duplicate for the ft icr ms analysis the materials under the same category were combined into one composite sample to represent a single end member for example suspended algae and attached algae were combined as a representative source for algae while riparian plants and weeds were taken into account as a source for riparian plants table 1 before the ft icr ms analyses the solid phase extraction was conducted using ppl cartridges bondelut 1g sorbent agilent inc which is a styrene divinylvenzene polymer modified with proprietary non polar surface following the procedure described in chen et al 2016b the dom retained in the ppl cartridge was immediately extracted with methanol and stored in a freezer until analyzed 2 2 analytical methods 2 2 1 doc concentrations and uv visible spectroscopy the concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc were measured using a total organic carbon analyzer toc vcpn shimadzu japan absorption spectra from 200 to 600 nm were scanned at 1 nm intervals using a uv visible spectrophotometer uv 1800 shimadzu japan with a 1 cm quartz cell hellma germany specific uv absorbance suva was calculated based on the 100 fold uv absorption coefficient at 254 nm normalized by the doc concentration the analytical precision of the instruments is presented in the supplementary information table s2 2 2 2 fluorescence spectroscopy fluorescence excitation emission matrices eems was recorded with a luminescence spectrometer f 7000 hitachi japan the eems were scanned at the emission wavelengths em of 280 550 nm with 1 nm increments and over an excitation wavelength ex range of 220 500 nm with a stepwise increase of 5 nm excitation and emission slits were both adjusted to 10 nm the samples were diluted until the uv absorption coefficient at 254 nm dropped below 0 05 cm 1 in order to avoid the inner filter effects ohno 2002 the luminescence spectrometer was adjusted by correcting the ex lamp and the em detector the fluorescence responses for the blank i e milli q water were subtracted from the original eem data the fluorescence intensities of all samples were normalized to raman units r u lawaetz and stedmon 2009 the commonly used dom optical indices were calculated from the eem data which included fluorescence index fi humification index hix and biological index bix values the details of the definitions the calculations and related references are available in table s3 2 2 3 ft icr ms analyses ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry measurements were performed with a 15 t ft icr ms interfaced with an apollo ii electrospray ionization source 15t ft icr ms bruker daltonik germany located at the korea basic science institute in ochang south korea a negative ion mode nanomate was used as dom was generally negatively charged the instrument was operated in a broadband mode between 150 and 1200 m z the samples were injected using a hamilton syringe with a flow rate of 2 Œºl min 1 the spray current was set to 3 0 kv and the drying gas temperature was 180 c with a 4 0 l min 1 flow rate the skimmer voltage was set at 30 v one hundred transient scans which were collected with a 4 mword time domain were co added to one mass spectrum the external calibration with arginine clusters and internal recalibration with suwannee river fulvic acid standard srfa 200 900 a built in mixture were adopted to achieve a mass accuracy of 0 050 ppm procedural blanks were run and subtracted from each corresponding sample a conservative magnitude threshold was set to an s n ratio of 10 to avoid potential false positives all ions were singly charged as confirmed by the isotopic spacing pattern 1 00335 da of the corresponding 12cn and 13c12cn 1 mass peak the spectra were evaluated in the mass range of 200 800 m z the mass accuracy threshold was Œ¥m 2 ppm the nitrogen rule and double bond equivalent dbe 1 1 2 2c h n rule permitting only positive integers were applied the criteria of elemental ratios were implemented such as 2 25 h c 0 3 o c 1 2 n c 0 5 s c 0 2 several selected indices such as intensity weighted average wa molecular masses elemental ratios modified aromatic index aimod 1 c 0 5o s 0 5h c 0 5o s n p and dbe were calculated from the normalized peak intensities the assigned formulas were categorized into eight compound groups which included lignin cram carboxyl rich alicyclic molecules proteins carbohydrates lipid unsathydrocarbon unsaturated hydrocarbon cas condensed aromatic structures tannin and aromatic formula the detail criteria of the implemented elemental ratio of the eight groups are displayed in table s4 2 3 statistical analyses a non metric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis was conducted to select from the ft icr ms analyses appropriate parameters that can adequately represent the changes of the om sources or the molecular composition corresponding to shifts in periods during the storm event event 2 from the nmds several ft icr ms parameters were chosen from those that were highly associated with five individual storm periods namely the beginning the rising the peak the falling and the ending periods fig 1 the selected parameters were m zwa dbewa hwa nwa owa cho chon chos chons lignin cram proteins cas tannin and aromatic formula af fig s3 and their values were compared as computed from the end members versus storm samples all statistical analyses were performed using a freeware software r version 3 4 3 with factoextra and vegan packages 2 4 end member mixing analysis emma using isosource program the assignments of the relative contributions of the selected om sources to the storm samples were conducted using isosource program version 1 3 1 although this software has been used mostly in the analysis of stable isotope ratios it is not restricted to this application because the fundamental calculation rest on the general principle of mass balance phillips et al 2005 derrien et al 2018a in the present study emma was applied to the spectroscopic indices of the different end members which are the ten om sources table 1 and the storm dom samples table s6 to apply the emma model the appropriate optical indices were selected by 1 excluding the indices that exhibit the values of the storm samples beyond the ranges of the end members and 2 preferentially choosing indices with a high capacity to discriminate between contrasting om sources in the literature derrien et al 2018a yang et al 2015a based on these criteria the bix and fi were chosen for the emma table s7 in the isosource program the source increment and the value for mass balance tolerance were set at 3 and 1 respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of end member dom the ten end members were divided into their respective om sources namely water soils plants and algae as shown in table 1 in the water group the doc concentration was higher for road runoff 4 51 mg l 1 and treated effluent 4 09 mg l 1 than for groundwater 0 26 mg l 1 more doc amounts per gram of end member material were observed for the om groups of plants 7858 56 076 mg c g 1 n 18 and algae 15 200 19 367 mg c g 1 n 9 than for the soil group 122 620 mg c g 1 n 18 the treated effluent exhibited the highest bix and the second highest fi values but low suva254 and hix which indicated that this end member was enriched with microbial sources that were probably generated by the biological treatment processes adopted in the facility groundwater dom showed relatively low suva254 hix and bix values previous studies have reported that the groundwater collected from forested watersheds showed lower suva254 0 97 1 7 l mg c 1 m 1 and hix 0 52 0 78 but higher bix 0 89 and fi 1 47 1 74 values compared to those of plant derived or soil derived dom inamdar et al 2012 yang et al 2015a some of the differences in the dom indices of groundwater observed in this study compared to the cited references in particular the bix might have been caused by differences in regional characteristics such as soil profiles because preferential adsorption of aromatic compounds during downward percolation in soil is known to be a determinant of the optical properties of dom from soil leachates to deeper groundwater inamdar et al 2012 yang et al 2015a road runoff dom was characterized by the highest hix but a relatively low fi which was similar to typical allochthonous dom characteristics soil dom properties were different between topsoil and deep soil with relatively higher doc and hix and a lower suva254 shown for topsoil versus deep soil previous studies have presented a decreasing trend of doc suva254 fr√∂berg et al 2011 inamdar et al 2012 sanderman et al 2008 and hix values bi et al 2013 corvasce et al 2006 inamdar et al 2012 with deeper forest soil which suggested more enrichment of aromatic and humic structures in the upper soil layer the dom from riparian plants had the lowest suva254 and relatively low hix and bix values indicating relatively less humified dom property with a low aromatic content consistent with the previous findings of yang et al 2015a leaf dom presented the lowest bix low suva254 and fi values but a relatively high hix which indicates that this end member had undergone a degree of humification inamdar et al 2012 yang et al 2015a reed dom properties were similar to those of the leaves table 1 algal dom properties differed between the attached and the suspended algae with relatively higher suva254 and bix and lower hix and fi values presented for the former 3 2 temporal variation in dom during a storm event 3 2 1 rainfall and storm event the rainfall event under study occurred from 0 00 on the 26th of august to 18 00 on the 27th august with short interim breaks fig 1 the levels of turbidity and suspended solid peaked after the maximum rainfall intensity fig s2 the variations of discharge and water level generally followed the trends of turbidity and suspended solid fig s2 the immediate reflection of rainfall on the discharge implied a convergent watershed and a relatively short water residence time in the watershed which are typical of urban watersheds that are largely covered with impervious surface jennings and jarnagin 2002 mitchell et al 2001 walsh et al 2012 in this study the rainfall event was separated into five different periods that included the beginning the rising the peak the falling and the ending periods which were based on the turbidity data fig 1 and fig s2 3 2 2 variations in river dom during a storm event maximum doc concentration for the rainfall event was observed during the falling period 5 68 mg l 1 fig 1c many previous studies suggested that increased doc concentrations during storm events could be ascribed to the input of allochthonous om from the organic rich layer as a result of hydrological flushing of potential doc pools dhillon and inamdar 2013 jeong et al 2012 lee et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 yang et al 2015a a flushing effect has often been observed in the rising period of the first storm event in a storm season rusjan et al 2008 however this effect does not seem to be pronounced for the studied event because it is not the first storm event in the summer monsoon suva254 values which represent the aromatic content of dom peaked at the peak period of the event reaching a 1 7 fold increase compared to the initial values at the beginning period meanwhile the highest hix values were observed at the falling period increasing suva and hix values during storm events have been frequently reported and have been attributed to a large and continued input of aromatic structured and humified dom during storm events inamdar et al 2011 lee et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 yang et al 2015b bix and fi decreased during the storm event until the ending period fig 1b which may be interpreted as the reduction of the contribution of autochthonous or microbial sources to the river dom and or the increased input of terrestrial fulvic acid 1 4 the opposing trends in the temporal variations between hix and fi values agreed with other literatures inamdar et al 2011 nguyen et al 2013 yang et al 2015b 2015a the overall variations of the optical dom indices implied a strong influence of terrestrial derived dom during the event many previous studies have suggested that terrestrial om present in topsoil is a predominant source of storm dom inamdar et al 2012 2011 johnson et al 2011b lee et al 2016 yang et al 2015a however as previously discussed such a qualitative evaluation of the om sources of the dom in storm samples insufficiently elucidates the dynamic changes in the relative contributions of the different sources furthermore it is rare to find in past studies discussions that focused on the impacts of the diverse om sources on storm dom in urban watersheds 3 3 end member mixing analyses emma based on selected spectroscopic indices emma models were applied with the two selected optical indices bix and fi on the ten different dom end members and five storm dom samples that individually represented different storm periods the plot of bix against fi fig 2 may be considered a validation of the proposal that the values of the two optical indices i e bix and fi discriminated well the different end members and also that those of the storm samples were placed within the range of both indices of the end members fig 2 the results confirmed the validity of using emma in detail the bix values of all the storm samples 0 70 1 12 were higher than those of leaves 0 5 0 01 and reeds 0 58 0 005 but lower than those of treated effluent 1 27 on the contrary the fi values of all the storm samples 1 74 2 06 were larger than those of reeds 1 45 0 01 road runoff 1 52 riparian plants 1 58 0 03 and attached algae 1 61 0 02 but were positioned below the suspended algae 2 77 in the plot relative contributions of the ten end members to storm dom were estimated for five different periods of the event using the isosource program fig 3 table s8 as a result the dominant contributions to the river dom during the storm event were found to be made by treated effluent 60 5 4 1 for the beginning period and treated effluent 20 2 6 9 groundwater 13 3 12 topsoil 10 5 10 5 and attached algae 11 1 10 7 for the rising period for the other periods of the event which includes the peak the falling and the ending periods more diverse om sources appeared to have contributed to the dom in the storm samples as expected treated effluent did not make a great contribution to storm samples for the latter three storm periods the common trends in the variations from the beginning to the ending period can be characterized by the decreased contribution of treated effluent from 60 5 4 1 to 6 3 5 1 and the increased contributions of leaves from 2 9 3 6 to 9 8 8 5 reeds from 2 7 3 6 to 10 1 8 9 riparian plants from 3 5 4 4 to 11 8 11 road runoff from 3 2 3 9 to 11 3 10 4 and deep soil 4 1 4 7 to 12 6 12 2 in general the om end members with dominant contributions to storm dom shifted from treated effluent and topsoil before the peak period to more diverse sources which included leaves reeds road runoff and deep soil after the peak period the dominant sources after the peak period were closely related to typical non point sources in urban watersheds such as surface runoff and various om materials placed in the catchment surface the estimates of the present work are comparable to those of the previous studies that reported shifts in the dominant dom sources from deeper soil to upper soil layer during heavy storm events even though they were mostly based on non urban watersheds chen et al 2016a inamdar et al 2011 lee et al 2016 yang et al 2015a 3 4 molecular composition from ft icr ms analysis the ft icr ms data of the end members and the storm samples figs s4 s5 1 s5 2 which included elemental ratios molecular formula and compound groups are summarized in tables s9 1 and s9 2 3 4 1 characteristics of the end members modified aromatic index aimod which is a proxy for dom aromaticity ranged from 0 11 algae to 0 42 road runoff suggesting prevalent aliphatic structures in all dom end members willoughby et al 2014 the aimod of the algae end member 0 11 was lower than those of the plant extracts riparian plants 0 13 leaves 0 17 reeds 0 21 a similar trend was observed for dbe values between algae 3 6 versus other end members waters 7 4 14 3 soils 6 2 10 4 plants 4 4 5 3 which indicated a higher degree of unsaturation in dom structures of the algae group in contrast the high values of dbe 10 for road runoff and topsoil suggested relatively high abundance of aromatic compounds among the end members the molecular composition of the algae end member was in line with previous studies that reported on the hydrophilic nature and the low aromatic content of algal extracts chen et al 2016b nicolau et al 2015 plus the enrichment of s containing lipids proteinaceous compounds and unsaturated hydrocarbons bittar et al 2015 the results of the present study are also consistent with chen and jaff√© 2014 which reported lower aromaticity of fresh plant derived dom versus surface waters and soil dom in a wetland area among the eight categorized molecular groups table s9 2 the lignin cram was the most dominant for the end member groups of water 41 9 71 1 soil 38 6 52 4 plants 39 4 54 3 and algae 36 4 lignin is a well known component of the cell wall of vascular plants the other major components being cellulose and semi cellulose turner and somerville 1997 some previous studies also observed lignin cram type compounds in algal extracts chen et al 2016c d andrilli et al 2013 the second dominant compound group was protein for treated effluent 14 7 topsoil 17 2 and riparian plants 30 2 it was lipid for riparian plants 30 8 and algae 22 1 it was unsathydrocarbon for road runoff 27 6 and cas for groundwater 15 27 4 deep soil 33 6 leaves 28 2 and reeds 18 7 the relatively high abundance of protein in topsoil and treated effluent seems to be associated with plant residues and microbes respectively derrien et al 2017 hur et al 2009 cas was previously reported as the most dominant compound in humic acid which relates to the degree of humidification derrien et al 2017 ohno et al 2010 the carbohydrate group constituted a small portion of all end members 0 1 5 tannin was the second lowest group which ranged from 0 3 to 5 4 for most of the end members except for treated effluent cas 1 9 tannin 3 9 and riparian plants cas 0 9 tannin 0 9 although tannin is enriched in leachate from leaf litter as a major constituent of vascular plants along with cellulose hemicellulose and lignin roth et al 2014 it could be lost during the solid phase extraction process as previously demonstrated chen et al 2016c lv et al 2016 both the unique and the common formulas of the end members can be utilized to track or at least confirm the variations in the relative contributions of different om sources during storm events fig s5 1 3 4 2 characteristics of storm dom as previously remarked due to the shortage of sample for the ft icr ms analysis several storm samples were mixed together to make composite samples representing the five individual storm periods which included the beginning the rising the peak the falling and the ending periods n 5 fig s5 2 the number of assigned molecular formulas ranged from 1510 to 4149 with the highest and the lowest number corresponding to the rising and the beginning period samples respectively table s8 1 the aimod and dbe values of the storm samples varied from 0 17 to 0 25 and 4 4 8 0 respectively both parameters showed an increasing trend before the storm ending period which implied that a relatively high degree of saturation and enriched aromatic compounds were associated with the storm event the changes in the relative distributions of the categorized compound groups were also observed during the storm before the peak period the groups of lignin cram proteins carbohydrates lipid and tannin were abundant while unsathydrocarbon and cas were not the trends were reversed after the peak period which agreed in general with our earlier findings regarding the optical indices this consistency suggested that the molecular composition revealed by the ft icr ms could reasonably reflect the temporal shift in the dominant om sources supplying the storm dom again to date no previous study has used ft icr ms to explore the evolution of the dominant om sources during storm events 3 4 3 molecular similarity between storm and end member dom to assign dominant om sources to storm samples from the molecular composition point of view all the formulas from the ft icr ms were compared with those of each end member and the results were displayed in terms of the so called molecular similarity fig 4 the percentage of the molecular similarity was calculated based on the bray curtis dissimilarity matrix which has been widely used in ecology derrien et al 2018b hawkes et al 2016 in the van krevelen diagram the common formulas between the storm and the end member dom were primarily placed on the central part of the plot which corresponded mostly to the lignin cram group fig s6 the molecular similarity of the storm samples to each end member varied during the storm events fig 4 during the time period from the beginning to the ending period the molecular similarity of the storm samples was on a downtrend with the end members of treated effluent 21 8 9 4 topsoil 28 2 15 9 groundwater 25 7 14 3 and riparian plants 20 5 10 7 while the similarity increased for the sources of deep soil 18 5 30 3 and reeds 20 7 26 2 the general trends in the molecular similarity were in line with our previous findings based on the emma results using optical indices even though the same quantitative estimates could not be given from the ft icr ms data previous studies have itemized the main limitations of ft icr ms namely i missing organic constituents particularly relatively large sized molecules such as tannin group o c ratios 0 7 aliphatics group h c ratio 1 5 some part of lignin cram and heteroatomic formulas after ppl spe ii inconsistency of the ionization efficiencies among different sample matrices and iii potential errors in the justification for the exact structural information or the isomers of these formulas which solely depend on o c and h c ratios chen et al 2016b lv et al 2016 despite these limitations it is promising that the results of the source tracking by ft icr ms were consistent with those of the optical indices 3 4 4 statistical comparison between storm and end member dom in order to provide further insight into the association of end members with storm samples the molecular formula and compound groups were compared between the storm and the end member samples using an nmds analysis fig 5 the statistical tool allowed the identification of the dominant om sources for each period of the storm event an nmds analysis was performed with the selected parameters on the ft icr ms data n 15 the storm periods were distinctly separated by two clusters as the before versus during after peak period in the plot fig 5 the storm phases of the beginning and the rising periods were clustered within the ranges of groundwater reeds topsoil treated effluent and riparian plants while the rest of the storm phases which included peak falling and ending periods were roughly located within the range of leaves deep soil and reeds based on the two statistical analysis on the ft icr ms data namely similarity and nmds the om sources in their order of dominance during storms can be summarized as topsoil groundwater and treated effluent for the beginning period topsoil for the rising period deep soil and leaves for the peak period and deep soil and reeds for the falling and ending periods 3 5 comparison between spectroscopic indices based emma and ft icr ms results in general the dominant end members estimated by the emma using the two optical indices were in a good correspondence with those by the statistical analyses based on the ft icr ms data the common observation from both source tracking tools was that the major om source of the storm dom was treated effluent for the beginning period topsoil for the rising period and leaves or deep soil for the other three periods i e peak falling and ending periods the prevailing contributions of treated effluent in the initial period of the storm event coincided with the typical feature of urban rivers which is why the river water quality is heavily affected by the effluent from wastewater treatment plants during low flow seasons hur et al 2008 however the decreasing contributions of topsoil for the falling period of storm contrasted with the findings of previous studies which suggested that terrestrial dom from top soil is the dominant om source throughout storm events in forested watersheds dhillon and inamdar 2013 jeong et al 2012 lee et al 2016 nguyen et al 2013 yang et al 2015a possible reasons for the differences will be briefly presented i since the previously studied areas are mostly covered by forests which is characterized by organic rich forest floors the organic content and composition of the soil would thus differ between these areas and the urban watershed that is the focus of the present work ii considering the wider distribution of impervious areas of urban versus non urban watersheds the om from the topsoil is more likely to immediately impact the storm water during the initial period of rain events in urban watersheds via surface runoff otherwise known as the flushing effect 4 conclusions this study clearly demonstrated dynamic variations in the contributions of several potential om sources to storm dom using optical indices based emma and ft icr ms among several optical indices tested for emma fi and bix were found to be the most robust proxies to estimate the contribution of the om sources to storm dom in an urban watershed the optical indices based emma showed that treated effluent was the most dominant om source supplying dom to storm samples at the beginning period 61 while the contributions from a more diverse sources which included treated effluent 20 topsoil 13 and groundwater 14 became pronounced for the rising period the om sources from leaves and reeds became more important 28 for the other storm periods namely peaks falling and ending periods the emma results were roughly consistent with the statistical interpretations of the data from ft icr ms in which the topsoil groundwater riparian plants and treated effluent played roles as the major contributors to storm samples before the peak period while the deep soil reeds and leaves explained most of the river dom during and after the peak period the dynamic variations of the dominant sources were well explained by the expected trends of typical urban watersheds under the influence of municipal wastewater facilities this study provides an in depth understanding of the changes in chemical composition of river dom during storm events in urban watersheds and it also broadened the applicability of fluorescence spectroscopy and ft icr ms as source tracking tools for storm dom declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

18526,three dimensional electrochemical reactor 3der is a highly efficient technology for refractory wastewater treatment particle electrodes filled between anode and cathode are the core units of 3der determining the treatment efficiency of wastewater however particle electrodes deactivation due to catalytic sites coverage seriously impedes the continuous operation of 3der in this work granular sludge carbon gsc particle electrodes being resistant to deactivation are fabricated by pyrolyzing the mixture of waste sludge polymethyl methacrylate pmma and copper tailings whose performances are evaluated by degrading rhodamine b rhb wastewater in a continuous flow 3der results indicate that hierarchical pore structure comprising macro meso and micropores is developed in gsc 10 cts by doping 10 g pmma and 5 g copper tailings into 100 g waste sludge pmma contributes to construct macropores which is essential for the mass transfer of rhb into gsc particle electrodes of centimeter size copper tailings promote the formation of meso and micro pores in gscs as well as improving the electrochemical properties consequently gsc 10 cts packed 3der exhibits the highest removal efficiency and lowest energy consumption for rhb treatment in addition the compressive strength of gsc 10 cts is enhanced by copper tails that is crucial to fill into 3der as particle electrodes the high efficient and cost effective gsc 10 cts fabricated by waste materials have the potential of substituting commercial granular activated carbon catalysts in the future consequently promoting the application of 3der in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords hierarchical pore particle electrode three dimensional electrochemical reactor waste sludge wastewater treatment 1 introduction treatment of industrial refractory wastewater is a great challenge in china various physical chemical approaches have been applied to deal with these wastewater among which three dimensional electrochemical reactor 3der is a highly efficient and environmental friendly technology zheng et al 2016 based on conventional electrochemical technology 3der is developed by filling conductive particles such as granular activated carbon gac between anode and cathode wei et al 2010 after applying external electric field these particles are polarized to be multiple microelectrodes significantly improving the efficiency of wastewater treatment gac is the most widely used particle electrodes due to its good electrical conductivity large surface area and low cost since the electrocatalytic activity of pristine gac is relatively weak noble metals such as pd and cu are loaded onto gac to enhance its electrocatalytic property zhang et al 2013 some metal oxides fe3o4 sno2 sb2o3 ruo2 iro2 supported gacs also exhibit high electrocatalytic activity li et al 2016 however deactivation of gac catalysts due to the coverage of catalytic sites by contaminants seriously deteriorates the treatment performance of 3der during long term operation furthermore the expense of gac catalysts are too expensive for wastewater treatment therefore particle electrodes of high efficient and cost effective are still in urgent need by 3der technology currently multifunctional carbon materials converted from waste sludge exhibit potential in electrochemical energy storage and pollutants adsorption catalytic oxidation yuan and dai 2016 particularly waste sludge derived carbons scs are used as electrocatalysts for their carbonaceous nature and co existence of metal elements acid orange 7 dyeing wastewater can be degraded by 80 2 through the electrocatalysis of scs powder sun et al 2015 iron oxide supported scs powder has the capability of purifying coal gasification wastewater by electrochemical oxidation hou et al 2016 although the efficacy of scs powder is verified the difficulties in separating and recovering powder catalysts restrain the practical application of scs therefore granular sludge carbon gscs is fabricated and successfully applied as particle electrodes of 3der to treat dyeing wastewater in our previous work ji et al 2018 gscs is demonstrated to be highly efficient initially but the treatment performance of 3der is inevitably attenuating during the continuous operation ascribing to the deactivation of gscs since contaminants adsorption at the interface of gscs is more rapid than contaminants decomposition by electrocatalysis the active catalytic sites are gradually covered by the accumulated contaminants to maintain a stable treatment performance the structure of gscs should be optimized to balance the processes of adsorption and electrocatalysis the adsorption property of gscs is highly dependent on porous structure which can be regulated by adding pore forming agents kong et al 2013 the electrocatalytic property of gscs can be improved by optimizing catalytic components therefore polymethyl methacrylate pmma and waste copper tailings are doped into waste sludge to improve the performances of gscs in present work pmma is a spherical plastic particle that easily burned out during pyrolysis xia et al 2011 consequently creating multiple pores in gscs porous structure of gscs is designed to enhance the mass transfer between contaminants and gscs particle electrodes promoting adsorption and electrocatalysis occurred in 3der copper tailings comprise various metal components such as cu and fe which can improve the electrocatalytic activity of gscs thomas et al 2013 the synergy of adsorption and electrocatalysis would effectively relieve the coverage of active catalytic sites in gscs and achieve a stable treatment performance in 3der in this study gscs particle electrodes being resistant to deactivation were fabricated by pyrolyzing the mixture of waste sludge pmma and copper tailings the performances of the prepared gscs were evaluated by degrading rhodamine b rhb wastewater in a continuous flow 3der the roles of pmma and copper tailings in improving the properties of gscs were investigated from the aspects of porous structure and electrocatalytic activity of the materials herein we report a strategy of fabricating porous gscs as high efficient and cost effective particle electrodes consequently promoting the application of 3der in wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the dewatered waste sludge obtained from tianshan wastewater treatment plant shanghai china was pretreated with feso4 and ca oh 2 copper tailings were collected from the mineral processing slag of a copper mine located in tongling anhui china waste sludge contained abundant c 26 58 ca 32 16 and fe 19 12 elements table s1 copper tailings comprised various metal elements such as fe 32 33 and cu 0 88 waste sludge and copper tailings were ground into fine powder of less than 150 mesh before utilization pmma with the average particle size of 10 Œºm were purchased from mitsubishi co guangdong china the other regents are all analytical grade from sinopharm co shanghai china 2 2 preparation of gscs the gscs were fabricated referring to our previous work with a few modifications ji et al 2018 100 g sludge powder was mixed with zncl2 solution 40 wt as activation agent and 1 g sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as adhesive the mixture was stirred slowly for 12 h at ambient temperature and then was shaped into spherical precursors with the diameter of 8 mm by a granulator ld 88a chuangli china the obtained particles were dried at 105 c for 12 h and subsequently pyrolyzed in a tube furnace gsl 1400x kejing china at heating rate of 10 c min to 600 c in the presence of n2 holding for 2 h after cooling down the products were washed with 80 c distill water until the effluent ph was constant the obtained particles were dried at 105 c overnight and labeled as gsc pmma and copper tailings were doped into the sludge powder before activation to improve the performances of gsc the dosages of pmma and copper tailings were optimized previously as described in supplementary materials to investigate the roles of pmma and copper tailings as well as the synergy of the two additives in gsc improvement different fabrication conditions were selected as listed in table 1 2 3 analytical methods themogravimetric tg analysis was carried on a

esr emx 8 2 7 bruker germany the electrochemical properties of gscs were analyzed on an electrochemical workstation chi 660e chenhua china using a three electrode system a glassy carbon disk 3 0 mm in diameter coated with various gscs was used as the working electrode with pt wire as the counter electrode and ag agcl electrode as the reference electrode ji et al 2018 the cyclic voltammetry cv measurements were conducted in rhb and k4fe cn 6 solution respectively electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were measured in k3fe cn 6 solution n2 was purged into the solution for 30 min prior to each scan 2 4 continuous flow 3der for evaluating the performances of gscs the configuration of the continuous flow 3der was displayed in fig 1 which was a plexiglas rectangular tank with the working volume of 80 ml two main electrodes including a ti ruo2 iro2 anode 100 30 1 mm and a titanium plate cathode with the same dimension shuerde co china were positioned vertically and parallel to each other with an inner gap of 3 cm the prepared gscs of 40 g were filled between anode and cathode commercial gac catalysts jiacheng co zhejiang china and 2der without particle electrodes were also tested for comparison the concentration of rhb in influent was 50 mg l with 0 1 m na2so4 electrolyte the flow rate of influent was 6 67 ml min corresponding to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 min air was sparged into 3der through the air inlet fig 1 to promote mass transfer and pollutants degradation zhang et al 2013 the air inlet was connecting with an aeration pump and the aeration rate was maintained at 15 ml min by adjusting the flow meter the concentration of oxygen in 3der was determined to be 8 15 mg l by a dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa magnetic stirring was carried at the bottom of the reactor to enhance mass transfer of oxygen into rhb solution contreras moreno et al 2017 and to improve the electrocatalytic reactions at gas liquid solid oxygen rhb particle electrodes three phase interfaces in 3der fig s1 rhb was pumped into the 3der continuously and voltage 8 v was provided by a digital dc power supply ce0036030s rainworm china the experiments of rhb degradation in 3der were carried out at the room temperature of 26 c the effluent samples were collected and filtered through 0 45 Œºm nitrocellulose membrane before analysis energy consumption ec kwh g rhb of 3der was calculated as follows neti and misra 2012 1 ec ui c 0 c t q where u is the applied voltage v i is the current a c0 is the initial rhb concentration mg l ct is rhb concentration at time t mg l q is the flow rate of rhb solution l h 3 results 3 1 wastewater treatment performance of 3der filled with gscs the removal efficiency of rhb in continuous flow 3der is shown in fig 2 a the average removal efficiency was only 24 2 for 2d system in the absence of gscs the removal efficiency attenuated from 79 1 to 56 2 in 14 h when filling commercial gac catalysts in 3der remarkable improvement in rhb removal efficiency was observed for 3der filled with prepared gscs particle electrodes for gsc the removal efficiency maintained over 90 during the initial 6 h while decreasing to 52 9 when the treatment time prolonged to 14 h for gsc cts the removal efficiency was slightly higher than gsc during the initial 8 h while decreasing more rapidly to 38 9 in 14 h doping 10 pmma gsc 10 significantly enhanced the removal efficiency in the first 8 h and the average removal efficiency was as high as 98 9 however the removal efficiency decreased quickly to 47 2 in the late 6 h for gsc 10 cts the removal efficiency was relatively stable ranging from 85 4 to 99 6 the removal efficiency maintained over 94 1 during 12 h operation then decreased by less than 10 in the late 2 h apparently gsc 10 cts were more resistant to deactivation compared to the other gscs achieving a durable treatment performance in 14 h what s more the dissolution of cu and fe species from gsc 10 cts into the effluent were negligible during the treatment process table s2 suggesting the stability of the prepared gsc 10 cts current is another important parameter to characterize the electrocatalytic process in 3der current for all the gscs were relatively stable during the treatment process in the presence of 8 v voltage fig 2c 2d system generated the highest current value the current was lower for 3der filled with gscs compared to 3der filled with commercial gac catalysts the lowest current presented when gsc 10 cts was filled in 3der for rhb treatment energy consumption ec directly determined the operation cost of 3der fig 2d indicated that 2d system consumed much more electric energy than 3der for commercial gac catalysts ec increased slightly with the prolonging treatment time ec of gsc cts was lower than that of commercial gac catalysts in the first 9 h but gradually approaching even exceeding that of commercial gac catalysts after 12 h ec of gsc gsc 10 were lower than that of commercial gac catalysts while slightly increased after 10 h it was noticed that ec of gsc 10 cts was the lowest and maintained stable during the whole 14 h treatment the results also verified the impressive performance of gsc 10 cts in energy consumption as well as the highest removal efficiency the superiority of gsc 10 cts was ascribed to hierarchical pore structure and better electrocatalytic properties 3 2 porous structure of gscs gscs particle electrodes taken effect on rhb removal in 3der by adsorption and electrocatalysis the adsorption capability of the gscs made considerable contributions to rhb removal as shown in fig 2b the adsorption property of gscs followed the order of gsc 10 gsc 10 cts gsc gsc cts it was clearly that pmma addition enhanced rhb adsorption while doping copper tailings was to the opposite however when looking over the bet surface area of gscs table 2 gsc 10 had the lowest surface area of 56 55 m2 g the adsorption property of gscs was independent on the surface area the results revealed that the adsorption behavior of gscs in 3der was different from that of the powder materials adsorption of rhb highly relied on the macropores in gscs which existed in gsc 10 gsc 10 cts due to pmma dosage thermal analysis in fig s2 confirmed the pore forming capability of pmma gsc 10 precursor mainly experienced a three stage weight loss the first stage ranged from 25 to 200 c which was due to the release of moisture and decomposition of volatile organics bandosz and block 2006 the majority of the weight loss occurred between 200 and 600 c which was related to the vaporization of pmma and organics such as proteins carbohydrates and aliphatic compounds li et al 2018 there was slight weight loss at the final stage of 600 700 c owing to the hardly decomposable substance since pmma started to burn out at 400 c gsc 10 precursor had more dramatic weight loss compared to gsc precursor due to vaporization of pmma when temperature increased over 400 c the results demonstrated the capability of pmma in fabricating macropores during the pyrolysis of waste sludge sem in fig 3 displayed the morphology and porous structure of gscs gsc surface was relatively dense without obvious pores the surface of gsc cts were rougher compared to that of gsc with development of noticeable pores that might be related to the inorganic components such as fe and cu in the doped copper tailings table s1 which were used to develop porous structure in sludge based adsorbents xie et al 2013 therefore copper tailings also exhibited the capability of fabricating pores in gscs large pores over 10 Œºm in gsc 10 was fabricated by vaporization of pmma 10 11 Œºm during pyrolysis the pores were further enlarged in gsc 10 cts in addition flake like crystals grew both on the surface and at the pores wall of gsc 10 cts accordingly pmma mainly contributed to developing macropores while copper tailings promoted the formation of porous structure and deposition of crystals n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for the prepared gscs fig s3 exhibited type iv isotherm of iupac definition lee et al 2013 hysteresis loop over a wide relative pressure ranging from 0 4 to 1 0 suggested the existence of mesopores in all the gscs h3 hysteresis loops associated with gsc and gsc cts revealed wedge shaped pores east 2016 h4 hysteresis loop indicated the micro mesoporous structure of gsc 10 and gsc 10 cts feng et al 2015 abundant fe components in sludge promoted the development of the porous structure of the gscs li et al reported that adding scrap iron comprising fe fe2o3 and fe3o4 into sewage sludge significantly improved the formation of mesopores in the produced activated carbon li et al 2015 yang et al found that fe2o3 in situ catalyzed the cracking of c c and c h bonds in tar to produce porous structure of sewage sludge yang et al 2018 ferric salts was considered to enlarge the pore volume of sludge based adsorbents by increasing mesopores yang et al 2016 in this study fe components in raw sludge mainly presented in the forms of ferric salts and iron oxides hence facilitating the formation of mesopores in gscs during pyrolysis ca species in the sludge also contributed to the porous structure in gscs liu et al reported that ca was favorable for the formation of pores by encouraging partial cleavages of c c bonds and c h bonds in the sludge resulting in the decomposition of organic macromolecules into relative small molecules liu et al 2013 in addition porosity was also developed during volatilization of zncl2 and additional micro porosity and meso porosity could arise during the washing step of removing entrapped zncl2 hadi et al 2015 the distribution curves of pore size further figured out the porous structure of the prepared gscs fig 4 gsc exhibited broad distribution in mesopores with the diameter of 4 8 nm gsc cts possessed a lower pore size distribution over 4 6 nm than gsc apparently the portion of macropores in gscs increased with pmma doping the obvious peak of macropores at 6 Œºm appeared in gsc 10 for gsc 10 cts macropores of 12 Œºm and micropores of 1 5 nm emerged compared to gsc 10 the enlargement of macropores in gsc 10 cts was probably due to magnified vaporization of pmma by inorganic components in copper tailings tang et al 2018a the micropores in gsc 10 cts was intensified by co doping pmma and copper tailings as micropores also presented in gsc 10 fig s3 3 3 electrocatalytic activity of the gscs the electrochemical property of prepared gscs was evaluated by cv measurement with 20 consecutive cycles of scan in rhb and k4fe cn 6 solution respectively as shown in fig 5 a obvious redox peaks of rhb were observed for all gscs with two oxidative peaks and two reductive peaks gsc 10 cts exhibited the highest oxidative peak current 2 55 2 70 ma followed by gsc cts 2 39 2 26 ma gsc 10 2 10 2 24 ma and gsc 1 63 1 92 ma the results indicated that the electrochemical oxidation of rhb on gsc 10 cts and gsc cts was faster than on the other two gscs moreover redox reaction of fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 on gscs were measured fig 5b the redox peaks were quite weak for gsc 10 but obvious for the other gscs for gsc there were redox peaks of fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 with a peak separation Œ¥ep of 0 45 mv the reduced ep for gsc 10 cts and gsc cts suggested the declined thermodynamic barrier of redox reactions on these two materials furthermore the peak currents for gsc 10 cts significantly increased than gsc cts indicating that electron transfer rate on gsc 10 cts was more rapid than on gsc cts the interfacial electron transfer properties of different gscs were evaluated by eis measurement with the nyquist plots in fig 5c the diameter semicircle in the high frequency range was assigned to the charge transfer resistance rct at the interface of gscs during electrocatalysis process based on equivalent circuit models xu and song 2015 the rct values of both gsc cts 208 0 œâ and gsc 10 cts 204 0 œâ were reduced by doping copper tailings in comparison with gsc 217 9 œâ and gsc 10 258 6 œâ the metal components such as cu from copper tailings table s1 accelerated the charge transfer reaction the straight line in the low frequency range represented diffusion resistance of the electrode electrolyte interface the higher slope of linear part for gsc 10 cts and gsc cts corresponded to faster diffusion rate of the electrode electrolyte interface accordingly interfacial electron transfer properties of gscs were improved by doping copper tailings including both diffusion at the electrode electrolyte interface and charge transfer at the electrode interface the results were in agreement with the higher conductivity of gsc 10 cts and gsc cts in table 2 combined with cv analysis gsc 10 cts was demonstrated to have the highest electrochemical activity which was essential for electrocatalysis 3 4 physical and chemical properties of gscs the physical and chemical properties of gscs were listed in table 2 addition of pmma into sludge led to a lower yield due to vaporization of pmma during pyrolysis the apparent density decreased with pmma addition demonstrating the formation of porous structure in gscs by sacrificing pmma templates accordingly the compressive strength of the gscs were inevitably reduced the carbon content of gscs increased with pmma addition although pure pmma materials completely vaporized at 400 c fig s2 mixing with sludge definitely influenced the vaporization behavior of pmma the presence of inherent minerals in sludge retarded the release of volatile pmma vapors and then led to the deposition of a few pmma tang et al 2018a both yield and apparent density of the gscs declined after doping copper tailings revealing that copper tailings also contributed to the porous structure of gscs by promoting the formation of pores in gscs bagreev et al 2001 this result confirmed the capability of copper tailings in fabricating pores which was indicated in sem and porosity analysis also the contents of s fe and cu elevated in gscs by introducing copper tailings especially the ratio of cu a highly efficient electrocatalytic component increased by one magnitude after doping copper tailings more importantly the compressive strength of the gscs was obviously enhanced in the presence of copper tails that was crucial to fill gscs into 3der as particle electrodes for wastewater treatment xrd results in fig 6 a reflected the crystal structure of the gscs the diffraction peak at 26 6 corresponded to the characteristic diffraction of graphite this peak was obviously intensified and became sharper for gscs doped with copper tailings indicating more ordered graphite crystallites ji et al 2018 accordingly electrochemical properties of gscs were improved coinciding with the increased conductivity of gsc cts and gsc 10 cts in table 2 the predominance of graphite carbon in gscs might be ascribed to the high pyrolysis temperature of 600 c gu et al 2013 wang et al 2017b and abundant fe components in the raw sludge wen et al 2018 the peaks at 2Œ∏ 36 2 31 7 34 4 56 5 47 4 were the diffraction of zno crystalline planes derived from zncl2 activator the diffraction intensity of zno in gsc 10 cts declined and the shape broadened revealing decreased crystallinity and increased distribution of zno tang et al 2018b that facilitated the electrocatalytic oxidation of wastewater due to more uniform catalytic sites fe3o4 0 5fe3 0 25fe2 o crystalline phase jcpds 89 0688 presented in gsc and gsc 10 at the pyrolysis temperature of 600 c wang et al 2017b the diffraction intensity of fe3o4 decreased with addition of copper tailings gsc cts and almost disappeared in gsc 10 cts instead diffraction peaks of wustite i e fe0 95o 0 1fe3 0 85fe2 o jcpds 79 1967 emerged in gsc 10 cts this was due to the reduction of fe ‚Ö≤ to fe ii by the reductants existed in or generated from copper tailings during pyrolysis tang et al 2018a pmma constructed macropores significantly enhanced mass transfer and more fe ‚Ö≤ was exposed for reduction leading to the accumulation of fe0 95o in gsc 10 cts fe ii exhibited high catalytic activity in generating radicals hu et al 2011 that were important oxidants for decomposing contaminants in 3der obvious peaks of c1s o1s fe2p and zn2p were displayed in xps spectra fig 6b corresponding to the vital components of graphite carbon zno fe3o4 and fe0 95o in the gscs high resolution scans of fe element fig s4 indicated that both fe ‚Ö± and fe ‚Ö≤ co existed in all the gscs with different ratios 4 discussion 4 1 roles of radicals in rhb removal electrocatalytic generation of radicals played important roles in indirect oxidation of contaminants in the 3der zhu et al 2011 accordingly dmpo spin trapped esr spectroscopy was used to track the activated radicals formed in 3der as shown in fig 7 ooh characterized by seven intensity peaks were detected for gsc 10 gsc cts and gsc 10 cts which was the product of o2 reacting with h2o wang et al 2017a 2 o2 h2o ooh oh the mechanisms for radicals production were distinct for different gscs gsc 10 generated radicals while gsc not that was highly related with the macropores in gsc 10 more catalytic sites interior could participate reactions due to enhanced mass transfer by macropores radicals generated by gsc cts were mainly due to the increased catalytic components from copper tailings therefore the peak intensity of gsc 10 cts in esr spectrum was the strongest by improving mass transfer and catalytic components simultaneously gsc 10 cts was efficient catalyst for radicals generation and hence for the indirect oxidation of pollutants to demonstrate the contributions of radicals to rhb removal tertbutyl alcohol was added into the influent as radical scavengers as shown in fig 2e the removal efficiency of all gscs decreased to various degrees after quenching the radicals especially for gsc 10 cts stable treatment efficiency could not be maintained lacking of radicals during long term operation fig 2f presented the removal efficiency contributed by radicals by subtracting fig 2a e it was found that the contribution of radicals was less than 10 for gsc 10 in spite of considerable capability of gsc 10 in generating radicals fig 7 the reason might be the excessive adsorption of rhb by gsc 10 fig 2b leading to the coverage of catalytic sites by the contaminants the results implied that adsorption and electrocatalysis of contaminants by particle electrodes should be matched in 3der the evolution of gsc and gsc cts was similar displaying a trend of first rise then decline the increased contribution of radicals synchronized with the decreased contribution of adsorption fig 2f the subsequently declined trend was mainly due to the coverage of catalytic sites therefore roles of radicals in contaminants removal not only depended on radicals generation by gscs but also being related with mass transfer at the interface of gscs due to the excellent electrocatalytic property and porous structure of gsc 10 cts the contributions of radicals kept growing during 14 h operation 4 2 gscs of hierarchical pore structure resist deactivation the porous structure of the gscs greatly influenced wastewater treatment performance of 3der there appeared significant attenuation in rhb removal efficiency after 8 h treatment for gsc and gsc cts fig 2a since lacking macropores rhb was difficult to diffuse into the interior of gscs mass transfer in these gscs were restricted only catalytic sites on gscs surface could participate the electrocatalytic process accordingly these exposed catalytic sites were gradually covered by the contaminants leading to the reduction in treatment performance with operation time the poor adsorption of rhb by gsc and gsc cts also demonstrated the limited mass transfer of rhb in these gscs fig 2b the adsorption capability of gscs was irrelevant with their bet surface area table 2 but highly depending on the macropores in gsc 10 and gsc 10 cts the macropores created by pmma allowed rhb to migrate into the gsc 10 presenting the strongest adsorption capability fig 2b however the weak electrocatalytic property led to accumulation of rhb in gsc 10 and rhb removal efficiency decreased dramatically when catalytic sites were covered by the contaminants gsc 10 cts exhibited stable treatment performances due to the hierarchical pore structure effectively resisting deactivation of the particle electrodes macropores primarily worked as channels for mass transfer aschermann et al 2018 that were essential for the diffusion of rhb into gsc 10 cts of centimeter size meso and micropores enlarged specific surface area and therefore incremental catalytic sites were available li et al 2014 thereafter micro and mesopores located interior could participate the catalytic reactions rhb was continuously removed by gsc 10 cts because of the hierarchical pore structure and excellent electrocatalytic property 4 3 environmental and economic significance of gscs sewage sludge is an inevitable by product from wastewater treatment plants produced in large amounts fabricating sludge derived gscs offers a new strategy for wastes recycling exhibiting obvious environmental significance production of commercial gac catalysts generally comprise two steps fabricating gac from coal biomass and loading metals such as pd and cu on gac to enhance the catalytic properties zhang et al 2013 in this study gscs are fabricated by one step approach of activation granulation and carbonization in situ utilizing organic matters and metals in sludge and copper tailings compared to producing commercial gac catalysts pmma is the main additional chemical which vaporizes in the forms of co2 co during pyrolysis the metals are free of use during gscs fabrication avoiding the secondary pollution of heavy metals therefore we consider that gscs fabrication is more environmental the fabrication cost of gscs could be evaluated based on sludge pyrolyzed activated carbon which is about rmb 620 1240 ton considering transportation energy consumption chemicals and other processes bhatnagar et al 2008 the fabrication procedure of gscs is similar with sludge pyrolyzed activated carbon except extra doping 10 pmma rmb 15000 ton and 5 copper tailings free therefore the finished gscs products would cost lower than rmb 3000 ton by adding all the expenses that is much lower than the cost of the cheapest gac catalysts in the market about rmb 8000 ton it is reasonable to conclude that gscs are cost effective catalysts for wastewater treatment 5 conclusions in this study gscs were fabricated by pyrolyzing the mixture of waste sludge pmma and copper tailings and filled into 3der as particle electrodes for rhb wastewater treatment results indicated that gsc 10 cts performed the highest removal efficiency and the lowest energy consumption during rhb treatment process superior hierarchical pore structure comprising macro meso and micropores was established in gsc 10 cts being more resistant to deactivation during wastewater treatment pmma constructed macropores were essential for the mass transfer of rhb into gscs of centimeter size copper tailings facilitated the formation of meso and micro pores during sludge pyrolysis as well as improving electrochemical activity of gscs in addition the compressive strength of the porous gsc 10 cts were enhanced in the presence of copper tails that was crucial to fill into 3der as particle electrodes the environmental friendly and cost effective gscs might substitute commercial gac catalysts in the future

18526,three dimensional electrochemical reactor 3der is a highly efficient technology for refractory wastewater treatment particle electrodes filled between anode and cathode are the core units of 3der determining the treatment efficiency of wastewater however particle electrodes deactivation due to catalytic sites coverage seriously impedes the continuous operation of 3der in this work granular sludge carbon gsc particle electrodes being resistant to deactivation are fabricated by pyrolyzing the mixture of waste sludge polymethyl methacrylate pmma and copper tailings whose performances are evaluated by degrading rhodamine b rhb wastewater in a continuous flow 3der results indicate that hierarchical pore structure comprising macro meso and micropores is developed in gsc 10 cts by doping 10 g pmma and 5 g copper tailings into 100 g waste sludge pmma contributes to construct macropores which is essential for the mass transfer of rhb into gsc particle electrodes of centimeter size copper tailings promote the formation of meso and micro pores in gscs as well as improving the electrochemical properties consequently gsc 10 cts packed 3der exhibits the highest removal efficiency and lowest energy consumption for rhb treatment in addition the compressive strength of gsc 10 cts is enhanced by copper tails that is crucial to fill into 3der as particle electrodes the high efficient and cost effective gsc 10 cts fabricated by waste materials have the potential of substituting commercial granular activated carbon catalysts in the future consequently promoting the application of 3der in wastewater treatment graphical abstract image 1 keywords hierarchical pore particle electrode three dimensional electrochemical reactor waste sludge wastewater treatment 1 introduction treatment of industrial refractory wastewater is a great challenge in china various physical chemical approaches have been applied to deal with these wastewater among which three dimensional electrochemical reactor 3der is a highly efficient and environmental friendly technology zheng et al 2016 based on conventional electrochemical technology 3der is developed by filling conductive particles such as granular activated carbon gac between anode and cathode wei et al 2010 after applying external electric field these particles are polarized to be multiple microelectrodes significantly improving the efficiency of wastewater treatment gac is the most widely used particle electrodes due to its good electrical conductivity large surface area and low cost since the electrocatalytic activity of pristine gac is relatively weak noble metals such as pd and cu are loaded onto gac to enhance its electrocatalytic property zhang et al 2013 some metal oxides fe3o4 sno2 sb2o3 ruo2 iro2 supported gacs also exhibit high electrocatalytic activity li et al 2016 however deactivation of gac catalysts due to the coverage of catalytic sites by contaminants seriously deteriorates the treatment performance of 3der during long term operation furthermore the expense of gac catalysts are too expensive for wastewater treatment therefore particle electrodes of high efficient and cost effective are still in urgent need by 3der technology currently multifunctional carbon materials converted from waste sludge exhibit potential in electrochemical energy storage and pollutants adsorption catalytic oxidation yuan and dai 2016 particularly waste sludge derived carbons scs are used as electrocatalysts for their carbonaceous nature and co existence of metal elements acid orange 7 dyeing wastewater can be degraded by 80 2 through the electrocatalysis of scs powder sun et al 2015 iron oxide supported scs powder has the capability of purifying coal gasification wastewater by electrochemical oxidation hou et al 2016 although the efficacy of scs powder is verified the difficulties in separating and recovering powder catalysts restrain the practical application of scs therefore granular sludge carbon gscs is fabricated and successfully applied as particle electrodes of 3der to treat dyeing wastewater in our previous work ji et al 2018 gscs is demonstrated to be highly efficient initially but the treatment performance of 3der is inevitably attenuating during the continuous operation ascribing to the deactivation of gscs since contaminants adsorption at the interface of gscs is more rapid than contaminants decomposition by electrocatalysis the active catalytic sites are gradually covered by the accumulated contaminants to maintain a stable treatment performance the structure of gscs should be optimized to balance the processes of adsorption and electrocatalysis the adsorption property of gscs is highly dependent on porous structure which can be regulated by adding pore forming agents kong et al 2013 the electrocatalytic property of gscs can be improved by optimizing catalytic components therefore polymethyl methacrylate pmma and waste copper tailings are doped into waste sludge to improve the performances of gscs in present work pmma is a spherical plastic particle that easily burned out during pyrolysis xia et al 2011 consequently creating multiple pores in gscs porous structure of gscs is designed to enhance the mass transfer between contaminants and gscs particle electrodes promoting adsorption and electrocatalysis occurred in 3der copper tailings comprise various metal components such as cu and fe which can improve the electrocatalytic activity of gscs thomas et al 2013 the synergy of adsorption and electrocatalysis would effectively relieve the coverage of active catalytic sites in gscs and achieve a stable treatment performance in 3der in this study gscs particle electrodes being resistant to deactivation were fabricated by pyrolyzing the mixture of waste sludge pmma and copper tailings the performances of the prepared gscs were evaluated by degrading rhodamine b rhb wastewater in a continuous flow 3der the roles of pmma and copper tailings in improving the properties of gscs were investigated from the aspects of porous structure and electrocatalytic activity of the materials herein we report a strategy of fabricating porous gscs as high efficient and cost effective particle electrodes consequently promoting the application of 3der in wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials and reagents the dewatered waste sludge obtained from tianshan wastewater treatment plant shanghai china was pretreated with feso4 and ca oh 2 copper tailings were collected from the mineral processing slag of a copper mine located in tongling anhui china waste sludge contained abundant c 26 58 ca 32 16 and fe 19 12 elements table s1 copper tailings comprised various metal elements such as fe 32 33 and cu 0 88 waste sludge and copper tailings were ground into fine powder of less than 150 mesh before utilization pmma with the average particle size of 10 Œºm were purchased from mitsubishi co guangdong china the other regents are all analytical grade from sinopharm co shanghai china 2 2 preparation of gscs the gscs were fabricated referring to our previous work with a few modifications ji et al 2018 100 g sludge powder was mixed with zncl2 solution 40 wt as activation agent and 1 g sodium carboxymethyl cellulose as adhesive the mixture was stirred slowly for 12 h at ambient temperature and then was shaped into spherical precursors with the diameter of 8 mm by a granulator ld 88a chuangli china the obtained particles were dried at 105 c for 12 h and subsequently pyrolyzed in a tube furnace gsl 1400x kejing china at heating rate of 10 c min to 600 c in the presence of n2 holding for 2 h after cooling down the products were washed with 80 c distill water until the effluent ph was constant the obtained particles were dried at 105 c overnight and labeled as gsc pmma and copper tailings were doped into the sludge powder before activation to improve the performances of gsc the dosages of pmma and copper tailings were optimized previously as described in supplementary materials to investigate the roles of pmma and copper tailings as well as the synergy of the two additives in gsc improvement different fabrication conditions were selected as listed in table 1 2 3 analytical methods themogravimetric tg analysis was carried on a thermogravimetric analyzer tga sdta851e mettler toledo switzerland compressive strength of gscs was measured by an automatic particle strength tester yhkc 3a jiangyan china the conductivity of gscs

esr emx 8 2 7 bruker germany the electrochemical properties of gscs were analyzed on an electrochemical workstation chi 660e chenhua china using a three electrode system a glassy carbon disk 3 0 mm in diameter coated with various gscs was used as the working electrode with pt wire as the counter electrode and ag agcl electrode as the reference electrode ji et al 2018 the cyclic voltammetry cv measurements were conducted in rhb and k4fe cn 6 solution respectively electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis were measured in k3fe cn 6 solution n2 was purged into the solution for 30 min prior to each scan 2 4 continuous flow 3der for evaluating the performances of gscs the configuration of the continuous flow 3der was displayed in fig 1 which was a plexiglas rectangular tank with the working volume of 80 ml two main electrodes including a ti ruo2 iro2 anode 100 30 1 mm and a titanium plate cathode with the same dimension shuerde co china were positioned vertically and parallel to each other with an inner gap of 3 cm the prepared gscs of 40 g were filled between anode and cathode commercial gac catalysts jiacheng co zhejiang china and 2der without particle electrodes were also tested for comparison the concentration of rhb in influent was 50 mg l with 0 1 m na2so4 electrolyte the flow rate of influent was 6 67 ml min corresponding to a hydraulic retention time hrt of 12 min air was sparged into 3der through the air inlet fig 1 to promote mass transfer and pollutants degradation zhang et al 2013 the air inlet was connecting with an aeration pump and the aeration rate was maintained at 15 ml min by adjusting the flow meter the concentration of oxygen in 3der was determined to be 8 15 mg l by a dissolved oxygen meter hq30d hach usa magnetic stirring was carried at the bottom of the reactor to enhance mass transfer of oxygen into rhb solution contreras moreno et al 2017 and to improve the electrocatalytic reactions at gas liquid solid oxygen rhb particle electrodes three phase interfaces in 3der fig s1 rhb was pumped into the 3der continuously and voltage 8 v was provided by a digital dc power supply ce0036030s rainworm china the experiments of rhb degradation in 3der were carried out at the room temperature of 26 c the effluent samples were collected and filtered through 0 45 Œºm nitrocellulose membrane before analysis energy consumption ec kwh g rhb of

q is the flow rate of rhb solution l h 3 results 3 1 wastewater treatment performance of 3der filled with gscs the removal efficiency of rhb in continuous flow 3der is shown in fig 2 a the average removal efficiency was only 24 2 for 2d system in the absence of gscs the removal efficiency attenuated from 79 1 to 56 2 in 14 h when filling commercial gac catalysts in 3der remarkable improvement in rhb removal efficiency was observed for 3der filled with prepared gscs particle electrodes for gsc the removal efficiency maintained over 90 during the initial 6 h while decreasing to 52 9 when the treatment time prolonged to 14 h for gsc cts the removal efficiency was slightly higher than gsc during the initial 8 h while decreasing more rapidly to 38 9 in 14 h doping 10 pmma gsc 10 significantly enhanced the removal efficiency in the first 8 h and the average removal efficiency was as high as 98 9 however the removal efficiency decreased quickly to 47 2 in the late 6 h for gsc 10 cts the removal efficiency was relatively stable ranging from 85 4 to 99 6 the removal efficiency maintained over 94 1 during 12 h operation then decreased by less than 10 in the late 2 h apparently gsc 10 cts were more resistant to deactivation compared to the other gscs achieving a durable treatment performance in 14 h what s more the dissolution of cu and fe species from gsc 10 cts into the effluent were negligible during the treatment process table s2 suggesting the stability of the prepared gsc 10 cts current is another important parameter to characterize the electrocatalytic process in 3der current for all the gscs were relatively stable during the treatment process in the presence of 8 v voltage fig 2c 2d system generated the highest current value the current was lower for 3der filled with gscs compared to 3der filled with commercial gac catalysts the lowest current presented when gsc 10 cts was filled in 3der for rhb treatment energy consumption ec directly determined the operation cost of 3der fig 2d indicated that 2d system consumed much more electric energy than 3der for commercial gac catalysts ec increased slightly with the prolonging treatment time ec of gsc cts was lower than that of commercial gac catalysts in the first 9 h but gradually approaching even exceeding that of commercial gac catalysts after 12 h ec of gsc gsc 10 were lower than that of commercial gac catalysts while slightly increased after 10 h it was noticed that ec of gsc 10 cts was the lowest and maintained stable during the whole 14 h treatment the results also verified the impressive performance of gsc 10 cts in energy consumption as well as the highest removal efficiency the superiority of gsc 10 cts was ascribed to hierarchical pore structure and better electrocatalytic properties 3 2 porous structure of gscs gscs particle electrodes taken effect on rhb removal in 3der by adsorption and electrocatalysis the adsorption capability of the gscs made considerable contributions to rhb removal as shown in fig 2b the adsorption property of gscs followed the order of gsc 10 gsc 10 cts gsc gsc cts it was clearly that pmma addition enhanced rhb adsorption while doping copper tailings was to the opposite however when looking over the bet surface area of gscs table 2 gsc 10 had the lowest surface area of 56 55 m2 g the adsorption property of gscs was independent on the surface area the results revealed that the adsorption behavior of gscs in 3der was different from that of the powder materials adsorption of rhb highly relied on the macropores in gscs which existed in gsc 10 gsc 10 cts due to pmma dosage thermal analysis in fig s2 confirmed the pore forming capability of pmma gsc 10 precursor mainly experienced a three stage weight loss the first stage ranged from 25 to 200 c which was due to the release of moisture and decomposition of volatile organics bandosz and block 2006 the majority of the weight loss occurred between 200 and 600 c which was related to the vaporization of pmma and organics such as proteins carbohydrates and aliphatic compounds li et al 2018 there was slight weight loss at the final stage of 600 700 c owing to the hardly decomposable substance since pmma started to burn out at 400 c gsc 10 precursor had more dramatic weight loss compared to gsc precursor due to vaporization of pmma when temperature increased over 400 c the results demonstrated the capability of pmma in fabricating macropores during the pyrolysis of waste sludge sem in fig 3 displayed the morphology and porous structure of gscs gsc surface was relatively dense without obvious pores the surface of gsc cts were rougher compared to that of gsc with development of noticeable pores that might be related to the inorganic components such as fe and cu in the doped copper tailings table s1 which were used to develop porous structure in sludge based adsorbents xie et al 2013 therefore copper tailings also exhibited the capability of fabricating pores in gscs large pores over 10 Œºm in gsc 10 was fabricated by vaporization of pmma 10 11 Œºm during pyrolysis the pores were further enlarged in gsc 10 cts in addition flake like crystals grew both on the surface and at the pores wall of gsc 10 cts accordingly pmma mainly contributed to developing macropores while copper tailings promoted the formation of porous structure and deposition of crystals n2 adsorption desorption isotherms for the prepared gscs fig s3 exhibited type iv isotherm of iupac definition lee et al 2013 hysteresis loop over a wide relative pressure ranging from 0 4 to 1 0 suggested the existence of mesopores in all the gscs h3 hysteresis loops associated with gsc and gsc cts revealed wedge shaped pores east 2016 h4 hysteresis loop indicated the micro mesoporous structure of gsc 10 and gsc 10 cts feng et al 2015 abundant fe components in sludge promoted the development of the porous structure of the gscs li et al reported that adding scrap iron comprising fe fe2o3 and fe3o4 into sewage sludge significantly improved the formation of mesopores in the produced activated carbon li et al 2015 yang et al found that fe2o3 in situ catalyzed the cracking of c c and c h bonds in tar to produce porous structure of sewage sludge yang et al 2018 ferric salts was considered to enlarge the pore volume of sludge based adsorbents by increasing mesopores yang et al 2016 in this study fe components in raw sludge mainly presented in the forms of ferric salts and iron oxides hence facilitating the formation of mesopores in gscs during pyrolysis ca species in the sludge also contributed to the porous structure in gscs liu et al reported that ca was favorable for the formation of pores by encouraging partial cleavages of c c bonds and c h bonds in the sludge resulting in the decomposition of organic macromolecules into relative small molecules liu et al 2013 in addition porosity was also developed during volatilization of zncl2 and additional micro porosity and meso porosity could arise during the washing step of removing entrapped zncl2 hadi et al 2015 the distribution curves of pore size further figured out the porous structure of the prepared gscs fig 4 gsc exhibited broad distribution in mesopores with the diameter of 4 8 nm gsc cts possessed a lower pore size distribution over 4 6 nm than gsc apparently the portion of macropores in gscs increased with pmma doping the obvious peak of macropores at 6 Œºm appeared in gsc 10 for gsc 10 cts macropores of 12 Œºm and micropores of 1 5 nm emerged compared to gsc 10 the enlargement of macropores in gsc 10 cts was probably due to magnified vaporization of pmma by inorganic components in copper tailings tang et al 2018a the micropores in gsc 10 cts was intensified by co doping pmma and copper tailings as micropores also presented in gsc 10 fig s3 3 3 electrocatalytic activity of the gscs the electrochemical property of prepared gscs was evaluated by cv measurement with 20 consecutive cycles of scan in rhb and k4fe cn 6 solution respectively as shown in fig 5 a obvious redox peaks of rhb were observed for all gscs with two oxidative peaks and two reductive peaks gsc 10 cts exhibited the highest oxidative peak current 2 55 2 70 ma followed by gsc cts 2 39 2 26 ma gsc 10 2 10 2 24 ma and gsc 1 63 1 92 ma the results indicated that the electrochemical oxidation of rhb on gsc 10 cts and gsc cts was faster than on the other two gscs moreover redox reaction of fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 on gscs were measured fig 5b the redox peaks were quite weak for gsc 10 but obvious for the other gscs for gsc there were redox peaks of fe cn 6 4 fe cn 6 3 with a peak separation Œ¥ep of 0 45 mv the reduced ep for gsc 10 cts and gsc cts suggested the declined thermodynamic barrier of redox reactions on these two materials furthermore the peak currents for gsc 10 cts significantly increased than gsc cts indicating that electron transfer rate on gsc 10 cts was more rapid than on gsc cts the interfacial electron transfer properties of different gscs were evaluated by eis measurement with the nyquist plots in fig 5c the diameter semicircle in the high frequency range was assigned to the charge transfer resistance rct at the interface of gscs during electrocatalysis process based on equivalent circuit models xu and song 2015 the rct values of both gsc cts 208 0 œâ and gsc 10 cts 204 0 œâ were reduced by doping copper tailings in comparison with gsc 217 9 œâ and gsc 10 258 6 œâ the metal components such as cu from copper tailings table s1 accelerated the charge transfer reaction the straight line in the low frequency range represented diffusion resistance of the electrode electrolyte interface the higher slope of linear part for gsc 10 cts and gsc cts corresponded to faster diffusion rate of the electrode electrolyte interface accordingly interfacial electron transfer properties of gscs were improved by doping copper tailings including both diffusion at the electrode electrolyte interface and charge transfer at the electrode interface the results were in agreement with the higher conductivity of gsc 10 cts and gsc cts in table 2 combined with cv analysis gsc 10 cts was demonstrated to have the highest electrochemical activity which was essential for electrocatalysis 3 4 physical and chemical properties of gscs the physical and chemical properties of gscs were listed in table 2 addition of pmma into sludge led to a lower yield due to vaporization of pmma during pyrolysis the apparent density decreased with pmma addition demonstrating the formation of porous structure in gscs by sacrificing pmma templates accordingly the compressive strength of the gscs were inevitably reduced the carbon content of gscs increased with pmma addition although pure pmma materials completely vaporized at 400 c fig s2 mixing with sludge definitely influenced the vaporization behavior of pmma the presence of inherent minerals in sludge retarded the release of volatile pmma vapors and then led to the deposition of a few pmma tang et al 2018a both yield and apparent density of the gscs declined after doping copper tailings revealing that copper tailings also contributed to the porous structure of gscs by promoting the formation of pores in gscs bagreev et al 2001 this result confirmed the capability of copper tailings in fabricating pores which was indicated in sem and porosity analysis also the contents of s fe and cu elevated in gscs by introducing copper tailings especially the ratio of cu a highly efficient electrocatalytic component increased by one magnitude after doping copper tailings more importantly the compressive strength of the gscs was obviously enhanced in the presence of copper tails that was crucial to fill gscs into 3der as particle electrodes for wastewater treatment xrd results in fig 6 a reflected the crystal structure of the gscs the diffraction peak at 26 6 corresponded to the characteristic diffraction of graphite this peak was obviously intensified and became sharper for gscs doped with copper tailings indicating more ordered graphite crystallites ji et al 2018 accordingly electrochemical properties of gscs were improved coinciding with the increased conductivity of gsc cts and gsc 10 cts in table 2 the predominance of graphite carbon in gscs might be ascribed to the high pyrolysis temperature of 600 c gu et al 2013 wang et al 2017b and abundant fe components in the raw sludge wen et al 2018 the peaks at 2Œ∏ 36 2 31 7 34 4 56 5 47 4 were the diffraction of zno crystalline planes derived from zncl2 activator the diffraction intensity of zno in gsc 10 cts declined and the shape broadened revealing decreased crystallinity and increased distribution of zno tang et al 2018b that facilitated the electrocatalytic oxidation of wastewater due to more uniform catalytic sites fe3o4 0 5fe3 0 25fe2 o crystalline phase jcpds 89 0688 presented in gsc and gsc 10 at the pyrolysis temperature of 600 c wang et al 2017b the diffraction intensity of fe3o4 decreased with addition of copper tailings gsc cts and almost disappeared in gsc 10 cts instead diffraction peaks of wustite i e fe0 95o 0 1fe3 0 85fe2 o jcpds 79 1967 emerged in gsc 10 cts this was due to the reduction of fe ‚Ö≤ to fe ii by the reductants existed in or generated from copper tailings during pyrolysis tang et al 2018a pmma constructed macropores significantly enhanced mass transfer and more fe ‚Ö≤ was exposed for reduction leading to the accumulation of fe0 95o in gsc 10 cts fe ii exhibited high catalytic activity in generating radicals hu et al 2011 that were important oxidants for decomposing contaminants in 3der obvious peaks of c1s o1s fe2p and zn2p were displayed in xps spectra fig 6b corresponding to the vital components of graphite carbon zno fe3o4 and fe0 95o in the gscs high resolution scans of fe element fig s4 indicated that both fe ‚Ö± and fe ‚Ö≤ co existed in all the gscs with different ratios 4 discussion 4 1 roles of radicals in rhb removal electrocatalytic generation of radicals played important roles in indirect oxidation of contaminants in the 3der zhu et al 2011 accordingly dmpo spin trapped esr spectroscopy was used to track the activated radicals formed in 3der as shown in fig 7 ooh characterized by seven intensity peaks were detected for gsc 10 gsc cts and gsc 10 cts which was the product of o2 reacting with h2o wang et al 2017a 2 o2 h2o ooh oh the mechanisms for radicals production were distinct for different gscs gsc 10 generated radicals while gsc not that was highly related with the macropores in gsc 10 more catalytic sites interior could participate reactions due to enhanced mass transfer by macropores radicals generated by gsc cts were mainly due to the increased catalytic components from copper tailings therefore the peak intensity of gsc 10 cts in esr spectrum was the strongest by improving mass transfer and catalytic components simultaneously gsc 10 cts was efficient catalyst for radicals generation and hence for the indirect oxidation of pollutants to demonstrate the contributions of radicals to rhb removal tertbutyl alcohol was added into the influent as radical scavengers as shown in fig 2e the removal efficiency of all gscs decreased to various degrees after quenching the radicals especially for gsc 10 cts stable treatment efficiency could not be maintained lacking of radicals during long term operation fig 2f presented the removal efficiency contributed by radicals by subtracting fig 2a e it was found that the contribution of radicals was less than 10 for gsc 10 in spite of considerable capability of gsc 10 in generating radicals fig 7 the reason might be the excessive adsorption of rhb by gsc 10 fig 2b leading to the coverage of catalytic sites by the contaminants the results implied that adsorption and electrocatalysis of contaminants by particle electrodes should be matched in 3der the evolution of gsc and gsc cts was similar displaying a trend of first rise then decline the increased contribution of radicals synchronized with the decreased contribution of adsorption fig 2f the subsequently declined trend was mainly due to the coverage of catalytic sites therefore roles of radicals in contaminants removal not only depended on radicals generation by gscs but also being related with mass transfer at the interface of gscs due to the excellent electrocatalytic property and porous structure of gsc 10 cts the contributions of radicals kept growing during 14 h operation 4 2 gscs of hierarchical pore structure resist deactivation the porous structure of the gscs greatly influenced wastewater treatment performance of 3der there appeared significant attenuation in rhb removal efficiency after 8 h treatment for gsc and gsc cts fig 2a since lacking macropores rhb was difficult to diffuse into the interior of gscs mass transfer in these gscs were restricted only catalytic sites on gscs surface could participate the electrocatalytic process accordingly these exposed catalytic sites were gradually covered by the contaminants leading to the reduction in treatment performance with operation time the poor adsorption of rhb by gsc and gsc cts also demonstrated the limited mass transfer of rhb in these gscs fig 2b the adsorption capability of gscs was irrelevant with their bet surface area table 2 but highly depending on the macropores in gsc 10 and gsc 10 cts the macropores created by pmma allowed rhb to migrate into the gsc 10 presenting the strongest adsorption capability fig 2b however the weak electrocatalytic property led to accumulation of rhb in gsc 10 and rhb removal efficiency decreased dramatically when catalytic sites were covered by the contaminants gsc 10 cts exhibited stable treatment performances due to the hierarchical pore structure effectively resisting deactivation of the particle electrodes macropores primarily worked as channels for mass transfer aschermann et al 2018 that were essential for the diffusion of rhb into gsc 10 cts of centimeter size meso and micropores enlarged specific surface area and therefore incremental catalytic sites were available li et al 2014 thereafter micro and mesopores located interior could participate the catalytic reactions rhb was continuously removed by gsc 10 cts because of the hierarchical pore structure and excellent electrocatalytic property 4 3 environmental and economic significance of gscs sewage sludge is an inevitable by product from wastewater treatment plants produced in large amounts fabricating sludge derived gscs offers a new strategy for wastes recycling exhibiting obvious environmental significance production of commercial gac catalysts generally comprise two steps fabricating gac from coal biomass and loading metals such as pd and cu on gac to enhance the catalytic properties zhang et al 2013 in this study gscs are fabricated by one step approach of activation granulation and carbonization in situ utilizing organic matters and metals in sludge and copper tailings compared to producing commercial gac catalysts pmma is the main additional chemical which vaporizes in the forms of co2 co during pyrolysis the metals are free of use during gscs fabrication avoiding the secondary pollution of heavy metals therefore we consider that gscs fabrication is more environmental the fabrication cost of gscs could be evaluated based on sludge pyrolyzed activated carbon which is about rmb 620 1240 ton considering transportation energy consumption chemicals and other processes bhatnagar et al 2008 the fabrication procedure of gscs is similar with sludge pyrolyzed activated carbon except extra doping 10 pmma rmb 15000 ton and 5 copper tailings free therefore the finished gscs products would cost lower than rmb 3000 ton by adding all the expenses that is much lower than the cost of the cheapest gac catalysts in the market about rmb 8000 ton it is reasonable to conclude that gscs are cost effective catalysts for wastewater treatment 5 conclusions in this study gscs were fabricated by pyrolyzing the mixture of waste sludge pmma and copper tailings and filled into 3der as particle electrodes for rhb wastewater treatment results indicated that gsc 10 cts performed the highest removal efficiency and the lowest energy consumption during rhb treatment process superior hierarchical pore structure comprising macro meso and micropores was established in gsc 10 cts being more resistant to deactivation during wastewater treatment pmma constructed macropores were essential for the mass transfer of rhb into gscs of centimeter size copper tailings facilitated the formation of meso and micro pores during sludge pyrolysis as well as improving electrochemical activity of gscs in addition the compressive strength of the porous gsc 10 cts were enhanced in the presence of copper tails that was crucial to fill into 3der as particle electrodes the environmental friendly and cost effective gscs might substitute commercial gac catalysts in the future

18527,algal derived organic matter aom from algal blooms in water supply systems contains dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved organic carbon doc among other constituents the don and doc are disinfection by product dbp precursor compounds and must be well characterised to facilitate effective removal thus minimising dbp formation during disinfection while doc character has been studied extensively don analysis suffers from inaccuracies due to sample pre treatment and instrument sensitivities a liquid chromatography method that combines size exclusion chromatography with highly sensitive organic carbon and nitrogen detectors lc ocnd has been widely adopted for doc analysis however its potential for application for don charactersation has been suggested as a viable alternative to existing don characterisation techniquesnot been assessed despite its potential hence the aim was to compare the effectiveness of conventional total dissolved n dissolved inorganic n tn din and lc ocnd methods for analysing don in aom a suite of n containing model compounds representative of don and aom extracted from chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 and microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 1 were used to evaluate the techniques the don of both model compounds and aom was first analysed using the conventional method and then via lc ocnd it was observed that lc ocnd had a better precision for don when tn contained more din lc ocnd provided direct quantitative measurements for bulk and fractionated don and din with little interference caused by din additionally lc ocnd provided information on mw distribution and protein content of the aom for example lc ocnd results showed that m aeruginosa aom contained more hmw material than c vulgaris aom however as lc ocnd uses uv oxidation it could not completely oxidise complex aromatic structures and thus had a lower recovery for hmw model compounds and algal don in comparison to the conventional method that used high temperature catalytic oxidation overall it is advised that a combination of lc ocnd and tn analysis be used to provide a more detailed characterisation of n containing aom and other similar hmw aquatic nom samples graphical abstract image 1 keywords algae cyanobacteria flow injection analysis lc ocd limit of detection 1 introduction algae are rich in organic n and surface waters impaired by algal extracellular and intracellular organic matter eom and iom normally have higher concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen don and lower ratios of dissolved organic carbon doc don than non impacted waters dotson and westerhoff 2009 lee et al 2006 mitch et al 2009 westerhoff and mash 2002 as eom and iom contain higher don composition relative to other sources it is a significant precursor for nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps krasner et al 2007 shah and mitch 2012 during algal blooms and subsequent water treatment the risk of iom being released is minimised by preventing algal cell lysis however poor removal of n dbp precursor containing eom combined with downstream disinfection could result in the formation of algal derived n dbps in the final drinking water if the character of these dissolved organic constituents are well understood treatment processes can be optimised to enhance their removal prior to disinfection resulting in the minimisation of n dbp formation bond et al 2010 typically the methods applied to determine total don concentrations are based on assessing concentrations of the total dissolved nitrogen tn after sample oxidation and then subtracting the separately measured concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din the tn din method berman and bronk 2003 bronk et al 2000 lee and westerhoff 2005 westerhoff and mash 2002 currently three oxidation methods are commonly applied to determine the total tn 1 a wet chemical method based on persulphate digestion and oxidation po to nitrate where concentration can be determined by absorbance spectroscopy valderrama 1981 or analysed colorimetrically by the spongy cadmium method jones 1984 2 high temperature oxidation to nitric oxide and detection by either spectrophotometry suzuki et al 1985 or chemiluminescence ammann et al 2000 and 3 ultraviolet uv oxidation to nitrate followed by analysis using the spongy cadmium method bronk et al 2000 jones 1984 however the accuracy of the don measurement by the tn din method is strongly dependent on the percentage of din in tn and the accuracy of the measurements for tn and individual din species a high ratio of din tn 0 6 has been found to cause greater variance in din measurements than the actual don levels lee and westerhoff 2005 also each measurement contributes to the overall analytical uncertainty u u d o n u t n 2 u n h 4 2 u n o 3 n o 2 2 1 2 berman and bronk 2003 bronk et al 2000 lee and westerhoff 2005 another major disadvantage of the tn din method is that it cannot directly provide information on don character that is necessary for n dbp characterisation for example size or mass distribution because it only measures bulk don it has been reported that the largest fraction of aom is that of high molecular weight hmw colloids which are rich in organic nitrogen leenheer et al 2007 li et al 2015 for example about 70 of don in drinking water sources impaired by algae was associated with the hmw fraction in which 14 of don was identified as polypeptides and combined amino acids while the remaining 56 of don was unidentified dotson and westerhoff 2009 guo et al 2003 organic matter characterisation can be undertaken via fractionation procedures for example according to size however the characterisation of the hmw fraction of don has not been widely investigated except for a few studies heinz et al 2015 shah and mitch 2012 further information on don character in addition to total don concentration is therefore required fractionation of don in water samples can be accomplished using liquid chromatography combined with highly sensitive organic carbon and nitrogen detection lc ocnd chon et al 2013 heinz et al 2015 huber et al 2011b the system employs a size exclusion chromatography sec column to fractionate samples followed by the detection of doc uv absorbance and don this results in the simultaneous doc and don characterisation for both the bulk sample and also the size fractionated samples huber et al 2011b this technique has been used extensively for doc characterisation of aquatic natural organic matter nom huber et al 2011b yang et al 2018 organic matter fouling in ultrafiltration henderson et al 2011 and extracellular polymeric substances eps in biofilm and membrane studies you et al 2018 yue et al 2015 among others one study compared the protein content of the biopolymer fraction of eps measured by the bradford assay and lc ocnd and suggested that lc ocnd was a viable tool for the quantification of doc and mw distribution stewart et al 2013 however lc ocnd studies have focused predominantly on doc character with minimal attention to the character of don it is still unclear whether lc ocnd is a robust technique for quantifying and characterising bulk or fractionated don when compared to quantifying don by tn din method hence the main aim of this study is to compare techniques to measure the concentrations of both bulk and fractionated don using the conventional tn din and the commonly applied lc ocnd method doc labor germany as described in detail in huber et al 2011b the measurements of doc don and din from a model compounds from biopolymers to lmw compounds and b eom hereafter referred to as aom of a green algal and a cyanobacterial species that had very different aom character in terms of total oc and on pivokonsky et al 2016 rao et al 2018 were compared using all methods the merits and limitations of these methods were evaluated rigorously using a protocol that incorporated analysis of specificity or selectivity linearity of calibration limits of detection and quantification lod and loq recovery repeatability trueness and proof of applicability lindner and wainer 1996 overall a comprehensive characterisation protocol for don analysis in n rich for example algal impacted water samples is established 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 quantitative calibration

model compounds was chosen as representative of don present in surface waters table 1 these model compounds represent typical proteinaceous n containing organics including amino acids amino sugars proteins polypeptides hmw substances polysaccharides and molecules exhibiting a range of heterocyclic or aromatic structures samples of reference nom standard humic acids and standard fulvic acids were purchased from the international humic substances society ihss usa all other model compounds were purchased at analytical grade standard 99 purity from sigma aldrich australia except for nicotinic acid scharlau chemie south australia additionally polyethylene glycol peg standards poly standard service germany were used for calibration of the mw distribution through the sec column the c and n composition of each model compound table 1 was calculated theoretically for model compounds with mw 500 da e g vitamins amino acids amino sugars and peptides chemical compositions were calculated from their known molecular formulae for humic substances and chitosan the chemical compositions were provided by the suppliers for proteins bovine serum albumin bsa and phycocyanin the chemical compositions were calculated using the protein identification and analysis tools of online protparam database gasteiger et al 2005 based on the protein sequences obtained from the molecular modelling database mmdb in national center for biotechnology information ncbi finally for Œ≥ globulins the relative information was estimated from the amino acid compositions and the protein sequences of human igg kappa v i which were retrieved from the collection of protein sequences and their annotations of online uniport database the uniprot 2015 stock solutions of model compounds 1000 mg l 1

using the phosphate buffer to minimise any potential interference from the lc ocnd mobile phase as model compounds contain no inorganic n don was calculated from tn analysis only 2 1 3 algae cultivation axenic cultures of green algae chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 and cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 01 were obtained from the australia national algae culture collection csiro hobart tasmania and subcultured in 250 ml flasks containing 100 ml each of sterilised jaworski medium henderson et al 2008 and mla medium bolch and blackburn 1996 respectively table s2 1 these two species were selected due to their different doc concentrations in aom and distinguishable size distributions from lmw to hmw range henderson et al 2008 the cultures were grown from day 0 until day 35 as this ensured that aom could be extracted during specific growth stages such as the exponential phase stationary phase and late stationary phase to produce a range of aom compositions for comparison between the different methods applied algae were cultured under illumination of 600 60 Œºmol m 2 s 1 with a light dark cycle of 16 h 8 h in an incubator labec plant growth chamber australia at 21 c cell counts were determined using a light microscope leica icc 50 germany and haemocytometer or sedgewick rafter chambers 2 1 4 extraction of organic matter from the cultures the aom was extracted from the cultures based on a procedure reported previously henderson et al 2008 briefly cells were separated from aom by centrifugation twice at 10 000 g for 15 min with an allegra x 15r centrifuge beckman coulter australia the supernatants from the centrifuge cycles were filtered prior to analysis extracts of aom no cells were collected from the cultures every five days from days 0 35 2 2 analytical methods for model compounds the recoveries of bulk n and c obtained by bulk toc tn analysis as well as the lc ocnd method were compared to the theoretical values table 1 this procedure allowed the assessment of the instrumental performance when analysing model compounds comprising different sizes structures and other properties afterwards the same assessment was applied when characterising unknown aom samples 2 2 1 determination of c and n using conventional doc tn din methods 2 2 1 1 determination of bulk doc and tn using high temperature oxidation determination of bulk doc and tn

injection analysis fia lachat quickchem 8500 usa the din measured by this method was then subtracted from the tn measured through high temperature oxidation to evaluate the bulk don in the samples full details available in s1 1 2 and s1 2 2 in si 2 3 1 determination of bulk and fractionated doc and don using size exclusion chromatography with c and n detection an lc ocnd system model 8 doc

the bypass signals for doc don and uvdabs254 aromatic and unsaturated structures a dilution factor of 10 was applied to samples with high doc values such that the resultant docs were 5 mg c l 1 to ensure accuracy of the technique huber et al 2011b please see s1 1 3 and s1 2 3 in si for full details 2 4 method validation 2 4 1 estimation of the limits of detection and quantification in this study lod and loq were determined using 10 replicate analyses of ultrapure water as the mean concentration of the blank a plus three or ten times of standard deviation s respectively equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 lod a 3 s 2 loq a 10 s this approach has the disadvantage that there is a lack of objective evidence to prove whether an analyte will indeed produce a signal distinguishable from a blank sample at this low concentration u s federal register 2000 hence an additional approach that uses linear regression was also applied as a comparison a linear calibration curve using appropriate calibration standards in the range of 0 1 10 mg l 1 for toc and 0 01 1 0 mg l 1 for tn as measured using the toc tn analyser lc ocnd and fia respectively the instrument response y fitted a linear regression model with concentration x as described in eq 3 3 y Œ±x b this is used to compute the sensitivity Œ± and the lod and loq which can be expressed as shown in equations 4 and 5 4 lod 3 s Œ± 5 loq 10 s Œ± where s yx is estimated by the standard deviation of y residuals of the linear regression and Œ± is the slope of the calibration curve this method has the advantage that there is little interference from background noise shrivastava and gupta 2011 2 4 2 determination of recovery and precision the recovery and precision of n measurements from each instrument toc tn analyser lc ocnd and fia were determined and compared potassium nitrate wako japan and nicotinic acid was selected as inorganic n and organic n standards for both the toc tn analyser and lc ocnd while the fia was tested using potassium nitrate ammonium chloride and aqueous potassium nitrite the concentrations 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 mg l 1 of the standard solutions used were prepared by serial dilution and each standard was measured in at least triplicate the measurements ten assays of different standards at various concentrations were then conducted for the total recovery determination of each instrument the results obtained for each standard were used to calculate the n recovery eq 6 using the average concentration measured for each standard c i and theoretical concentration of n for the model compound c s t d i the recovery for each different concentration standard was then averaged to represent the trueness of the method the precision was calculated as the standard deviation of calculated recoveries of all standards and described as a relative standard deviation rsd eq 7 as the standards were measured over a period of 2 years the precision represents the long term repeatability of each instrument 6 r e c o v e r y i c i c s t d i 100 c s t d i 7 r s d s 100 c i 2 4 3 calibration of size exclusion column using peg standards and model compounds in this study humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa standards 2 mg c l 1 peg standards with mw of 0 194 0 434 1 02 2 01 6 55 and 12 2 kda and the model compounds with a broad range of mw table 1 were used for the calibration of the size exclusion column based on a similar method of calibration reported by allpike et al 2005 3 results 3 1 assessment of methods 3 1 1 linearity limits of detection and quantification for all methods all the instruments demonstrated a good linearity of r2 0 998 for calibration standards prepared at different concentration ranges with no significant change in linearity when the standards were prepared using either ultrapure water or phosphate buffer si figure s2 1a c the lod and loq values determined using replicate analysis of a blank sample were compared to those estimated by the linear regression method table 2 both methods produced similar values for lods and loqs although the method using replicates of the blank was significantly influenced by low concentrations of doc loq 0 152 mg c l 1 lod 0 070 mg c l 1 present in the ultrapure laboratory water table 2 additionally the lod and loq values for bulk don analysis were comparable for both the tn din loq 0 043 mg n l 1 lod 0 015 mg n l 1 and the lc ocnd loq 0 037 mg n l 1 lod 0 018 mg n l 1 methods for replicate measurements of the blank additionally calculation of lod and loq values for don in individual aom size fractions biopolymer building blocks and lmw fractions produced similar values 3 1 2 comparison of recovery and precision among instruments the average recovery of various n standards nitrate and nicotinic acid as tn standards for tn and lc ond analysis nitrate nitrite and ammonia as din standards for fia using different instruments and measured over two years is presented in fig 1 a good agreement of 1 2 rsd 95 confidence interval was observed for all instruments and n species this suggests that none of the methods have an inherent bias i e low or high recovery comparison of long term precision showed that the toc tn analyser had the largest variability in recovery 2 4 rsd with the precision of the other instruments ranging between 1 5 and 1 7 rsd however overall all instruments had excellent long term precision the long term repeatability of the instruments was tested using the growth media for the algal and cyanobacterial cultures nitrate was always the major din source in both media 93 2 in the jaworski medium and 98 7 in the mla medium si table s2 1 and aom during the exponential phase day 0 9 before nitrate was fully assimilated during the stationary phase day 10 fig 2 therefore comparison of nitrite and ammonia measurements by lc ocnd and fia was not employed in this study due to their negligible content comparable concentrations of no3 were determined by the two methods fig 2 for example the precision of nitrate measurements from mla media and aom of m aeruginosa on days 5 and 10 were 1 7 8 5 and 13 rsd via lc ocnd and 1 5 9 1 and 13 rsd via fia respectively this revealed good reproducibility for nitrate measurements between the two methods suggesting lc ocnd and fia had the same precision level for nitrate characterisation in this study 3 1 3 calibration of the apparent molecular weight distribution in lc ocnd when considering the relationships between tr min and log mw of all model compounds and peg standards two linear trend lines were observed fig 3 firstly a linear relationship between tr min and log mw had the best fit r2 0 997 dashed line in fig 3 when only the peg standards were considered this excellent linearity for peg was consistent with previous reports her et al 2004 huber et al 2011b stewart et al 2013 similarly a linear relationship was observed when analysing the model compounds r2 0 879 solid line in fig 3 and this was also consistent with previous studies allpike et al 2005 2007 stewart et al 2013 however model compounds including tryptophan and glucosamine 5 6 in fig 3 respectively were found to have longer retention times than others within a similar mw range this was particularly apparent for tryptophan 5 which had the longest retention time of 112 min further statistical analysis demonstrated that tryptophan s retention time was an outlier among all the model compounds including glucosamine glucosamine s tr of 71 min was well within statistical uncertainty according to si table s2 2 and is believed to be caused by hydrophobic interactions of tryptophan with the sec column resin due to its non polar indole side chain her et al 2002 huber et al 2011b furthermore the outlying effect of tryptophan could also be a consequence of its hydrodynamic size it is well known that compounds with linear structures have a larger hydrodynamic size when compared to ring branched and coiled structures of similar mw belenkii and vilenchik 1983 this therefore may explain why a model compounds with ring structures 5 6 1 had a higher retention time when compared to model compounds 2 3 4 and 7 fig 3 that had linear structures and b coiled and branched compounds 13 14 did not elute close to the void volume even though their mw was outside the range of column overall a good fit of the trendlines r2 approximately 0 9 for peg standards and model compounds in lc ocnd indicated a steady increase in the retention time with a decrease in the mw thereby demonstrating that this would benefit size fractionation of algal don 3 1 4 influence of molecular weight and molecular structures on doc and don recovery in lc ocnd and high temperature oxidation methods the recoveries of doc and don depended on molecular weight when characterised using either lc ocnd or the high temperature oxidation methods of analysis figs 4 and si table s2 3 while lmw 1 kda model compounds typically had equivalent doc and don recovery for both analytical methods significantly lower recoveries for both doc and don were observed when using the lc ocnd for higher mw compounds slightly lower don recovery for higher mw compounds was also observed when using the bulk high temperature oxidation method fig 4 b but doc analysed by the high temperature oxidation method maintained recovery values of close to 100 irrespective of mw fig 4a when the mw was larger than 10 kda recoveries of most model compounds were less than 60 when measured by lc ocnd for example while doc and don recovery of bsa mw 66 kda by the high temperature oxidation methods were still around 100 that obtained using the lc ocnd was only 27 4 and 60 2 for doc and don respectively si table s2 3 for the chitosan standards with mw 100 kda the recoveries of doc and don using lc ocnd were 10 this indicated that mw was a greater influence on recovery for lc ocnd analysis than bulk toc or tn analysis similar observations to those made fig 4a and b have been made previously when analysing the oc of aquatic nom using the lc ocd and have been attributed to the differing oxidation efficiencies arising from different methods of analysis i e uv oxidation and high temperature combustion lankes et al 2009 the variable doc and don recoveries on the measured doc don ratio was also compared to the theoretically calculated ratios fig 5 for all model compounds measured by the high temperature oxidation method the measured doc don ratios were consistently higher than the theoretical ratios by 10 13 this small change was possibly due to the slightly lower don recovery when applying the high temperature oxidation method fig 4b however for lc ocnd analysis the measured doc don ratios deviated more significantly from theoretical values in either positive or negative directions as mw increased fig 5 specifically the measured doc don ratios from the amino sugar humic substances and the polysaccharide compounds 8 10 and 14 had an increasingly positive deviation while a negative deviation was observed for amino acids and proteins compounds 2 5 minor and 11 13 since the decrease in doc recovery with mw by lc ocnd was more pronounced than the decrease in don recovery fig 4a and b the particularly negative change in doc don ratios was attributed to the proportionally lower recovery of doc for amino acids and protein type model compounds hence the oxidation efficiency of hmw doc for the lc ocnd method is not only due to mw but can also be attributed to the chemical categories of the model compounds lmw model aliphatic compounds were found to have a higher recovery of don by lc ocnd than the other lmw model compounds within a similar mw range for example within model compounds of mw of 0 200 da glucosamine and the amino acid tryptophan had the lowest don recoveries of 76 and 75 respectively while aliphatic model compounds in this mw range exhibited recoveries greater than 89 si table s2 3 it was also evident that lower recovery was observed for doc by lc ocnd for model compounds containing heterocyclic aromatic structures si table s2 3 it has been previously suggested that the recovery of don by lc ocnd is negatively affected by n atoms position and number in n heterocyclic compounds with oxidation yields between 60 and 90 huber et al 2011b which is consistent with the lower yields observed for nicotinic acid and tryptophan which are both n heterocycles with one n atom in their ring systems 3 2 characterisation of algal organic matter 3 2 1 recoveries of bulk doc and don from analysis of aom the concentrations of total doc and don in the aom were consistently lower when measured using the lc ocnd compared to the toc tn analyser fig 6 this did not change throughout the growth phases of the species and the results were similar to those obtained for hmw model compounds using lc ocnd fig 4 this was expected because a large proportion of hmw material is typically present in the aom henderson et al 2010 pivokonsky et al 2016 rao et al 2018 between the two species lower recoveries of doc and don were observed in aom of m aeruginosa compared to the aom from c vulgaris this suggests that m aeruginosa has more hmw or heterocyclic aromatic constituents than c vulgaris which is consistent with the findings of henderson et al 2008 who reported that m aeruginosa comprised higher molecular weight doc than c vulgaris 3 2 2 ratio of doc to don in bulk aom for each species the doc don ratio in bulk aom days 5 35 was compared using analysis by the toc tn analyser and tn din method and analysis by lc ocnd fig 7 all algal doc don ratios followed a linear relationship with algal age regardless of the measurement method however the gradient of trend lines for the algal doc don ratios obtained by lc ocnd were always greater than those obtained by the toc tn din methods moreover the doc and don concentrations measured by lc ocnd was consistently smaller than those measured by toc tn din method regardless of species or growth phase higher variability as measured by rsd was observed for don measurements of both species when measured by tn din method particularly for aom samples from the early growth phase day 5 15 figs 6b and 7a b for example the mean rsd for all c vulgaris aom samples days 5 35 was 44 by the tn din method compared to 6 by the lc ocnd method the mean rsd for all m aeruginosa aom samples was 70 by the tn din method compared to 12 by the lc ocnd method for m aeruginosa this high variability in the early growth stages was possibly caused by the high concentrations of nitrate from growth media si table s2 1 resulting in relatively small difference between tn and din and possibly higher error and the cumulation of errors within the multiple analytical steps of the tn din method lee and westerhoff 2005 this was further supported by the fact that higher nitrate concentrations in mla medium resulted in higher rsds for don measurements for m aeruginosa cultured in mla than that of c vulgaris cultured in jaworski in summary lc ocnd resulted in lower recoveries for both doc and don than the toc tn din analysis for aom samples but had better precision for don measurements when tn samples contained a high proportion of din the increasing difference in don and don recovery between the toc tn din and lc ocnd methods for aom and model compounds suggests that the proportion of hmw or heterocyclic aromatic structures in aom increased with culture age particularly for m aeruginosa 3 2 3 fractionation of algal organic matter by lc ocnd size fractionation using lc ocnd showed that the aom in both species comprised three major fractions 1 biopolymers 2 building blocks and 3 lmw acids and neutrals fig 8 as operationally defined by huber et al 2011b for size fractions in freshwater samples additionally m aeruginosa aom had a peak at a similar retention time to humic acid model compound 9 the biopolymer and building blocks fractions were observed to mainly be hmw 1 kda when directly comparing them to the retention time of the model compounds additionally the associated uvd signal for these fractions indicated that the hmw fractions present in aom of both cultures could comprise a large proportion of double bonded or aromatic c and n huber et al 2011b it was also noted that the retention time of the biopolymer fraction of the aom of m aeruginosa 29 5 min c and n was shorter than that of c vulgaris 31 5 min c and n thereby suggesting that aom of m aeruginosa comprised a larger proportion of hmw material than that of c vulgaris using the calibration curve equation m w 11 258 e 0 027 t r fig 4 the average mw of the biopolymers was estimated as 119 kda for m aeruginosa and 64 kda for c vulgaris the hmw fractions both biopolymer and building blocks contributed to 86 and 62 of doc and 94 and 91 of don in the aom from c vulgaris and m aeruginosa respectively table 3 assuming the ratio of 3 1 for the proteinaceous c to n in the algal biopolymer fraction the percentage of proteins present in the biopolymer fraction of the aom was calculated using doc don ratios huber et al 2011b this showed that c vulgaris aom had lower protein content in the biopolymer fraction 4 4 than m aeruginosa aom 35 further characterisation of a suite of algae and cyanobacteria using this technique is required to ensure robustness of the technique 4 discussion 4 1 quantification of nitrogen sources using lc ocnd the lods for bulk don measurement for either lc ocnd or the tn din method table 2 were an order of magnitude lower than the average don concentrations 0 16 0 19 mg n l 1 previously found in drinking water treatment plant influents dotson et al 2008 lee et al 2006 or in source waters impaired by algal blooms 0 29 0 37 mg n l 1 dotson and westerhoff 2009 mitch et al 2009 westerhoff and mash 2002 additionally lc ocnd produced lod values that were similar for the fractions of don and doc table 2 analysis of n precision for all three instruments e g lc ocnd toc tn analyser and fia showed similar results figs 1 and 2 however as the tn and din measurements for the tn din method were separately assessed using the toc tn analyser and fia a larger uncertainty would be expected for don calculated using this method due to the accumulative errors and the interference from din content lee and westerhoff 2005 this is illustrated by the much higher rsd observed for the algal don determinations at early growth stages containing a higher nitrate content using this method in comparison to the lc ocnd method figs 6b and 7a b this suggests lc ocnd has a particular advantage for determining don due to its ability to separate din and therefore analyse don and din components independently furthermore there was very good agreement between the lc ocnd and fia methods for nitrate analysis fig 2 hence employing lc ocnd instead of fia for quantification of nitrate in aom samples is appropriate this means that the complex preparation of reagents which have a short shelf life 24 h required by fia method si section s1 1 2 can be avoided previously it has been reported that other din species such as ammonia can be separated chromatographically from the nitrate peak using lc ocnd huber et al 2011a however the chromatographic separation of individual din species except for nitrates was not examined in this study due to the reasons outlined previously 4 2 lower recovery of don and doc using lc ocnd this study confirmed that the lc ocnd system which uses uv oxidation for both c and n detection had lower recoveries for doc and don than the toc tn analyser which uses high temperature oxidation for example measurements of doc and don for aom extracted from m aeruginosa using lc ocnd were about 30 and 50 lower respectively than those from the tn din method this difference may be caused by the lower oxidation efficiency of uv oxidation in the granztel reactor in the lc ocnd system for hmw doc or the donox reactor for hmw don which has been reported to produce dissolved n concentrations that are 5 40 lower than wet chemical and high temperature oxidation methods bronk et al 2000 when the molecular size increased both model compounds and aom had lower recoveries from uv oxidation for example m aeruginosa had lower recoveries of both doc and don than c vulgaris fig 5a and b and this may also be caused by the greater size distribution in aom for m aeruginosa than c vulgaris fig 8 lankes et al 2009 the underestimation of don and doc contents can also depend on chemical structures which typically affect uv oxidation efficiency more than other oxidation methods her et al 2002 lankes et al 2009 for example the presence of complex aromatic compounds can also reduce the oxidation efficiency of uv oxidation her et al 2002 ring structures like triazine present in nom and chitosan molecules rinaudo 2006 sillanp√§√§ et al 2015 may also significantly reduce the don recovery due to their particular stability against uv oxidation huber et al 2011b lankes et al 2009 reported that polysaccharides present in the nom compounds impacted detection for doc only and similar to doc the recovery of don in polysaccharide model compounds chitosan in this study was found to be lower when analysed using lc ocnd fig 4 4 3 benefits of applying lc ocnd analysis analysis using lc ocnd was found to be a valuable approach for a the fractionation of don based on size and mw distribution in aom and similar water samples fig 8 b estimating the protein content as c in the biopolymer or the total doc using quantitative ratios between biopolymer don and doc table 3 huber et al 2011b and c providing a fast and robust method for determination of din sources such as nitrate fig 2 and potentially nitrite and ammonia huber et al 2011a although the lc ocnd system resulted in low recoveries for don and doc in aom samples likely due to low uv oxidation efficiency this study suggests that by combining the lc ocnd chromatograms and toc tn analyser data a good estimation of the bulk doc and don concentrations in aom samples could be provided in addition aom samples that were fractionated by mw through the lc ocnd could be analysed to provide valuable information on the doc or don concentrations of the respective fractions 5 conclusions quantitative characterisation of doc and don in model compounds and aom samples was conducted using lc ocnd and toc analysis and lc ocnd and tn din respectively the evaluation of both methods for characterising aom is summarised below lc ocnd can provide a direct quantitative measurement for both bulk and fractionated don and din with little interference caused by din content in the sample for instance larger variability as measured by rsd was observed for tn din method when used for aom samples containing significant nitrate content in contrast the lc ocnd had better precision for don when tn contained more din in the form of nitrate lc ocnd was able to provide information on mw distribution and protein content of aom it showed that both algal species predominately comprised hmw aom and that m aeruginosa aom contained a higher proportion of hmw than c vulgaris aom both lc ocnd and the tn din methods had limitations for the characterisation of bulk n while the lc ocnd was able to provide information on the character of don the uv oxidation technique used by the lc ocnd had 75 efficiency for hmw compounds the tn din method although efficient in oxidising hmw compounds did not provide any information on the character of don it is suggested that the combination of lc ocnd and off line toc tn analysis could be applied simultaneously for characterisation of aom and other similar hmw aquatic nom samples

18527,algal derived organic matter aom from algal blooms in water supply systems contains dissolved organic nitrogen don and dissolved organic carbon doc among other constituents the don and doc are disinfection by product dbp precursor compounds and must be well characterised to facilitate effective removal thus minimising dbp formation during disinfection while doc character has been studied extensively don analysis suffers from inaccuracies due to sample pre treatment and instrument sensitivities a liquid chromatography method that combines size exclusion chromatography with highly sensitive organic carbon and nitrogen detectors lc ocnd has been widely adopted for doc analysis however its potential for application for don charactersation has been suggested as a viable alternative to existing don characterisation techniquesnot been assessed despite its potential hence the aim was to compare the effectiveness of conventional total dissolved n dissolved inorganic n tn din and lc ocnd methods for analysing don in aom a suite of n containing model compounds representative of don and aom extracted from chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 and microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 1 were used to evaluate the techniques the don of both model compounds and aom was first analysed using the conventional method and then via lc ocnd it was observed that lc ocnd had a better precision for don when tn contained more din lc ocnd provided direct quantitative measurements for bulk and fractionated don and din with little interference caused by din additionally lc ocnd provided information on mw distribution and protein content of the aom for example lc ocnd results showed that m aeruginosa aom contained more hmw material than c vulgaris aom however as lc ocnd uses uv oxidation it could not completely oxidise complex aromatic structures and thus had a lower recovery for hmw model compounds and algal don in comparison to the conventional method that used high temperature catalytic oxidation overall it is advised that a combination of lc ocnd and tn analysis be used to provide a more detailed characterisation of n containing aom and other similar hmw aquatic nom samples graphical abstract image 1 keywords algae cyanobacteria flow injection analysis lc ocd limit of detection 1 introduction algae are rich in organic n and surface waters impaired by algal extracellular and intracellular organic matter eom and iom normally have higher concentrations of dissolved organic nitrogen don and lower ratios of dissolved organic carbon doc don than non impacted waters dotson and westerhoff 2009 lee et al 2006 mitch et al 2009 westerhoff and mash 2002 as eom and iom contain higher don composition relative to other sources it is a significant precursor for nitrogenous disinfection by products n dbps krasner et al 2007 shah and mitch 2012 during algal blooms and subsequent water treatment the risk of iom being released is minimised by preventing algal cell lysis however poor removal of n dbp precursor containing eom combined with downstream disinfection could result in the formation of algal derived n dbps in the final drinking water if the character of these dissolved organic constituents are well understood treatment processes can be optimised to enhance their removal prior to disinfection resulting in the minimisation of n dbp formation bond et al 2010 typically the methods applied to determine total don concentrations are based on assessing concentrations of the total dissolved nitrogen tn after sample oxidation and then subtracting the separately measured concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din the tn din method berman and bronk 2003 bronk et al 2000 lee and westerhoff 2005 westerhoff and mash 2002 currently three oxidation methods are commonly applied to determine the total tn 1 a wet chemical method based on persulphate digestion and oxidation po to nitrate where concentration can be determined by absorbance spectroscopy valderrama 1981 or analysed colorimetrically by the spongy cadmium method jones 1984 2 high temperature oxidation to nitric oxide and detection by either spectrophotometry suzuki et al 1985 or chemiluminescence ammann et al 2000 and 3 ultraviolet uv oxidation to nitrate followed by analysis using the spongy cadmium method bronk et al 2000 jones 1984 however the accuracy of the don measurement by the tn din method is strongly dependent on the percentage of din in tn and the accuracy of the measurements for tn and individual din species a high ratio of din tn 0 6 has been found to cause greater variance in din measurements than the actual don levels lee and westerhoff 2005 also each measurement contributes to the overall analytical uncertainty u u d o n u t n 2 u n h 4 2 u n o 3 n o 2 2 1 2 berman and bronk 2003 bronk et al 2000 lee and westerhoff 2005 another major disadvantage of the tn din method is that it cannot directly provide information on don character that is necessary for n dbp characterisation for example size or mass distribution because it only measures bulk don it has been reported that the largest fraction of aom is that of high molecular weight hmw colloids which are rich in organic nitrogen leenheer et al 2007 li et al 2015 for example about 70 of don in drinking water sources impaired by algae was associated with the hmw fraction in which 14 of don was identified as polypeptides and combined amino acids while the remaining 56 of don was unidentified dotson and westerhoff 2009 guo et al 2003 organic matter characterisation can be undertaken via fractionation procedures for example according to size however the characterisation of the hmw fraction of don has not been widely investigated except for a few studies heinz et al 2015 shah and mitch 2012 further information on don character in addition to total don concentration is therefore required fractionation of don in water samples can be accomplished using liquid chromatography combined with highly sensitive organic carbon and nitrogen detection lc ocnd chon et al 2013 heinz et al 2015 huber et al 2011b the system employs a size exclusion chromatography sec column to fractionate samples followed by the detection of doc uv absorbance and don this results in the simultaneous doc and don characterisation for both the bulk sample and also the size fractionated samples huber et al 2011b this technique has been used extensively for doc characterisation of aquatic natural organic matter nom huber et al 2011b yang et al 2018 organic matter fouling in ultrafiltration henderson et al 2011 and extracellular polymeric substances eps in biofilm and membrane studies you et al 2018 yue et al 2015 among others one study compared the protein content of the biopolymer fraction of eps measured by the bradford assay and lc ocnd and suggested that lc ocnd was a viable tool for the quantification of doc and mw distribution stewart et al 2013 however lc ocnd studies have focused predominantly on doc character with minimal attention to the character of don it is still unclear whether lc ocnd is a robust technique for quantifying and characterising bulk or fractionated don when compared to quantifying don by tn din method hence the main aim of this study is to compare techniques to measure the concentrations of both bulk and fractionated don using the conventional tn din and the commonly applied lc ocnd method doc labor germany as described in detail in huber et al 2011b the measurements of doc don and din from a model compounds from biopolymers to lmw compounds and b eom hereafter referred to as aom of a green algal and a cyanobacterial species that had very different aom character in terms of total oc and on pivokonsky et al 2016 rao et al 2018 were compared using all methods the merits and limitations of these methods were evaluated rigorously using a protocol that incorporated analysis of specificity or selectivity linearity of calibration limits of detection and quantification lod and loq recovery repeatability trueness and proof of applicability lindner and wainer 1996 overall a comprehensive characterisation protocol for don analysis in n rich for example algal impacted water samples is established 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials 2 1 1 quantitative calibration

model compounds was chosen as representative of don present in surface waters table 1 these model compounds represent typical proteinaceous n containing organics including amino acids amino sugars proteins polypeptides hmw substances polysaccharides and molecules exhibiting a range of heterocyclic or aromatic structures samples of reference nom standard humic acids and standard fulvic acids were purchased from the international humic substances society ihss usa all other model compounds were purchased at analytical grade standard 99 purity from sigma aldrich australia except for nicotinic acid scharlau chemie south australia additionally polyethylene glycol peg standards poly standard service germany were used for calibration of the mw distribution through the sec column the c and n composition of each model compound table 1 was calculated theoretically for model compounds with mw 500 da e g vitamins amino acids amino sugars and peptides chemical compositions were calculated from their known molecular formulae for humic substances and chitosan the chemical compositions were provided by the suppliers for proteins bovine serum albumin bsa and phycocyanin the chemical compositions were calculated using the protein identification and analysis tools of online protparam database gasteiger et al 2005 based on the protein sequences obtained from the molecular modelling database mmdb in national center for biotechnology information ncbi finally for Œ≥ globulins the relative information was estimated from the amino acid compositions and the protein sequences of human igg kappa v i which were retrieved from the collection of protein sequences and their annotations of online uniport database the uniprot 2015 stock solutions of model compounds 1000 mg l 1 were prepared using ultrapure water and stored in sealed glass bottles in the dark at 4 c they were diluted into a series of working solutions 1 0 2 5 5 0 and 10 0 mg l 1 immediately prior to analysis using the phosphate buffer to minimise any potential interference from the lc ocnd mobile phase as model compounds contain no inorganic n don was calculated from tn analysis only 2 1 3 algae cultivation axenic cultures of green algae chlorella vulgaris cs 42 7 and cyanobacteria microcystis aeruginosa cs 555 01 were obtained from the australia national algae culture collection csiro hobart tasmania and subcultured in 250 ml flasks containing 100 ml each of sterilised jaworski medium henderson et al 2008 and mla medium bolch and blackburn 1996 respectively table s2 1 these two species were selected due to their different doc concentrations in aom and distinguishable size distributions from lmw to hmw range henderson et al 2008 the cultures were grown from day 0 until day 35 as this ensured that aom could be extracted during specific growth stages such as the exponential phase stationary phase and late stationary phase to produce a range of aom compositions for comparison between the different methods applied algae were cultured under illumination of 600 60 Œºmol m 2 s 1 with a light dark cycle of 16 h 8 h in an incubator labec plant growth chamber australia at 21 c cell counts were determined using a light microscope leica icc 50 germany and haemocytometer or sedgewick rafter chambers 2 1 4 extraction of organic matter from the cultures the aom was extracted from the cultures based on a procedure reported previously henderson et al 2008 briefly cells were separated from aom by centrifugation twice at 10 000 g for 15 min with an allegra x 15r centrifuge beckman coulter australia the supernatants from the centrifuge cycles were filtered prior to analysis extracts of aom no cells were collected from the cultures every five days from days 0 35 2 2 analytical methods for model compounds the recoveries of bulk n and c obtained by bulk toc tn analysis as well as the lc ocnd method were compared to the theoretical values table 1 this procedure allowed the assessment of the instrumental performance when analysing model compounds comprising different sizes structures and other properties afterwards the same assessment was applied when characterising unknown aom samples 2 2 1 determination of c and n using conventional doc tn din methods 2 2 1 1 determination of bulk doc and tn using high temperature oxidation determination of bulk doc and tn

carbon decomposed to co2 at 680 c total n was simultaneously decomposed to nitrogen monoxide no at 720 c please see s1 1 1 and s1 2 1 in the supporting information si for full details 2 3 determination of bulk inorganic n using colorimetric analysis the concentrations of dissolved inorganic nitrogen din nitrite no2 nitrate no3 and ammonia nh4 in aom samples were measured via flow injection analysis fia lachat quickchem 8500 usa the din measured by this method was then subtracted from the tn measured through high temperature oxidation to evaluate the bulk don in the samples full details available in s1 1 2 and s1 2 2 in si 2 3 1 determination of bulk and fractionated doc and don using size exclusion chromatography with c and n detection an lc ocnd system model 8 doc labor germany was used to characterise aom samples huber et al 2011b specht et al 2000 the separation principle is based on size exclusion chromatography sec using a toyopearl tsk hw 50s column 250 mm

the bypass signals for doc don and uvdabs254 aromatic and unsaturated structures a dilution factor of 10 was applied to samples with high doc values such that the resultant docs were 5 mg c l 1 to ensure accuracy of the technique huber et al 2011b please see s1 1 3 and s1 2 3 in si for full details 2 4 method validation 2 4 1 estimation of the limits of detection and quantification in this study lod and loq were determined using 10 replicate analyses of ultrapure water as the mean concentration of the blank a plus three or ten times of standard deviation s respectively equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 lod a 3 s 2 loq a 10 s this approach has the disadvantage that there is a lack of objective evidence to prove whether an analyte will indeed produce a signal distinguishable from a blank sample at this low concentration u s federal register 2000 hence an additional approach that uses linear regression was also applied as a comparison a linear calibration curve using appropriate calibration standards in the range of 0 1 10 mg l 1 for toc and 0 01 1 0 mg l 1 for tn as measured using the toc tn analyser lc ocnd and fia respectively the instrument response y fitted a linear regression model with concentration x as described in eq 3 3 y Œ±x b this is used to compute the sensitivity Œ± and the lod and loq which can be expressed as shown in equations 4 and 5 4 lod 3 s Œ± 5 loq 10 s Œ± where s yx is estimated by the standard deviation of y residuals of the linear regression and Œ± is the slope of the calibration curve this method has the advantage that there is little interference from background noise shrivastava and gupta 2011 2 4 2 determination of recovery and precision the recovery and precision of n measurements from each instrument toc tn analyser lc ocnd and fia were determined and compared potassium nitrate wako japan and nicotinic acid was selected as inorganic n and organic n standards for both the toc tn analyser and lc ocnd while the fia was tested using potassium nitrate ammonium chloride and aqueous potassium nitrite the concentrations 0 1 0 5 1 and 2 mg l 1 of the standard solutions used were prepared by serial dilution and each standard was measured in at least triplicate the measurements ten assays of different standards at various concentrations were then conducted for the total recovery determination of each instrument the results obtained for each standard were used to calculate the n recovery eq 6 using the average concentration measured for each standard c i and theoretical concentration of n for the model compound c s t d i the recovery for each different concentration standard was then averaged to represent the trueness of the method the precision was calculated as the standard deviation of calculated recoveries of all standards and described as a relative standard deviation rsd eq 7 as the standards were measured over a period of 2 years the precision represents the long term repeatability of each instrument 6 r e c o v e r y i c i c s t d i 100 c s t d i 7 r s d s 100 c i 2 4 3 calibration of size exclusion column using peg standards and model compounds in this study humic acid ha and fulvic acid fa standards 2 mg c l 1 peg standards with mw of 0 194 0 434 1 02 2 01 6 55 and 12 2 kda and the model compounds with a broad range of mw table 1 were used for the calibration of the size exclusion column based on a similar method of calibration reported by allpike et al 2005 3 results 3 1 assessment of methods 3 1 1 linearity limits of detection and quantification for all methods all the instruments demonstrated a good linearity of r2 0 998 for calibration standards prepared at different concentration ranges with no significant change in linearity when the standards were prepared using either ultrapure water or phosphate buffer si figure s2 1a c the lod and loq values determined using replicate analysis of a blank sample were compared to those estimated by the linear regression method table 2 both methods produced similar values for lods and loqs although the method using replicates of the blank was significantly influenced by low concentrations of doc loq 0 152 mg c l 1 lod 0 070 mg c l 1 present in the ultrapure laboratory water table 2 additionally the lod and loq values for bulk don analysis were comparable for both the tn din loq 0 043 mg n l 1 lod 0 015 mg n l 1 and the lc ocnd loq 0 037 mg n l 1 lod 0 018 mg n l 1 methods for replicate measurements of the blank additionally calculation of lod and loq values for don in individual aom size fractions biopolymer building blocks and lmw fractions produced similar values 3 1 2 comparison of recovery and precision among instruments the average recovery of various n standards nitrate and nicotinic acid as tn standards for tn and lc ond analysis nitrate nitrite and ammonia as din standards for fia using different instruments and measured over two years is presented in fig 1 a good agreement of 1 2 rsd 95 confidence interval was observed for all instruments and n species this suggests that none of the methods have an inherent bias i e low or high recovery comparison of long term precision showed that the toc tn analyser had the largest variability in recovery 2 4 rsd with the precision of the other instruments ranging between 1 5 and 1 7 rsd however overall all instruments had excellent long term precision the long term repeatability of the instruments was tested using the growth media for the algal and cyanobacterial cultures nitrate was always the major din source in both media 93 2 in the jaworski medium and 98 7 in the mla medium si table s2 1 and aom during the exponential phase day 0 9 before nitrate was fully assimilated during the stationary phase day 10 fig 2 therefore comparison of nitrite and ammonia measurements by lc ocnd and fia was not employed in this study due to their negligible content comparable concentrations of no3 were determined by the two methods fig 2 for example the precision of nitrate measurements from mla media and aom of m aeruginosa on days 5 and 10 were 1 7 8 5 and 13 rsd via lc ocnd and 1 5 9 1 and 13 rsd via fia respectively this revealed good reproducibility for nitrate measurements between the two methods suggesting lc ocnd and fia had the same precision level for nitrate characterisation in this study 3 1 3 calibration of the apparent molecular weight distribution in lc ocnd when considering the relationships between tr min and log mw of all model compounds and peg standards two linear trend lines were observed fig 3 firstly a linear relationship between tr min and log mw had the best fit r2 0 997 dashed line in fig 3 when only the peg standards were considered this excellent linearity for peg was consistent with previous reports her et al 2004 huber et al 2011b stewart et al 2013 similarly a linear relationship was observed when analysing the model compounds r2 0 879 solid line in fig 3 and this was also consistent with previous studies allpike et al 2005 2007 stewart et al 2013 however model compounds including tryptophan and glucosamine 5 6 in fig 3 respectively were found to have longer retention times than others within a similar mw range this was particularly apparent for tryptophan 5 which had the longest retention time of 112 min further statistical analysis demonstrated that tryptophan s retention time was an outlier among all the model compounds including glucosamine glucosamine s tr of 71 min was well within statistical uncertainty according to si table s2 2 and is believed to be caused by hydrophobic interactions of tryptophan with the sec column resin due to its non polar indole side chain her et al 2002 huber et al 2011b furthermore the outlying effect of tryptophan could also be a consequence of its hydrodynamic size it is well known that compounds with linear structures have a larger hydrodynamic size when compared to ring branched and coiled structures of similar mw belenkii and vilenchik 1983 this therefore may explain why a model compounds with ring structures 5 6 1 had a higher retention time when compared to model compounds 2 3 4 and 7 fig 3 that had linear structures and b coiled and branched compounds 13 14 did not elute close to the void volume even though their mw was outside the range of column overall a good fit of the trendlines r2 approximately 0 9 for peg standards and model compounds in lc ocnd indicated a steady increase in the retention time with a decrease in the mw thereby demonstrating that this would benefit size fractionation of algal don 3 1 4 influence of molecular weight and molecular structures on doc and don recovery in lc ocnd and high temperature oxidation methods the recoveries of doc and don depended on molecular weight when characterised using either lc ocnd or the high temperature oxidation methods of analysis figs 4 and si table s2 3 while lmw 1 kda model compounds typically had equivalent doc and don recovery for both analytical methods significantly lower recoveries for both doc and don were observed when using the lc ocnd for higher mw compounds slightly lower don recovery for higher mw compounds was also observed when using the bulk high temperature oxidation method fig 4 b but doc analysed by the high temperature oxidation method maintained recovery values of close to 100 irrespective of mw fig 4a when the mw was larger than 10 kda recoveries of most model compounds were less than 60 when measured by lc ocnd for example while doc and don recovery of bsa mw 66 kda by the high temperature oxidation methods were still around 100 that obtained using the lc ocnd was only 27 4 and 60 2 for doc and don respectively si table s2 3 for the chitosan standards with mw 100 kda the recoveries of doc and don using lc ocnd were 10 this indicated that mw was a greater influence on recovery for lc ocnd analysis than bulk toc or tn analysis similar observations to those made fig 4a and b have been made previously when analysing the oc of aquatic nom using the lc ocd and have been attributed to the differing oxidation efficiencies arising from different methods of analysis i e uv oxidation and high temperature combustion lankes et al 2009 the variable doc and don recoveries on the measured doc don ratio was also compared to the theoretically calculated ratios fig 5 for all model compounds measured by the high temperature oxidation method the measured doc don ratios were consistently higher than the theoretical ratios by 10 13 this small change was possibly due to the slightly lower don recovery when applying the high temperature oxidation method fig 4b however for lc ocnd analysis the measured doc don ratios deviated more significantly from theoretical values in either positive or negative directions as mw increased fig 5 specifically the measured doc don ratios from the amino sugar humic substances and the polysaccharide compounds 8 10 and 14 had an increasingly positive deviation while a negative deviation was observed for amino acids and proteins compounds 2 5 minor and 11 13 since the decrease in doc recovery with mw by lc ocnd was more pronounced than the decrease in don recovery fig 4a and b the particularly negative change in doc don ratios was attributed to the proportionally lower recovery of doc for amino acids and protein type model compounds hence the oxidation efficiency of hmw doc for the lc ocnd method is not only due to mw but can also be attributed to the chemical categories of the model compounds lmw model aliphatic compounds were found to have a higher recovery of don by lc ocnd than the other lmw model compounds within a similar mw range for example within model compounds of mw of 0 200 da glucosamine and the amino acid tryptophan had the lowest don recoveries of 76 and 75 respectively while aliphatic model compounds in this mw range exhibited recoveries greater than 89 si table s2 3 it was also evident that lower recovery was observed for doc by lc ocnd for model compounds containing heterocyclic aromatic structures si table s2 3 it has been previously suggested that the recovery of don by lc ocnd is negatively affected by n atoms position and number in n heterocyclic compounds with oxidation yields between 60 and 90 huber et al 2011b which is consistent with the lower yields observed for nicotinic acid and tryptophan which are both n heterocycles with one n atom in their ring systems 3 2 characterisation of algal organic matter 3 2 1 recoveries of bulk doc and don from analysis of aom the concentrations of total doc and don in the aom were consistently lower when measured using the lc ocnd compared to the toc tn analyser fig 6 this did not change throughout the growth phases of the species and the results were similar to those obtained for hmw model compounds using lc ocnd fig 4 this was expected because a large proportion of hmw material is typically present in the aom henderson et al 2010 pivokonsky et al 2016 rao et al 2018 between the two species lower recoveries of doc and don were observed in aom of m aeruginosa compared to the aom from c vulgaris this suggests that m aeruginosa has more hmw or heterocyclic aromatic constituents than c vulgaris which is consistent with the findings of henderson et al 2008 who reported that m aeruginosa comprised higher molecular weight doc than c vulgaris 3 2 2 ratio of doc to don in bulk aom for each species the doc don ratio in bulk aom days 5 35 was compared using analysis by the toc tn analyser and tn din method and analysis by lc ocnd fig 7 all algal doc don ratios followed a linear relationship with algal age regardless of the measurement method however the gradient of trend lines for the algal doc don ratios obtained by lc ocnd were always greater than those obtained by the toc tn din methods moreover the doc and don concentrations measured by lc ocnd was consistently smaller than those measured by toc tn din method regardless of species or growth phase higher variability as measured by rsd was observed for don measurements of both species when measured by tn din method particularly for aom samples from the early growth phase day 5 15 figs 6b and 7a b for example the mean rsd for all c vulgaris aom samples days 5 35 was 44 by the tn din method compared to 6 by the lc ocnd method the mean rsd for all m aeruginosa aom samples was 70 by the tn din method compared to 12 by the lc ocnd method for m aeruginosa this high variability in the early growth stages was possibly caused by the high concentrations of nitrate from growth media si table s2 1 resulting in relatively small difference between tn and din and possibly higher error and the cumulation of errors within the multiple analytical steps of the tn din method lee and westerhoff 2005 this was further supported by the fact that higher nitrate concentrations in mla medium resulted in higher rsds for don measurements for m aeruginosa cultured in mla than that of c vulgaris cultured in jaworski in summary lc ocnd resulted in lower recoveries for both doc and don than the toc tn din analysis for aom samples but had better precision for don measurements when tn samples contained a high proportion of din the increasing difference in don and don recovery between the toc tn din and lc ocnd methods for aom and model compounds suggests that the proportion of hmw or heterocyclic aromatic structures in aom increased with culture age particularly for m aeruginosa 3 2 3 fractionation of algal organic matter by lc ocnd size fractionation using lc ocnd showed that the aom in both species comprised three major fractions 1 biopolymers 2 building blocks and 3 lmw acids and neutrals fig 8 as operationally defined by huber et al 2011b for size fractions in freshwater samples additionally m aeruginosa aom had a peak at a similar retention time to humic acid model compound 9 the biopolymer and building blocks fractions were observed to mainly be hmw 1 kda when directly comparing them to the retention time of the model compounds additionally the associated uvd signal for these fractions indicated that the hmw fractions present in aom of both cultures could comprise a large proportion of double bonded or aromatic c and n huber et al 2011b it was also noted that the retention time of the biopolymer fraction of the aom of m aeruginosa 29 5 min c and n was shorter than that of c vulgaris 31 5 min c and n thereby suggesting that aom of m aeruginosa comprised a larger proportion of hmw material than that of c vulgaris using the calibration curve equation m w 11 258 e 0 027 t r fig 4 the average mw of the biopolymers was estimated as 119 kda for m aeruginosa and 64 kda for c vulgaris the hmw fractions both biopolymer and building blocks contributed to 86 and 62 of doc and 94 and 91 of don in the aom from c vulgaris and m aeruginosa respectively table 3 assuming the ratio of 3 1 for the proteinaceous c to n in the algal biopolymer fraction the percentage of proteins present in the biopolymer fraction of the aom was calculated using doc don ratios huber et al 2011b this showed that c vulgaris aom had lower protein content in the biopolymer fraction 4 4 than m aeruginosa aom 35 further characterisation of a suite of algae and cyanobacteria using this technique is required to ensure robustness of the technique 4 discussion 4 1 quantification of nitrogen sources using lc ocnd the lods for bulk don measurement for either lc ocnd or the tn din method table 2 were an order of magnitude lower than the average don concentrations 0 16 0 19 mg n l 1 previously found in drinking water treatment plant influents dotson et al 2008 lee et al 2006 or in source waters impaired by algal blooms 0 29 0 37 mg n l 1 dotson and westerhoff 2009 mitch et al 2009 westerhoff and mash 2002 additionally lc ocnd produced lod values that were similar for the fractions of don and doc table 2 analysis of n precision for all three instruments e g lc ocnd toc tn analyser and fia showed similar results figs 1 and 2 however as the tn and din measurements for the tn din method were separately assessed using the toc tn analyser and fia a larger uncertainty would be expected for don calculated using this method due to the accumulative errors and the interference from din content lee and westerhoff 2005 this is illustrated by the much higher rsd observed for the algal don determinations at early growth stages containing a higher nitrate content using this method in comparison to the lc ocnd method figs 6b and 7a b this suggests lc ocnd has a particular advantage for determining don due to its ability to separate din and therefore analyse don and din components independently furthermore there was very good agreement between the lc ocnd and fia methods for nitrate analysis fig 2 hence employing lc ocnd instead of fia for quantification of nitrate in aom samples is appropriate this means that the complex preparation of reagents which have a short shelf life 24 h required by fia method si section s1 1 2 can be avoided previously it has been reported that other din species such as ammonia can be separated chromatographically from the nitrate peak using lc ocnd huber et al 2011a however the chromatographic separation of individual din species except for nitrates was not examined in this study due to the reasons outlined previously 4 2 lower recovery of don and doc using lc ocnd this study confirmed that the lc ocnd system which uses uv oxidation for both c and n detection had lower recoveries for doc and don than the toc tn analyser which uses high temperature oxidation for example measurements of doc and don for aom extracted from m aeruginosa using lc ocnd were about 30 and 50 lower respectively than those from the tn din method this difference may be caused by the lower oxidation efficiency of uv oxidation in the granztel reactor in the lc ocnd system for hmw doc or the donox reactor for hmw don which has been reported to produce dissolved n concentrations that are 5 40 lower than wet chemical and high temperature oxidation methods bronk et al 2000 when the molecular size increased both model compounds and aom had lower recoveries from uv oxidation for example m aeruginosa had lower recoveries of both doc and don than c vulgaris fig 5a and b and this may also be caused by the greater size distribution in aom for m aeruginosa than c vulgaris fig 8 lankes et al 2009 the underestimation of don and doc contents can also depend on chemical structures which typically affect uv oxidation efficiency more than other oxidation methods her et al 2002 lankes et al 2009 for example the presence of complex aromatic compounds can also reduce the oxidation efficiency of uv oxidation her et al 2002 ring structures like triazine present in nom and chitosan molecules rinaudo 2006 sillanp√§√§ et al 2015 may also significantly reduce the don recovery due to their particular stability against uv oxidation huber et al 2011b lankes et al 2009 reported that polysaccharides present in the nom compounds impacted detection for doc only and similar to doc the recovery of don in polysaccharide model compounds chitosan in this study was found to be lower when analysed using lc ocnd fig 4 4 3 benefits of applying lc ocnd analysis analysis using lc ocnd was found to be a valuable approach for a the fractionation of don based on size and mw distribution in aom and similar water samples fig 8 b estimating the protein content as c in the biopolymer or the total doc using quantitative ratios between biopolymer don and doc table 3 huber et al 2011b and c providing a fast and robust method for determination of din sources such as nitrate fig 2 and potentially nitrite and ammonia huber et al 2011a although the lc ocnd system resulted in low recoveries for don and doc in aom samples likely due to low uv oxidation efficiency this study suggests that by combining the lc ocnd chromatograms and toc tn analyser data a good estimation of the bulk doc and don concentrations in aom samples could be provided in addition aom samples that were fractionated by mw through the lc ocnd could be analysed to provide valuable information on the doc or don concentrations of the respective fractions 5 conclusions quantitative characterisation of doc and don in model compounds and aom samples was conducted using lc ocnd and toc analysis and lc ocnd and tn din respectively the evaluation of both methods for characterising aom is summarised below lc ocnd can provide a direct quantitative measurement for both bulk and fractionated don and din with little interference caused by din content in the sample for instance larger variability as measured by rsd was observed for tn din method when used for aom samples containing significant nitrate content in contrast the lc ocnd had better precision for don when tn contained more din in the form of nitrate lc ocnd was able to provide information on mw distribution and protein content of aom it showed that both algal species predominately comprised hmw aom and that m aeruginosa aom contained a higher proportion of hmw than c vulgaris aom both lc ocnd and the tn din methods had limitations for the characterisation of bulk n while the lc ocnd was able to provide information on the character of don the uv oxidation technique used by the lc ocnd had 75 efficiency for hmw compounds the tn din method although efficient in oxidising hmw compounds did not provide any information on the character of don it is suggested that the combination of lc ocnd and off line toc tn analysis could be applied simultaneously for characterisation of aom and other similar hmw aquatic nom samples

18528,purine and pyrimidines are present an important pool of dissolved organic nitrogen in aqueous medias and also precursors of disinfection byproducts the degradation kinetics of cytosine and adenine model pyrimidine and purine compounds were investigated along with their transformation pathways leading to the formation of disinfection byproducts during two typical multi barrier disinfection processes uv irradiation and uv chlorine pretreatment followed by post chlorination uv irradiation followed by post chlorination enhanced the degradation of cytosine and adenine by 17 1 and 26 1 respectively but it also generated more byproduct precursors compared to chlorination alone the presence of reactive species in the uv chlorine treatment greatly enhanced cytosine and adenine degradation by 61 8 and 123 0 but generated even more disinfection byproducts compared to 24 h chlorination the concentrations of byproducts increased by up to 361 6 for cytosine and 85 1 for adenine with longer uv chlorine treatment from 2 to 30 min thirty minutes of combined uv chlorine treatment decreased the total organic chlorine produced from cytosine by 34 4 from 233 8 to 153 3 Œºg cl l 1 but it increased byproduct generation by 68 3 compared with 24 h of simple chlorination the tocl from adenine increased by 50 0 from 9 2 to 18 4 Œºg cl l 1 but byproduct generation was 11 0 less after 30 min of uv chlorine pretreatment followed by 24 h of chlorination the intermediates generated were analyzed in detail and multiple transformation pathways leading to byproduct formation are proposed graphical abstract image 1 keywords cytosine adenine uv chlorine uv irradiation disinfection byproducts water treatment 1 introduction dissolved organic nitrogen don constitutes an important portion of the dissolved organic matter typically found in natural aqueous environments don can affect the performance of water treatment processes and wastewater reuse causing membrane fouling and generating toxic disinfection byproducts dbps young and uden 1994 besides amino acids and amines heterocyclic organic nitrogenous compounds such as purine and pyrimidines are also an important pool of don the concentration of pyrimidines and purines ranges from 20 to 860 Œºg l 1 in wastewater effluent and they are found at microgram per liter concentrations in river water groundwater and even drinking water supplies ram and morris 1980 purine and pyrimidines have been investigated as precursors of dbps during chlorination young and uden 1994 zhang et al 2017 both can react with chlorine to generate

hans halonitromethanes hnms and cyanogen chloride cncl the formation of haloacetamides hacams has not however been observed young and uden 1994 shang et al 2000 li and blatchley 2007 zhang has reported zhang et al 2017 that the total dbp yields produced from cytosine thymine uracil adenine and guanine over 24 h ranges from 118 to 483 Œºg mmol 1 of the precursor at a chlorine to precursor ratio of 10 1 at ph 7 pyrimidine bases generate more dbps than do purine bases cytosine generates the highest n dbp levels including hans and hnms in chlorination zhang et al 2017 the transformation of pyrimidines and purines during chlorination depends on the ph and the chlorine to precursor ratio products with multiple chlorine adducts on heterocyclic rings or on aliphatic amines have been observed during the chlorination of adenine and cytosine zhang et al 2017 further chlorination leads to ring cleavage and dbp generation in water treatment uv irradiation is often used together with chlorination uv irradiation followed by chlorination is the normal practice in drinking water treatment where the uv irradiation is a primary disinfection to inactivate microorganisms and chlorination is used as secondary disinfection which provides residual treatment in the distribution system li and mitch 2018 simultaneous use of uv and chlorine uv chlorine has been proposed as an advanced oxidation process aop for drinking water or wastewater treatment to eliminate micropollutants and inactive microorganisms zhang and parker 2018 hydroxyl radicals ho and reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl and cl2 can be generated in such uv chlorine application nowell and hoign√© 1992 the uv chlorine aop effectively inactives chlorine resistant microorganisms such as cryptosporidium parvum oocysts zhou et al 2014 and bacillus subtilis endospores forsyth et al 2013 the process also exhibits superior performance in transforming pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and algal toxins compared to uv irradiation or chlorination alone yang et al 2016 pan et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a 2019b sequential or simultaneous use of uv with chlorine may change the dbp precursors and thus affect the subsequent formation of dbps during secondary disinfection the reactive oxidants ho and rcs preferentially attack moieties with high electron donating capacity such as those with double bonds aromatic or phenolic groups leading to degradation of the chromophores and fluorophores in dissolved organic matter wang et al 2017 the degradation of natural organic matter by uv chlorine treatment has been found to generate more haas hans and hals than chlorination alone wang et al 2017 gao et al 2019 but the mechanisms are not clear understanding the transformation pathways of representative organic nitrogen compounds is important for elucidating the mechanisms of dbp formation especially for n dbps pyrimidines and purines as important dbp precursors were explored in this study seeking to understand their fate and the transformation pathways to dbps involved previous studies have investigated the reactions of ho with pyrimidines and purines ho reacts with adenine via hydroxylation at c8 in the imidazole ring generating several products including 8 hydroxyadenine and 5 formamido 4 6 diaminopyrimidine franc√©s monerris et al 2016 ho oxidizes cytosine at the c5 c6 double bond to form monohydroxy and dihydroxy derivatives hong et al 2001 the reactions of rcs with pyrimidines and purines have not yet been evaluated but chlorine containing products may form when uv or uv with chlorine is applied ahead of post chlorination it is not clear how that may change the precursors and affect the dbp formation potential this study was therefore designed to explore the degradation kinetics of pyrimidines and purine and their transformation pathways leading to dbp formation during uv irradiation alone and with chlorine followed by post chlorination cytosine and adenine were selected as the model compounds pyrimidine and purine the formation of 25 species of halogenated carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps was studied see table s1 in the supporting information the total organic chlorine tocl was also analyzed the transformation intermediates were identified and reaction schemes and dbp formation pathways were proposed 2 materials

by a milli q purification system monochromatic uv irradiation at 253 7 nm was applied through an apparatus containing a 10w low pressure mercury lamp which delivered a quasi collimated beam the uv lamp was warmed up at least 30 min before any experimentation the incident uv flux was 0 54 mw cm 2 determined by iodide iodate chemical actinometry rahn et al 2006 2 2 experimental procedures solutions 200 ml containing 28 0 Œºm adenine or cytosine were buffered at ph 7 0 using 10 mm phosphate buffer for the uv chlorine aop tests a sealed quartz cylindrical dish 8 cm in diameter containing 200 ml of the solution to be tested was placed under the uv lamp the reactions were initiated by adding 280 Œºm free chlorine and illuminating the lamp simultaneously the samples were completely mixed by a magnetic stirrer during the reactions after a pre determined time interval 2 30 min the reaction mixture was sampled and the sample was quenched by adding 40 mg of ascorbic acid to remove residual chlorine the concentrations of cytosine or adenine and dbps were then determined free chlorine was added to the remaining portion of the sample to recover a free chlorine concentration of 20 mg l 1 280 Œºm for 2 or 24 h of post chlorination in the dark the uv irradiation experiments were conducted similarly except that no free chlorine was dosed until after the uv irradiation period control tests were performed by adding 20 mg l 1 of free chlorine to cytosine or adenine solutions for 2 min to 24 h of chlorination without pretreatment total organic chlorine tocl was analyzed only after 24 h of post chlorination all of the experiments were conducted in duplicate the standard deviations of the duplicate measurements were calculated to create the error bars in the figures displaying the results to identify the degradation intermediates involved 280 Œºm cytosine was reacted with 2 8 mm free chlorine at ph 7 0 with and without uv irradiation the samples were quenched

of cytosine and adenine at ph 7 0 during chlorination alone in uv photolysis with and without post chlorination and in the uv chlorine aop the degradation of cytosine and adenine in all those processes exhibited pseudo first order degradation kinetics in chlorination alone the degradation rate constants for cytosine and adenine were 6 49 10 2 and 4 13 10 2 min 1 respectively after 30 min of chlorination cytosine and adenine were reduced by 87 and 74 respectively shown in fig s2 cytosine and adenine were barely reduced under uv irradiation alone 5 decrease but 30 min of uv irradiation did induce faster degradation of both cytosine rate constant 7 06 10 2 min 1 and adenine 5 21 10 2 min 1 during post chlorination i e during chlorination alone cytosine and adenine had strong uv absorbance at 254 nm figs s3 and s4 the œÄ œÄ and œÄ œÉ double bonds of purines and pyrimidines can be excited by uv irradiation franziska et al 2013 satzger et al 2006 there were however no observable changes in the chromatograms that could be because uv induced intermediates have structures too similar to those of the parent compounds and can hardly be separated in an hplc column the uv induced intermediates were identified by the uhplc qtof ms however and will be discussed in section 3 3 cytosine and adenine had the highest degradation rate constants in the uv chlorine aop 1 05 10 1 and 9 21 10 2 min 1 respectively they were 1 6 and 2 2 times those when treated by chlorination alone more than 98 of the cytosine and adenine were degraded after 30 min of uv chlorine treatment fig s2 the notable effectiveness of the aop can be attributed to the reactive ho and rcs radicals produced from the photolysis of free chlorine the second order reaction rate constants of ho with cytosine and adenine have been reported as 6 3 109 and 5 1 109 m 1s 1 respectively ross et al 1998 the reactions of ho with cytosine and adenine were mainly via oh addition and hydrogen abstraction hong et al 2001 sunil paul et al 2014 based on the fact that rcs preferentially attack moieties with electron donating capacity minakata et al 2017 rcs possibly attacked the c5 c6 double bond on the heterocyclic ring of cytosine and the c8 n9 double bond on the imidazole ring of adenine producing chlorinated intermediates the photolysis of chloro intermediate products and the participation of rcs and ho contributed to the rapid degradation of cytosine and adenine due to cytosine and adenine s dissimilar degradation rates and reaction sites their dbps may also have different formation trends 3 2 dbp and tocl formation from cytosine and adenine 3 2 1 dbp formation in uv irradiation followed by post chlorination fig 2 shows the dbp formation potentials from cytosine and adenine under three treatment scenarios 24 h of chlorination without any pretreatment the left section control sequential uv irradiation for 2 30 min followed by 24 h of post chlorination the middle section and the uv chlorine aop for 2 30 min followed by 24 h of post chlorination the right section the sum the dbp concentrations generated from cytosine after 24 h of chlorination i e the control condition was 66 5 Œºg l 1 which was 9 times those generated from adenine 7 4 Œºg l 1 that great difference in dbp levels of cytosine and adenine in chlorination agrees with the observations of previous studies young and uden 1994 zhang et al 2015 after 30 min of uv irradiation followed by 24 h of post chlorination the total dbp concentration was 116 2 Œºg l 1 for cytosine and 9 8 Œºg l 1 for adenine corresponding to 74 7 and 32 4 increases respectively compared with the control samples fig 2 clearly uv with post chlorination promoted the formation of more dbps from cytosine than that from adenine fig 2a shows how dbp formation from cytosine depended on the uv irradiation time increasing the uv irradiation time from 2 to 30 min i e from 65 to 975 mj cm 2 increased the total dbp concentration generated from cytosine by 26 1 from 92 2 to 116 2 Œºg l 1 fig s5a suggests that dbp formation from cytosine was also enhanced with increasing post chlorination time after uv irradiation pretreatment after 24 h of post chlorination the dominant dbp species of cytosine were dichloroacetic acid dcaa 41 2 Œºg l 1 and chloral hydrate ch 26 2 Œºg l 1 the n dbps included dichloroacetonitrile dcan 11 8 Œºg l 1 and dichloroacetamides dcacam 10 6 Œºg l 1 compared to chlorination alone uv irradiation of cytosine promoted the formation of dbp precursors fig s6b with adenine uv irradiation time had little effect on dbp formation fig 2b dbp formation was limited and limited to a small range 9 8 11 1 Œºg l 1 although increasing the post chlorination period increased dbp formation slightly each of the byproducts formed was present at less than 2 5 Œºg l 1 after 24 h of post chlorination following uv irradiation fig s5b 3 2 2 dbp formation in the uv chlorine aop followed by post chlorination as fig 2 clearly shows the uv chlorine aop followed by 24 h of post chlorination significantly promoted dbp formation from cytosine by 57 7 361 6 and moderately enhanced that from adenine by 8 1 85 1 compared to 24 h of chlorination alone the control notably dbp formation from cytosine depended strongly on the duration of uv chlorine treatment fig 2a when the uv chlorine aop pretreatment time increased from 2 to 30 min the total 24 h dbp formation potential from cytosine tripled from 104 9 to 307 2 Œºg l 1 c dbps increased from 81 3 to 256 4 Œºg l 1 and n dbps increased from 23 6 to 50 8 Œºg l 1 respectively by contrast the dbps formed from adenine in 24 h increased more modestly from 8 5 to 13 7 Œºg l 1 when uv chlorine treatment was prolonged from 2 to 30 min fig 2b fig 3 a indicates that the degradation of cytosine in the uv chlorine aop produced dbp precursors as well as fully formed dbps comparing the aop with chlorination alone the total dbp concentration generated from cytosine in 30 min 187 7 Œºg l 1 was 22 8 fold higher than that through chlorination alone for the same chlorine dosage 7 9 Œºg l 1 fig s7 the dominant byproducts from cytosine in the uv chlorine aop were ch 59 5 Œºg l 1 dcaa 34 2 Œºg l 1 dcacam 38 4 Œºg l 1 and dcan 36 1 Œºg l 1 simple chlorination of cytosine generated ch dcaa and dcan but at 0 8 4 5 and 0 3 Œºg l 1 respectively and dcacam was not observed so the ch and dcaa formation in aop were 73 4 fold and 6 6 fold higher than those from chlorination when the uv chlorine aop was supplemented with post chlorination the c dbp levels formed from cytosine increased gradually with the post chlorination time n dbp levels however decreased fig 3a as the post chlorination time increased from 2 to 24 h the ch and dcaa concentrations increased sharply from 66 4 to 46 0 Œºg l 1 to 89 7 and 136 3 Œºg l 1 respectively but the dcacam and dcan levels declined from 22 7 to 38 3 Œºg l 1 to 15 1 and 24 0 Œºg l 1 respectively the decrease in nitrogenous byproducts may be attributable to their hydrolysis and oxidation by chlorine yang et al 2007 as fig s6a shows after subtracting the dbp levels formed during the 30 min of uv chlorine pretreatment the c dbp levels formed from cytosine after post chlorination were still higher than those from chlorination alone especially for dcaa 75 8 Œºg l 1 and ch 19 0 Œºg l 1 these results imply that dbp precursors were indeed formed through interactions with reactive radicals e g ho and rcs in the uv chlorine aop overall the greatly enhanced byproduct formation from cytosine can be attributed to both the uv chlorine pretreatment and the post chlorination fig 3b indicates that the uv chlorine aop treatment of adenine generated much less byproduct than that generated from cytosine the total byproduct concentration 30 min of uv chlorine aop of adenine 2 3 Œºg l 1 was 76 7 fold lower than that from cytosine 187 7 Œºg l 1 fig s7 illustrates that the levels of various byproducts after uv chlorine treatment were comparable to those after chlorination alone suggesting that the impact of the aop on the formation of dbps from adenine was limited dcaa was the dominant dbp species fig 3b and its concentration increased slightly from 2 2 to 5 8 Œºg l 1 with increasing post chlorination from 2 to 24 h adenine degradation in the aop formed hardly any n dbps n dbp concentrations were less than 0 1 Œºg l 1 regardless of the post chlorination time aop pretreatment of adenine produced mainly the intermediates that contributed to dcaa formation the great difference in dbp formation between cytosine and adenine in the uv chlorine aop can be attributed to the different reactive sites of the compounds cytosine consists of a nitrogen containing heterocyclic rings pyrimidine rings with a primary amine functional group whereas adenine contains a pyrimidine ring and an imidazole ring fig s1 during uv chlorine treatment of cytosine both free chlorine and reactive radicals ho and rcs may be susceptible to attack at the c5 c6 double bond and the amine via chlorination addition hydroxylation and or deamination elsellami et al 2014 hong et al 2001 these radical involved reactions break the heterocyclic rings and form dbps in adenine the c8 c9 double bond in the imidazole ring is reportedly the main the reaction site with ho franc√©s monerris et al 2016 sunil paul et al 2014 the limited byproduct formation from adenine suggests that reactions with rcs may involve the imidazole ring as has been observed in caffeine sun et al 2016 3 2 3 tocl formation fig 4 a presents the tocl formation results cytosine produced much higher tocl concentrations 246 3 Œºg cl l 1 than adenine 9 2 Œºg cl l 1 after 24 h of chlorination in the dark the tocl levels from both cytosine and adenine were generally stable during uv irradiation followed by post chlorination regardless of the uv exposure time but interestingly tocl formed from cytosine and adenine showed opposite trends when uv chlorine pretreatment was followed by post chlorination for cytosine increasing uv chlorine pretreatment time from 2 min to 30 min decreased the tocl level by 35 5 from 237 7 to 153 3 Œºg cl l 1 with adenine increasing uv chlorine pretreatment time from 2 min to 30 min increased the tocl level from 10 9 to 18 4 Œºg cl l 1 the tocl decrease observed with cytosine in the uv chlorine pretreatment is opposite to the trend in formation of known dbps fig 2a fig 4b illustrates the dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in these two processes the mineralization rates of cytosine and adenine were similar under the same treatment procedures doc removal rate was generally higher in the uv chlorine aop pretreatment than that in the uv irradiation pretreatment which can be attributed to the participation of reactive radicals however cytosine and adenine showed different tocl levels implying their different reactivity with chlorine fig 5 illustrates the fraction of each group of dbp in the tocl formed from cytosine and adenine after 30 min of uv chlorine aop or uv irradiation pretreatment followed by 24 h of post chlorination cytosine treated using the uv chlorine aop followed by post chlorination generated primarily hals 43 2 and haas 16 2 are the main groups of known dbps in tocl and the unknown dbps comprised 21 7 of the tocl after uv irradiation followed by post chlorination however unknown dbps comprised 81 4 of the tocl almost triple the percentage after aop pretreatment followed by post chlorination it seemed that the reactions of cytosine with ho and rcs in the uv chlorine aop generated intermediates that could undergo chlorine substitution or cleavage to generate dbps turning to adenine haas accounted for 23 6 25 9 of the tocl in both sequential processes the fraction of cncl was different however cncl accounted for 6 2 of the tocl after the uv chlorine aop pretreatment followed by post chlorination whereas it was 16 1 tocl after uv irradiation followed by post chlorination the proportions of unknown dbps in the tocl were 52 8 and 40 8 after the uv chlorine aop and uv irradiation pretreatment followed by post chlorination respectively unlike cytosine the reaction of adenine with ho and rcs in uv chlorine treatment preferentially generated unknown dbps 3 3 dbp formation pathways from cytosine 3 3 1 transformation products of cytosine in uv chlorine aop and uv irradiation due to the much higher levels of dbp formed from cytosine than adenine the intermediates from cytosine degradation upon uv chlorine aop and uv irradiation pretreatment followed by post chlorination were identified using the uhplc qtof ms in positive mode cytosine was observed at m z 112 0516 at the retention time rt of 0 60 min corresponding to the chemical formula c4h5n3o liquid chromatograms for cytosine during chlorination uv chlorine aop treatment and uv irradiation alone and after uv irradiation followed by post chlorination are shown in fig s8 ten main intermediates p146a p146b p146c p146d p145 p199 p163 p91 p63 and p58 and two cytosine dimers p221 and p257 were observed their structural characteristics are summarized in table s2 and fig s9 the extracted ion chromatograms extracted ion ms spectra and ms2 spectra of the intermediates in the different processes are provided in figures s10 s15 specifically p146a c4h4cln3o rt 0 96 min was observed in the m z clusters at 146 0124 and 148 0093 with an isotope ratio of 3 1 it was formed by one chlorine substitution on cytosine 112 35 1 146 other monochloro cytosine isomers p146 b p146 c and p146 d were observed with retention times of 0 86 0 84 and 0 88 min fig s11 the chlorine substitution may occur at the c5 and c6 positions as well as at the n1 and n3 positions on the heterocyclic ring reynolds et al 1988 free chlorine might also react with the primary amine group at c4 forming an n cl bond as in the p146e proposed in fig s9 but the n cl bond could be converted back to the parent cytosine after addition of a quenching reagent cao et al 2019 p145 c4hn2o2cl rt 0 75 min was another dominant chloro cytosine intermediate detected at m zs of 145 0284 and 147 0253 with an isotope ratio of 3 1 p145 was formed via the deamination of the amine group at c4 as well as chlorination and dehydration at the c5 c6 double bond additionally dichlorinated cytosine intermediates such as p199 c4h7cl2n3o2 rt 0 67 min were also observed with a characteristic isotope ratio of 9 6 1 at an m z of 199 9915 and several hydroxyl cytosine products were also observed p163 c4h6n2o5 rt 0 76 min was detected at m z 163 0624 it was generated by hydroxylation of the c5 and c6 double bond in cytosine p221 m z 221 1759 and p257 m z 257 3445 were derivative dimers produced through crosslinking of cytosine radicals under uv irradiation finally several other hydroxyl intermediates were also produced via ring breakage including p91 p58 and p63 fig 6 illustrates the evolution of these cytosine intermediates during chlorination the uv chlorine aop and uv irradiation followed by post chlorination the p146 isomers and p199 were observed after chlorination alone all of the chloro intermediates presented their strongest signal within 10 min fig 6a in the uv chlorine aop mono chloro cytosine p146a and p145 were the dominant intermediates fig 6b p146a reached its highest intensity at 5 min and then decreased sharply to 30 min indicating its rapid transformation of monochloro cytosine into other products the abundance of p145 increased gradually for 15 min followed by a slow decrease to 30 min the dichloro p199 and hydroxyl products p63 and p58 were present at relatively lower abundance than p146a and p145 the signals from those intermediates reached their maxima at around 10 min and then decreased to relatively lower levels then dbps such as ch dcaa and dcan were formed shah and mitch 2011 zhang et al 2017 among those intermediates p146a p146b and p199 were also observed during chlorination alone fig 6a the intermediates during chlorination alone showed different trends from those during the uv chlorine aop p146b s signal reached its maximum within 10 min of chlorination p145 wasn t observed during chlorination alone and the intensity of p146a in the uv chlorine aop was two orders of magnitude higher than that in chlorination p163 was the predominant product after 30 min of uv irradiation accompanied by cytosine dimers p211 and p256 fig s8 p163 was the distinct uv induced intermediate because abundant p163 was observed in the uv irradiation alone but it was not observed in the uv chlorine aop or in chlorination alone when the uv irradiated samples were subjected to post chlorination p163 decreased quickly within 1 h and was entirely degraded after 10 h of post chlorination fig 6c p211 and p256 also followed gradual decreasing trends during post chlorination but p145 increased sharply and reached its maximum after 1 h of post chlorination suggesting the rapid transformation of p163 into p145 the transformation of p163 towards p145 can be attributed to the hydroxylation enhancing the electron density of cytosine which promoted chlorine adduction and dehydration at two adjacent hydroxyl groups moreover p146a reached its maximum within 2 h and decreased quickly within 10 h of post chlorination p146a exhibited lower intensity but decreased more quickly than p145 as is shown in fig 6 p145 was observed in samples treated with uv and chlorine or with uv alone followed by chlorination but it was absent during chlorination alone it was produced through synergy between uv irradiation and chlorination simultaneous or sequential thus more dbps were formed than in chlorination alone due to the additional cytosine transformation pathways involving p145 3 3 2 proposed dbp formation pathways fig 7 proposes a scheme by which byproducts may form during cytosine degradation in the uv chlorine aop p146 and p145 are formed initially in the pathway beginning from p146 free chlorine and rcs generated in the uv chlorine aop are susceptible to attack at the c4 and c5 positions of cytosine via either chlorine substitution or electrophilic attack on unsaturated bonds reynolds et al 1988 young and uden 1994 p199 is thus formed from p146 via the chlorination from free chlorine or rcs and hydroxyl addition at the c5 c6 double bond hong et al 2001 radical ho and rcs attack or chlorine substitution cleaves p199 s heterocyclic ring to form dbps such as dcaa and ch this dbp formation pathway in the uv chlorine aop resembles one reported previously for chlorination alone young and uden 1994 but the uv chlorine aop accelerates the process and leads to the formation of more byproducts p145 has not previously been identified as an intermediate in simultaneous and sequential uv irradiation and chlorination it may be generated through the cleavage of the c nh2 bond at the c4 position under uv irradiation elsellami et al 2014 as well as through chlorination and dehydration at the c5 c6 double bond by reactive radicals and free chlorine p145 could further generate p58 and p63 via ring breakage the main pathway for the formation of n dbps such as dcan dcacam and cncl the dbp formation pathways during the sequential uv irradiation and post chlorination are also proposed in fig 7 uv exposure resulted in the formation of p163 by hydroxylation of the c5 c6 double bond and deamination at cytosine s c4 position it has been reported that uv irradiation generates cytosine radical cations which could further transform to hydroxyl cytosine through hydroxylation hong et al 2001 then p163 tends to form p145 during the post chlorination period hydroxylation enhances cytosine s electron density promoting chlorine adduction and dehydration at two adjacent hydroxyl groups and thus forming dbps during the post chlorination process p163 could also undergo ring breakage to form p91 which would also generate dbps during the post chlorination and uv irradiation could itself generate dimers p211 and p256 via ring crosslinking of cytosine radicals dizdaroglu and simic 1984 that would produce organic chlorine products during post chlorination 4 conclusions the degradation of cytosine and adenine is greatly enhanced in the uv chlorine aop compared to chlorination alone uv pretreatment followed by post chlorination also shows more modest enhancement the dbp generation from cytosine was significantly greater than from adenine in both uv chlorine aop and uv irradiation followed by post chlorination longer uv chlorine aop pretreatment time greatly enhanced the dbp concentrations from cytosine but had little impact on those from adenine the differences in dbp generation between cytosine and adenine suggest that different reaction sites are involved in cytosine and adenine s reactions with free chlorine and other reactive species compared to chlorination alone less tocl was generated from cytosine in the uv chlorine aop followed by post chlorination but higher concentrations of other byproducts were observed the formation of new dbp p145 was observed in when either the uv chlorine aop or uv irradiation alone was followed by post chlorination p145 is an important n dbp precursor formed via deamination induced by uv irradiation and chlorination and then dehydration induced by free chlorine and radicals uv chlorine aop is found to be effective to remove precursor compounds e g cytosine and adenine but the associated dbp formation deserves further evaluation especially in real waters with diverse water properties declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

18528,purine and pyrimidines are present an important pool of dissolved organic nitrogen in aqueous medias and also precursors of disinfection byproducts the degradation kinetics of cytosine and adenine model pyrimidine and purine compounds were investigated along with their transformation pathways leading to the formation of disinfection byproducts during two typical multi barrier disinfection processes uv irradiation and uv chlorine pretreatment followed by post chlorination uv irradiation followed by post chlorination enhanced the degradation of cytosine and adenine by 17 1 and 26 1 respectively but it also generated more byproduct precursors compared to chlorination alone the presence of reactive species in the uv chlorine treatment greatly enhanced cytosine and adenine degradation by 61 8 and 123 0 but generated even more disinfection byproducts compared to 24 h chlorination the concentrations of byproducts increased by up to 361 6 for cytosine and 85 1 for adenine with longer uv chlorine treatment from 2 to 30 min thirty minutes of combined uv chlorine treatment decreased the total organic chlorine produced from cytosine by 34 4 from 233 8 to 153 3 Œºg cl l 1 but it increased byproduct generation by 68 3 compared with 24 h of simple chlorination the tocl from adenine increased by 50 0 from 9 2 to 18 4 Œºg cl l 1 but byproduct generation was 11 0 less after 30 min of uv chlorine pretreatment followed by 24 h of chlorination the intermediates generated were analyzed in detail and multiple transformation pathways leading to byproduct formation are proposed

reported zhang et al 2017 that the total dbp yields produced from cytosine thymine uracil adenine and guanine over 24 h ranges from 118 to 483 Œºg mmol 1 of the precursor at a chlorine to precursor ratio of 10 1 at ph 7 pyrimidine bases generate more dbps than do purine bases cytosine generates the highest n dbp levels including hans and hnms in chlorination zhang et al 2017 the transformation of pyrimidines and purines during chlorination depends on the ph and the chlorine to precursor ratio products with multiple chlorine adducts on heterocyclic rings or on aliphatic amines have been observed during the chlorination of adenine and cytosine zhang et al 2017 further chlorination leads to ring cleavage and dbp generation in water treatment uv irradiation is often used together with chlorination uv irradiation followed by chlorination is the normal practice in drinking water treatment where the uv irradiation is a primary disinfection to inactivate microorganisms and chlorination is used as secondary disinfection which provides residual treatment in the distribution system li and mitch 2018 simultaneous use of uv and chlorine uv chlorine has been proposed as an advanced oxidation process aop for drinking water or wastewater treatment to eliminate micropollutants and inactive microorganisms zhang and parker 2018 hydroxyl radicals ho and reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl and cl2 can be generated in such uv chlorine application nowell and hoign√© 1992 the uv chlorine aop effectively inactives chlorine resistant microorganisms such as cryptosporidium parvum oocysts zhou et al 2014 and bacillus subtilis endospores forsyth et al 2013 the process also exhibits superior performance in transforming pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and algal toxins compared to uv irradiation or chlorination alone yang et al 2016 pan et al 2017 cheng et al 2018 zhang et al 2019a 2019b sequential or simultaneous use of uv with chlorine may change the dbp precursors and thus affect the subsequent formation of dbps during secondary disinfection the reactive oxidants ho and rcs preferentially attack moieties with high electron donating capacity such as those with double bonds aromatic or phenolic groups leading to degradation of the chromophores and fluorophores in dissolved organic matter wang et al 2017 the degradation of natural organic matter by uv chlorine treatment has been found to generate more haas hans and hals than chlorination alone wang et al 2017 gao et al 2019 but the mechanisms are not clear understanding the transformation pathways of representative organic nitrogen compounds is important for elucidating the mechanisms of dbp formation especially for n dbps pyrimidines and purines as important dbp precursors were explored in this study seeking to understand their fate and the transformation pathways to dbps involved previous studies have investigated the reactions of ho with pyrimidines and purines ho reacts with adenine via hydroxylation at c8 in the imidazole ring generating several products including 8 hydroxyadenine and 5 formamido 4 6 diaminopyrimidine franc√©s monerris et al 2016 ho oxidizes cytosine at the c5 c6 double bond to form monohydroxy and dihydroxy derivatives hong et al 2001 the reactions of rcs with pyrimidines and purines have not yet been evaluated but chlorine containing products may form when uv or uv with chlorine is applied ahead of post chlorination it is not clear how that may change the precursors and affect the dbp formation potential this study was therefore designed to explore the degradation kinetics of pyrimidines and purine and their transformation pathways leading to dbp formation during uv irradiation alone and with chlorine followed by post chlorination cytosine and adenine were selected as the model compounds pyrimidine and purine the formation of 25 species of halogenated carbonaceous and nitrogenous dbps was studied see table s1 in the supporting information the total organic chlorine tocl was also analyzed the transformation intermediates were identified and reaction schemes and dbp formation pathways were proposed 2 materials

supplementary information dbp standards were obtained from sigma aldrich usa cncl standard solutions were prepared by mixing 0 5 mg l 1 as n of glycine with 5 mg l 1 as cl2 of free chlorine at ph 7 0

solutions 200 ml containing 28 0 Œºm adenine or cytosine were buffered at ph 7 0 using 10 mm phosphate buffer for the uv chlorine aop tests a sealed quartz cylindrical dish 8 cm in diameter containing 200 ml of the solution to be tested was placed under the uv lamp the reactions were initiated by adding 280 Œºm free chlorine and illuminating the lamp simultaneously the samples were completely mixed by a magnetic stirrer during the reactions after a pre determined time interval 2 30 min the reaction mixture was sampled and the sample was quenched by adding 40 mg of ascorbic acid to remove residual chlorine the concentrations of cytosine or adenine and dbps were then determined free chlorine was added to the remaining portion of the sample to recover a free chlorine concentration of 20 mg l 1 280 Œºm for 2 or 24 h of post chlorination in the dark the uv irradiation experiments were conducted similarly except that no free chlorine was dosed until after the uv irradiation period control tests were performed by adding 20 mg l 1 of free chlorine to cytosine or adenine solutions for 2 min to 24 h of chlorination without pretreatment total organic chlorine tocl was analyzed only after 24 h of post chlorination all of the experiments were conducted in duplicate the standard deviations of the duplicate measurements were calculated to create the error bars in the figures displaying the results to identify the degradation intermediates involved 280 Œºm cytosine was reacted with 2 8 mm free chlorine at ph 7 0 with and without uv irradiation the samples were quenched

of cytosine and adenine at ph 7 0 during chlorination alone in uv photolysis with and without post chlorination and in the uv chlorine aop the degradation of cytosine and adenine in all those processes exhibited pseudo first order degradation kinetics in chlorination alone the degradation rate constants for cytosine and adenine were 6 49 10 2 and 4 13 10 2 min 1 respectively after 30 min of chlorination cytosine and adenine were reduced by 87 and 74 respectively shown in fig s2 cytosine and adenine were barely reduced under uv irradiation alone 5 decrease but 30 min of uv irradiation did induce faster degradation of both cytosine rate constant 7 06 10 2 min 1 and adenine 5 21 10 2 min 1 during post chlorination i e during chlorination alone cytosine and adenine had strong uv absorbance at 254 nm figs s3 and s4 the œÄ œÄ and œÄ œÉ double bonds of purines and pyrimidines can be excited by uv irradiation franziska et al 2013 satzger et al 2006 there were however no observable changes in the chromatograms that could be because uv induced intermediates have structures too similar to those of the parent compounds and can hardly be separated in an hplc column the uv induced intermediates were identified by the uhplc qtof ms however and will be discussed in section 3 3 cytosine and adenine had the highest degradation rate constants in the uv chlorine aop 1 05 10 1 and 9 21 10 2 min 1 respectively they were 1 6 and 2 2 times those when treated by chlorination alone more than 98 of the cytosine and adenine were degraded after 30 min of uv chlorine treatment fig s2 the notable effectiveness of the aop can be attributed to the reactive ho and rcs radicals produced from the photolysis of free chlorine the second order reaction rate constants of ho with cytosine and adenine have been reported as 6 3 109 and 5 1 109 m 1s 1 respectively ross et al 1998 the reactions of ho with cytosine and adenine were mainly via oh addition and hydrogen abstraction hong et al 2001 sunil paul et al 2014 based on the fact that rcs preferentially attack moieties with electron donating capacity minakata et al 2017 rcs possibly attacked the c5 c6 double bond on the heterocyclic ring of cytosine and the c8 n9 double bond on the imidazole ring of adenine producing chlorinated intermediates the photolysis of chloro intermediate products and the participation of rcs and ho contributed to the rapid degradation of cytosine and adenine due to cytosine and adenine s dissimilar degradation rates and reaction sites their dbps may also have different formation trends 3 2 dbp and tocl formation from cytosine and adenine 3 2 1 dbp formation in uv irradiation followed by post chlorination fig 2 shows the dbp formation potentials from cytosine and adenine under three treatment scenarios 24 h of chlorination without any pretreatment the left section control sequential uv irradiation for 2 30 min followed by 24 h of post chlorination the middle section and the uv chlorine aop for 2 30 min followed by 24 h of post chlorination the right section the sum the dbp concentrations generated from cytosine after 24 h of chlorination i e the control condition was 66 5 Œºg l 1 which was 9 times those generated from adenine 7 4 Œºg l 1 that great difference in dbp levels of cytosine and adenine in chlorination agrees with the observations of previous studies young and uden 1994 zhang et al 2015 after 30 min of uv irradiation followed by 24 h of post chlorination the total dbp concentration was 116 2 Œºg l 1 for cytosine and 9 8 Œºg l 1 for adenine corresponding to 74 7 and 32 4 increases respectively compared with the control samples fig 2 clearly uv with post chlorination promoted the formation of more dbps from cytosine than that from adenine fig 2a shows how dbp formation from cytosine depended on the uv irradiation time increasing the uv irradiation time from 2 to 30 min i e from 65 to 975 mj cm 2 increased the total dbp concentration generated from cytosine by 26 1 from 92 2 to 116 2 Œºg l 1 fig s5a suggests that dbp formation from cytosine was also enhanced with increasing post chlorination time after uv irradiation pretreatment after 24 h of post chlorination the dominant dbp species of cytosine were dichloroacetic acid dcaa 41 2 Œºg l 1 and chloral hydrate ch 26 2 Œºg l 1 the n dbps included dichloroacetonitrile dcan 11 8 Œºg l 1 and dichloroacetamides dcacam 10 6 Œºg l 1 compared to chlorination alone uv irradiation of cytosine promoted the formation of dbp precursors fig s6b with adenine uv irradiation time had little effect on dbp formation fig 2b dbp formation was limited and limited to a small range 9 8 11 1 Œºg l 1 although increasing the post chlorination period increased dbp formation slightly each of the byproducts formed was present at less than 2 5 Œºg l 1 after 24 h of post chlorination following uv irradiation fig s5b 3 2 2 dbp formation in the uv chlorine aop followed by post chlorination as fig 2 clearly shows the uv chlorine aop followed by 24 h of post chlorination significantly promoted dbp formation from cytosine by 57 7 361 6 and moderately enhanced that from adenine by 8 1 85 1 compared to 24 h of chlorination alone the control notably dbp formation from cytosine depended strongly on the duration of uv chlorine treatment fig 2a when the uv chlorine aop pretreatment time increased from 2 to 30 min the total 24 h dbp formation potential from cytosine tripled from 104 9 to 307 2 Œºg l 1 c dbps increased from 81 3 to 256 4 Œºg l 1 and n dbps increased from 23 6 to 50 8 Œºg l 1 respectively by contrast the dbps formed from adenine in 24 h increased more modestly from 8 5 to 13 7 Œºg l 1 when uv chlorine treatment was prolonged from 2 to 30 min fig 2b fig 3 a indicates that the degradation of cytosine in the uv chlorine aop produced dbp precursors as well as fully formed dbps comparing the aop with chlorination alone the total dbp concentration generated from cytosine in 30 min 187 7 Œºg l 1 was 22 8 fold higher than that through chlorination alone for the same chlorine dosage 7 9 Œºg l 1 fig s7 the dominant byproducts from cytosine in the uv chlorine aop were ch 59 5 Œºg l 1 dcaa 34 2 Œºg l 1 dcacam 38 4 Œºg l 1 and dcan 36 1 Œºg l 1 simple chlorination of cytosine generated ch dcaa and dcan but at 0 8 4 5 and 0 3 Œºg l 1 respectively and dcacam was not observed so the ch and dcaa formation in aop were 73 4 fold and 6 6 fold higher than those from chlorination when the uv chlorine aop was supplemented with post chlorination the c dbp levels formed from cytosine increased gradually with the post chlorination time n dbp levels however decreased fig 3a as the post chlorination time increased from 2 to 24 h the ch and dcaa concentrations increased sharply from 66 4 to 46 0 Œºg l 1 to 89 7 and 136 3 Œºg l 1 respectively but the dcacam and dcan levels declined from 22 7 to 38 3 Œºg l 1 to 15 1 and 24 0 Œºg l 1 respectively the decrease in nitrogenous byproducts may be attributable to their hydrolysis and oxidation by chlorine yang et al 2007 as fig s6a shows after subtracting the dbp levels formed during the 30 min of uv chlorine pretreatment the c dbp levels formed from cytosine after post chlorination were still higher than those from chlorination alone especially for dcaa 75 8 Œºg l 1 and ch 19 0 Œºg l 1 these results imply that dbp precursors were indeed formed through interactions with reactive radicals e g ho and rcs in the uv chlorine aop overall the greatly enhanced byproduct formation from cytosine can be attributed to both the uv chlorine pretreatment and the post chlorination fig 3b indicates that the uv chlorine aop treatment of adenine generated much less byproduct than that generated from cytosine the total byproduct concentration 30 min of uv chlorine aop of adenine 2 3 Œºg l 1 was 76 7 fold lower than that from cytosine 187 7 Œºg l 1 fig s7 illustrates that the levels of various byproducts after uv chlorine treatment were comparable to those after chlorination alone suggesting that the impact of the aop on the formation of dbps from adenine was limited dcaa was the dominant dbp species fig 3b and its concentration increased slightly from 2 2 to 5 8 Œºg l 1 with increasing post chlorination from 2 to 24 h adenine degradation in the aop formed hardly any n dbps n dbp concentrations were less than 0 1 Œºg l 1 regardless of the post chlorination time aop pretreatment of adenine produced mainly the intermediates that contributed to dcaa formation the great difference in dbp formation between cytosine and adenine in the uv chlorine aop can be attributed to the different reactive sites of the compounds cytosine consists of a nitrogen containing heterocyclic rings pyrimidine rings with a primary amine functional group whereas adenine contains a pyrimidine ring and an imidazole ring fig s1 during uv chlorine treatment of cytosine both free chlorine and reactive radicals ho and rcs may be susceptible to attack at the c5 c6 double bond and the amine via chlorination addition hydroxylation and or deamination elsellami et al 2014 hong et al 2001 these radical involved reactions break the heterocyclic rings and form dbps in adenine the c8 c9 double bond in the imidazole ring is reportedly the main the reaction site with ho franc√©s monerris et al 2016 sunil paul et al 2014 the limited byproduct formation from adenine suggests that reactions with rcs may involve the imidazole ring as has been observed in caffeine sun et al 2016 3 2 3 tocl formation fig 4 a presents the tocl formation results cytosine produced much higher tocl concentrations 246 3 Œºg cl l 1 than adenine 9 2 Œºg cl l 1 after 24 h of chlorination in the dark the tocl levels from both cytosine and adenine were generally stable during uv irradiation followed by post chlorination regardless of the uv exposure time but interestingly tocl formed from cytosine and adenine showed opposite trends when uv chlorine pretreatment was followed by post chlorination for cytosine increasing uv chlorine pretreatment time from 2 min to 30 min decreased the tocl level by 35 5 from 237 7 to 153 3 Œºg cl l 1 with adenine increasing uv chlorine pretreatment time from 2 min to 30 min increased the tocl level from 10 9 to 18 4 Œºg cl l 1 the tocl decrease observed with cytosine in the uv chlorine pretreatment is opposite to the trend in formation of known dbps fig 2a fig 4b illustrates the dissolved organic carbon doc concentrations in these two processes the mineralization rates of cytosine and adenine were similar under the same treatment procedures doc removal rate was generally higher in the uv chlorine aop pretreatment than that in the uv irradiation pretreatment which can be attributed to the participation of reactive radicals however cytosine and adenine showed different tocl levels implying their different reactivity with chlorine fig 5 illustrates the fraction of each group of dbp in the tocl formed from cytosine and adenine after 30 min of uv chlorine aop or uv irradiation pretreatment followed by 24 h of post chlorination cytosine treated using the uv chlorine aop followed by post chlorination generated primarily hals 43 2 and haas 16 2 are the main groups of known dbps in tocl and the unknown dbps comprised 21 7 of the tocl after uv irradiation followed by post chlorination however unknown dbps comprised 81 4 of the tocl almost triple the percentage after aop pretreatment followed by post chlorination it seemed that the reactions of cytosine with ho and rcs in the uv chlorine aop generated intermediates that could undergo chlorine substitution or cleavage to generate dbps turning to adenine haas accounted for 23 6 25 9 of the tocl in both sequential processes the fraction of cncl was different however cncl accounted for 6 2 of the tocl after the uv chlorine aop pretreatment followed by post chlorination whereas it was 16 1 tocl after uv irradiation followed by post chlorination the proportions of unknown dbps in the tocl were 52 8 and 40 8 after the uv chlorine aop and uv irradiation pretreatment followed by post chlorination respectively unlike cytosine the reaction of adenine with ho and rcs in uv chlorine treatment preferentially generated unknown dbps 3 3 dbp formation pathways from cytosine 3 3 1 transformation products of cytosine in uv chlorine aop and uv irradiation due to the much higher levels of dbp formed from cytosine than adenine the intermediates from cytosine degradation upon uv chlorine aop and uv irradiation pretreatment followed by post chlorination were identified using the uhplc qtof ms in positive mode cytosine was observed at m z 112 0516 at the retention time rt of 0 60 min corresponding to the chemical formula c4h5n3o liquid chromatograms for cytosine during chlorination uv chlorine aop treatment and uv irradiation alone and after uv irradiation followed by post chlorination are shown in fig s8 ten main intermediates p146a p146b p146c p146d p145 p199 p163 p91 p63 and p58 and two cytosine dimers p221 and p257 were observed their structural characteristics are summarized in table s2 and fig s9 the extracted ion chromatograms extracted ion ms spectra and ms2 spectra of the intermediates in the different processes are provided in figures s10 s15 specifically p146a c4h4cln3o rt 0 96 min was observed in the m z clusters at 146 0124 and 148 0093 with an isotope ratio of 3 1 it was formed by one chlorine substitution on cytosine 112 35 1 146 other monochloro cytosine isomers p146 b p146 c and p146 d were observed with retention times of 0 86 0 84 and 0 88 min fig s11 the chlorine substitution may occur at the c5 and c6 positions as well as at the n1 and n3 positions on the heterocyclic ring reynolds et al 1988 free chlorine might also react with the primary amine group at c4 forming an n cl bond as in the p146e proposed in fig s9 but the n cl bond could be converted back to the parent cytosine after addition of a quenching reagent cao et al 2019 p145 c4hn2o2cl rt 0 75 min was another dominant chloro cytosine intermediate detected at m zs of 145 0284 and 147 0253 with an isotope ratio of 3 1 p145 was formed via the deamination of the amine group at c4 as well as chlorination and dehydration at the c5 c6 double bond additionally dichlorinated cytosine intermediates such as p199 c4h7cl2n3o2 rt 0 67 min were also observed with a characteristic isotope ratio of 9 6 1 at an m z of 199 9915 and several hydroxyl cytosine products were also observed p163 c4h6n2o5 rt 0 76 min was detected at m z 163 0624 it was generated by hydroxylation of the c5 and c6 double bond in cytosine p221 m z 221 1759 and p257 m z 257 3445 were derivative dimers produced through crosslinking of cytosine radicals under uv irradiation finally several other hydroxyl intermediates were also produced via ring breakage including p91 p58 and p63 fig 6 illustrates the evolution of these cytosine intermediates during chlorination the uv chlorine aop and uv irradiation followed by post chlorination the p146 isomers and p199 were observed after chlorination alone all of the chloro intermediates presented their strongest signal within 10 min fig 6a in the uv chlorine aop mono chloro cytosine p146a and p145 were the dominant intermediates fig 6b p146a reached its highest intensity at 5 min and then decreased sharply to 30 min indicating its rapid transformation of monochloro cytosine into other products the abundance of p145 increased gradually for 15 min followed by a slow decrease to 30 min the dichloro p199 and hydroxyl products p63 and p58 were present at relatively lower abundance than p146a and p145 the signals from those intermediates reached their maxima at around 10 min and then decreased to relatively lower levels then dbps such as ch dcaa and dcan were formed shah and mitch 2011 zhang et al 2017 among those intermediates p146a p146b and p199 were also observed during chlorination alone fig 6a the intermediates during chlorination alone showed different trends from those during the uv chlorine aop p146b s signal reached its maximum within 10 min of chlorination p145 wasn t observed during chlorination alone and the intensity of p146a in the uv chlorine aop was two orders of magnitude higher than that in chlorination p163 was the predominant product after 30 min of uv irradiation accompanied by cytosine dimers p211 and p256 fig s8 p163 was the distinct uv induced intermediate because abundant p163 was observed in the uv irradiation alone but it was not observed in the uv chlorine aop or in chlorination alone when the uv irradiated samples were subjected to post chlorination p163 decreased quickly within 1 h and was entirely degraded after 10 h of post chlorination fig 6c p211 and p256 also followed gradual decreasing trends during post chlorination but p145 increased sharply and reached its maximum after 1 h of post chlorination suggesting the rapid transformation of p163 into p145 the transformation of p163 towards p145 can be attributed to the hydroxylation enhancing the electron density of cytosine which promoted chlorine adduction and dehydration at two adjacent hydroxyl groups moreover p146a reached its maximum within 2 h and decreased quickly within 10 h of post chlorination p146a exhibited lower intensity but decreased more quickly than p145 as is shown in fig 6 p145 was observed in samples treated with uv and chlorine or with uv alone followed by chlorination but it was absent during chlorination alone it was produced through synergy between uv irradiation and chlorination simultaneous or sequential thus more dbps were formed than in chlorination alone due to the additional cytosine transformation pathways involving p145 3 3 2 proposed dbp formation pathways fig 7 proposes a scheme by which byproducts may form during cytosine degradation in the uv chlorine aop p146 and p145 are formed initially in the pathway beginning from p146 free chlorine and rcs generated in the uv chlorine aop are susceptible to attack at the c4 and c5 positions of cytosine via either chlorine substitution or electrophilic attack on unsaturated bonds reynolds et al 1988 young and uden 1994 p199 is thus formed from p146 via the chlorination from free chlorine or rcs and hydroxyl addition at the c5 c6 double bond hong et al 2001 radical ho and rcs attack or chlorine substitution cleaves p199 s heterocyclic ring to form dbps such as dcaa and ch this dbp formation pathway in the uv chlorine aop resembles one reported previously for chlorination alone young and uden 1994 but the uv chlorine aop accelerates the process and leads to the formation of more byproducts p145 has not previously been identified as an intermediate in simultaneous and sequential uv irradiation and chlorination it may be generated through the cleavage of the c nh2 bond at the c4 position under uv irradiation elsellami et al 2014 as well as through chlorination and dehydration at the c5 c6 double bond by reactive radicals and free chlorine p145 could further generate p58 and p63 via ring breakage the main pathway for the formation of n dbps such as dcan dcacam and cncl the dbp formation pathways during the sequential uv irradiation and post chlorination are also proposed in fig 7 uv exposure resulted in the formation of p163 by hydroxylation of the c5 c6 double bond and deamination at cytosine s c4 position it has been reported that uv irradiation generates cytosine radical cations which could further transform to hydroxyl cytosine through hydroxylation hong et al 2001 then p163 tends to form p145 during the post chlorination period hydroxylation enhances cytosine s electron density promoting chlorine adduction and dehydration at two adjacent hydroxyl groups and thus forming dbps during the post chlorination process p163 could also undergo ring breakage to form p91 which would also generate dbps during the post chlorination and uv irradiation could itself generate dimers p211 and p256 via ring crosslinking of cytosine radicals dizdaroglu and simic 1984 that would produce organic chlorine products during post chlorination 4 conclusions the degradation of cytosine and adenine is greatly enhanced in the uv chlorine aop compared to chlorination alone uv pretreatment followed by post chlorination also shows more modest enhancement the dbp generation from cytosine was significantly greater than from adenine in both uv chlorine aop and uv irradiation followed by post chlorination longer uv chlorine aop pretreatment time greatly enhanced the dbp concentrations from cytosine but had little impact on those from adenine the differences in dbp generation between cytosine and adenine suggest that different reaction sites are involved in cytosine and adenine s reactions with free chlorine and other reactive species compared to chlorination alone less tocl was generated from cytosine in the uv chlorine aop followed by post chlorination but higher concentrations of other byproducts were observed the formation of new dbp p145 was observed in when either the uv chlorine aop or uv irradiation alone was followed by post chlorination p145 is an important n dbp precursor formed via deamination induced by uv irradiation and chlorination and then dehydration induced by free chlorine and radicals uv chlorine aop is found to be effective to remove precursor compounds e g cytosine and adenine but the associated dbp formation deserves further evaluation especially in real waters with diverse water properties declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

worldwide however the pou water dispenser itself can adversely impact water quality this study investigated the bacterial growth through a pou water dispenser fed with chlorinated tap water specifically the heterotrophic plate count increased from 0 01 to 20 01 103 of colony forming units per ml the biomig test which evaluates the biostability of polymeric materials based on the

polyvinyl chloride were relatively stable polymeric component examination of an actual pou water dispenser revealed highly accumulated biofilms on the silicone tube used in the device 118 103 cfu cm 2 the use of polymers with high biofilm formation should be minimized in water dispensers whereas approved polymeric components contribute to biological stability in the dispensed drinking water

2010 stalter et al 2016 girolamini et al 2019 according to the market share statistics pou devices have become increasingly popular worldwide the pou device market was valued at 14 billion dollars in 2014 with an expected annual growth of 9 9 worldwide markets and markets 2014 this is particularly true in south korea where half the households use pou water dispensers nier 2018 interestingly the korean ministry of environment recently reported that the effluent from 52 of the tested water dispensers 261 of 505 exceeded the hpc threshold of the korean tap water regulations 100 cfu ml 1 among which 20 exceeded 500 cfu ml 1 whereas the chlorinated tap water used to feed the dispenser met the regulatory level nier 2018 although the hpc is not a health related parameter who 2002 it can be useful for evaluating the overall performance of pou water dispensers and the microbial changes in the finished water it is worthy to note that enteric organisms and other pathogens were also detected in the dispensed water girolamini et al 2019 therefore the adverse impact on the water quality through the dispenser systems cannot be disregarded recent studies have highlighted the importance of bacterial problems in building plumbing systems which have a higher surface area to volume ratio longer water stagnation time at warm temperatures and faster disinfectant decay compared to those in water distribution pipelines lautenschlager et al 2010 wen et al 2015 proctor et al 2016 zlatanovic et al 2017 pou water dispensers share these same conditions most commercial water dispenser systems are equipped with a water reservoir membrane filters carbon filters and various other treatment units thus the device structures are compact and complex fig 1 the surface area in contact with the water increases substantially because the inner diameters of the tubing for such devices are also small 6 10 mm moreover there is usually stagnant water in the reservoir inside the device thus the water contacting area and the stagnation of water provided via the pou water dispenser cannot be underestimated in relation to that of the building plumbing also as both cold and warm water are available through the water dispenser temperature is likely another factor related to the problems in pou water dispensers hence the selection of polymeric materials e g tubing fittings and reservoir for pou water dispensers in contact with tap water must be carefully considered due to the versatility of polymeric products i e plastic and rubber many types of polymer have been widely used for drinking water systems in south korea over 20 types of components containing polymeric materials are approved for use in pou water dispensers including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs polyethylene

ansi 61 us bs 6920 uk ktw guideline germany and en 1420 12873 eu the problem is that several polymeric materials may allow the migration of organics that are biologically utilizable previous studies have successfully demonstrated the leaching potential of total organic carbon toc and assimilable organic carbon aoc from polymeric materials e g pipes kitchen faucets and shower hoses which change the taste and odor and promote bacterial growth in stagnant tap water in households kelley et al 2014 connell et al 2016 however only a few countries have recommended using the approved components for drinking water systems in terms of changes in the biomass formation on each product surface european countries have augmented guidelines and certification tests for the components such as for biomass production potential bpp the netherlands mean dissolved oxygen demand mdod uk and the w270 method germany although most of the biological guidelines and certifications are not mandatory these approved materials are recommended for use in order to provide better water hygiene and biological stability for customer consumption the guidelines can also be applied for testing the polymeric components of the pou water dispensers however it should be noted that the use of pou devices is most popular in asia pacific countries markets and markets 2014 where there is generally a significant dosing of residual disinfectant in the tap water thus changes in the biological stability of the water caused by the polymeric components and its leachate are often disregarded wen et al 2015 previously suggested the use of a biomig test package that measures the potential for organic leaching and biomass formation simultaneously interacting with the drinking water component surfaces the biomig test provides a fast and reproducible assay of the water deterioration potential induced by polymeric materials the present study is the first to investigate water deterioration and bacterial promotion by pou water dispensers and their component materials the objectives of the study are as follows first we aimed to evaluate the organic migration potentials using the toc and aoc from the pou water dispenser components second we investigated the biomass formation potential net growth of sessile and planktonic bacteria on the polymeric components third the change in water quality through the actual operation of a pou water dispenser was confirmed step by step fourth the resultant biofilm formation on the actual pou water dispenser components i e polymeric component examination was investigated and compared with the biomig results 2 materials and methods 2 1 selected test materials in the present study pe silicone rubber ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm rubber pom abs and pvc were selected as the test materials fig s1 first we selected a commercial pe tube od 6 mm id 3 5 mm approved according to nsf ansi 61 drinking water system components health effects pe is the most commonly used plastic material for the main tube of water dispensers figs 1 and 2 the stability of pe is important because the installed length of the pe tube at least 1 2 m in the pou water dispenser is relatively longer than that of the other materials silicone rubber tubes are often used for the final connections that deliver the finished water from the reservoir to the faucet figs 1b and 2f therefore silicone tubes may have an adverse impact on the final water quality we selected two commercial silicone rubber tubes used for water dispensers which are most commonly used as faucet connection tubes the first one silicone a was a translucent type and relatively larger od 16 mm id 9 mm than the silicone b tube fig s1 the other tube silicone b was a greyish opaque type and relatively small od 9 mm id 7 mm detailed information on the raw materials was not available but we assumed that these silicone rubbers were not approved according to nsf ansi 61 and other certification tests abs is another important material because it is generally used for the water reservoir and its housing in pou water dispenser systems as a relatively large volume of stagnant water sits in the reservoir tank the reservoir components should be more biologically stable than the other polymeric materials i e should release less toc and aoc pom is often used for the tube connector body and collets inside the pou device many of the fitting materials available on the market are approved by nsf and we selected one of them a pom connector body was used after we removed the o ring rubber and collets from the fittings epdm rubber is often used for shower hoses in households however its use is limited to rubber fittings o rings for the pou device systems the migration potential mp test could not be applied to the o ring rubber therefore we selected another commercial epdm shower hose to meet the test conditions e g surface area epdm also served as a reference material with higher organic migration potential as previously reported bucheli witschel et al 2012 wen et al 2015 although the use of pvc is allowed for pou device components we selected pvc as a pipe reference material in this study one commercially available pvc pipe approved according to nsf ansi 61 was used in this study we also used the carbon free glass plates as a negative control 2 2 preparation of the materials to perform the biomig test selected materials were prepared and washed for experimentation we cut all the test materials to provide 100 cm2 of surface area in contact with the water the tubing and pipe pe silicone epdm and pvc samples were regarded as hollow cylinders and cut to meet the contact area based on their inner and outer diameters the abs reservoir housing was cut into four segment plates 5 cm 2 5 cm 12 5 cm2 thus the sum of the surface area in contact with the water met the target 100 cm2 all the prepared materials were rinsed with tap water submerged in ultrapure water for 1 h cleaned in an ultrasound bath 40 khz for 10 min and then washed with ultrapure water to ensure that the test materials were submerged stainless steel wire was used as a test piece holder the washed materials were subsequently used for the migration potential mp and biomass formation potential bfp tests 2 3 migration potential mp test the mp test is the assay protocol used to determine the bulk and biodegradable organic migration from the polymeric surfaces in contact with the drinking water i e toc and aoc respectively although the toc only reveals the bulk organic matter without detailed information about the molecular size hazardous subcomponents and toxicity it is still useful and hygienically important because the toc includes unwanted substances in the water regardless of their chemical structure schuster 2015 on the other hand the aoc reveals the changes in the biological stability in terms of readily biodegradable organic content in the leached toc the procedure for the mp test is as follows each 100 cm2 portion of the test materials was placed in a 100 ml straight sided glass bottle d 60 mm h 77 mm submerged in 100 ml of 0 2 Œºm filtered mineral water evian france surface volume 1 cm 1 and then stored in a water bath for a day at two temperatures 20 or 60 c individually the leachate was retrieved and the process was repeated daily from day 1 m1 to day 7 m7 generally pou water dispensers offer the convenience of cold or hot drinking water ranging from 5 to 90 c according to various migration protocols for drinking water components testing should be conducted under cold 23 2 c warm 60 2 c or hot 85 2 c temperature conditions e g kc jwwa z108 nsf ansi 61 and en 12873 the test conditions should be similar to the temperature conditions under which the materials are actually used the cold migration test is generally regarded as optional in these protocols however we added the cold migration condition to simulate pou water dispensers and the ambient temperature during use european guidelines en 12873 designate the migration cycle in one or three days either 24 1 or 72 1 h for warm and cold migration water respectively to compare both migrations we conducted each warm and cold migration cycle for only 24 h samples m1 m2 and m3 were analyzed based on the en 12873 protocol m6 and m7 leachates were analyzed a detailed comparison between the migration periods is shown in fig s2 2 4 toc and aoc analyses toc nonpurgeable organic carbon was measured using a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan detection limit of method dl 0 1 mg l 1 coefficient of variation cv 1 and then normalized using the water contact surface area of each test component 100 cm2 the background toc of the negative control i e glass was constant at 0 28 0 35 mg l 1 average 0 33 0 03 mg l 1 to determine the net change due to toc migration we subtracted the background toc from that of the daily leachates during the mp test we also confirmed the change in fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the first 24 h samples of leachate m1 using the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem technique due to the low fluorescence of tap water the 3d eem tool provides a fast easy and sensitive method for detecting the leaching of various aromatic and gasoline range organics in each leachate sample park et al 2016 wasswa et al 2019 aoc was determined based on the flow cytometric method for inoculating indigenous bacteria as described elsewhere wen et al 2015 carbon free borosilicate glass vials 50 ml were prepared for further bioassay indigenous bacteria from bottled mineral water evian were used as the inoculum and an aliquot of unfiltered mineral water total cell count tcc 1 2 0 1 105 cells ml 1 was added to 20 ml of each daily leachate m1 7 to make up the initial inoculum count 5000 cells ml 1 for carbon limitation 690 Œºl of mineral supplement was added to each sample see table s2 after incubation for 5 d at 30 c bacterial growth entered the stationary phase and the tcc was measured thereafter a working solution 10 Œºl of sybr green i gel stain 100 invitrogen usa was added to 1 ml of each sample incubated for 10 min at 30 c and then diluted 10 times with sterile water prior to tcc analysis tcc was analyzed using a cube 6 flow cytometer partec germany dl 1000 cells ml 1 cv 2 the conversion factor 1 107 cells Œºg 1 acetate c eq was used to calculate the aoc concentration based on the net growth cell counts in each of the leachate samples all samples were corrected by subtracting the aoc in the negative control samples 20 7 Œºg l 1 2 5 biomass formation potential bfp test the bfp test determines the bacterial growth potential in the leachate planktonic cells as well as on the surface of the test materials sessile cells based on the flow cytometric analysis the planktonic and sessile cell counts during the bfp test were analyzed and used to demonstrate the biomass formation potential of each test material individual pieces 1 3 cm2 of the washed material were also prepared and used for analyzing the resultant sessile growth on the component surface a sterile glass jar was filled with 100 ml of 0 2 Œºm filtered mineral water and evian bottled mineral water was again used as the natural inoculum for bacterial incubation during the bfp test an aliquot 1 ml of unfiltered mineral water 1 2 0 1 105 cells ml 1 was introduced to meet the initial inoculum cell counts in the volume of test water 100 ml mineral medium in the amount of 3 4 ml was added see table s2 the glassware containing the submerged test materials was stored in a temperature controlled orbital incubator shaker 90 rpm at 30 c for 14 d after the incubation period the planktonic bacteria formation potential in the medium water was determined via flow cytometry to determine the sessile bacteria formation potential the test pieces were collected placed in a sterile conical tube submerged in 20 ml of sterile mineral water and sonicated for 10 min using a vcx 130 ultrasonic processor 130 w 20 khz 77 power and 30 s sonication intervals sonics materials inc usa to detach the biofilm from each component surface finally the biofilm suspension was analyzed using flow cytometry and the cell concentration of sessile bacteria was normalized using the analyzed surface area detailed information on biofilm removal via sonication is shown in table s3 2 6 point of use pou device operation and examination the pou water dispenser used in this study was a multiple filtration model consisting of a pre carbon filter alumina nanofiber filter post carbon filter and reservoir water passed through these filtration barriers was stagnant in the 12 l abs reservoir and then was supplied to the customer through a pp faucet fig 2 we collected weekly samples from each treatment step pre carbon membrane filter post carbon and final faucet the ph turbidity and chlorine residual were monitored immediately right after the sample collection the ph was measured with a hq40d portable meter hach usa and the turbidity was measured with a 2100q portable meter hach the chlorine residual was determined by the standard orthotoluidine method for which the dl was 0 02 mg l 1 the water dispenser was operated at room temperature for 10 weeks october 2017 january 2018 n 10 but the tap water i e influent temperature fluctuated seasonally during this study therefore we compared the first half of the dataset october november 2017 n 5 with the latter half that was obtained during the winter december 2017 january 2018 n 5 after 10 weeks of operation the pou water dispenser was disassembled into its individual components for examination all components including the tubing fittings connectors reservoir and faucet were analyzed for the biomass concentration on each surface in brief a sterilized cotton bud was used to collect the biomass as described in boe hansen et al 2003 the collected biomass was resuspended in prefiltered mineral water evian the hpc tcc and adenosine triphosphate atp in the mineral water with the resuspended biomass were analyzed and the results were thereafter normalized by the surface area cm2 2 7 microbial analysis hpc tcc atp and total coliform hpc tcc atp and total coliform were used for the analysis of the pou water dispenser effluents and the biofilm was swabbed from the disassembled components in south korea the regulated threshold for hpc in tap water is under 100 cfu ml 1 but the hpc level guideline for water dispenser effluent was recently revised and removed based on the absence of hygienic relevance who 2002 nier 2018 however we monitored the change in hpc through the device system as an indicator of the general microbial quality of the water for hpc autoclaved r2a agar was used as a culture medium the samples that exceeded 200 cfu ml 1 were diluted with a pbs buffer and analyzed again total coliform had been regarded as a typical health relevant fecal contamination and regulatory parameter for drinking water in this study total coliform was also enumerated using the enzyme substrate test standard method 9223 tcc is an emerging parameter used as a drinking water monitoring technique having the advantages of fast detection of nonculturable bacteria van nevel et al 2017 tcc was used in this study to compare the results of the bfp and biofilm swabbing test for the device components each 1 ml aliquot of pou water dispenser effluent and swabbed biomass resuspension were transferred into sterile tubes 1 5 ml a working solution 10 Œºl of sybr green i gel stain 100 was added to each sample and stained for 10 min at 30 c considering the relatively low cell density in the effluent of pou water dispensers 103 105 cells ml 1 the dilution of stained samples was minimized to two times the stained samples were diluted with sterile water and then analyzed using a cube 6 flow cytometer atp is often used for drinking water monitoring because it is a fast and sensitive assay for microbial detection in tap water lautenschlager et al 2010 bactiter glo promega usa working reagent was thawed at room temperature for 30 min prior to mixing with the samples a 100 Œºl sample of water and reagent 1 1 was mixed gently and then incubated at 30 c for 1 min a glomax 20 20 luminometer promega was used to read the relative luminescence per sample and the values were converted to total atp concentrations dl 0 02 nmol l 1 cv 2 2 8 statistical analysis mean comparison pearson correlation and analysis of variance anova were performed using the pasw statistics program spss inc il usa the dataset had equal variance for the post hoc test fisher s least significant difference lsd method was used to determine significant changes p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 toc migration potential and fluorescence changes in the migration water the selected materials for commercial use in pou water dispensers were compared using the biomig test to evaluate changes in the water quality induced by these water contacting materials although the toc is weakly related to bacterial growth proctor et al 2016 it is still important due to its relationship to the odor and taste of the water and the gasoline range hydrocarbons leaching from the polymeric pipes as described by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2002 the present study compared the toc migration from the selected materials under two temperature conditions i e 20 and 60 c we observed a dramatic difference in the leached toc which certainly varied with the polymer type and water temperature fig 3 bucheli witschel et al 2012 reported that an elevated water temperature might maximize the organics leaching from the polymeric surfaces because it could enhance the migration rates and the interaction between the water phase and the polymeric component surfaces in this regard we also confirmed a higher sum of toc migration at warm temperatures 2 66 Œºg cm 2 compared to that at cold temperatures 1 27 Œºg cm 2 silicone b and pom showed a dramatic decrease in the total sum of toc via cold migration 92 94 decrease versus that of warm migration fig 3a and b therefore the water temperature significantly influenced the migration potentials most of the selected materials showed a declining trend in the daily toc migration from m1 to m7 except for that of silicone b fig 3 and table s4 the lowest sum of toc was seen with pe 1 1 Œºg cm 2 cold migration followed by pvc 1 3 Œºg cm 2 and abs 2 0 Œºg cm 2 these materials were relatively stable under both migration temperature conditions 1 2 and 2 4 Œºg cm 2 cold and warm migration respectively compared to the epdm and pom silicones 3 27 and 19 66 Œºg cm 2 cold and warm migration respectively the most problematic toc migration result was with flexible material such as silicone a followed by silicone b and epdm fig 3 the total sum of toc from silicone a was 66 and 27 Œºg cm 2 for warm and cold migration respectively silicone b migration was 49 and 3 Œºg cm 2 for warm and cold migration respectively epdm migration was 42 and 14 Œºg cm 2 for the total sum of toc for warm and cold migration respectively to summarize material selection based on the mp test results would evidently improve the quality of water supplied directly to the customer we recommend not exposing the silicone hose to warm water and minimizing its usage to improve the hygiene and water quality in pou water dispensers based on the toc migration test to investigate the leaching of dissolved organic matter during the mp test we also analyzed the change in fluorescence characteristics of the polymer leachates i e first 24 h of migration at warm temperature using the 3d eem the results confirmed that the net changes in the fluorescent dissolved organic matter induced by the polymeric materials differed considerably from the patterns of the natural organic fluorescence regions particularly that of the humic rich water a region ex 260 em 380 460 and c region ex 350 em 420 480 nm park et al 2016 wasswa et al 2019 fig s3 the eem contour plot showed that the change in the leachate fluorescence was in the range of relatively short excitation emission wavelengths in all cases the usepa 2002 reported that leached organics from pipe materials mainly included gasoline range organics therefore we could conclude that the changes in organic migration and fluorescent dissolved organic matter characteristics in the samples were influenced by plasticizers polymerization products and unknown hydrocarbons exhibiting gasoline range organic properties the highest fluorescence intensity was observed with the epdm leachate maximum peak 1 104 au arbitrary unit followed by that of abs pe pom silicone a and silicone b pvc leachate showed negligible change among the polymer materials in this study the pvc pipe was relatively leach resistant compared to the other polymeric materials with respect to both toc and eem possibly due to its structure i e amorphous glassy polymer usepa 2002 however bucheli witschel et al 2012 used pvc as a leaching positive material in their migration tests thus the polymer names and types e g pvc pe etc do not guarantee the stability of the material the organic migration can vary depending on the recipe of test materials softeners and manufacturer therefore all commercially available products should be tested individually meanwhile the toc and eem offered limited information about the leached organic contents and their properties in particular the influence of the leachate on human health is unknown based on the biomig test results hence we suggest the application of other analytical methods such as size exclusion gas chromatography fourier transform infrared technique electrospray ionization and toxicity tests to further understand the hygienic relevance and water quality changes induced by the leached organics brocca et al 2002 usepa 2002 wras 2013 connell et al 2016 3 2 aoc migration potential previous studies have revealed that various polymeric materials and their leachates contain considerable amounts of aoc bucheli witschel et al 2012 wen et al 2015 connell et al 2016 proctor et al 2016 in the present study the aoc of the selected materials ranged from 0 1 to 1 2 Œºg cm 2 fig 4 the aoc contents in toc were 0 5 20 6 and 1 1 36 6 under warm 60 c and cold 20 c temperature conditions respectively table s5 and the correlation between the migrated aoc and toc was low table 1 the aoc was essential for revealing the biological impact of the leachates on biofilm formation potentials and it varied between the warm and cold migration tests fig 4a and b under warm migration the highest aoc was observed for the silicone b tube 1 2 Œºg cm 2 followed by abs pom and silicone a 0 9 0 6 and 0 5 Œºg cm 2 respectively the highest aoc under the cold migration test was observed for silicone a and b both 0 6 Œºg cm 2 followed by pe and abs the silicone tubes showed a relatively higher aoc migration potential among the selected materials under both temperature conditions similar to the toc results the aoc migration potentials of silicone b pom and abs varied with the temperature conditions based on the present results it is important to determine the impact of various water temperatures on the biostability of the polymeric components in water dispensers epdm showed the lowest aoc migration potential under both temperature conditions but we believe that the selected epdm inhibited bacterial growth resulting in an underestimation of the aoc content fig s4 it should be noted that the bacterial inhibition of the selected epdm may have been due to the plasticizer or antimicrobial coating content wen et al 2015 proctor et al 2016 according to the eem and toc the epdm leachate showed a high content of aromatic or unsaturated hydrocarbons whereas the silicone leachate possibly contained a lower aromatic content fig s3 the present study did not include the pathogen growth potential however wen et al 2015 previously reported that escherichia coli o157 consumed 17 19 of the total aoc migrated from the drinking water components pe polybutylene and epdm the rate of aoc consumption by each pathogen inoculum e coli o157 vibrio cholerae and pseudomonas aeruginosa also varied by the type of polymer 3 3 biofilm formation potentials the bfp test was conducted via batch experiment using flow cytometry the results showed high accumulations of biomass in most of the leachates except for that of epdm the growth potential for planktonic bacteria was generally several times higher than that for sessile bacteria the greatest planktonic growth was observed for the silicone a followed by abs and silicone b blank bars fig 5 similar to the planktonic growth the highest sessile growth was observed for the silicone a followed by abs and silicone b filled bars fig 5 regarding the biofilm formation process the planktonic bacteria may serve as seeds for the initial attachment of bacteria to the surfaces of the pou device components resulting in the development of biofilm this shows that the interaction between the planktonic and sessile bacteria might result in each type of bacteria promoting the growth of the other according to the sessile growth the microbially safest material was epdm followed by pvc pom and pe as mentioned earlier the minimum biomass formation in the epdm leachate was not surprising due to the bacterial inhibition of epdm fig s4 it is also worthy to note that the relative cell size of the sessile bacteria on the epdm was smaller than that of the others p 0 05 table s6 regarding the limited use of the epdm o ring rubber in a single water dispenser the impact of epdm was negligible hence the bfp results show that the pvc pom and pe are relatively stable materials for pou water treatment devices in contrast the silicone rubber tubes and abs reservoir enhanced the bacterial growth in the water dispenser system 3 4 summary of biomig test the biomig test successfully confirmed that the test materials in contact with water and their leachates boosted the bacterial growth and biofilm formation in a comparison between the aoc and bfp the relationship between the aoc and bfp results demonstrate that the formation of sessile and planktonic bacteria was relatively highly correlated with the leaching of aoc content under cold temperature conditions r 0 93 and 0 92 p 0 01 as shown in table 1 on the other hand aoc under warm temperature conditions was not significantly correlated with biomass formation r 0 37 0 66 p 0 05 previous studies have explained that the elevated water temperature enhanced the organic migration rates and possibly resulted in maximized aoc migration potential bucheli witschel et al 2012 even though the cold water test underestimated the organic migration the biofilm potentials in water dispensers can be better predicted by the cold water mp test because water dispensers are generally operated at room temperature however it is worthwhile to estimate the mp using various water temperatures for each polymeric component water dispensers often serve chilled or boiled water through the final faucet and tubes therefore the actual biofilm formation on each component may depend on the contact water temperature previous studies mainly focused on the biomig test results normalized by the surface area however the materials that contact the water have different surface areas in actual water dispenser devices considering that the length of the silicone tube used for a single pou water dispenser was only 20 30 cm fig 1 the actual surface area of the pe tube and abs reservoir in an actual water dispenser was higher than the test surface area 100 cm2 for example 2 m of pe tube provides approximately 220 cm2 of contact area whereas the abs reservoir in this study 15 l provides approximately 3100 cm2 table s7 therefore the material for the water reservoir tank should be more carefully selected among the polymeric components such as the tubing housing and fittings of the pou device system meanwhile a variety of polymeric materials are still being used in pou water dispenser devices and their impact on bacterial growth promotion is unknown based on the experimental results of the present study further analysis of the actual surface area used in pou water dispenser systems is also necessary 3 5 water quality provided by the pou water dispenser the biomig test confirmed that bacterial growth can be promoted by polymeric materials but many other parameters are also involved in the bacterial growth and biofilm formation in pou water dispenser devices to evaluate the bacterial growth using an actual device we operated and monitored a commercially available pou water dispenser and its effluent for 10 weeks the schematic diagram of the pou device fig 2 shows each treatment step inside the device chlorinated tap water i e influent was introduced to the pre carbon filter after which the water went through the nanofiber filter post carbon filter reservoir and faucet table 2 the ph did not change remained within the range 7 5 7 7 the turbidity significantly decreased from 0 33 to 0 15 ntu p value 0 05 the highest removal of turbidity was observed with the pre carbon filter 39 followed by the nanofiber filter 26 the residual chlorine in the feed water was 0 17 0 04 mg l 1 and met the requirement for tap water in south korea minimum 0 1 mg l 1 as expected the chlorine residuals rapidly decreased through the pre carbon filter and were below the detection limit in the subsequent effluents from the nanofiber filter post carbon filter and at the faucet nescerecka et al 2014 reported that the decline in chlorine residuals could result in significant bacterial growth throughout the subsequent parts of the system hence it should be noted that during the following device treatment steps e g nanofiber and post carbon filters the tubing and fittings could provide an ideal environment for bacterial growth and biofilm formation 3 6 bacterial growth through pou water dispenser and examination of its components tcc atp hpc and total coliform in the pou water dispenser effluent were also analyzed table 2 although the tcc is not regulated by the present water quality guidelines worldwide an abnormal change in tcc can be regarded as an indicator of the water treatment performance the analysis results revealed that tcc undoubtedly increased from 0 32 to 1 59 105 cells ml 1 significance level 0 06 through the pou water dispenser the bacterial density doubled through the pre carbon filter increased 1 7 fold after the nanofiber filter and doubled again through the reservoir i e faucet effluent however the total atp increased slightly from 0 03 to 0 05 nmol l 1 through the device and it was not statistically significant significance level 0 33 table 2 in our previous study park et al 2016 the total atp mainly consisted of free atp in chlorinated tap water 0 7 mg cl2 l 1 therefore the total atp in the feed water was likely free atp accordingly the intracellular atp should be measured to determine the biomass in chlorinated tap water but this was not performed in the present study lautenschlager et al 2010 reported that the increased magnitude of hpc in stagnant water 4 580 fold was higher than that of the intact cell counts and bacterial atp 1 6 3 2 fold and 1 7 18 fold respectively therefore the conventional hpc assay is still important for characterizing the microbial changes such as cultivability hpc in the influent was 12 16 cfu ml 1 which met the korean regulations for tap water 100 cfu ml 1 however it increased dramatically through the treatment steps from 0 01 to 20 01 103 cfu ml 1 hpc in the feed water increased 57 fold after the pre carbon filter the subsequent steps namely the nanofiber filter and post carbon filter resulted in an increase in hpc of 1 4 and 2 5 times respectively in the finished water from the faucet hpc increased dramatically by 8 3 times possibly due to water stagnation in the reservoir hpc increased by 1600 times from the influent to the final faucet and it was higher than that of the overnight stagnant tap water nonchlorinated 0 87 1 00 103 cfu ml 1 lautenschlager et al 2010 therefore hpc from the pou device exceeded the tap water regulations less than 100 300 cfu ml 1 in relevant countries including south korea germany and switzerland van nevel et al 2017 nier 2018 it is also important to note that the who 2002 suggested minimizing abnormal changes in the hpc regardless of its health risk however total coliform was not detected in any of the samples in the present study hence the increase in hpc was not related to health relevant microorganisms in a comparison of the sampling periods the greatest increase in hpc occurred in the first half of the device operation october november 2017 and hpc in the finished water ranged from 11 2 to 77 4 103 cfu ml 1 on the other hand hpc was much lower during the second half of the device operation 1 9 103 cfu ml 1 december 2017 january 2018 the source water temperature in the present system was 14 5 and 3 1 c for the first half and the second half of the study periods respectively water environment information system republic of korea accessed november 2018 zlatanovic et al 2017 also reported that hpc in stagnant water in building plumbing was considerably lower during the winter experiment therefore it is reasonable that the hpc level was impacted not only by the pou device structures e g pre carbon filter but also by the feed water temperature after 10 weeks of operating the pou water dispenser we disassembled the device components that contacted the water e g tubes reservoir and fittings the biofilms on each component were not seen visually but microbial assays such as hpc tcc and atp verified the presence of biofilm formation on the components fig 6 the results showed dramatic differences in biofilm formation on each component surface the hpc tcc and atp results for the pe tubes and the pom connectors were relatively low compared to those of the silicone tube abs reservoir and pp faucet corresponding to previous results it was notable that the highest biofilm concentration was found on the silicone tube again the hpc tcc and atp concentrations on the silicone tube were at least 3 fold higher than that of the pe tubes atp on the silicone tube exceeded the bpp pass fail limit 1000 pg or 1 97 nmol atp cm 2 meanwhile the atp level on the pe and pom components was lower than the pass fail limit fig 6 to sum up the silicone tube was revealed as the most problematic material based not only on the biomig prediction tools but also on the biofilm swabbing test proctor et al 2016 previously compared the biomass concentrations resulting from the bfp test and a realistic building plumbing simulator and they found correlations in terms of biofilm formation the study concluded that the biomig test was a useful prediction tool for biofilm formation diagnosis the tendency for biofilm formation on polymeric components could vary with their physical characteristics such as material diameter and roughness douterelo et al 2014 based on this study the biofilm could preferentially develop on specific components in pou water dispensers as predicted by the biomig test 4 conclusions adverse effects from the pou water dispenser components were confirmed including heterotrophic growth bacterial growth promotion and biofilm formation the study results indicate the importance of material selection for the pou systems the key findings are as follows hpc and tcc increased in pou water dispenser systems as the result of no chlorine residual the biomig test results revealed that organic migration and biofilm formation varied according to the polymer types used in pou water dispenser components and aoc migration in cold water was highly correlated with the biofilm formation potential prior to water dispenser operation the biomig test was useful for estimating the biofilm formation potential on the polymeric components used in the pou water dispenser the use of polymers with high biofilm formation between the reservoir and the faucet should be minimized for pou water dispensers whereas the approved polymeric components contributed to biological stability in the water dispenser effluent declaration of competing

specifically the heterotrophic plate count increased from 0 01 to 20 01 103 of colony forming units per ml the biomig test which evaluates the biostability of polymeric materials based on the

2010 stalter et al 2016 girolamini et al 2019 according to the market share statistics pou devices have become increasingly popular worldwide the pou device market was valued at 14 billion dollars in 2014 with an expected annual growth of 9 9 worldwide markets and markets 2014 this is particularly true in south korea where half the households use pou water dispensers nier 2018 interestingly the korean ministry of environment recently reported that the effluent from 52 of the tested water dispensers 261 of 505 exceeded the hpc threshold of the korean tap water regulations 100 cfu ml 1 among which 20 exceeded 500 cfu ml 1 whereas the chlorinated tap water used to feed the dispenser met the regulatory level nier 2018 although the hpc is not a health related parameter who 2002 it can be useful for evaluating the overall performance of pou water dispensers and the microbial changes in the finished water it is worthy to note that enteric organisms and other pathogens were also detected in the dispensed water girolamini et al 2019 therefore the adverse impact on the water quality through the dispenser systems cannot be disregarded recent studies have highlighted the importance of bacterial problems in building plumbing systems which have a higher surface area to volume ratio longer water stagnation time at warm temperatures and faster disinfectant decay compared to those in water distribution pipelines lautenschlager et al 2010 wen et al 2015 proctor et al 2016 zlatanovic et al 2017 pou water dispensers share these same conditions most commercial water dispenser systems are equipped with a water reservoir membrane filters carbon filters and various other treatment units thus the device structures are compact and complex fig 1 the surface area in contact with the water increases substantially because the inner diameters of the tubing for such devices are also small 6 10 mm moreover there is usually stagnant water in the reservoir inside the device thus the water contacting area and the stagnation of water provided via the pou water dispenser cannot be underestimated in relation to that of the building plumbing also as both cold and warm water are available through the water dispenser temperature is likely another factor related to the problems in pou water dispensers hence the selection of polymeric materials e g tubing fittings and reservoir for pou water dispensers in contact with tap water must be carefully considered due to the versatility of polymeric products i e plastic and rubber many types of polymer have been widely used for drinking water systems in south korea over 20 types of components containing polymeric materials are approved for use in pou water dispensers including acrylonitrile butadiene styrene abs polyethylene

ansi 61 us bs 6920 uk ktw guideline germany and en 1420 12873 eu the problem is that several polymeric materials may allow the migration of organics that are biologically utilizable previous studies have successfully demonstrated the leaching potential of total organic carbon toc and assimilable organic carbon aoc from polymeric materials e g pipes kitchen faucets and shower hoses which change the taste and odor and promote bacterial growth in stagnant tap water in households kelley et al 2014 connell et al 2016 however only a few countries have recommended using the approved components for drinking water systems in terms of changes in the biomass formation on each product surface european countries have augmented guidelines and certification tests for the components such as for biomass production potential bpp the netherlands mean dissolved oxygen demand mdod uk and the w270 method germany although most of the biological guidelines and certifications are not mandatory these approved materials are recommended for use in order to provide better water hygiene and biological stability for customer consumption the guidelines can also be applied for testing the polymeric components of the pou water dispensers however it should be noted that the use of pou devices is most popular in asia pacific countries markets and markets 2014 where there is generally a significant dosing of residual disinfectant in the tap water thus changes in the biological stability of the water caused by the polymeric components and its leachate are often disregarded wen et al 2015 previously suggested the use of a biomig test package that measures the potential for organic leaching and biomass formation simultaneously interacting with the drinking water component surfaces the biomig test provides a fast and reproducible assay of the water deterioration potential induced by polymeric materials the present study is the first to investigate water deterioration and bacterial promotion by pou water dispensers and their component materials the objectives of the study are as follows first we aimed to evaluate the organic migration potentials using the toc and aoc from the pou water dispenser components second we investigated the biomass formation potential net growth of sessile and planktonic bacteria on the polymeric components third the change in water quality through the actual operation of a pou water dispenser was confirmed step by step fourth the resultant biofilm formation on the actual pou water dispenser components i e polymeric component examination was investigated and compared with the biomig results 2 materials and methods 2 1 selected test materials in the present study pe silicone rubber ethylene propylene diene monomer epdm rubber pom abs and pvc were selected as the test materials fig s1 first we selected a commercial pe tube od 6 mm id 3 5 mm approved according to nsf ansi 61 drinking water system components health effects pe is the most commonly used plastic material for the main tube of water dispensers figs 1 and 2 the stability of pe is important because the installed length of the pe tube at least 1 2 m in the pou water dispenser is relatively longer than that of the other materials silicone rubber tubes are often used for the final connections that deliver the finished water from the reservoir to the faucet figs 1b and 2f therefore silicone tubes may have an adverse impact on the final water quality we selected two commercial silicone rubber tubes used for water dispensers which are most commonly used as faucet connection tubes the first one silicone a was a translucent type and relatively larger od 16 mm id 9 mm than the silicone b tube fig s1 the other tube silicone b was a greyish opaque type and relatively small od 9 mm id 7 mm detailed information on the raw materials was not available but we assumed that these silicone rubbers were not approved according to nsf ansi 61 and other certification tests abs is another important material because it is generally used for the water reservoir and its housing in pou water dispenser systems as a relatively large volume of stagnant water sits in the reservoir tank the reservoir components should be more biologically stable than the other polymeric materials i e should release less toc and aoc pom is often used for the tube connector body and collets inside the pou device many of the fitting materials available on the market are approved by nsf and we selected one of them a pom connector body was used after we removed the o ring rubber and collets from the fittings epdm rubber is often used for shower hoses in households however its use is limited to rubber fittings o rings for the pou device systems the migration potential mp test could not be applied to the o ring rubber therefore we selected another commercial epdm shower hose to meet the test conditions e g surface area epdm also served as a reference material with higher organic migration potential as previously reported bucheli witschel et al 2012 wen et al 2015 although the use of pvc is allowed for pou device components we selected pvc as a pipe reference material in this study one commercially available pvc pipe approved according to nsf ansi 61 was used in this study we also used the carbon free glass plates as a negative control 2 2 preparation of the materials to perform the biomig test selected materials were prepared and washed for experimentation we cut all the test materials to provide 100 cm2 of surface area in contact with the water the tubing and pipe pe silicone epdm and pvc samples were regarded as hollow cylinders and cut to meet the contact area based on their inner and outer diameters the abs reservoir housing was cut into four segment plates 5 cm 2 5 cm 12 5 cm2 thus the sum of the surface area in contact with the water met the target 100 cm2 all the prepared materials were rinsed with tap water submerged in ultrapure water for 1 h cleaned in an ultrasound bath 40 khz for 10 min and then washed with ultrapure water to ensure that the test materials were submerged stainless steel wire was used as a test piece holder the washed materials were subsequently used for the migration potential mp and biomass formation potential bfp tests 2 3 migration potential mp test the mp test is the assay protocol used to determine the bulk and biodegradable organic migration from the polymeric surfaces in contact with the drinking water i e toc and aoc respectively although the toc only reveals the bulk organic matter without detailed information about the molecular size hazardous subcomponents and toxicity it is still useful and hygienically important because the toc includes unwanted substances in the water regardless of their chemical structure schuster 2015 on the other hand the aoc reveals the changes in the biological stability in terms of readily biodegradable organic content in the leached toc the procedure for the mp test is as follows each 100 cm2 portion of the test materials was placed in a 100 ml straight sided glass bottle d 60 mm h 77 mm submerged in 100 ml of 0 2 Œºm filtered mineral water evian france surface volume 1 cm 1 and then stored in a water bath for a day at two temperatures 20 or 60 c individually the leachate was retrieved and the process was repeated daily from day 1 m1 to day 7 m7 generally pou water dispensers offer the convenience of cold or hot drinking water ranging from 5 to 90 c according to various migration protocols for drinking water components testing should be conducted under cold 23 2 c warm 60 2 c or hot 85 2 c temperature conditions e g kc jwwa z108 nsf ansi 61 and en 12873 the test conditions should be similar to the temperature conditions under which the materials are actually used the cold migration test is generally regarded as optional in these protocols however we added the cold migration condition to simulate pou water dispensers and the ambient temperature during use european guidelines en 12873 designate the migration cycle in one or three days either 24 1 or 72 1 h for warm and cold migration water respectively to compare both migrations we conducted each warm and cold migration cycle for only 24 h samples m1 m2 and m3 were analyzed based on the en 12873 protocol m6 and m7 leachates were analyzed a detailed comparison between the migration periods is shown in fig s2 2 4 toc and aoc analyses toc nonpurgeable organic carbon was measured using a toc vcph analyzer shimadzu japan detection limit of method dl 0 1 mg l 1 coefficient of variation cv 1 and then normalized using the water contact surface area of each test component 100 cm2 the background toc of the negative control i e glass was constant at 0 28 0 35 mg l 1 average 0 33 0 03 mg l 1 to determine the net change due to toc migration we subtracted the background toc from that of the daily leachates during the mp test we also confirmed the change in fluorescent dissolved organic matter in the first 24 h samples of leachate m1 using the three dimensional excitation emission matrix 3d eem technique due to the low fluorescence of tap water the 3d eem tool provides a fast easy and sensitive method for detecting the leaching of various aromatic and gasoline range organics in each leachate sample park et al 2016 wasswa et al 2019 aoc was determined based on the flow cytometric method for inoculating indigenous bacteria as described elsewhere wen et al 2015 carbon free borosilicate glass vials 50 ml were prepared for further bioassay indigenous bacteria from bottled mineral water evian were used as the inoculum and an aliquot of unfiltered mineral water total cell count tcc 1 2 0 1 105 cells ml 1 was added to 20 ml of each daily leachate m1 7 to make up the initial inoculum count 5000 cells ml 1 for carbon limitation 690 Œºl of mineral supplement was added to each sample see table s2 after incubation for 5 d at 30 c bacterial growth entered the stationary phase and the tcc was measured thereafter a working solution 10 Œºl of sybr green i gel stain 100 invitrogen usa was added to 1 ml of each sample incubated for 10 min at 30 c and then diluted 10 times with sterile water prior to tcc analysis tcc was analyzed using a cube 6 flow cytometer partec germany dl 1000 cells ml 1 cv 2 the conversion factor 1 107 cells Œºg 1 acetate c eq was used to calculate the aoc concentration based on the net growth cell counts in each of the leachate samples all samples were corrected by subtracting the aoc in the negative control samples 20 7 Œºg l 1 2 5 biomass formation potential bfp test the bfp test determines the bacterial growth potential in the leachate planktonic cells as well as on the surface of the test materials sessile cells based on the flow cytometric analysis the planktonic and sessile cell counts during the bfp test were analyzed and used to demonstrate the biomass formation potential of each test material individual pieces 1 3 cm2 of the washed material were also prepared and used for analyzing the resultant sessile growth on the component surface a sterile glass jar was filled with 100 ml of 0 2 Œºm filtered mineral water and evian bottled mineral water was again used as the natural inoculum for bacterial incubation during the bfp test an aliquot 1 ml of unfiltered mineral water 1 2 0 1 105 cells ml 1 was introduced to meet the initial inoculum cell counts in the volume of test water 100 ml mineral medium in the amount of 3 4 ml was added see table s2 the glassware containing the submerged test materials was stored in a temperature controlled orbital incubator shaker 90 rpm at 30 c for 14 d after the incubation period the planktonic bacteria formation potential in the medium water was determined via flow cytometry to determine the sessile bacteria formation potential the test pieces were collected placed in a sterile conical tube submerged in 20 ml of sterile mineral water and sonicated for 10 min using a vcx 130 ultrasonic processor 130 w 20 khz 77 power and 30 s sonication intervals sonics materials inc usa to detach the biofilm from each component surface finally the biofilm suspension was analyzed using flow cytometry and the cell concentration of sessile bacteria was normalized using the analyzed surface area detailed information on biofilm removal via sonication is shown in table s3 2 6 point of use pou device operation and examination the pou water dispenser used in this study was a multiple filtration model consisting of a pre carbon filter alumina nanofiber filter post carbon filter and reservoir water passed through these filtration barriers was stagnant in the 12 l abs reservoir and then was supplied to the customer through a pp faucet fig 2 we collected weekly samples from each treatment step pre carbon membrane filter post carbon and final faucet the ph turbidity and chlorine residual were monitored immediately right after the sample collection the ph was measured with a hq40d portable meter hach usa and the turbidity was measured with a 2100q portable meter hach the chlorine residual was determined by the standard orthotoluidine method for which the dl was 0 02 mg l 1 the water dispenser was operated at room temperature for 10 weeks october 2017 january 2018 n 10 but the tap water i e influent temperature fluctuated seasonally during this study therefore we compared the first half of the dataset october november 2017 n 5 with the latter half that was obtained during the winter december 2017 january 2018 n 5 after 10 weeks of operation the pou water dispenser was disassembled into its individual components for examination all components including the tubing fittings connectors reservoir and faucet were analyzed for the biomass concentration on each surface in brief a sterilized cotton bud was used to collect the biomass as described in boe hansen et al 2003 the collected biomass was resuspended in prefiltered mineral water evian the hpc tcc and adenosine triphosphate atp in the mineral water with the resuspended biomass were analyzed and the results were thereafter normalized by the surface area cm2 2 7 microbial analysis hpc tcc atp and total coliform hpc tcc atp and total coliform were used for the analysis of the pou water dispenser effluents and the biofilm was swabbed from the disassembled components in south korea the regulated threshold for hpc in tap water is under 100 cfu ml 1 but the hpc level guideline for water dispenser effluent was recently revised and removed based on the absence of hygienic relevance who 2002 nier 2018 however we monitored the change in hpc through the device system as an indicator of the general microbial quality of the water for hpc autoclaved r2a agar was used as a culture medium the samples that exceeded 200 cfu ml 1 were diluted with a pbs buffer and analyzed again total coliform had been regarded as a typical health relevant fecal contamination and regulatory parameter for drinking water in this study total coliform was also enumerated using the enzyme substrate test standard method 9223 tcc is an emerging parameter used as a drinking water monitoring technique having the advantages of fast detection of nonculturable bacteria van nevel et al 2017 tcc was used in this study to compare the results of the bfp and biofilm swabbing test for the device components each 1 ml aliquot of pou water dispenser effluent and swabbed biomass resuspension were transferred into sterile tubes 1 5 ml a working solution 10 Œºl of sybr green i gel stain 100 was added to each sample and stained for 10 min at 30 c considering the relatively low cell density in the effluent of pou water dispensers 103 105 cells ml 1 the dilution of stained samples was minimized to two times the stained samples were diluted with sterile water and then analyzed using a cube 6 flow cytometer atp is often used for drinking water monitoring because it is a fast and sensitive assay for microbial detection in tap water lautenschlager et al 2010 bactiter glo promega usa working reagent was thawed at room temperature for 30 min prior to mixing with the samples a 100 Œºl sample of water and reagent 1 1 was mixed gently and then incubated at 30 c for 1 min a glomax 20 20 luminometer promega was used to read the relative luminescence per sample and the values were converted to total atp concentrations dl 0 02 nmol l 1 cv 2 2 8 statistical analysis mean comparison pearson correlation and analysis of variance anova were performed using the pasw statistics program spss inc il usa the dataset had equal variance for the post hoc test fisher s least significant difference lsd method was used to determine significant changes p value 0 05 3 results and discussion 3 1 toc migration potential and fluorescence changes in the migration water the selected materials for commercial use in pou water dispensers were compared using the biomig test to evaluate changes in the water quality induced by these water contacting materials although the toc is weakly related to bacterial growth proctor et al 2016 it is still important due to its relationship to the odor and taste of the water and the gasoline range hydrocarbons leaching from the polymeric pipes as described by the united states environmental protection agency usepa 2002 the present study compared the toc migration from the selected materials under two temperature conditions i e 20 and 60 c we observed a dramatic difference in the leached toc which certainly varied with the polymer type and water temperature fig 3 bucheli witschel et al 2012 reported that an elevated water temperature might maximize the organics leaching from the polymeric surfaces because it could enhance the migration rates and the interaction between the water phase and the polymeric component surfaces in this regard we also confirmed a higher sum of toc migration at warm temperatures 2 66 Œºg cm 2 compared to that at cold temperatures 1 27 Œºg cm 2 silicone b and pom showed a dramatic decrease in the total sum of toc via cold migration 92 94 decrease versus that of warm migration fig 3a and b therefore the water temperature significantly influenced the migration potentials most of the selected materials showed a declining trend in the daily toc migration from m1 to m7 except for that of silicone b fig 3 and table s4 the lowest sum of toc was seen with pe 1 1 Œºg cm 2 cold migration followed by pvc 1 3 Œºg cm 2 and abs 2 0 Œºg cm 2 these materials were relatively stable under both migration temperature conditions 1 2 and 2 4 Œºg cm 2 cold and warm migration respectively compared to the epdm and pom silicones 3 27 and 19 66 Œºg cm 2 cold and warm migration respectively the most problematic toc migration result was with flexible material such as silicone a followed by silicone b and epdm fig 3 the total sum of toc from silicone a was 66 and 27 Œºg cm 2 for warm and cold migration respectively silicone b migration was 49 and 3 Œºg cm 2 for warm and cold migration respectively epdm migration was 42 and 14 Œºg cm 2 for the total sum of toc for warm and cold migration respectively to summarize material selection based on the mp test results would evidently improve the quality of water supplied directly to the customer we recommend not exposing the silicone hose to warm water and minimizing its usage to improve the hygiene and water quality in pou water dispensers based on the toc migration test to investigate the leaching of dissolved organic matter during the mp test we also analyzed the change in fluorescence characteristics of the polymer leachates i e first 24 h of migration at warm temperature using the 3d eem the results confirmed that the net changes in the fluorescent dissolved organic matter induced by the polymeric materials differed considerably from the patterns of the natural organic fluorescence regions particularly that of the humic rich water a region ex 260 em 380 460 and c region ex 350 em 420 480 nm park et al 2016 wasswa et al 2019 fig s3 the eem contour plot showed that the change in the leachate fluorescence was in the range of relatively short excitation emission wavelengths in all cases the usepa 2002 reported that leached organics from pipe materials mainly included gasoline range organics therefore we could conclude that the changes in organic migration and fluorescent dissolved organic matter characteristics in the samples were influenced by plasticizers polymerization products and unknown hydrocarbons exhibiting gasoline range organic properties the highest fluorescence intensity was observed with the epdm leachate maximum peak 1 104 au arbitrary unit followed by that of abs pe pom silicone a and silicone b pvc leachate showed negligible change among the polymer materials in this study the pvc pipe was relatively leach resistant compared to the other polymeric materials with respect to both toc and eem possibly due to its structure i e amorphous glassy polymer usepa 2002 however bucheli witschel et al 2012 used pvc as a leaching positive material in their migration tests thus the polymer names and types e g pvc pe etc do not guarantee the stability of the material the organic migration can vary depending on the recipe of test materials softeners and manufacturer therefore all commercially available products should be tested individually meanwhile the toc and eem offered limited information about the leached organic contents and their properties in particular the influence of the leachate on human health is unknown based on the biomig test results hence we suggest the application of other analytical methods such as size exclusion gas chromatography fourier transform infrared technique electrospray ionization and toxicity tests to further understand the hygienic relevance and water quality changes induced by the leached organics brocca et al 2002 usepa 2002 wras 2013 connell et al 2016 3 2 aoc migration potential previous studies have revealed that various polymeric materials and their leachates contain considerable amounts of aoc bucheli witschel et al 2012 wen et al 2015 connell et al 2016 proctor et al 2016 in the present study the aoc of the selected materials ranged from 0 1 to 1 2 Œºg cm 2 fig 4 the aoc contents in toc were 0 5 20 6 and 1 1 36 6 under warm 60 c and cold 20 c temperature conditions respectively table s5 and the correlation between the migrated aoc and toc was low table 1 the aoc was essential for revealing the biological impact of the leachates on biofilm formation potentials and it varied between the warm and cold migration tests fig 4a and b under warm migration the highest aoc was observed for the silicone b tube 1 2 Œºg cm 2 followed by abs pom and silicone a 0 9 0 6 and 0 5 Œºg cm 2 respectively the highest aoc under the cold migration test was observed for silicone a and b both 0 6 Œºg cm 2 followed by pe and abs the silicone tubes showed a relatively higher aoc migration potential among the selected materials under both temperature conditions similar to the toc results the aoc migration potentials of silicone b pom and abs varied with the temperature conditions based on the present results it is important to determine the impact of various water temperatures on the biostability of the polymeric components in water dispensers epdm showed the lowest aoc migration potential under both temperature conditions but we believe that the selected epdm inhibited bacterial growth resulting in an underestimation of the aoc content fig s4 it should be noted that the bacterial inhibition of the selected epdm may have been due to the plasticizer or antimicrobial coating content wen et al 2015 proctor et al 2016 according to the eem and toc the epdm leachate showed a high content of aromatic or unsaturated hydrocarbons whereas the silicone leachate possibly contained a lower aromatic content fig s3 the present study did not include the pathogen growth potential however wen et al 2015 previously reported that escherichia coli o157 consumed 17 19 of the total aoc migrated from the drinking water components pe polybutylene and epdm the rate of aoc consumption by each pathogen inoculum e coli o157 vibrio cholerae and pseudomonas aeruginosa also varied by the type of polymer 3 3 biofilm formation potentials the bfp test was conducted via batch experiment using flow cytometry the results showed high accumulations of biomass in most of the leachates except for that of epdm the growth potential for planktonic bacteria was generally several times higher than that for sessile bacteria the greatest planktonic growth was observed for the silicone a followed by abs and silicone b blank bars fig 5 similar to the planktonic growth the highest sessile growth was observed for the silicone a followed by abs and silicone b filled bars fig 5 regarding the biofilm formation process the planktonic bacteria may serve as seeds for the initial attachment of bacteria to the surfaces of the pou device components resulting in the development of biofilm this shows that the interaction between the planktonic and sessile bacteria might result in each type of bacteria promoting the growth of the other according to the sessile growth the microbially safest material was epdm followed by pvc pom and pe as mentioned earlier the minimum biomass formation in the epdm leachate was not surprising due to the bacterial inhibition of epdm fig s4 it is also worthy to note that the relative cell size of the sessile bacteria on the epdm was smaller than that of the others p 0 05 table s6 regarding the limited use of the epdm o ring rubber in a single water dispenser the impact of epdm was negligible hence the bfp results show that the pvc pom and pe are relatively stable materials for pou water treatment devices in contrast the silicone rubber tubes and abs reservoir enhanced the bacterial growth in the water dispenser system 3 4 summary of biomig test the biomig test successfully confirmed that the test materials in contact with water and their leachates boosted the bacterial growth and biofilm formation in a comparison between the aoc and bfp the relationship between the aoc and bfp results demonstrate that the formation of sessile and planktonic bacteria was relatively highly correlated with the leaching of aoc content under cold temperature conditions r 0 93 and 0 92 p 0 01 as shown in table 1 on the other hand aoc under warm temperature conditions was not significantly correlated with biomass formation r 0 37 0 66 p 0 05 previous studies have explained that the elevated water temperature enhanced the organic migration rates and possibly resulted in maximized aoc migration potential bucheli witschel et al 2012 even though the cold water test underestimated the organic migration the biofilm potentials in water dispensers can be better predicted by the cold water mp test because water dispensers are generally operated at room temperature however it is worthwhile to estimate the mp using various water temperatures for each polymeric component water dispensers often serve chilled or boiled water through the final faucet and tubes therefore the actual biofilm formation on each component may depend on the contact water temperature previous studies mainly focused on the biomig test results normalized by the surface area however the materials that contact the water have different surface areas in actual water dispenser devices considering that the length of the silicone tube used for a single pou water dispenser was only 20 30 cm fig 1 the actual surface area of the pe tube and abs reservoir in an actual water dispenser was higher than the test surface area 100 cm2 for example 2 m of pe tube provides approximately 220 cm2 of contact area whereas the abs reservoir in this study 15 l provides approximately 3100 cm2 table s7 therefore the material for the water reservoir tank should be more carefully selected among the polymeric components such as the tubing housing and fittings of the pou device system meanwhile a variety of polymeric materials are still being used in pou water dispenser devices and their impact on bacterial growth promotion is unknown based on the experimental results of the present study further analysis of the actual surface area used in pou water dispenser systems is also necessary 3 5 water quality provided by the pou water dispenser the biomig test confirmed that bacterial growth can be promoted by polymeric materials but many other parameters are also involved in the bacterial growth and biofilm formation in pou water dispenser devices to evaluate the bacterial growth using an actual device we operated and monitored a commercially available pou water dispenser and its effluent for 10 weeks the schematic diagram of the pou device fig 2 shows each treatment step inside the device chlorinated tap water i e influent was introduced to the pre carbon filter after which the water went through the nanofiber filter post carbon filter reservoir and faucet table 2 the ph did not change remained within the range 7 5 7 7 the turbidity significantly decreased from 0 33 to 0 15 ntu p value 0 05 the highest removal of turbidity was observed with the pre carbon filter 39 followed by the nanofiber filter 26 the residual chlorine in the feed water was 0 17 0 04 mg l 1 and met the requirement for tap water in south korea minimum 0 1 mg l 1 as expected the chlorine residuals rapidly decreased through the pre carbon filter and were below the detection limit in the subsequent effluents from the nanofiber filter post carbon filter and at the faucet nescerecka et al 2014 reported that the decline in chlorine residuals could result in significant bacterial growth throughout the subsequent parts of the system hence it should be noted that during the following device treatment steps e g nanofiber and post carbon filters the tubing and fittings could provide an ideal environment for bacterial growth and biofilm formation 3 6 bacterial growth through pou water dispenser and examination of its components tcc atp hpc and total coliform in the pou water dispenser effluent were also analyzed table 2 although the tcc is not regulated by the present water quality guidelines worldwide an abnormal change in tcc can be regarded as an indicator of the water treatment performance the analysis results revealed that tcc undoubtedly increased from 0 32 to 1 59 105 cells ml 1 significance level 0 06 through the pou water dispenser the bacterial density doubled through the pre carbon filter increased 1 7 fold after the nanofiber filter and doubled again through the reservoir i e faucet effluent however the total atp increased slightly from 0 03 to 0 05 nmol l 1 through the device and it was not statistically significant significance level 0 33 table 2 in our previous study park et al 2016 the total atp mainly consisted of free atp in chlorinated tap water 0 7 mg cl2 l 1 therefore the total atp in the feed water was likely free atp accordingly the intracellular atp should be measured to determine the biomass in chlorinated tap water but this was not performed in the present study lautenschlager et al 2010 reported that the increased magnitude of hpc in stagnant water 4 580 fold was higher than that of the intact cell counts and bacterial atp 1 6 3 2 fold and 1 7 18 fold respectively therefore the conventional hpc assay is still important for characterizing the microbial changes such as cultivability hpc in the influent was 12 16 cfu ml 1 which met the korean regulations for tap water 100 cfu ml 1 however it increased dramatically through the treatment steps from 0 01 to 20 01 103 cfu ml 1 hpc in the feed water increased 57 fold after the pre carbon filter the subsequent steps namely the nanofiber filter and post carbon filter resulted in an increase in hpc of 1 4 and 2 5 times respectively in the finished water from the faucet hpc increased dramatically by 8 3 times possibly due to water stagnation in the reservoir hpc increased by 1600 times from the influent to the final faucet and it was higher than that of the overnight stagnant tap water nonchlorinated 0 87 1 00 103 cfu ml 1 lautenschlager et al 2010 therefore hpc from the pou device exceeded the tap water regulations less than 100 300 cfu ml 1 in relevant countries including south korea germany and switzerland van nevel et al 2017 nier 2018 it is also important to note that the who 2002 suggested minimizing abnormal changes in the hpc regardless of its health risk however total coliform was not detected in any of the samples in the present study hence the increase in hpc was not related to health relevant microorganisms in a comparison of the sampling periods the greatest increase in hpc occurred in the first half of the device operation october november 2017 and hpc in the finished water ranged from 11 2 to 77 4 103 cfu ml 1 on the other hand hpc was much lower during the second half of the device operation 1 9 103 cfu ml 1 december 2017 january 2018 the source water temperature in the present system was 14 5 and 3 1 c for the first half and the second half of the study periods respectively water environment information system republic of korea accessed november 2018 zlatanovic et al 2017 also reported that hpc in stagnant water in building plumbing was considerably lower during the winter experiment therefore it is reasonable that the hpc level was impacted not only by the pou device structures e g pre carbon filter but also by the feed water temperature after 10 weeks of operating the pou water dispenser we disassembled the device components that contacted the water e g tubes reservoir and fittings the biofilms on each component were not seen visually but microbial assays such as hpc tcc and atp verified the presence of biofilm formation on the components fig 6 the results showed dramatic differences in biofilm formation on each component surface the hpc tcc and atp results for the pe tubes and the pom connectors were relatively low compared to those of the silicone tube abs reservoir and pp faucet corresponding to previous results it was notable that the highest biofilm concentration was found on the silicone tube again the hpc tcc and atp concentrations on the silicone tube were at least 3 fold higher than that of the pe tubes atp on the silicone tube exceeded the bpp pass fail limit 1000 pg or 1 97 nmol atp cm 2 meanwhile the atp level on the pe and pom components was lower than the pass fail limit fig 6 to sum up the silicone tube was revealed as the most problematic material based not only on the biomig prediction tools but also on the biofilm swabbing test proctor et al 2016 previously compared the biomass concentrations resulting from the bfp test and a realistic building plumbing simulator and they found correlations in terms of biofilm formation the study concluded that the biomig test was a useful prediction tool for biofilm formation diagnosis the tendency for biofilm formation on polymeric components could vary with their physical characteristics such as material diameter and roughness douterelo et al 2014 based on this study the biofilm could preferentially develop on specific components in pou water dispensers as predicted by the biomig test 4 conclusions adverse effects from the pou water dispenser components were confirmed including heterotrophic growth bacterial growth promotion and biofilm formation the study results indicate the importance of material selection for the pou systems the key findings are as follows hpc and tcc increased in pou water dispenser systems as the result of no chlorine residual the biomig test results revealed that organic migration and biofilm formation varied according to the polymer types used in pou water dispenser components and aoc migration in cold water was highly correlated with the biofilm formation potential prior to water dispenser operation the biomig test was useful for estimating the biofilm formation potential on the polymeric components used in the pou water dispenser the use of polymers with high biofilm formation between the reservoir and the faucet should be minimized for pou water dispensers whereas the approved polymeric components contributed to biological stability in the water dispenser effluent declaration of competing
