13405,microplastics mps have become an emerging global environmental pollution issue while studies on the impact of nanoplastics nps on aquatic environments especially in freshwater environments are still limited in this study we compared the toxic effects of micro and nano sized polystyrene microbeads ps mps and ps nps on a widespread freshwater algal species chlamydomonas reinhardtii c reinhardtii the results revealed that both ps mps and ps nps had negative effects on the growth of c reinhardtii in the range of 50 to 500 mg l reducing its biomass and photosynthetic pigment the growth inhibitory rate ir of c reinhardtii was 61 7 and 23 3 when exposed to 500 mg l ps nps and ps mps for 96 h respectively demonstrating a higher toxic effect of the nps than the mps in comparison to the control group reactive oxygen species ros and malondialdehyde mda levels in algae cells increased enhancing cell membrane permeability and then accelerating ps np internalization mda levels increased by 1 3 and 2 2 times under ps mps and ps nps exposure 500 mg l 96 h respectively furthermore the content of the extracellular polymeric substances and the antioxidant enzymatic superoxide dismutase peroxidase and catalase activities were all enhanced to resist the adverse effects caused by ps mps and ps nps it is interesting that the internalized nps were found to be clearly encapsulated in the vacuoles of the algal cells these findings suggest that the ecological effect of nps might need more attention especially considering the continuing fragmentation of mps in the environment keywords microplastics nanoplastics c reinhardtii toxicity oxidative stress 1 introduction plastic products are widely utilized in daily life due to their light weight chemical stability and impact resistance the global annual production of plastics has increased from 1 5 million tons in the 1950s to 359 million tons in 2018 with an increasing rate of 20 million tons per year 1 2 although plastic products bring lots of convenience to human plastic waste will inevitably be discharged into the water environment due to waste disposal and mismanagement for example it was estimated more than 250 thousand tons of plastic waste are floating on the global ocean surface 3 large fragments of plastic waste can be easily removed and recycled whereas tiny plastic particles are nearly impossible to be eliminated from the environment 4 the high production rate coupled with low ineffective recycling strategy as well as their slow bio degradation rate ultimately leads to an increasing accumulation of plastics in the environment 4 an in depth understanding is highly needed to reveal the ecological impacts of the widespread microplastics mps in the water environment mps 5 mm are mainly divided into primary and secondary sources in the environment 5 the primary mps refer to plastics produced at a micrometer size e g the exfoliating microspheres in facial cleansers and textile fibers 6 secondary mps are derived from the gradual degradation or fragmentation of plastics caused by ultraviolet radiation oxidation and mechanical abrasion 7 8 at present the distribution behavior and toxicity of mps have raised human s concern in oceans an ultimate destination of mps 5 however a few studies have focused on the freshwater environment which is closer to human activities in recent years large quantities and types of mps in freshwater have also been found for instance yan et al found that the abundance of mps in the pearl river estuary and urban sections of the river were 8902 items m3 and 19 860 items m3 respectively and more than 80 of the mps were smaller than 0 5 mm 9 anderson et al found that mps concentrations ranged from 66 788 to 293 449 items m3 in the laurentian great lakes in canada and the mps were largely from secondary sources 10 the abundance of mps particles detected in the danube river even exceeded the number of fish larvae 11 furthermore secondary mps have also been found in inaccessible plateau lake areas 12 consequently mps pollution studies should not be limited to the marine environment and the freshwater environment should also be examined mps are a great concern for the aquatic ecosystem because of their small sizes to aquatic organisms including phytoplankton 13 zooplankton 14 fish 15 and other organisms 16 17 especially mps may be enriched along the food chain ultimately threatening human health 18 small sized mps can result in a downward trend in survival and reproduction rates of marine zooplankton by blocking digestive tract and reducing food intake from outside 14 wan et al found that 5 and 50 μm mps may trigger microbiome dysbiosis and alter metabolomic profiles 19 in addition small size plastics present a high sorption capacity of other chemicals e g heavy metals and organic pollutants from surrounding media because of their high specific surface areas and consequently influence the bioavailability of these chemicals 20 for instance the concentrations of chemicals on mps can be up to 105 to 106 times higher than those in the surrounding seawater 21 microalgae a basic primary producer in aquatic environment play essential roles in oxygen production and global carbon cycle 22 in addition microalgae are mostly single celled organisms with short growth cycles and simple cultivation methods and are sensitive to pollutants 23 therefore the presence of mps in the aquatic environment can also affect microalgae previous studies have shown that mps could be accumulated by algae resulting in growth inhibition decreased photosynthetic capacity and oxidative damage 23 24 in addition the potential toxicity of mps increases with the increase of the fragmentation of particles 25 for instance zhang et al showed that 1 μm mps obviously inhibited the growth of skeletonema costatum and the maximum growth inhibitory rate ir was up to 39 7 at 96 h exposure while 1 mm plastic debris had no effects 23 mao et al found that a small polystyrene ps of 0 1 μm size can cause a severe adverse effect on photosynthetic activity of chlorella pyrenoidosa but such inhibitory effect gradually decreased over time 13 furthermore the environmental concentrations of nanoplastics nps 100 nm are currently unknown due to the lack of detection methods which are expected to increase with the ongoing fragmentation of mps 26 the high surface to volume ratio of nps may increase their potential environmental risks previous researches suggested that metal nanoparticles can have significant negative effects on microalgae such as inhibiting growth and photosynthesis blocking algae pores and causing oxidative stress and structural damage 27 28 hence it is noteworthy to investigate the direct and indirect toxic effects of nps on microalgae based on this background c reinhardtii the most widely distributed algal species in freshwater environments and commonly used in eco toxicological studies was chosen as the model organism polystyrene ps widely used in commercial plastics was selected as a typical plastic 29 in this study we compared the effects of two particle size ps microbeads 100 nm and 100 μm on the growth photosynthetic oxidative stress and cell morphology of c reinhardtii the objective was to gain insight into the different response mechanisms of ps mps and ps nps on microalgae the findings of this study help improve our knowledge on the toxicity effects of micro and nano plastics in freshwater environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of ps nps and ps mps ps microbeads with a diameter of 100 nm and 100 μm were both purchased from dongguan mingyuxing plastic raw material co ltd china they were original plastic products without plasticizers and other additives the particle size distributions and zeta potentials of these ps mps and ps nps were observed with a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd britain and zetasizer nano zs zetasizernano malvern instruments ltd britain respectively 2 2 microalgal cultivation c reinhardtii fachb 265 was provided by the freshwater algae culture collection of the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china all culture supplies of c reinhardtii including growth medium erlenmeyer flasks etc were sterilized by autoclaving at 105 c for 40 min before use the algae were cultured in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 300 ml of sterile selenite enrichment se medium table s1 at 25 1 c the algae cells were placed into an illumination incubator under a light intensity of 4000 50 lx with a 12 12 h light dark cycle the erlenmeyer flasks were shaken 4 6 times daily to prevent sedimentation of the algae cells and ensure co2 supply the algae were cultured to be at the logarithmic growth stage for subsequent tests with the initial algae density maintained at 1 106 cells ml 2 3 microalgae growth inhibition assay the stock solutions of ps mps and ps nps were diluted with milli q water to a final concentration of 50 250 and 500 mg l respectively the algae solution without ps microbeads served as controls all experiments were repeated three times under sterile conditions the algal solution erlenmeyer flasks were randomly placed in the illumination incubator for 96 h and c reinhardtii density was counted every 24 h using a hemocytometer growth inhibition ratio ir of c reinhardtii was calculated by the following formula ir 1 t c 100 where t was the cell density cells ml in the ps mps or ps nps experimental group and c was the cell density cells ml in the control group 2 4 determination of chlorophyll content the algal suspension 4 ml was centrifuged to remove the supernatant and resuspended in the same volume of 80 acetone the centrifuge tube was heated in a water bath at 55 c in the dark for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 5 min to dilute the supernatant with 80 acetone to 5 ml then the absorbance values were measured at 663 nm 645 nm and 470 nm the formula for calculating chlorophyll content is as follows 28 c a 12 21 a 663 2 81 a 646 c b 20 13 a 646 5 03 a 663 c x c 1000 a 470 3 27 c a 104 c b 229 c t c a c b where ca cb cx c and ct were the concentrations of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b carotenoids and total chlorophylls respectively 2 5 determination of extracellular polymeric substances eps the main eps components of microalgae are polysaccharide and proteins 30 in this study the contents of exopolysaccharide and extracellular protein were determined at a 24 h interval the content of eps was measured by heat treatment as follows the algal suspension 10 ml was first centrifuged 4000 rpm 10 min then the supernatant was removed then a phosphate buffered solution pbs 0 1 m ph 7 2 was added to supplement the volume next the mixture was heated at 80 c for 30 min and then centrifuged to collect the supernatant and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane to determine the polysaccharide and protein content the protein content in the eps was stained with coomassie brilliant blue reagent and measured at 595 nm wavelength 31 and the polysaccharide content was determined at 620 nm using the anthrone sulfuric assay according to the method of morris et al 32 2 6 flow cytometry fcm analysis the effects of micro or nano plastics exposure on cell morphology intracellular chlorophyll autofluorescence cell membrane permeability and oxidative stress were analyzed by using fcm bd biosciences new jersey usa forward scattered light fsc side scattered light ssc and red autofluorescence fl4 red emission filter long pass 670 nm were correlated with cell size cell complexity and chlorophyll autofluorescence respectively propidium iodide pi is a nucleic acid dye that can only enter membrane compromised cells and emit red fluorescent after binding nucleic acids allowing quantification of cell membrane permeability 28 the dead cells stained red with pi were measured using the fl3 channel 533 30 nm reactive oxygen species ros generation was evaluated using the 2 7 dichlorofluorescin diacetate h2dcfda staining method using fl1 channel 605 635 nm although h2dcfda is a non fluorescent dye it is converted to the highly fluorescent 2 7 dichlorofluorescein dcf when oxidized in the presence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide anion radical o2 33 the algae suspension 1 ml was collected by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min after treatment with ps mps or ps nps for 96 h and then washed and resuspended in pbs 0 1 m ph 7 2 to assess cell membrane permeability and intracellular ros generation we used 60 μm pi or 80 μm h2dcfda to stain microalgae cells and incubated them for 30 min in the dark at 25 c the 0 1 mm h2o2 treated cells and 100 heat damaged cells at 99 c for 30 min served as positive controls for ros generation and cell membrane permeability respectively negative controls were normal cells without micro or nano plastics treatment after staining the fluorescence intensities for each parameter were respectively obtained from 10 000 cells of c reinhardtii the intracellular relative fluorescence intensity was expressed as fluorescence intensity of the treated groups the control group 100 2 7 assays for antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation antioxidant enzymes mainly include superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod and catalase cat the sod pod cat and malondialdehyde mda were all measured using different kits sod a001 1 pod a084 3 cat a007 1 1 mda a003 1 nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china the algae suspension 50 ml was centrifuged 3000 rpm 10 min to remove the supernatant then the collected algal precipitate was washed twice and mixed with pbs 0 1 m ph 7 0 homogenized using an ultrasonic cell crusher scientz iid ningbo scientz biotechnology company china for 3 min in an ice bath and then centrifuged 12 000 rpm 15 min to collect the supernatant finally according to the manufacturer s instructions the supernatant was taken and added to the indicator to determine the absorbance at the corresponding wavelengths 2 8 microstructure analysis the surface heterogeneous aggregation and cellular ultrastructure alteration of algal cells were observed by a scanning electron microscope sem su8010 hitachi japan and transmission electron microscopy tem h 7650 hitachi japan respectively due to the space limit the experimental details are presented in supplementary materials text 1 2 9 statistical analysis all data were expressed as the mean standard deviation n 3 the experimental data were analyzed with spss 19 0 and a one way analysis of variance anova p values of 0 01 and 0 05 were considered to be extremely significant difference and a significant difference the spss software was used to calculate the medium effective concentration ec50 the collected fcm data were analyzed using the flowjo software version 10 3 results 3 1 characterization of ps micro and nano beads the median diameters of the ps mps and ps nps were 93 6 μm and 102 1 nm respectively and both of them showed a normal distribution in solution fig 1 the zeta potentials of the ps mps and ps nps suspension were 4 75 1 85 mv and 0 47 0 04 mv respectively fig s1 the sem images exhibited that the micro and nano beads were of spherical nature with a smooth surface fig 1 3 2 effects of micro and nano plastics on the growth and metabolism of c reinhardtii 3 2 1 effects of micro and nano plastics on the growth of c reinhardtii the inhibition ratios ir of ps mps and ps nps 0 500 mg l on the biomass of c reinhardtii at 0 96 h are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively compared with the control group both ps mps and ps nps could inhibit the growth of algae and the inhibitory effect became more obvious with increasing exposure concentration and time the ir of ps mps was 5 2 13 9 and 23 3 under 50 250 500 mg l treatment for 96 h whereas that of ps nps was 16 4 45 1 and 61 7 respectively indicating the distinct size effect the smaller the size of the plastic particles is the stronger the toxicity to microalgae is the 96 h ec50 of ps nps for c reinhardtii was 300 35 mg l however the ps mps didn t reach the half maximum inhibitory concentration in the range of 0 500 mg l 3 2 2 effects of micro and nano plastics on photosynthetic pigment content of c reinhardtii as demonstrated in fig 3 the synthesis of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b carotenoids and total chlorophyll in c reinhardtii was inhibited as the concentration of microplastics increased the inhibition ratios of carotenoids and total chlorophyll for 500 mg l ps mps 96 h were 22 9 and 26 5 respectively compared to the control group whereas those for ps nps were up to 72 6 and 72 8 respectively therefore ps nps had a stronger inhibitory effect on algal photosynthesis meanwhile we measured the intensity of chlorophyll autofluorescence microalgal cells by using fcm fig 4 a the intracellular chlorophyll autofluorescence of c reinhardtii decreased significantly with increasing concentration and decreasing particle size the inhibition of chlorophyll autofluorescence increased from 17 8 to 33 7 when the ps mps concentration increased from 50 mg l to 500 mg l while for ps nps the inhibitory effect of chlorophyll increased from 10 5 to 61 1 the findings matched those of the chlorophyll content tests fig 3 3 2 3 eps content as shown in fig 5 a the content of exopolysaccharide under micro and nano plastics exposures decreased in a short time 24 h and 48 h respectively subsequently the exopolysaccharide content in c reinhardtii increased with the increase of ps mps and ps nps concentrations at 72 and 96 h showing a dose response trend for ps nps the exopolysaccharide content of c reinhardtii exposed to 50 250 and 500 mg l ps nps significantly p 0 05 increased by 27 1 29 3 and 48 0 at 96 h compared with the control group respectively the maximum exopolysaccharide content was observed under 500 mg l ps for 96 h which was 54 2 1 23 and 72 0 1 8 mg g for mps and nps respectively the result indicated that the microalgae under ps nps stress could secrete more exopolysaccharide to resist adverse effects compared with those under ps mps stress in addition a dose response trend becomes more evident in extracellular protein content under micro and nano plastics stress except at 24 h the extracellular protein content produced by ps nps was greater than that induced by ps mps at the same dose fig 5b after exposure to 500 mg l ps nps for 96 h algal cells secreted up to 22 5 2 4 mg g of extracellular protein which was 1 85 and 1 54 times greater than the control group and the same concentration of ps mps respectively the above results indicate that compared with ps mps ps nps promote microalgae to secrete more content of eps including exopolysaccharide and protein which may involve in the extracellular defense mechanism that tries to prevent plastics from entering into cells 3 3 effects of micro and nano plastics on oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity of c reinhardtii 3 3 1 oxidative biomarkers as shown in fig s2 ps mps and ps nps 250 mg l induced an increasing dcf fluorescence intensity ros production in c reinhardtii as the dcf peak shifted rightward on the x axis and the peak of mps shifted significantly than nps between the x axis values of 103 and 104 therefore the relative ros ratio was calculated from fig s2 and provided a semi quantitative assessment of ros level in fig 6 a when the concentration of ps mps increased from 50 mg l to 500 mg l the ros increased from 112 2 7 4 to 130 2 12 1 at 96 h however it is worth noting that a different trend was observed under ps nps stress the ros decreased from 117 9 10 4 to 98 7 5 7 at the same concentration gradient of ps nps in addition compared with the control group the intracellular ros production of c reinhardtii significantly increased p 0 05 in 500 mg l ps mps and there was a significant difference p 0 05 between ps mps and ps nps this phenomenon was related to cell apoptosis and increase of antioxidant enzyme activity 3 3 2 antioxidant enzyme activity of c reinhardtii in order to gain insights into the change of antioxidative enzymes under micro and nano plastics stress the activities of three anti oxidative enzymes sod cat and pod were investigated fig 6b d the maximum enhancement in sod activity at 500 mg l ps mps and ps nps was 1 3 and 2 4 fold respectively compared to the control fig 6b the activity of sod increased with the increase of mps or nps concentrations in addition the increasing trend of ps nps was more significant than that of ps mps increasing from 28 6 0 3 to 59 2 2 0 u 106cells these data indicated that ps nps were more likely to induce microalgae to produce superoxide anion o2 thereby increasing their inhibitory effect on algae cat and pod are also major antioxidant enzymes involved in modulation of intracellular ros levels results of cat and pod values are shown in fig 6c and d the intracellular cat activity of c reinhardtii increased gradually with the increase of ps dose in the range of 50 to 500 mg l which was consistent with the trend of sod the cat for ps nps was significantly higher p 0 01 than that for ps mps and the maximum value was 3 2 0 1 u 106cells under 500 mg l ps nps exposure at 96 h furthermore pod enzyme activity showed a similar trend positively correlated with the ps concentration and negatively correlated with the size of plastics interestingly the pod activity was the highest under 250 mg l ps nps stress instead of 500 mg l which was 8 3 fold higher than that of the control group this may be related to the more severe cell damage caused by high concentrations of ps nps both cat and sod activities of the ps nps test groups were significantly enhanced p 0 05 which also reflected that ps nps stress enhanced the intracellular peroxide content 3 3 3 lipid peroxidation mda is the most frequently used indicator for lipid peroxidation the amount of mda in microalgae cells rose after 96 h of exposure in both ps mps and ps nps experiments indicating lipid peroxidation fig 7 a in addition the mda level was enhanced with the increase of ps concentration the mda contents increased from 1 2 to 1 3 times compared to the control group when the ps mps concentration increased from 50 mg l to 500 mg l and the mda contents increased from 1 5 to 2 2 times when the ps nps increased from 50 to 500 mg l these data showed ps nps had stronger oxidative damages than ps mps which was consistent with the results of oxidative stress experiments 3 3 4 cell membrane permeability as demonstrated in fig s3 the contour map of 100 heat damaged cells positive control deviated significantly from normal cells negative control and the increase in fluorescence intensity indicated an increase in cell membrane permeability as the exposure concentration of micro or nano plastics increased the cell contour map gradually drifted to the right indicating membrane damage in addition the overlap area between the ps nps and the positive control cells was larger under the 500 mg l stress indicating that the microalgae cell membrane is more permeable under the high concentration of ps nps stress the relative fluorescence intensity can be used to evaluate the changes in membrane permeability under plastic stress it was defined as the ratio of fluorescence intensity of the ps mps or ps nps treated cells to that of the untreated cells fig 7b we found that increasing the concentration of micro or nano plastics from 50 mg l to 500 mg l significantly p 0 05 increased the membrane permeability of the c reinhardtii cells especially after exposure to 500 mg l ps nps for 96 h the cell membrane permeability was increased by 21 0 0 2 p 0 01 when compared with the control interestingly ps mps caused a significant p 0 05 increase in cell membrane permeability at 50 mg l while ps nps had no significant difference in short both mps and nps caused a certain degree of changes in cell membrane permeability and high concentrations of ps nps could easily lead to severe cell damage or even death 3 4 morphological property of c reinhardtii 3 4 1 cell size as shown in fig 4b the control and ps mps treated groups cells had similar cell size however the size of c reinhardtii increased significantly p 0 01 in the ps nps treated groups 50 and 250 mg l and the increases were 22 7 and 17 1 respectively compared with the control group for 96 h and while cell size was negatively related to ps nps concentration there was no significant p 0 05 effect on ps mps 3 4 2 ultrastructure of c reinhardtii cells and potential internalization of micro and nano plastics sem images of cells after 96 h exposure of ps mps and ps nps are shown in fig 8 c reinhardtii cells were well adhered to the ps mps surface and sank to the bottom with the mps fig 8a however ps nps and c reinhardtii formed a heterogeneous aggregation fig 8b as if a plastic coat on the microalgae to further understand the effect of ps nps on the ultrastructure and organelle organization of c reinhardtii tem was performed on the cells treated with ps nps for 96 h fig 9 tem pictures of non exposed c reinhardtii cells with intact morphology cell wall plasma membrane pyrenoids chloroplast nucleus and other organelles were shown in fig 9a and b the vacuoles were clear and transparent without obvious impurities by contrast when exposed to ps nps the cell wall was detached from the plasma membrane and the thylakoids could not be precisely distinguished in the cell fig 9c and d in addition the formation of autophagic vacuoles was observed and many ps nps gathered in the vacuole fig 9e and f this might be related to the intracellular defense mechanism of microalgae which aggregated the nps into the vacuole to reduce their diffusion in the cell 4 discussions from the obtained results both ps mps and ps nps can influence algal growth and reproduction in particular ps nps have a more obvious inhibitory effect than ps mps the more micro or nano plastics that are added the more harmful the algae become previous studies have indicated that mps can inhibit the growth of microalgae which was consistent with the results in our study 34 for example sjollema et al found that three different diameters of ps 0 05 0 5 and 6 μm had a significant negative effect on the growth of dunaliella tertiolecta under 250 mg l exposure at 72 h and the inhibitory rate of algae increased with the decreasing size of mps 35 however liu et al found that there were no significant differences among the five types of mps on scenedesmus obliquus except under 0 5 μm ps during the 150 h exposure but the toxic mechanism varied with particle size 36 large size mps could potentially serve as substrates for microalgae to colonize the surface and promote growth while nps could enter the cell and cause serious damage 37 the photosynthetic pigment content directly reflects the photosynthetic capacity of microalgae 38 in the present experiments with the increase of ps concentration or decrease in particle size the pigment content of c reinhardtii reduced indicating that the photosynthetic system of microalgae was inhibited these results were further verified by measuring the autofluorescence intensity of chlorophyll using fcm stress factors are believed to reduce levels of photosynthetic pigments leading to a reduction in the effective quantum yield of psii and photosynthetic capacity 39 in the study of wu et al both polyvinyl chloride pvc and polypropylene pp could inhibit the electron transmission efficiency of microalgae and reduce the value of fv fm fv fm and fv f0 40 similarly we observed with tem that the thylakoid structure was destroyed and blurred under 500 mg l ps nps stress thylakoids are the sites of light photosynthetic reactions and play a key role in the stability of photosynthesis because they contain photosynthetic pigment 41 therefore the destruction of thylakoids by ps nps will inevitably affect the photosynthesis of microalgae furthermore the accumulation of ros content in microalgae under microplastics stress can also destroy the structure of chloroplasts and hinder synthesis of photosynthetic pigments 42 in this study we found that ps mps induced a higher ros content in microalgae cells than ps nps while their effect on antioxidant enzyme activity was opposite combined with the analysis of the cell membrane permeability index this may be due to nanometer particle stress will increase the cell membrane permeability leading to cell apoptotic lysis and intracellular ros may spill over excessive ros levels not only inhibit photosynthetic activity of microalgae but also promote lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane 43 44 mda content reflects the extent of lipid peroxidation and membrane injury 45 mda levels rose when ps microbeads concentration increased indicating the occurrence of lipid peroxidation in c reinhardtii moreover the cell membrane permeability was greatly increased under high concentration of ps nps treatment 250 mg l fig 7b an obvious plasmolysis phenomenon was further observed using tem fig 9d additionally ros plays a dual role in cell injuries excessive ros induces cell apoptosis and necrosis while a small increase in ros level promotes cell proliferation 46 if the cell is damaged severely and the damage lasts for a long time the membrane permeability will continue to increase eventually leading to cell apoptosis 43 this will cause the cells and organelles to swell and deform increasing the cell complexity which is similar to the increase in cell size under ps nps as shown in fig s4 in this study research has reported that the adsorption of nps in algal cells resulted in the accumulation of excessive ros which caused physical blockage and hindered photosynthesis of scenedesmus 47 compared with mps nps showed more serious injury of the cell membrane indicating that nps may be more toxic in aquatic environments antioxidant enzymes play an important role in cellular defense against oxidative stress sod can scavenge superoxide radicals o2 to protect cells from oxidative damage which turns o2 into o2 and h2o2 48 our results showed that algal cells could significantly p 0 01 enhance the activity of sod in response to external stresses caused by micro or nano plastics especially 100 nm ps nps also the sod level was enhanced with the increase of ps nps the sod converts o2 into h2o2 while the generated h2o2 could be further eliminated by cat and pod 18 therefore cat and pod are regarded as the second line of defense against oxidative stress which h2o2 can be metabolized into oxygen and water by cat and pod 49 the cat and pod activity in c reinhardtii cells gradually increased with the increase of micro and nano plastics content which was basically consistent with the change of sod however the activity of the pod enzyme decreases under 500 mg l after ps nps exposure for 96 h this may be related to the accumulation of excessive h2o2 that can t be eliminated at the time leading to changes in the enzyme molecular structure and destruction of the defense system 50 microalgae exposed to stressful circumstances such as the presence of ps nps sticking to the cell surface can also generate more eps eps can attach ps nps on the algal surface to resist unfavorable factors which was also found in the present study 51 lagarde et al found that two of the microalgae genes udp glucuronate decarboxylase and udp glucose 4 epimerase involved in extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis pathways were strongly over expressed when exposed to 1 g l high density polyethylene hdpe 400 μm after more than 70 days 52 meanwhile eps can thicken cell walls to protect cells from physical damage 53 the tem images showed that algal cell walls thickened fig 9e which may effectively prevent invasion of nps 13 similar results were also detected in chlorella ellipsoids exposed to aluminum oxide nanoparticles 54 on the other hand eps can attach nanoparticles through establishing hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interaction 55 56 changing the surface charge and hydrodynamic diameter and reducing bioavailability 57 thus these excessive secretions of eps are possibly associated with the defense mechanisms of microalgae against micro and nano plastics in addition the physical adsorption between microalgae and mps or nps is also one of the indispensable reasons for inhibiting the growth of microalgae the adsorption of microalgae on the ps mps surface will cause a shading effect on the photosynthesis of the algae cells and inhibit the electron transmission efficiency 23 furthermore owing to their high specific surface area nps are simpler to accumulate and adsorb on the surface of microalgae than mps ps nps blocked the transmission channel between microalgae and external substances hindering the exchange of substances and energy between inside and outside the cell bhattacharya et al found that the hetero aggregation of ps microplastic and chlorella cells blocked light from reaching the photosynthetic centers and damaged the cell walls 47 adsorption and internalization of nanomaterials are also the main reasons for the increase in cell size 27 it is intriguing that c reinhardtii cells produce autophagic vacuoles and then phagocytize nps into vacuoles to prevent further intracellular diffusion of nps as shown in tem images fig 9f 5 conclusions in summary ps nps exhibited more severe and unfavorable effects on c reinhardtii than ps mps according to the findings of systematic studies on growth inhibition photosynthesis oxidative stress and ultrastructure the reason may be that nps which have a small size and high surface area are more susceptible to being absorbed and internalized by microalgae causing a shading effect oxidative stress and cell structure damage to the algal cells the stress of mps and nps on microalgae also induced the defense mechanism of the microalgae causing an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity sod pod and cat and eps secretion this study is an acute toxicity experiment revealing the toxicity and defense mechanism of microalgae with different particle sizes 100 nm and 100 μm of plastics which is useful for providing a theoretical reference for understanding the environmental risk assessment of mps and nps pollution in the freshwater environment the next step of the study is to minimize the difference between laboratory culture conditions and the real freshwater environment we will adopt low concentrations of mps and nps as well as long term exposure conditions to lay the foundation to comprehensively evaluate the toxicity of micro and nano plastics in the real aquatic environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

13405,microplastics mps have become an emerging global environmental pollution issue while studies on the impact of nanoplastics nps on aquatic environments especially in freshwater environments are still limited in this study we compared the toxic effects of micro and nano sized polystyrene microbeads ps mps and ps nps on a widespread freshwater algal species chlamydomonas reinhardtii c reinhardtii the results revealed that both ps mps and ps nps had negative effects on the growth of c reinhardtii in the range of 50 to 500 mg l reducing its biomass and photosynthetic pigment the growth inhibitory rate ir of c reinhardtii was 61 7 and 23 3 when exposed to 500 mg l ps nps and ps mps for 96 h respectively demonstrating a higher toxic effect of the nps than the mps in comparison to the control group reactive oxygen species ros and malondialdehyde mda levels in algae cells increased enhancing cell membrane permeability and then accelerating ps np internalization mda levels increased by 1 3 and 2 2 times under ps mps and ps nps exposure 500 mg l 96 h respectively furthermore the content of the extracellular polymeric substances and the antioxidant enzymatic superoxide dismutase peroxidase and catalase activities were all enhanced to resist the adverse effects caused by ps mps and ps nps it is interesting that the internalized nps were found to be clearly encapsulated in the vacuoles of the algal cells these findings suggest that the ecological effect of nps might need more attention especially considering the continuing fragmentation of mps in the environment keywords microplastics nanoplastics c reinhardtii toxicity oxidative stress 1 introduction plastic products are widely utilized in daily life due to their light weight chemical stability and impact resistance the global annual production of plastics has increased from 1 5 million tons in the 1950s to 359 million tons in 2018 with an increasing rate of 20 million tons per year 1 2 although plastic products bring lots of convenience to human plastic waste will inevitably be discharged into the water environment due to waste disposal and mismanagement for example it was estimated more than 250 thousand tons of plastic waste are floating on the global ocean surface 3 large fragments of plastic waste can be easily removed and recycled whereas tiny plastic particles are nearly impossible to be eliminated from the environment 4 the high production rate coupled with low ineffective recycling strategy as well as their slow bio degradation rate ultimately leads to an increasing accumulation of plastics in the environment 4 an in depth understanding is highly needed to reveal the ecological impacts of the widespread microplastics mps in the water environment mps 5 mm are mainly divided into primary and secondary sources in the environment 5 the primary mps refer to plastics produced at a micrometer size e g the exfoliating microspheres in facial cleansers and textile fibers 6 secondary mps are derived from the gradual degradation or fragmentation of plastics caused by ultraviolet radiation oxidation and mechanical abrasion 7 8 at present the distribution behavior and toxicity of mps have raised human s concern in oceans an ultimate destination of mps 5 however a few studies have focused on the freshwater environment which is closer to human activities in recent years large quantities and types of mps in freshwater have also been found for instance yan et al found that the abundance of mps in the pearl river estuary and urban sections of the river were 8902 items m3 and 19 860 items m3 respectively and more than 80 of the mps were smaller than 0 5 mm 9 anderson et al found that mps concentrations ranged from 66 788 to 293 449 items m3 in the laurentian great lakes in canada and the mps were largely from secondary sources 10 the abundance of mps particles detected in the danube river even exceeded the number of fish larvae 11 furthermore secondary mps have also been found in inaccessible plateau lake areas 12 consequently mps pollution studies should not be limited to the marine environment and the freshwater environment should also be examined mps are a great concern for the aquatic ecosystem because of their small sizes to aquatic organisms including phytoplankton 13 zooplankton 14 fish 15 and other organisms 16 17 especially mps may be enriched along the food chain ultimately threatening human health 18 small sized mps can result in a downward trend in survival and reproduction rates of marine zooplankton by blocking digestive tract and reducing food intake from outside 14 wan et al found that 5 and 50 μm mps may trigger microbiome dysbiosis and alter metabolomic profiles 19 in addition small size plastics present a high sorption capacity of other chemicals e g heavy metals and organic pollutants from surrounding media because of their high specific surface areas and consequently influence the bioavailability of these chemicals 20 for instance the concentrations of chemicals on mps can be up to 105 to 106 times higher than those in the surrounding seawater 21 microalgae a basic primary producer in aquatic environment play essential roles in oxygen production and global carbon cycle 22 in addition microalgae are mostly single celled organisms with short growth cycles and simple cultivation methods and are sensitive to pollutants 23 therefore the presence of mps in the aquatic environment can also affect microalgae previous studies have shown that mps could be accumulated by algae resulting in growth inhibition decreased photosynthetic capacity and oxidative damage 23 24 in addition the potential toxicity of mps increases with the increase of the fragmentation of particles 25 for instance zhang et al showed that 1 μm mps obviously inhibited the growth of skeletonema costatum and the maximum growth inhibitory rate ir was up to 39 7 at 96 h exposure while 1 mm plastic debris had no effects 23 mao et al found that a small polystyrene ps of 0 1 μm size can cause a severe adverse effect on photosynthetic activity of chlorella pyrenoidosa but such inhibitory effect gradually decreased over time 13 furthermore the environmental concentrations of nanoplastics nps 100 nm are currently unknown due to the lack of detection methods which are expected to increase with the ongoing fragmentation of mps 26 the high surface to volume ratio of nps may increase their potential environmental risks previous researches suggested that metal nanoparticles can have significant negative effects on microalgae such as inhibiting growth and photosynthesis blocking algae pores and causing oxidative stress and structural damage 27 28 hence it is noteworthy to investigate the direct and indirect toxic effects of nps on microalgae based on this background c reinhardtii the most widely distributed algal species in freshwater environments and commonly used in eco toxicological studies was chosen as the model organism polystyrene ps widely used in commercial plastics was selected as a typical plastic 29 in this study we compared the effects of two particle size ps microbeads 100 nm and 100 μm on the growth photosynthetic oxidative stress and cell morphology of c reinhardtii the objective was to gain insight into the different response mechanisms of ps mps and ps nps on microalgae the findings of this study help improve our knowledge on the toxicity effects of micro and nano plastics in freshwater environments 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of ps nps and ps mps ps microbeads with a diameter of 100 nm and 100 μm were both purchased from dongguan mingyuxing plastic raw material co ltd china they were original plastic products without plasticizers and other additives the particle size distributions and zeta potentials of these ps mps and ps nps were observed with a laser particle size analyzer mastersizer 3000 malvern instruments ltd britain and zetasizer nano zs zetasizernano malvern instruments ltd britain respectively 2 2 microalgal cultivation c reinhardtii fachb 265 was provided by the freshwater algae culture collection of the institute of hydrobiology wuhan china all culture supplies of c reinhardtii including growth medium erlenmeyer flasks etc were sterilized by autoclaving at 105 c for 40 min before use the algae were cultured in 500 ml erlenmeyer flasks containing 300 ml of sterile selenite enrichment se medium table s1 at 25 1 c the algae cells were placed into an illumination incubator under a light intensity of 4000 50 lx with a 12 12 h light dark cycle the erlenmeyer flasks were shaken 4 6 times daily to prevent sedimentation of the algae cells and ensure co2 supply the algae were cultured to be at the logarithmic growth stage for subsequent tests with the initial algae density maintained at 1 106 cells ml 2 3 microalgae growth inhibition assay the stock solutions of ps mps and ps nps were diluted with milli q water to a final concentration of 50 250 and 500 mg l respectively the algae solution without ps microbeads served as controls all experiments were repeated three times under sterile conditions the algal solution erlenmeyer flasks were randomly placed in the illumination incubator for 96 h and c reinhardtii density was counted every 24 h using a hemocytometer growth inhibition ratio ir of c reinhardtii was calculated by the following formula ir 1 t c 100 where t was the cell density cells ml in the ps mps or ps nps experimental group and c was the cell density cells ml in the control group 2 4 determination of chlorophyll content the algal suspension 4 ml was centrifuged to remove the supernatant and resuspended in the same volume of 80 acetone the centrifuge tube was heated in a water bath at 55 c in the dark for 30 min and then centrifuged at 12 000 rpm for 5 min to dilute the supernatant with 80 acetone to 5 ml then the absorbance values were measured at 663 nm 645 nm and 470 nm the formula for calculating chlorophyll content is as follows 28 c a 12 21 a 663 2 81 a 646 c b 20 13 a 646 5 03 a 663 c x c 1000 a 470 3 27 c a 104 c b 229 c t c a c b where ca cb cx c and ct were the concentrations of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b carotenoids and total chlorophylls respectively 2 5 determination of extracellular polymeric substances eps the main eps components of microalgae are polysaccharide and proteins 30 in this study the contents of exopolysaccharide and extracellular protein were determined at a 24 h interval the content of eps was measured by heat treatment as follows the algal suspension 10 ml was first centrifuged 4000 rpm 10 min then the supernatant was removed then a phosphate buffered solution pbs 0 1 m ph 7 2 was added to supplement the volume next the mixture was heated at 80 c for 30 min and then centrifuged to collect the supernatant and filtered through a 0 45 μm filter membrane to determine the polysaccharide and protein content the protein content in the eps was stained with coomassie brilliant blue reagent and measured at 595 nm wavelength 31 and the polysaccharide content was determined at 620 nm using the anthrone sulfuric assay according to the method of morris et al 32 2 6 flow cytometry fcm analysis the effects of micro or nano plastics exposure on cell morphology intracellular chlorophyll autofluorescence cell membrane permeability and oxidative stress were analyzed by using fcm bd biosciences new jersey usa forward scattered light fsc side scattered light ssc and red autofluorescence fl4 red emission filter long pass 670 nm were correlated with cell size cell complexity and chlorophyll autofluorescence respectively propidium iodide pi is a nucleic acid dye that can only enter membrane compromised cells and emit red fluorescent after binding nucleic acids allowing quantification of cell membrane permeability 28 the dead cells stained red with pi were measured using the fl3 channel 533 30 nm reactive oxygen species ros generation was evaluated using the 2 7 dichlorofluorescin diacetate h2dcfda staining method using fl1 channel 605 635 nm although h2dcfda is a non fluorescent dye it is converted to the highly fluorescent 2 7 dichlorofluorescein dcf when oxidized in the presence of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 hydroxyl radical oh and superoxide anion radical o2 33 the algae suspension 1 ml was collected by centrifugation at 3500 rpm for 10 min after treatment with ps mps or ps nps for 96 h and then washed and resuspended in pbs 0 1 m ph 7 2 to assess cell membrane permeability and intracellular ros generation we used 60 μm pi or 80 μm h2dcfda to stain microalgae cells and incubated them for 30 min in the dark at 25 c the 0 1 mm h2o2 treated cells and 100 heat damaged cells at 99 c for 30 min served as positive controls for ros generation and cell membrane permeability respectively negative controls were normal cells without micro or nano plastics treatment after staining the fluorescence intensities for each parameter were respectively obtained from 10 000 cells of c reinhardtii the intracellular relative fluorescence intensity was expressed as fluorescence intensity of the treated groups the control group 100 2 7 assays for antioxidant enzyme activities and lipid peroxidation antioxidant enzymes mainly include superoxide dismutase sod peroxidase pod and catalase cat the sod pod cat and malondialdehyde mda were all measured using different kits sod a001 1 pod a084 3 cat a007 1 1 mda a003 1 nanjing jiancheng bioengineering institute china the algae suspension 50 ml was centrifuged 3000 rpm 10 min to remove the supernatant then the collected algal precipitate was washed twice and mixed with pbs 0 1 m ph 7 0 homogenized using an ultrasonic cell crusher scientz iid ningbo scientz biotechnology company china for 3 min in an ice bath and then centrifuged 12 000 rpm 15 min to collect the supernatant finally according to the manufacturer s instructions the supernatant was taken and added to the indicator to determine the absorbance at the corresponding wavelengths 2 8 microstructure analysis the surface heterogeneous aggregation and cellular ultrastructure alteration of algal cells were observed by a scanning electron microscope sem su8010 hitachi japan and transmission electron microscopy tem h 7650 hitachi japan respectively due to the space limit the experimental details are presented in supplementary materials text 1 2 9 statistical analysis all data were expressed as the mean standard deviation n 3 the experimental data were analyzed with spss 19 0 and a one way analysis of variance anova p values of 0 01 and 0 05 were considered to be extremely significant difference and a significant difference the spss software was used to calculate the medium effective concentration ec50 the collected fcm data were analyzed using the flowjo software version 10 3 results 3 1 characterization of ps micro and nano beads the median diameters of the ps mps and ps nps were 93 6 μm and 102 1 nm respectively and both of them showed a normal distribution in solution fig 1 the zeta potentials of the ps mps and ps nps suspension were 4 75 1 85 mv and 0 47 0 04 mv respectively fig s1 the sem images exhibited that the micro and nano beads were of spherical nature with a smooth surface fig 1 3 2 effects of micro and nano plastics on the growth and metabolism of c reinhardtii 3 2 1 effects of micro and nano plastics on the growth of c reinhardtii the inhibition ratios ir of ps mps and ps nps 0 500 mg l on the biomass of c reinhardtii at 0 96 h are shown in fig 2 a and b respectively compared with the control group both ps mps and ps nps could inhibit the growth of algae and the inhibitory effect became more obvious with increasing exposure concentration and time the ir of ps mps was 5 2 13 9 and 23 3 under 50 250 500 mg l treatment for 96 h whereas that of ps nps was 16 4 45 1 and 61 7 respectively indicating the distinct size effect the smaller the size of the plastic particles is the stronger the toxicity to microalgae is the 96 h ec50 of ps nps for c reinhardtii was 300 35 mg l however the ps mps didn t reach the half maximum inhibitory concentration in the range of 0 500 mg l 3 2 2 effects of micro and nano plastics on photosynthetic pigment content of c reinhardtii as demonstrated in fig 3 the synthesis of chlorophyll a chlorophyll b carotenoids and total chlorophyll in c reinhardtii was inhibited as the concentration of microplastics increased the inhibition ratios of carotenoids and total chlorophyll for 500 mg l ps mps 96 h were 22 9 and 26 5 respectively compared to the control group whereas those for ps nps were up to 72 6 and 72 8 respectively therefore ps nps had a stronger inhibitory effect on algal photosynthesis meanwhile we measured the intensity of chlorophyll autofluorescence microalgal cells by using fcm fig 4 a the intracellular chlorophyll autofluorescence of c reinhardtii decreased significantly with increasing concentration and decreasing particle size the inhibition of chlorophyll autofluorescence increased from 17 8 to 33 7 when the ps mps concentration increased from 50 mg l to 500 mg l while for ps nps the inhibitory effect of chlorophyll increased from 10 5 to 61 1 the findings matched those of the chlorophyll content tests fig 3 3 2 3 eps content as shown in fig 5 a the content of exopolysaccharide under micro and nano plastics exposures decreased in a short time 24 h and 48 h respectively subsequently the exopolysaccharide content in c reinhardtii increased with the increase of ps mps and ps nps concentrations at 72 and 96 h showing a dose response trend for ps nps the exopolysaccharide content of c reinhardtii exposed to 50 250 and 500 mg l ps nps significantly p 0 05 increased by 27 1 29 3 and 48 0 at 96 h compared with the control group respectively the maximum exopolysaccharide content was observed under 500 mg l ps for 96 h which was 54 2 1 23 and 72 0 1 8 mg g for mps and nps respectively the result indicated that the microalgae under ps nps stress could secrete more exopolysaccharide to resist adverse effects compared with those under ps mps stress in addition a dose response trend becomes more evident in extracellular protein content under micro and nano plastics stress except at 24 h the extracellular protein content produced by ps nps was greater than that induced by ps mps at the same dose fig 5b after exposure to 500 mg l ps nps for 96 h algal cells secreted up to 22 5 2 4 mg g of extracellular protein which was 1 85 and 1 54 times greater than the control group and the same concentration of ps mps respectively the above results indicate that compared with ps mps ps nps promote microalgae to secrete more content of eps including exopolysaccharide and protein which may involve in the extracellular defense mechanism that tries to prevent plastics from entering into cells 3 3 effects of micro and nano plastics on oxidative stress and antioxidant capacity of c reinhardtii 3 3 1 oxidative biomarkers as shown in fig s2 ps mps and ps nps 250 mg l induced an increasing dcf fluorescence intensity ros production in c reinhardtii as the dcf peak shifted rightward on the x axis and the peak of mps shifted significantly than nps between the x axis values of 103 and 104 therefore the relative ros ratio was calculated from fig s2 and provided a semi quantitative assessment of ros level in fig 6 a when the concentration of ps mps increased from 50 mg l to 500 mg l the ros increased from 112 2 7 4 to 130 2 12 1 at 96 h however it is worth noting that a different trend was observed under ps nps stress the ros decreased from 117 9 10 4 to 98 7 5 7 at the same concentration gradient of ps nps in addition compared with the control group the intracellular ros production of c reinhardtii significantly increased p 0 05 in 500 mg l ps mps and there was a significant difference p 0 05 between ps mps and ps nps this phenomenon was related to cell apoptosis and increase of antioxidant enzyme activity 3 3 2 antioxidant enzyme activity of c reinhardtii in order to gain insights into the change of antioxidative enzymes under micro and nano plastics stress the activities of three anti oxidative enzymes sod cat and pod were investigated fig 6b d the maximum enhancement in sod activity at 500 mg l ps mps and ps nps was 1 3 and 2 4 fold respectively compared to the control fig 6b the activity of sod increased with the increase of mps or nps concentrations in addition the increasing trend of ps nps was more significant than that of ps mps increasing from 28 6 0 3 to 59 2 2 0 u 106cells these data indicated that ps nps were more likely to induce microalgae to produce superoxide anion o2 thereby increasing their inhibitory effect on algae cat and pod are also major antioxidant enzymes involved in modulation of intracellular ros levels results of cat and pod values are shown in fig 6c and d the intracellular cat activity of c reinhardtii increased gradually with the increase of ps dose in the range of 50 to 500 mg l which was consistent with the trend of sod the cat for ps nps was significantly higher p 0 01 than that for ps mps and the maximum value was 3 2 0 1 u 106cells under 500 mg l ps nps exposure at 96 h furthermore pod enzyme activity showed a similar trend positively correlated with the ps concentration and negatively correlated with the size of plastics interestingly the pod activity was the highest under 250 mg l ps nps stress instead of 500 mg l which was 8 3 fold higher than that of the control group this may be related to the more severe cell damage caused by high concentrations of ps nps both cat and sod activities of the ps nps test groups were significantly enhanced p 0 05 which also reflected that ps nps stress enhanced the intracellular peroxide content 3 3 3 lipid peroxidation mda is the most frequently used indicator for lipid peroxidation the amount of mda in microalgae cells rose after 96 h of exposure in both ps mps and ps nps experiments indicating lipid peroxidation fig 7 a in addition the mda level was enhanced with the increase of ps concentration the mda contents increased from 1 2 to 1 3 times compared to the control group when the ps mps concentration increased from 50 mg l to 500 mg l and the mda contents increased from 1 5 to 2 2 times when the ps nps increased from 50 to 500 mg l these data showed ps nps had stronger oxidative damages than ps mps which was consistent with the results of oxidative stress experiments 3 3 4 cell membrane permeability as demonstrated in fig s3 the contour map of 100 heat damaged cells positive control deviated significantly from normal cells negative control and the increase in fluorescence intensity indicated an increase in cell membrane permeability as the exposure concentration of micro or nano plastics increased the cell contour map gradually drifted to the right indicating membrane damage in addition the overlap area between the ps nps and the positive control cells was larger under the 500 mg l stress indicating that the microalgae cell membrane is more permeable under the high concentration of ps nps stress the relative fluorescence intensity can be used to evaluate the changes in membrane permeability under plastic stress it was defined as the ratio of fluorescence intensity of the ps mps or ps nps treated cells to that of the untreated cells fig 7b we found that increasing the concentration of micro or nano plastics from 50 mg l to 500 mg l significantly p 0 05 increased the membrane permeability of the c reinhardtii cells especially after exposure to 500 mg l ps nps for 96 h the cell membrane permeability was increased by 21 0 0 2 p 0 01 when compared with the control interestingly ps mps caused a significant p 0 05 increase in cell membrane permeability at 50 mg l while ps nps had no significant difference in short both mps and nps caused a certain degree of changes in cell membrane permeability and high concentrations of ps nps could easily lead to severe cell damage or even death 3 4 morphological property of c reinhardtii 3 4 1 cell size as shown in fig 4b the control and ps mps treated groups cells had similar cell size however the size of c reinhardtii increased significantly p 0 01 in the ps nps treated groups 50 and 250 mg l and the increases were 22 7 and 17 1 respectively compared with the control group for 96 h and while cell size was negatively related to ps nps concentration there was no significant p 0 05 effect on ps mps 3 4 2 ultrastructure of c reinhardtii cells and potential internalization of micro and nano plastics sem images of cells after 96 h exposure of ps mps and ps nps are shown in fig 8 c reinhardtii cells were well adhered to the ps mps surface and sank to the bottom with the mps fig 8a however ps nps and c reinhardtii formed a heterogeneous aggregation fig 8b as if a plastic coat on the microalgae to further understand the effect of ps nps on the ultrastructure and organelle organization of c reinhardtii tem was performed on the cells treated with ps nps for 96 h fig 9 tem pictures of non exposed c reinhardtii cells with intact morphology cell wall plasma membrane pyrenoids chloroplast nucleus and other organelles were shown in fig 9a and b the vacuoles were clear and transparent without obvious impurities by contrast when exposed to ps nps the cell wall was detached from the plasma membrane and the thylakoids could not be precisely distinguished in the cell fig 9c and d in addition the formation of autophagic vacuoles was observed and many ps nps gathered in the vacuole fig 9e and f this might be related to the intracellular defense mechanism of microalgae which aggregated the nps into the vacuole to reduce their diffusion in the cell 4 discussions from the obtained results both ps mps and ps nps can influence algal growth and reproduction in particular ps nps have a more obvious inhibitory effect than ps mps the more micro or nano plastics that are added the more harmful the algae become previous studies have indicated that mps can inhibit the growth of microalgae which was consistent with the results in our study 34 for example sjollema et al found that three different diameters of ps 0 05 0 5 and 6 μm had a significant negative effect on the growth of dunaliella tertiolecta under 250 mg l exposure at 72 h and the inhibitory rate of algae increased with the decreasing size of mps 35 however liu et al found that there were no significant differences among the five types of mps on scenedesmus obliquus except under 0 5 μm ps during the 150 h exposure but the toxic mechanism varied with particle size 36 large size mps could potentially serve as substrates for microalgae to colonize the surface and promote growth while nps could enter the cell and cause serious damage 37 the photosynthetic pigment content directly reflects the photosynthetic capacity of microalgae 38 in the present experiments with the increase of ps concentration or decrease in particle size the pigment content of c reinhardtii reduced indicating that the photosynthetic system of microalgae was inhibited these results were further verified by measuring the autofluorescence intensity of chlorophyll using fcm stress factors are believed to reduce levels of photosynthetic pigments leading to a reduction in the effective quantum yield of psii and photosynthetic capacity 39 in the study of wu et al both polyvinyl chloride pvc and polypropylene pp could inhibit the electron transmission efficiency of microalgae and reduce the value of fv fm fv fm and fv f0 40 similarly we observed with tem that the thylakoid structure was destroyed and blurred under 500 mg l ps nps stress thylakoids are the sites of light photosynthetic reactions and play a key role in the stability of photosynthesis because they contain photosynthetic pigment 41 therefore the destruction of thylakoids by ps nps will inevitably affect the photosynthesis of microalgae furthermore the accumulation of ros content in microalgae under microplastics stress can also destroy the structure of chloroplasts and hinder synthesis of photosynthetic pigments 42 in this study we found that ps mps induced a higher ros content in microalgae cells than ps nps while their effect on antioxidant enzyme activity was opposite combined with the analysis of the cell membrane permeability index this may be due to nanometer particle stress will increase the cell membrane permeability leading to cell apoptotic lysis and intracellular ros may spill over excessive ros levels not only inhibit photosynthetic activity of microalgae but also promote lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane 43 44 mda content reflects the extent of lipid peroxidation and membrane injury 45 mda levels rose when ps microbeads concentration increased indicating the occurrence of lipid peroxidation in c reinhardtii moreover the cell membrane permeability was greatly increased under high concentration of ps nps treatment 250 mg l fig 7b an obvious plasmolysis phenomenon was further observed using tem fig 9d additionally ros plays a dual role in cell injuries excessive ros induces cell apoptosis and necrosis while a small increase in ros level promotes cell proliferation 46 if the cell is damaged severely and the damage lasts for a long time the membrane permeability will continue to increase eventually leading to cell apoptosis 43 this will cause the cells and organelles to swell and deform increasing the cell complexity which is similar to the increase in cell size under ps nps as shown in fig s4 in this study research has reported that the adsorption of nps in algal cells resulted in the accumulation of excessive ros which caused physical blockage and hindered photosynthesis of scenedesmus 47 compared with mps nps showed more serious injury of the cell membrane indicating that nps may be more toxic in aquatic environments antioxidant enzymes play an important role in cellular defense against oxidative stress sod can scavenge superoxide radicals o2 to protect cells from oxidative damage which turns o2 into o2 and h2o2 48 our results showed that algal cells could significantly p 0 01 enhance the activity of sod in response to external stresses caused by micro or nano plastics especially 100 nm ps nps also the sod level was enhanced with the increase of ps nps the sod converts o2 into h2o2 while the generated h2o2 could be further eliminated by cat and pod 18 therefore cat and pod are regarded as the second line of defense against oxidative stress which h2o2 can be metabolized into oxygen and water by cat and pod 49 the cat and pod activity in c reinhardtii cells gradually increased with the increase of micro and nano plastics content which was basically consistent with the change of sod however the activity of the pod enzyme decreases under 500 mg l after ps nps exposure for 96 h this may be related to the accumulation of excessive h2o2 that can t be eliminated at the time leading to changes in the enzyme molecular structure and destruction of the defense system 50 microalgae exposed to stressful circumstances such as the presence of ps nps sticking to the cell surface can also generate more eps eps can attach ps nps on the algal surface to resist unfavorable factors which was also found in the present study 51 lagarde et al found that two of the microalgae genes udp glucuronate decarboxylase and udp glucose 4 epimerase involved in extracellular polysaccharide biosynthesis pathways were strongly over expressed when exposed to 1 g l high density polyethylene hdpe 400 μm after more than 70 days 52 meanwhile eps can thicken cell walls to protect cells from physical damage 53 the tem images showed that algal cell walls thickened fig 9e which may effectively prevent invasion of nps 13 similar results were also detected in chlorella ellipsoids exposed to aluminum oxide nanoparticles 54 on the other hand eps can attach nanoparticles through establishing hydrogen bonding or electrostatic interaction 55 56 changing the surface charge and hydrodynamic diameter and reducing bioavailability 57 thus these excessive secretions of eps are possibly associated with the defense mechanisms of microalgae against micro and nano plastics in addition the physical adsorption between microalgae and mps or nps is also one of the indispensable reasons for inhibiting the growth of microalgae the adsorption of microalgae on the ps mps surface will cause a shading effect on the photosynthesis of the algae cells and inhibit the electron transmission efficiency 23 furthermore owing to their high specific surface area nps are simpler to accumulate and adsorb on the surface of microalgae than mps ps nps blocked the transmission channel between microalgae and external substances hindering the exchange of substances and energy between inside and outside the cell bhattacharya et al found that the hetero aggregation of ps microplastic and chlorella cells blocked light from reaching the photosynthetic centers and damaged the cell walls 47 adsorption and internalization of nanomaterials are also the main reasons for the increase in cell size 27 it is intriguing that c reinhardtii cells produce autophagic vacuoles and then phagocytize nps into vacuoles to prevent further intracellular diffusion of nps as shown in tem images fig 9f 5 conclusions in summary ps nps exhibited more severe and unfavorable effects on c reinhardtii than ps mps according to the findings of systematic studies on growth inhibition photosynthesis oxidative stress and ultrastructure the reason may be that nps which have a small size and high surface area are more susceptible to being absorbed and internalized by microalgae causing a shading effect oxidative stress and cell structure damage to the algal cells the stress of mps and nps on microalgae also induced the defense mechanism of the microalgae causing an increase in antioxidant enzyme activity sod pod and cat and eps secretion this study is an acute toxicity experiment revealing the toxicity and defense mechanism of microalgae with different particle sizes 100 nm and 100 μm of plastics which is useful for providing a theoretical reference for understanding the environmental risk assessment of mps and nps pollution in the freshwater environment the next step of the study is to minimize the difference between laboratory culture conditions and the real freshwater environment we will adopt low concentrations of mps and nps as well as long term exposure conditions to lay the foundation to comprehensively evaluate the toxicity of micro and nano plastics in the real aquatic environment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

selectivity for gold iii over copper ii achieved at pheq 2 the highest stripping of gold iii 76 and copper ii 95 from loaded pkfad was accomplished with 1 m thiourea 0 5 m hydrochloric acid solution and 2 m formic acid respectively hence pkfad had shown great promise as a green extractant for gold iii and copper ii from chloride media graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords extraction

1 2 while copper is a transition metal for building construction power generation transmission and distribution electrical and electronics machinery and transportation 3 4 of late the extensive applications and limited supplies of gold and copper have driven their recovery from various aqueous waste solutions such as pregnant leach solutions of solid wastes electronic scraps dental amalgam wastes metal finishing sludges spent catalysts battery wastes coal ash etc spent process solutions spent plating and etching solutions waste rinse water etc and industrial wastewater metal finishing mining smelting electrical and electronic automobile etc 5 7 these waste solutions generally contain gold and copper ions mainly gold iii and copper ii in the range of 5 to 5800 mg l and 10 to 300 000 mg l 1 respectively numerous techniques such as cementation 8 membrane separation 9 electrochemical process 10 ion exchange 11 solvent extraction 12 and adsorption 13 have been used to recover gold iii and copper ii from aqueous media among these techniques solvent extraction is one of the simplest most efficient and widely used ones many researchers have recovered gold iii and or copper ii from various aqueous media via solvent extraction for instance rao et al 14 extracted 99 of gold iii and copper ii from sulfate and nitrate media respectively using a tertiary amide diluted in toluene and acorga m640 diluted in kerosene respectively kubota et al 15 extracted 85 of gold iii from chloride and nitrate media using n n n di 2 ethylhexyl amino carbonyl ethyl glycine diluted in n dodecane and raiguel et al 16 extracted 98 of gold iii from chloride media with diethyl carbonate meanwhile sun et al 17 extracted nearly 100 copper ii from sulfate media using a mixture of mextral 84h and cyanex 272 diluted in an aliphatic diluent and halim et al 18 extracted more than 95 of copper ii from sulfate media with different free fatty acid ffa rich oils namely palm fatty acid distillate palm kernel fatty acid distillate pkfad and jatropha oil pkfad is a low cost waste material generated by palm oil mills in palm oil producing nations like malaysia used broadly as a raw material for oleochemical soap and detergent and animal feed industries 19 recently halim et al 3 demonstrated for the first time that pkfad could serve as a green extractant without any diluent that extracted up to 98 of copper ii from sulfate media with the ffas 80 90 wt 19 of pkfad functioned as the active components in the extraction however that study was conducted with single copper ii media only and the potential of pkfad to extract other metal ions has not been explored yet since precious metal ions like gold iii often co exist with base metal ions like copper ii as the bulk metal ions in various chloride media 1 this work aimed to investigate the capability of pkfad to extract gold iii and copper ii from chloride media first the equilibrium ph pheq extraction isotherms of pkfad for gold iii and copper ii from single metal media without and with an inert salt were investigated followed by the extraction selectivity of pkfad for gold iii over copper ii from binary metal media and the stripping back extraction of gold iii and copper ii from loaded pkfad using various stripping agents the presence of extracted species in loaded pkfad was then verified using ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy lastly the extraction mechanisms of pkfad for gold iii and copper ii were evaluated accordingly by chemical modification studies and a chloride ion release test the overall flowchart of this work is depicted in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pkfad 85 wt of ffas 12 wt of glycerides and 3 wt other substances was supplied by biolution resources sdn bhd and was used directly in its original form without purification chloroauric acid haucl4 sigma aldrich 99 purity copper ii chloride dihydrate cucl2 2h2o r m 98 purity sodium chloride nacl q rec 99 8 purity hydrochloric acid hcl q rec 37 purity thiourea sigma aldrich 99 purity sulfuric acid h2so4 merck 98 purity formic acid hcooh q rec 85 purity sodium hydroxide naoh q rec 99 and sodium dodecyl sulfate sigma aldrich 99 were used as received 2 2 preparation of aqueous and organic phases the aqueous feed phases for extraction experiments which contained single or binary metal ions of gold iii or and copper ii were prepared by mixing suitable amounts of haucl4 or and cucl2 2h2o in distilled water without and with 200 mm of nacl inert salt while the organic phase was pkfad the initial concentration of each metal ion in the single or binary metal aqueous feed phases was 0 5 mm unless stated otherwise and the molar ratio of gold iii to copper ii employed in the binary metal media was 1 1 for stripping experiments the aqueous stripping phases were prepared from pure or mixed hcl h2so4 formic acid and thiourea at various concentrations from 0 5 to 2 m while the organic phases were loaded pkfad obtained after extraction 2 3 extraction and stripping procedures the extraction procedure was analogous to that provided in our earlier work 20 firstly a prepared aqueous feed phase was mixed with 30 ml of pkfad at an aqueous to organic phase volume ratio of 1 1 in an erlenmeyer conical flask with a glass stopper the flask was then agitated at 150 rpm using an orbital shaker lab companion si 300 for 5 min followed by a quiescent mixture settling for about 10 min to separate the phases by gravity next about 5 ml of aqueous sample was withdrawn from the flask using a syringe which was then subjected to pheq measurement by a ph meter hanna instrument hi11310 if the target pheq was not achieved 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh was added dropwise from a dropper to the flask and the flask was agitated for another 5 min this step continued until the target pheq was achieved after that the mixture was moved from the flask to a separatory funnel and left overnight for phase separation finally about 10 ml of aqueous sample was collected from the flask for metal analysis with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 7000 dv after appropriate filtration and dilution the percentage extraction e and distribution ratio of a metal ion d m as well as the separation factor of gold iii over copper ii sf au cu were calculated by eqs 1 2 and 3 respectively which are given as follows 21 1 e m i feed m f feed m i feed 100 2 d m m i feed m f feed m f feed 3 sf au cu d au d cu where m is a metal ion m i feed and m f feed are the initial and final concentrations of metal ions in the aqueous feed phase respectively the stripping procedure was comparable to that of extraction but without the pheq adjustment step the percentage stripping s of a metal ion is expressed as 20 4 s m f strip m i feed m f feed 100 where m f strip is the final concentration of metal ions in the aqueous stripping phase all extraction and stripping experiments were performed in duplicate at 25 c and repeated at least three times and the relative standard deviation of replicate samples was below 4 2 4 uv vis and ftir analyses the existence of extracted species in pkfad before and after extraction was examined with a uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 25 while the functional groups of pkfad before and after chemical modifications were analyzed using an ftir spectrometer thermo scientific nicolet 6700 the uv vis spectra were acquired by passing light through a sample of 3 ml in a quartz cuvette 22 while the ftir spectra by using a single beam set up with 64 scans at a resolution of 4 cm 1 23 all analyses were performed three times per sample and all spectra were baseline corrected 2 5 chemical modification studies 2 5 1 esterification the carboxyl cooh groups of ffas in pkfad were modified chemically by an esterification process described by wang et al 24 initially 50 g of pkfad was poured into a three neck round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a hotplate magnetic stirrer fisherbrand isotemp the flask was then immersed in an oil bath and heated to 95 c next 60 ml of methanol and 4 wt h2so4 were added to the heated pkfad in the flask followed by heating at the same temperature for 2 h the mixture was then shifted into a separatory funnel and allowed to settle overnight into two layers lastly the upper oil layer was separated and washed with hot distilled water at 50 c until the washing was neutral 2 5 2 hydrolysis the ester rcoo groups of glycerides in pkfad were modified chemically by an acid catalyzed hydrolysis process described by ma et al 25 briefly the process took place in a three neck round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser and equipped with a hotplate magnetic stirrer fisherbrand isotemp in an oil bath the reaction mixture contained 40 g of pkfad 30 wt of h2so4 catalyst and 2 wt of sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant and the water to pkfad mass ratio used was 3 1 the reaction mixture was heated at 100 c for 4 h and then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min the upper oil layer obtained from centrifugation was then separated and washed with hot distilled water at 50 c until the washing was neutral 2 6 chloride ion release test the concentration of chloride ions in an aqueous feed solution containing 2 5 mm initial gold iii concentration and 200 mm nacl was measured before and after extraction by pkfad according to the standard mercuric nitrate method apha 4500 cl method c 26 the measurement was performed three times per sample with a relative standard deviation of replicate samples of below 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 pheq extraction isotherms of pkfad for gold iii and copper ii from single metal media a pheq extraction isotherm is vital to understanding the extraction behavior of an organic solvent for target solutes under various conditions therefore the pheq extraction isotherms of pkfad for gold iii and copper ii from single metal media containing an initial gold iii or copper ii concentration of 0 5 mm without and with 200 mm nacl were investigated over the pheq range of 1 to 5 and the results obtained are depicted in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the pheq extraction isotherm of pkfad for gold iii without nacl exhibited a reverse sigmoid curve where e was maximum 99 at pheq 1 and 2 but dropped sharply to 23 at pheq 3 and then slipped gradually to a minimum of 7 at pheq 5 whereas that for gold iii with nacl showed an approximately horizontal pattern with e fluctuating at about 99 over the pheq range studied the former implies the pheq dependence of gold iii extraction by pkfad arising from the variation of the ionization degree of the cooh groups of ffas 85 wt the bulk components in pkfad with pheq 27 while the latter suggests its pheq independence attributable to the salting out effect of nacl in acidic pheq 7 chloride media gold iii species exist as a mixture of several anionic complexes predominating by aucl4 ions 16 but the cooh groups of ffas pka 3 28 are largely unionized cooh at pheq 3 and ionized carboxylate rcoo ions at pheq 3 27 accordingly in the absence of nacl the neutrally charged cooh groups of ffas diminished the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged aucl4 ions and enhanced the extraction of gold iii into pkfad at pheq 3 but at pheq 3 the negatively charged rcoo ions of ffas increased the electrostatic repulsion of aucl4 ions and reduced the extraction of gold iii fig 2 this extraction behavior of pkfad for gold iii without nacl at different pheq concurs with those of other cooh rich sources such as humic acid 29 30 peat soil humin 31 glutamic acid 32 and alfalfa biomass 33 for gold iii under similar conditions the plausible mechanism for gold iii extraction by pkfad at pheq 3 was through the hydrogen bonding resulting from the dipole dipole interactions between the partially positively charged acidic hydrogen atoms of the cooh groups of ffas in pkfad and the negatively charged chloride of aucl4 ions as illustrated in fig 3 31 a similar hydrogen bonding contributing to gold iii extraction at pheq 3 may also occur between the protonated ester rcooh groups of glycerides 34 12 wt the minor components in pkfad and aucl4 ions 35 in the presence of nacl however nacl interacted strongly with water dipoles to form polar hydration shells reducing the free water molecules and hence the hydration for aucl4 ions in the aqueous phase 36 this shifted the extraction equilibrium towards the organic phase to beneficially form the gold iii organic complexes extracted gold iii species and thus enhancing the e of gold iii over the pheq range studied fig 2 while the gold iii organic complexes formed at pheq 3 without and with nacl may be ascribed to the hydrogen bonding between aucl4 ions and cooh groups of ffas or rcooh groups of glycerides fig 3 those formed at pheq 3 with nacl could be attributable to a solvation mechanism between aucl4 ions and the deprotonated ester rcoo groups of glycerides in pkfad according to eq 5 37 5 aucl 4 aq rcoo org rcoo aucl 3 org cl aq where aq and org denote the aqueous and organic phases respectively rcoo aucl 3 is the gold iii organic complex formed and cl is the chloride ion released from aucl4 during the extraction in the absence of nacl however the low e 30 of gold iii attained at pheq 3 fig 2 suggests that the glycerides in pkfad did not play a major part in extracting gold iii this was probably due to the small amounts of glycerides 12 wt available in pkfad that were insufficient for gold iii extraction without the aid of the salting out effect of nacl similar salting out effects of nacl to those obtained in this work fig 2 have also been reported in the extraction of gold iii and palladium ii using a benzimidazole based ionic liquid 38 and ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate 39 respectively by other researchers unlike gold iii the pheq extraction isotherms of pkfad for copper ii without and with nacl shown as a single graph due to the close similarity of the data obtained presented a sigmoid curve where e was minimum 3 8 at pheq from 1 to 3 but increased dramatically to 63 at pheq 4 and then rose slowly to a maximum of 92 at pheq 5 fig 2 these results suggest that copper ii extraction by pkfad without and with nacl was strongly dependent on pheq and could be elucidated by the following extraction equation between copper ii and ffas from pkfad 3 6 cu 2 aq 2 m 2 rcooh 2 org cur 2 rcooh m org 2 h aq where rcooh 2 refers to the dimeric ffas m is the number of monomeric ffas involved in the extraction and cur 2 rcooh m is the copper ii organic complex extracted copper ii species formed based on eq 6 reducing proton h high pheq shifts the equilibrium position to the right and yields more copper ii organic complexes while increasing h low pheq moves the equilibrium position to the left and yields less copper ii organic complexes this extraction behavior of pkfad for copper ii without and with nacl agrees well with that of pkfad for copper ii without and with na2so4 reported earlier by our research team 3 denoting the negligible effect of different inert salts on copper ii extraction by pkfad the extraction mechanism of pkfad for copper ii could be delineated by ion exchange between copper ii and the acidic h from the cooh groups of ffas in pkfad eq 6 supported by the substantial ph drop measured in the aqueous feed phase before ph 5 3 and after pheq 3 3 extraction without any ph adjustment a similar ph drop in the aqueous feed phase before ph 3 7 and after pheq 3 4 extraction of gold iii by pkfad without and with nacl was however not observed indicating that an analogous ion exchange extraction mechanism as copper ii did not occur to gold iii the possibility for glycerides in pkfad to extract copper ii was ruled out since we had previously found that glyceride rich sources like vegetable oil were incapable of extracting copper ii from aqueous media 40 in addition the insignificant impact of nacl on the extraction of copper ii by pkfad fig 2 was probably due to the superior effect of pheq over the salting out effect of nacl considering the positive effect of nacl as an inert salt on gold iii extraction fig 2 it was used for further studies 3 2 extraction selectivity of pkfad for gold iii over copper ii from binary metal media given the scarcity of gold and its inordinately higher market value than that of copper usd 57 million t vs usd 9949 t 41 the selective recovery of gold iii over copper ii from waste solutions containing mixed gold iii and copper ii is indispensable hence the extraction selectivity of pkfad for gold iii over copper ii from binary metal media with 200 mm nacl was investigated over the pheq range of 1 to 5 and the results e and sfau cu obtained are shown in fig 4 equal initial concentrations 0 5 mm of gold iii and copper ii in aqueous feed solutions with gold iii to copper ii molar ratio of 1 1 were employed for all experiments to facilitate the detection of possible competition fig 4 reveals that the e of gold iii by pkfad from binary metal media with nacl was 95 99 over the pheq range studied while that of copper ii was 2 7 at pheq 3 but reached 62 and 92 at pheq 4 and 5 respectively these pheq extraction isotherms were compatible with those for the same metal ions from single metal media without for copper ii only and with for both gold iii and copper ii nacl fig 2 indicating weak interaction and competition for the binding sites between gold iii and copper ii meanwhile the sfau cu rose from 1074 at pheq 1 to a peak of 3129 at pheq 2 before plummeting to 1253 and 57 at pheq 3 and 4 respectively and hitting a low of 12 at pheq 5 fig 4 the lower sfau cu at pheq 1 than that at pheq 2 was caused by the competition between cl from the addition of hcl to increase the medium acidity and aucl for cooh groups of ffas or rcooh groups of glycerides in pkfad fig 3 31 while the lower sfau cu at pheq 3 5 than that at pheq 2 was due to the increasing copper ii extraction with gold iii extraction remained relatively unchanged over the same pheq range fig 4 it is worth noting that the highest sfau cu of 3129 achieved by pkfad at pheq 2 is higher than those attained by imidazolium 2063 42 and benzimidazole 171 38 ionic liquids and micelles 931 43 but lower than that accomplished by aromatic ethers 9801 44 this highly selective extraction of pkfad for gold iii over copper ii was on account of the vast disparities in the chemical behaviors between gold iii and copper ii such as oxidation states 3 for gold iii and 2 for copper ii speciations in acidic chloride media anion for gold iii and cation for copper ii and binding affinities towards pkfad at different pheq figs 2 and 4 3 3 stripping of gold iii and copper ii from loaded pkfad solute stripping from loaded organic solvents always follows after an extraction process for solute preconcentration before solute recovery hence stripping of gold iii and copper ii from loaded pkfad were explored with different types and concentrations of stripping agents in this work and the results obtained are given in fig 5 the loaded pkfad came from the extraction of gold iii and copper ii from single metal media containing an initial gold iii or copper ii concentration of 0 5 mm and 200 mm nacl at pheq 5 pure thiourea and hcl and their mixtures at concentrations from 0 5 to 2 5 m were used as the stripping agents for gold iii while pure formic acid and h2so4 at concentrations from 0 5 to 2 m were used for copper ii stripping the former were selected for their widespread use and proven success in previous related studies by other researchers 1 whereas the latter were based on our previous work 3 fig 5 depicts that pure thiourea chelating agent and hcl ion exchanger at 1 m could only strip 18 and 0 2 of gold iii respectively from loaded pkfad but their mixtures at various concentrations from 0 5 to 2 5 m generally performed better with the stripping efficiency order of 1 m thiourea 0 5 m hcl 76 0 5 m thiourea 0 5 m hcl 42 1 5 m thiourea 0 5 hcl 37 2 m thiourea 0 5 m hcl 33 2 5 m thiourea 0 5 hcl 14 the former signifies that chelating and ion exchange mechanisms did not play a key role in governing the gold iii extraction by pkfad at pheq 5 but the solvation mechanism eq 5 while the latter implies that there was synergism between thiourea and hcl in solvating the gold iii thiourea hcl complexes formed and weakening the interaction between gold iii and pkfad thus promoting stripping 45 the effectiveness of different thiourea mineral acid solutions in stripping and desorbing gold iii from various loaded organic solvents 16 and adsorbents 46 47 respectively have also been documented in the literature meanwhile increasing the concentration of formic acid improved the copper ii stripping from loaded pkfad but increasing the concentration of h2so4 impaired it with the maximum s of 95 and 89 recorded by 2 m formic acid and 0 5 m h2so4 fig 5 respectively factually formic acid is a weaker but less viscous acid than h2so4 pka of 3 75 vs 3 and viscosity of 1 6 mpa s vs 21 mpa s 25 c 48 hence the lower acidic strength of formic acid led to its lower s achieved at 0 5 m than h2so4 at the same concentration 84 vs 89 but increasing the concentration of formic acid boosted its acidic strength and thus its s for viscous acids like h2so4 the rise in its viscosity with concentrations heightened its mass transfer resistance and reduced the copper ii transfer rate and thus its s the high efficiency of formic acid and h2so4 ion exchangers in copper ii stripping fig 5 confirms the ion exchange mechanism of pkfad in extracting copper ii eq 6 which is in good agreement with our previous work 3 3 4 verification of the presence of extracted species in loaded pkfad the presence of extracted species in loaded pkfad was validated by analyzing the uv vis spectra of pkfad before and after gold iii and copper ii extraction from single metal media containing an initial gold iii or copper ii concentration of 2 5 mm and 200 mm nacl at pheq 5 over the wavelength range of 350 850 nm fig 6 a before gold iii and copper ii extraction the spectrum of pkfad showed no peaks within the wavelength range studied however sharp and broad peaks were found in the spectra of pkfad after gold iii and copper ii extraction respectively at the maximum absorption wavelengths of 379 and 650 nm respectively this could be explained by the charge transfer transitions in gold iii and copper ii organic complexes extracted species arising from the excitation of electrons from lower to higher energy orbitals 2 that were responsible for changes in the color of pkfad from amber before extraction to brown and green after gold iii and copper ii extraction respectively as shown in fig 6 b while the maximum absorption wavelength of copper ii organic complex obtained in this work is compatible with that 679 nm reported in our previous work using the same organic ligand pkfad that of gold iii organic complex is slightly higher than those reported by lestari 29 and paclawski and sak 49 using humic 312 nm and formic 314 nm acids respectively as organic ligands but falls within the range of those reported by akhmadullina et al 50 who employed n n chelating organic ligands 354 410 nm 3 5 extraction mechanism evaluation 3 5 1 chemical modifications of pkfad to demonstrate the important roles of cooh and rcoo groups at pheq 3 fig 3 and rcoo groups at pheq 3 eq 5 in gold iii extraction as well as cooh groups at pheq 3 eq 6 in copper ii extraction cooh groups were transformed into rcoo groups by an acid catalyzed esterification reaction with methanol eq 7 24 and rcoo groups into cooh groups via an acid catalyzed hydrolysis reaction with water eq 8 51 7 rcooh 2 org 2 ch 3 oh aq h 2 rcooch 3 org 2 h 2 o aq 8 rcoor org h 2 o aq h rcooh org r oh aq where ch 3 oh is methanol rcooch 3 is fatty acid methyl esters fame and r oh is alcohol fig 7 shows the ftir spectra of pristine and esterified pkfad the hydrolyzed pkfad produced a similar spectral fingerprint as the pristine pkfad with slightly more intense peaks and thus its spectrum is not presented in fig 7 as can be seen in fig 7 pristine pkfad exhibited intense characteristic peaks of dimeric carboxylic acids resembling those of pure dimeric lauric 52 and oleic 53 acids i e oh bending peaks at 935 out of plane 1413 in plane and 1465 in plane cm 1 co stretching peak at 1233 cm 1 co stretching peak at 1707 cm 1 and ch stretching peaks at 2853 symmetrical and 2922 asymmetrical cm 1 due to its high contents of lauric 49 wt 3 and oleic 11 wt 3 acids the characteristic peaks of esters i e co stretching peaks at 1112 and 1162 cm 1 and co stretching peak at 1743 cm 1 were relatively less intense due to the low glyceride content 12 wt of pkfad these findings are compatible with those reported by teo et al 54 and kamboh et al 23 for pristine palm fatty acid distillate after esterification the co stretching peak of dimeric carboxylic acids disappeared but the characteristic peaks of esters i e co stretching peaks at 1113 1168 and 1195 cm 1 and co stretching peak at 1740 cm 1 became considerably more intense as shown in the spectrum of esterified pkfad indicating the significant rise in the ester content of pkfad and the successful chemical modification of cooh groups of ffas in pkfad to fame eq 7 these results agree well with those reported by nosal et al 55 for fame derived from various ffas both the esterified and hydrolyzed pkfad were then used to extract gold iii and copper ii from single metal media containing an initial gold iii or copper ii concentration of 0 5 mm and 200 mm nacl at pheq 2 and 5 and the e of gold iii and copper ii attained were tabulated in table 1 the e of gold iii and copper ii accomplished with pristine pkfad under the same conditions retrieved from fig 2 were also included in table 1 for comparison purposes the high e of gold iii obtained by esterified pkfad at pheq 2 98 and 5 97 suggest the vital role of rcoo groups from fame in gold iii extraction at these pheq supporting the involvement of rcoo groups from glycerides before esterification in gold iii extraction at pheq 3 fig 3 and 3 eq 5 while the low e of copper ii obtained by esterified pkfad at pheq 2 5 and 5 27 indicate their insignificant role in copper ii extraction confirming the little or non involvement of rcoo groups from glycerides before esterification in copper ii extraction at pheq 3 and 3 meanwhile the high e 99 of gold iii and copper ii achieved by hydrolyzed pkfad at pheq 2 and 5 respectively denote the crucial role of cooh groups from ffas and verify their engagement in gold iii and copper ii extraction at pheq 3 fig 3 and 3 eq 6 respectively before hydrolysis in addition the substantial drops in the e of copper ii and gold iii by esterified 27 and hydrolyzed 14 pkfad respectively relative to those of pristine pkfad 92 for copper ii and 98 for gold iii at pheq 5 suggest the participation of cooh groups from ffas before esterification in copper ii extraction eq 6 and rcoo groups from glycerides before hydrolysis in gold iii extraction eq 5 at pheq 3 furthermore controlled experiments conducted with either 4 wt h2so4 catalyst or methanol without pkfad showed little or no effect on both gold iii and copper ii extraction data not shown these findings collectively corroborate the significant roles of cooh and rcoo groups at pheq 3 fig 3 and rcoo groups at pheq 3 eq 5 in gold iii extraction as well as cooh groups at pheq 3 eq 6 in copper ii extraction 3 5 2 chloride ion release test to substantiate the solvation mechanism involving the release of chloride ions from aucl4 ions during gold iii extraction by pkfad at pheq 3 eq 5 the chloride ion concentration in an aqueous feed solution containing an initial gold iii concentration of 2 5 mm and 200 mm nacl was determined before and after extraction by pkfad at pheq 5 the results disclosed that the concentration of chloride ions in the aqueous feed solution increased from 7486 to 7593 mg l before and after extraction and the e of gold iii achieved was 99 an evaluation of these data revealed that the amounts of chloride ion released and gold iii extracted were 3 02 and 2 51 mm respectively suggesting that about one mole of chloride ion was released for every mole of gold iii extracted and this validates the solvation mechanism proposed in eq 5 at pheq 3 this finding agrees with that obtained by radulescu et al 56 for gold iii adsorption by amberlite xad 7 containing rcoo groups meanwhile little or no change in the concentration of chloride ions was observed in the same aqueous feed solution before and after gold iii extraction by pkfad at pheq 2 data not shown indicating the absence of chloride ion release from the solvation mechanism as described by eq 5 at pheq 3 this supports the validity of the hydrogen bonding interaction between aucl4 ions and cooh groups of ffas or rcooh groups of glycerides in pkfad at pheq 3 that released no chloride ions fig 3 in addition no release of chloride ions was detected in a similar chloride ion release test conducted after copper ii extraction by pkfad at pheq 2 and 5 data not shown suggesting the nonoccurrence of the solvation mechanism between copper ii and rcoo groups of glycerides in pkfad as described by eq 5 for gold iii at pheq 3 and 3 4 conclusions pkfad extracted about 99 of gold iii at pheq 1 2 and 1 5 without and with nacl respectively and 92 of copper ii at pheq 5 without and with nacl with the highest separation factor for gold iii over copper ii of 3129 achieved at pheq 2 both gold iii and copper ii were stripped efficiently from loaded pkfad with 1 m thiourea 0 5 m hydrochloric acid solution 76 and 2 m formic acid 95 respectively the presence of extracted species in loaded pkfad was verified by a uv vis analysis gold iii was extracted by pkfad via a hydrogen bonding interaction with the carboxyl cooh groups of free fatty acids ffas or the protonated ester rcooh groups of glycerides in pkfad at pheq 3 and a solvation mechanism with the deprotonated ester rcoo groups of glycerides in pkfad at pheq 3 and copper ii was extracted by pkfad via an ion exchange mechanism with the cooh groups of ffas in pkfad at pheq 3 these mechanisms were supported by chemical modification studies and a chloride ion release test however future studies should address the extraction of gold iii and copper ii from different compositions of multi metal media using pkfad for more practical applications funding sources this work was supported by the ministry of education malaysia under the

1 2 while copper is a transition metal for building construction power generation transmission and distribution electrical and electronics machinery and transportation 3 4 of late the extensive applications and limited supplies of gold and copper have driven their recovery from various aqueous waste solutions such as pregnant leach solutions of solid wastes electronic scraps dental amalgam wastes metal finishing sludges spent catalysts battery wastes coal ash etc spent process solutions spent plating and etching solutions waste rinse water etc and industrial wastewater metal finishing mining smelting electrical and electronic automobile etc 5 7 these waste solutions generally contain gold and copper ions mainly gold iii and copper ii in the range of 5 to 5800 mg l and 10 to 300 000 mg l 1 respectively numerous techniques such as cementation 8 membrane separation 9 electrochemical process 10 ion exchange 11 solvent extraction 12 and adsorption 13 have been used to recover gold iii and copper ii from aqueous media among these techniques solvent extraction is one of the simplest most efficient and widely used ones many researchers have recovered gold iii and or copper ii from various aqueous media via solvent extraction for instance rao et al 14 extracted 99 of gold iii and copper ii from sulfate and nitrate media respectively using a tertiary amide diluted in toluene and acorga m640 diluted in kerosene respectively kubota et al 15 extracted 85 of gold iii from chloride and nitrate media using n n n di 2 ethylhexyl amino carbonyl ethyl glycine diluted in n dodecane and raiguel et al 16 extracted 98 of gold iii from chloride media with diethyl carbonate meanwhile sun et al 17 extracted nearly 100 copper ii from sulfate media using a mixture of mextral 84h and cyanex 272 diluted in an aliphatic diluent and halim et al 18 extracted more than 95 of copper ii from sulfate media with different free fatty acid ffa rich oils namely palm fatty acid distillate palm kernel fatty acid distillate pkfad and jatropha oil pkfad is a low cost waste material generated by palm oil mills in palm oil producing nations like malaysia used broadly as a raw material for oleochemical soap and detergent and animal feed industries 19 recently halim et al 3 demonstrated for the first time that pkfad could serve as a green extractant without any diluent that extracted up to 98 of copper ii from sulfate media with the ffas 80 90 wt 19 of pkfad functioned as the active components in the extraction however that study was conducted with single copper ii media only and the potential of pkfad to extract other metal ions has not been explored yet since precious metal ions like gold iii often co exist with base metal ions like copper ii as the bulk metal ions in various chloride media 1 this work aimed to investigate the capability of pkfad to extract gold iii and copper ii from chloride media first the equilibrium ph pheq extraction isotherms of pkfad for gold iii and copper ii from single metal media without and with an inert salt were investigated followed by the extraction selectivity of pkfad for gold iii over copper ii from binary metal media and the stripping back extraction of gold iii and copper ii from loaded pkfad using various stripping agents the presence of extracted species in loaded pkfad was then verified using ultraviolet visible uv vis spectroscopy lastly the extraction mechanisms of pkfad for gold iii and copper ii were evaluated accordingly by chemical modification studies and a chloride ion release test the overall flowchart of this work is depicted in fig 1 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials pkfad 85 wt of ffas 12 wt of glycerides and 3 wt other substances was supplied by biolution resources sdn bhd and was used directly in its original form without purification chloroauric acid haucl4 sigma aldrich 99 purity copper ii chloride dihydrate cucl2 2h2o r m 98 purity sodium chloride nacl q rec 99 8 purity hydrochloric acid hcl q rec 37 purity thiourea sigma aldrich 99 purity sulfuric acid h2so4 merck 98 purity formic acid hcooh q rec 85 purity sodium hydroxide naoh q rec 99 and sodium dodecyl sulfate sigma aldrich 99 were used as received 2 2 preparation of aqueous and organic phases the aqueous feed phases for extraction experiments which contained single or binary metal ions of gold iii or and copper ii were prepared by mixing suitable amounts of haucl4 or and cucl2 2h2o in distilled water without and with 200 mm of nacl inert salt while the organic phase was pkfad the initial concentration of each metal ion in the single or binary metal aqueous feed phases was 0 5 mm unless stated otherwise and the molar ratio of gold iii to copper ii employed in the binary metal media was 1 1 for stripping experiments the aqueous stripping phases were prepared from pure or mixed hcl h2so4 formic acid and thiourea at various concentrations from 0 5 to 2 m while the organic phases were loaded pkfad obtained after extraction 2 3 extraction and stripping procedures the extraction procedure was analogous to that provided in our earlier work 20 firstly a prepared aqueous feed phase was mixed with 30 ml of pkfad at an aqueous to organic phase volume ratio of 1 1 in an erlenmeyer conical flask with a glass stopper the flask was then agitated at 150 rpm using an orbital shaker lab companion si 300 for 5 min followed by a quiescent mixture settling for about 10 min to separate the phases by gravity next about 5 ml of aqueous sample was withdrawn from the flask using a syringe which was then subjected to pheq measurement by a ph meter hanna instrument hi11310 if the target pheq was not achieved 1 m hcl or 1 m naoh was added dropwise from a dropper to the flask and the flask was agitated for another 5 min this step continued until the target pheq was achieved after that the mixture was moved from the flask to a separatory funnel and left overnight for phase separation finally about 10 ml of aqueous sample was collected from the flask for metal analysis with an inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometer icp oes perkinelmer optima 7000 dv after appropriate filtration and dilution the percentage extraction e and distribution ratio of a metal ion d m as well as the separation factor of gold iii over copper ii sf au cu were calculated by eqs 1 2 and 3 respectively which are given as follows 21 1 e m i feed m f feed m i feed 100 2 d m m i feed m f feed m f feed 3 sf au cu d au d cu where m is a metal ion m i feed and m f feed are the initial and final concentrations of metal ions in the aqueous feed phase respectively the stripping procedure was comparable to that of extraction but without the pheq adjustment step the percentage stripping s of a metal ion is expressed as 20 4 s m f strip m i feed m f feed 100 where m f strip is the final concentration of metal ions in the aqueous stripping phase all extraction and stripping experiments were performed in duplicate at 25 c and repeated at least three times and the relative standard deviation of replicate samples was below 4 2 4 uv vis and ftir analyses the existence of extracted species in pkfad before and after extraction was examined with a uv vis spectrophotometer perkinelmer lambda 25 while the functional groups of pkfad before and after chemical modifications were analyzed using an ftir spectrometer thermo scientific nicolet 6700 the uv vis spectra were acquired by passing light through a sample of 3 ml in a quartz cuvette 22 while the ftir spectra by using a single beam set up with 64 scans at a resolution of 4 cm 1 23 all analyses were performed three times per sample and all spectra were baseline corrected 2 5 chemical modification studies 2 5 1 esterification the carboxyl cooh groups of ffas in pkfad were modified chemically by an esterification process described by wang et al 24 initially 50 g of pkfad was poured into a three neck round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser and a hotplate magnetic stirrer fisherbrand isotemp the flask was then immersed in an oil bath and heated to 95 c next 60 ml of methanol and 4 wt h2so4 were added to the heated pkfad in the flask followed by heating at the same temperature for 2 h the mixture was then shifted into a separatory funnel and allowed to settle overnight into two layers lastly the upper oil layer was separated and washed with hot distilled water at 50 c until the washing was neutral 2 5 2 hydrolysis the ester rcoo groups of glycerides in pkfad were modified chemically by an acid catalyzed hydrolysis process described by ma et al 25 briefly the process took place in a three neck round bottom flask fitted with a reflux condenser and equipped with a hotplate magnetic stirrer fisherbrand isotemp in an oil bath the reaction mixture contained 40 g of pkfad 30 wt of h2so4 catalyst and 2 wt of sodium dodecyl sulfate surfactant and the water to pkfad mass ratio used was 3 1 the reaction mixture was heated at 100 c for 4 h and then centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 5 min the upper oil layer obtained from centrifugation was then separated and washed with hot distilled water at 50 c until the washing was neutral 2 6 chloride ion release test the concentration of chloride ions in an aqueous feed solution containing 2 5 mm initial gold iii concentration and 200 mm nacl was measured before and after extraction by pkfad according to the standard mercuric nitrate method apha 4500 cl method c 26 the measurement was performed three times per sample with a relative standard deviation of replicate samples of below 3 3 results and discussion 3 1 pheq extraction isotherms of pkfad for gold iii and copper ii from single metal media a pheq extraction isotherm is vital to understanding the extraction behavior of an organic solvent for target solutes under various conditions therefore the pheq extraction isotherms of pkfad for gold iii and copper ii from single metal media containing an initial gold iii or copper ii concentration of 0 5 mm without and with 200 mm nacl were investigated over the pheq range of 1 to 5 and the results obtained are depicted in fig 2 as shown in fig 2 the pheq extraction isotherm of pkfad for gold iii without nacl exhibited a reverse sigmoid curve where e was maximum 99 at pheq 1 and 2 but dropped sharply to 23 at pheq 3 and then slipped gradually to a minimum of 7 at pheq 5 whereas that for gold iii with nacl showed an approximately horizontal pattern with e fluctuating at about 99 over the pheq range studied the former implies the pheq dependence of gold iii extraction by pkfad arising from the variation of the ionization degree of the cooh groups of ffas 85 wt the bulk components in pkfad with pheq 27 while the latter suggests its pheq independence attributable to the salting out effect of nacl in acidic pheq 7 chloride media gold iii species exist as a mixture of several anionic complexes predominating by aucl4 ions 16 but the cooh groups of ffas pka 3 28 are largely unionized cooh at pheq 3 and ionized carboxylate rcoo ions at pheq 3 27 accordingly in the absence of nacl the neutrally charged cooh groups of ffas diminished the electrostatic repulsion of negatively charged aucl4 ions and enhanced the extraction of gold iii into pkfad at pheq 3 but at pheq 3 the negatively charged rcoo ions of ffas increased the electrostatic repulsion of aucl4 ions and reduced the extraction of gold iii fig 2 this extraction behavior of pkfad for gold iii without nacl at different pheq concurs with those of other cooh rich sources such as humic acid 29 30 peat soil humin 31 glutamic acid 32 and alfalfa biomass 33 for gold iii under similar conditions the plausible mechanism for gold iii extraction by pkfad at pheq 3 was through the hydrogen bonding resulting from the dipole dipole interactions between the partially positively charged acidic hydrogen atoms of the cooh groups of ffas in pkfad and the negatively charged chloride of aucl4 ions as illustrated in fig 3 31 a similar hydrogen bonding contributing to gold iii extraction at pheq 3 may also occur between the protonated ester rcooh groups of glycerides 34 12 wt the minor components in pkfad and aucl4 ions 35 in the presence of nacl however nacl interacted strongly with water dipoles to form polar hydration shells reducing the free water molecules and hence the hydration for aucl4 ions in the aqueous phase 36 this shifted the extraction equilibrium towards the organic phase to beneficially form the gold iii organic complexes extracted gold iii species and thus enhancing the e of gold iii over the pheq range studied fig 2 while the gold iii organic complexes formed at pheq 3 without and with nacl may be ascribed to the hydrogen bonding between aucl4 ions and cooh groups of ffas or rcooh groups of glycerides fig 3 those formed at pheq 3 with nacl could be attributable to a solvation mechanism between aucl4 ions and the deprotonated ester rcoo groups of glycerides in pkfad according to eq 5 37 5 aucl 4 aq rcoo org rcoo aucl 3 org cl aq where aq and org denote the aqueous and organic phases respectively rcoo aucl 3 is the gold iii organic complex formed and cl is the chloride ion released from aucl4 during the extraction in the absence of nacl however the low e 30 of gold iii attained at pheq 3 fig 2 suggests that the glycerides in pkfad did not play a major part in extracting gold iii this was probably due to the small amounts of glycerides 12 wt available in pkfad that were insufficient for gold iii extraction without the aid of the salting out effect of nacl similar salting out effects of nacl to those obtained in this work fig 2 have also been reported in the extraction of gold iii and palladium ii using a benzimidazole based ionic liquid 38 and ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate 39 respectively by other researchers unlike gold iii the pheq extraction isotherms of pkfad for copper ii without and with nacl shown as a single graph due to the close similarity of the data obtained presented a sigmoid curve where e was minimum 3 8 at pheq from 1 to 3 but increased dramatically to 63 at pheq 4 and then rose slowly to a maximum of 92 at pheq 5 fig 2 these results suggest that copper ii extraction by pkfad without and with nacl was strongly dependent on pheq and could be elucidated by the following extraction equation between copper ii and ffas from pkfad 3 6 cu 2 aq 2 m 2 rcooh 2 org cur 2 rcooh m org 2 h aq where rcooh 2 refers to the dimeric ffas m is the number of monomeric ffas involved in the extraction and cur 2 rcooh m is the copper ii organic complex extracted copper ii species formed based on eq 6 reducing proton h high pheq shifts the equilibrium position to the right and yields more copper ii organic complexes while increasing h low pheq moves the equilibrium position to the left and yields less copper ii organic complexes this extraction behavior of pkfad for copper ii without and with nacl agrees well with that of pkfad for copper ii without and with na2so4 reported earlier by our research team 3 denoting the negligible effect of different inert salts on copper ii extraction by pkfad the extraction mechanism of pkfad for copper ii could be delineated by ion exchange between copper ii and the acidic h from the cooh groups of ffas in pkfad eq 6 supported by the substantial ph drop measured in the aqueous feed phase before ph 5 3 and after pheq 3 3 extraction without any ph adjustment a similar ph drop in the aqueous feed phase before ph 3 7 and after pheq 3 4 extraction of gold iii by pkfad without and with nacl was however not observed indicating that an analogous ion exchange extraction mechanism as copper ii did not occur to gold iii the possibility for glycerides in pkfad to extract copper ii was ruled out since we had previously found that glyceride rich sources like vegetable oil were incapable of extracting copper ii from aqueous media 40 in addition the insignificant impact of nacl on the extraction of copper ii by pkfad fig 2 was probably due to the superior effect of pheq over the salting out effect of nacl considering the positive effect of nacl as an inert salt on gold iii extraction fig 2 it was used for further studies 3 2 extraction selectivity of pkfad for gold iii over copper ii from binary metal media given the scarcity of gold and its inordinately higher market value than that of copper usd 57 million t vs usd 9949 t 41 the selective recovery of gold iii over copper ii from waste solutions containing mixed gold iii and copper ii is indispensable hence the extraction selectivity of pkfad for gold iii over copper ii from binary metal media with 200 mm nacl was investigated over the pheq range of 1 to 5 and the results e and sfau cu obtained are shown in fig 4 equal initial concentrations 0 5 mm of gold iii and copper ii in aqueous feed solutions with gold iii to copper ii molar ratio of 1 1 were employed for all experiments to facilitate the detection of possible competition fig 4 reveals that the e of gold iii by pkfad from binary metal media with nacl was 95 99 over the pheq range studied while that of copper ii was 2 7 at pheq 3 but reached 62 and 92 at pheq 4 and 5 respectively these pheq extraction isotherms were compatible with those for the same metal ions from single metal media without for copper ii only and with for both gold iii and copper ii nacl fig 2 indicating weak interaction and competition for the binding sites between gold iii and copper ii meanwhile the sfau cu rose from 1074 at pheq 1 to a peak of 3129 at pheq 2 before plummeting to 1253 and 57 at pheq 3 and 4 respectively and hitting a low of 12 at pheq 5 fig 4 the lower sfau cu at pheq 1 than that at pheq 2 was caused by the competition between cl from the addition of hcl to increase the medium acidity and aucl for cooh groups of ffas or rcooh groups of glycerides in pkfad fig 3 31 while the lower sfau cu at pheq 3 5 than that at pheq 2 was due to the increasing copper ii extraction with gold iii extraction remained relatively unchanged over the same pheq range fig 4 it is worth noting that the highest sfau cu of 3129 achieved by pkfad at pheq 2 is higher than those attained by imidazolium 2063 42 and benzimidazole 171 38 ionic liquids and micelles 931 43 but lower than that accomplished by aromatic ethers 9801 44 this highly selective extraction of pkfad for gold iii over copper ii was on account of the vast disparities in the chemical behaviors between gold iii and copper ii such as oxidation states 3 for gold iii and 2 for copper ii speciations in acidic chloride media anion for gold iii and cation for copper ii and binding affinities towards pkfad at different pheq figs 2 and 4 3 3 stripping of gold iii and copper ii from loaded pkfad solute stripping from loaded organic solvents always follows after an extraction process for solute preconcentration before solute recovery hence stripping of gold iii and copper ii from loaded pkfad were explored with different types and concentrations of stripping agents in this work and the results obtained are given in fig 5 the loaded pkfad came from the extraction of gold iii and copper ii from single metal media containing an initial gold iii or copper ii concentration of 0 5 mm and 200 mm nacl at pheq 5 pure thiourea and hcl and their mixtures at concentrations from 0 5 to 2 5 m were used as the stripping agents for gold iii while pure formic acid and h2so4 at concentrations from 0 5 to 2 m were used for copper ii stripping the former were selected for their widespread use and proven success in previous related studies by other researchers 1 whereas the latter were based on our previous work 3 fig 5 depicts that pure thiourea chelating agent and hcl ion exchanger at 1 m could only strip 18 and 0 2 of gold iii respectively from loaded pkfad but their mixtures at various concentrations from 0 5 to 2 5 m generally performed better with the stripping efficiency order of 1 m thiourea 0 5 m hcl 76 0 5 m thiourea 0 5 m hcl 42 1 5 m thiourea 0 5 hcl 37 2 m thiourea 0 5 m hcl 33 2 5 m thiourea 0 5 hcl 14 the former signifies that chelating and ion exchange mechanisms did not play a key role in governing the gold iii extraction by pkfad at pheq 5 but the solvation mechanism eq 5 while the latter implies that there was synergism between thiourea and hcl in solvating the gold iii thiourea hcl complexes formed and weakening the interaction between gold iii and pkfad thus promoting stripping 45 the effectiveness of different thiourea mineral acid solutions in stripping and desorbing gold iii from various loaded organic solvents 16 and adsorbents 46 47 respectively have also been documented in the literature meanwhile increasing the concentration of formic acid improved the copper ii stripping from loaded pkfad but increasing the concentration of h2so4 impaired it with the maximum s of 95 and 89 recorded by 2 m formic acid and 0 5 m h2so4 fig 5 respectively factually formic acid is a weaker but less viscous acid than h2so4 pka of 3 75 vs 3 and viscosity of 1 6 mpa s vs 21 mpa s 25 c 48 hence the lower acidic strength of formic acid led to its lower s achieved at 0 5 m than h2so4 at the same concentration 84 vs 89 but increasing the concentration of formic acid boosted its acidic strength and thus its s for viscous acids like h2so4 the rise in its viscosity with concentrations heightened its mass transfer resistance and reduced the copper ii transfer rate and thus its s the high efficiency of formic acid and h2so4 ion exchangers in copper ii stripping fig 5 confirms the ion exchange mechanism of pkfad in extracting copper ii eq 6 which is in good agreement with our previous work 3 3 4 verification of the presence of extracted species in loaded pkfad the presence of extracted species in loaded pkfad was validated by analyzing the uv vis spectra of pkfad before and after gold iii and copper ii extraction from single metal media containing an initial gold iii or copper ii concentration of 2 5 mm and 200 mm nacl at pheq 5 over the wavelength range of 350 850 nm fig 6 a before gold iii and copper ii extraction the spectrum of pkfad showed no peaks within the wavelength range studied however sharp and broad peaks were found in the spectra of pkfad after gold iii and copper ii extraction respectively at the maximum absorption wavelengths of 379 and 650 nm respectively this could be explained by the charge transfer transitions in gold iii and copper ii organic complexes extracted species arising from the excitation of electrons from lower to higher energy orbitals 2 that were responsible for changes in the color of pkfad from amber before extraction to brown and green after gold iii and copper ii extraction respectively as shown in fig 6 b while the maximum absorption wavelength of copper ii organic complex obtained in this work is compatible with that 679 nm reported in our previous work using the same organic ligand pkfad that of gold iii organic complex is slightly higher than those reported by lestari 29 and paclawski and sak 49 using humic 312 nm and formic 314 nm acids respectively as organic ligands but falls within the range of those reported by akhmadullina et al 50 who employed n n chelating organic ligands 354 410 nm 3 5 extraction mechanism evaluation 3 5 1 chemical modifications of pkfad to demonstrate the important roles of cooh and rcoo groups at pheq 3 fig 3 and rcoo groups at pheq 3 eq 5 in gold iii extraction as well as cooh groups at pheq 3 eq 6 in copper ii extraction cooh groups were transformed into rcoo groups by an acid catalyzed esterification reaction with methanol eq 7 24 and rcoo groups into cooh groups via an acid catalyzed hydrolysis reaction with water eq 8 51 7 rcooh 2 org 2 ch 3 oh aq h 2 rcooch 3 org 2 h 2 o aq 8 rcoor org h 2 o aq h rcooh org r oh aq where ch 3 oh is methanol rcooch 3 is fatty acid methyl esters fame and r oh is alcohol fig 7 shows the ftir spectra of pristine and esterified pkfad the hydrolyzed pkfad produced a similar spectral fingerprint as the pristine pkfad with slightly more intense peaks and thus its spectrum is not presented in fig 7 as can be seen in fig 7 pristine pkfad exhibited intense characteristic peaks of dimeric carboxylic acids resembling those of pure dimeric lauric 52 and oleic 53 acids i e oh bending peaks at 935 out of plane 1413 in plane and 1465 in plane cm 1 co stretching peak at 1233 cm 1 co stretching peak at 1707 cm 1 and ch stretching peaks at 2853 symmetrical and 2922 asymmetrical cm 1 due to its high contents of lauric 49 wt 3 and oleic 11 wt 3 acids the characteristic peaks of esters i e co stretching peaks at 1112 and 1162 cm 1 and co stretching peak at 1743 cm 1 were relatively less intense due to the low glyceride content 12 wt of pkfad these findings are compatible with those reported by teo et al 54 and kamboh et al 23 for pristine palm fatty acid distillate after esterification the co stretching peak of dimeric carboxylic acids disappeared but the characteristic peaks of esters i e co stretching peaks at 1113 1168 and 1195 cm 1 and co stretching peak at 1740 cm 1 became considerably more intense as shown in the spectrum of esterified pkfad indicating the significant rise in the ester content of pkfad and the successful chemical modification of cooh groups of ffas in pkfad to fame eq 7 these results agree well with those reported by nosal et al 55 for fame derived from various ffas both the esterified and hydrolyzed pkfad were then used to extract gold iii and copper ii from single metal media containing an initial gold iii or copper ii concentration of 0 5 mm and 200 mm nacl at pheq 2 and 5 and the e of gold iii and copper ii attained were tabulated in table 1 the e of gold iii and copper ii accomplished with pristine pkfad under the same conditions retrieved from fig 2 were also included in table 1 for comparison purposes the high e of gold iii obtained by esterified pkfad at pheq 2 98 and 5 97 suggest the vital role of rcoo groups from fame in gold iii extraction at these pheq supporting the involvement of rcoo groups from glycerides before esterification in gold iii extraction at pheq 3 fig 3 and 3 eq 5 while the low e of copper ii obtained by esterified pkfad at pheq 2 5 and 5 27 indicate their insignificant role in copper ii extraction confirming the little or non involvement of rcoo groups from glycerides before esterification in copper ii extraction at pheq 3 and 3 meanwhile the high e 99 of gold iii and copper ii achieved by hydrolyzed pkfad at pheq 2 and 5 respectively denote the crucial role of cooh groups from ffas and verify their engagement in gold iii and copper ii extraction at pheq 3 fig 3 and 3 eq 6 respectively before hydrolysis in addition the substantial drops in the e of copper ii and gold iii by esterified 27 and hydrolyzed 14 pkfad respectively relative to those of pristine pkfad 92 for copper ii and 98 for gold iii at pheq 5 suggest the participation of cooh groups from ffas before esterification in copper ii extraction eq 6 and rcoo groups from glycerides before hydrolysis in gold iii extraction eq 5 at pheq 3 furthermore controlled experiments conducted with either 4 wt h2so4 catalyst or methanol without pkfad showed little or no effect on both gold iii and copper ii extraction data not shown these findings collectively corroborate the significant roles of cooh and rcoo groups at pheq 3 fig 3 and rcoo groups at pheq 3 eq 5 in gold iii extraction as well as cooh groups at pheq 3 eq 6 in copper ii extraction 3 5 2 chloride ion release test to substantiate the solvation mechanism involving the release of chloride ions from aucl4 ions during gold iii extraction by pkfad at pheq 3 eq 5 the chloride ion concentration in an aqueous feed solution containing an initial gold iii concentration of 2 5 mm and 200 mm nacl was determined before and after extraction by pkfad at pheq 5 the results disclosed that the concentration of chloride ions in the aqueous feed solution increased from 7486 to 7593 mg l before and after extraction and the e of gold iii achieved was 99 an evaluation of these data revealed that the amounts of chloride ion released and gold iii extracted were 3 02 and 2 51 mm respectively suggesting that about one mole of chloride ion was released for every mole of gold iii extracted and this validates the solvation mechanism proposed in eq 5 at pheq 3 this finding agrees with that obtained by radulescu et al 56 for gold iii adsorption by amberlite xad 7 containing rcoo groups meanwhile little or no change in the concentration of chloride ions was observed in the same aqueous feed solution before and after gold iii extraction by pkfad at pheq 2 data not shown indicating the absence of chloride ion release from the solvation mechanism as described by eq 5 at pheq 3 this supports the validity of the hydrogen bonding interaction between aucl4 ions and cooh groups of ffas or rcooh groups of glycerides in pkfad at pheq 3 that released no chloride ions fig 3 in addition no release of chloride ions was detected in a similar chloride ion release test conducted after copper ii extraction by pkfad at pheq 2 and 5 data not shown suggesting the nonoccurrence of the solvation mechanism between copper ii and rcoo groups of glycerides in pkfad as described by eq 5 for gold iii at pheq 3 and 3 4 conclusions pkfad extracted about 99 of gold iii at pheq 1 2 and 1 5 without and with nacl respectively and 92 of copper ii at pheq 5 without and with nacl with the highest separation factor for gold iii over copper ii of 3129 achieved at pheq 2 both gold iii and copper ii were stripped efficiently from loaded pkfad with 1 m thiourea 0 5 m hydrochloric acid solution 76 and 2 m formic acid 95 respectively the presence of extracted species in loaded pkfad was verified by a uv vis analysis gold iii was extracted by pkfad via a hydrogen bonding interaction with the carboxyl cooh groups of free fatty acids ffas or the protonated ester rcooh groups of glycerides in pkfad at pheq 3 and a solvation mechanism with the deprotonated ester rcoo groups of glycerides in pkfad at pheq 3 and copper ii was extracted by pkfad via an ion exchange mechanism with the cooh groups of ffas in pkfad at pheq 3 these mechanisms were supported by chemical modification studies and a chloride ion release test however future studies should address the extraction of gold iii and copper ii from different compositions of multi metal media using pkfad for more practical applications funding sources this work was supported by the ministry of education malaysia under the

13407,aniline is a refractory pollutant with high toxicity that will cause pollution if discharged without treatment however conventional technology cannot meet the requirements of safe disposal it is necessary to develop novel treatment technology to address this problem and the electro fenton process could be a solution in this study a novel cnt ag cu cathode was synthesized by ag doping and multiwall carbon nanotube cnt 3d morphology modification of copper foam cf the composition structure and morphology of cnt ag cu were obtained the aniline removal rate was over 99 under optimal conditions the kinetic analysis results indicated that aniline removal followed a pseudo first order kinetic law and the reaction rate constant reached 0 0661 min 1 the aniline removal rate also reached 99 2 after the cnt ag cu cathode was used 10 times without further treatment the cnt ag cu cathode had an excellent ability to maintain an oh concentration that reached 0 5 μmol l after 60 min of reaction aniline removal is a coupling multimechanism in which ag loading improves h2o2 generation and the nanoconfinement effect of cnts promotes accumulation of a high concentration of oh graphical abstracts unlabelled image keywords aniline electro fenton carbon nanotubes ag loading 1 introduction aniline is an important raw material that is widely used in dye manufacturing pharmaceutical production and other industrial fields it can cause serious environmental pollution when it is discharged in wastewater 1 2 because it is one of the refractory organic pollutants and difficult to degrade completely by traditional wastewater treatment technology 3 4 hence alternative technology that is efficient and has low energy consumption and low carbon emissions must be developed 5 the electro fenton process which is an advanced oxidation process aop has attracted much attention 6 7 in electro fenton process h2o2 and fe2 can be obtained by electroreduction reactions eqs 1 and 2 8 therefore hydroxyl radicals oh can be generated to sustain the reaction 9 as shown in eq 3 however there is at least one defect in the electro fenton process that is the o2 reduction reaction also has another path 10 11 in which four electrons participate which is shown in eq 4 therefore o2 could be consumed rapidly by this side reaction and be unhelpful to oh generation meanwhile other reduction reactions such as eqs 5 and 6 could also occur on the cathode surface decreasing the current efficiency 12 therefore it is valuable to promote h2o2 generation and fe3 reduction by constructing and designing novel efficient cathodes 1 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 fe 3 e fe 2 3 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 o h oh 4 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o 5 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 o 6 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 in this study copper foam cf was selected as the basic material of the cathode due to its porous structure and large specific surface area 13 14 to promote h2o2 generation ag was loaded onto cf 15 however ag loaded cf cathodes ag cu still have the problems of a narrow ph range and high electrochemical impedance during the electro fenton process in recent years the nanoconfinement effect 16 was found and it could be a solution for novel electro fenton cathode design the nanoconfinement effect refers to a phenomenon where the catalytic radical reaction rate greatly increases and free radicals accumulate in a nanoscale confined space 17 therefore in nanoscale confined spaces organic pollutants can be attacked more easily and degraded more rapidly with relatively high concentrations of free radicals nanoscale confined spaces are mostly found in nanostructured materials multiwall carbon nanotubes cnts are nanostructured materials that are widely used to increase specific surface area and adsorption capacity 18 therefore cnts were chosen in this study to stimulate the nanoconfinement effect on the ag cu cathode surface the cnt ag cu cathode synthesized in this study was identified as the outstanding cathode that can promote aniline removal this provides a new consideration for the practical use of electro fenton technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemical

ultrasonication in water and methanol the mixture was dried at 50 c in a drying oven and the treated cf was obtained cnts 0 3 g were put into 40 ml of anhydrous ethanol 99 and mixed completely by ultrasonication for 10 min after that the treated cf was immersed in the cnt ethanol suspension and ultrasonically treated for 30 min then the cnt cu cathode was acquired after it was dried in a blast oven at 70 c for 3 h the cf and cnt cu cathode were immersed in agno3 solution for 2 h the concentrations of the agno3 solutions were set at 0 5 1 0 and 2 0 m m then ag cu and cnt ag cu were obtained after they were dried in a blast oven at 70 c for 3 h 2 3 aniline removal experiments the aniline removal experiments were carried out in a square electrolytic cell 75 mm 55 mm 55 mm which is shown in fig 1 the cf ag cu cnt cu and cnt ag cu cathodes 20 mm 20 mm 10 mm were also used as aerators two platinum plates 20 mm 20 mm 1 mm were selected as anodes and the electrode spacing was maintained at 20 cm the constant current was supported by a dc power supply yk ad3005 yucoo network equipment co ltd china model wastewater 150 ml that contained 5 mg l aniline and 0 1 mol l na2so4 as the supporting electrolyte was put into the reactor and the ph values were adjusted with 10 m m h2so4 or naoh solution then a certain feso4 solution was added after aeration the reaction began when a constant current was applied and the current density was calculated according to the area of the anodes the samples were taken every 5 min and the concentration of aniline was obtained 2 4 analytical method the cathode surface appearance morphology and elemental composition were tested by scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive spectroscopy sem eds hitachi tm4000ii japan the elemental composition of the catalysts was identified by a rigaku d max 3c xrd instrument cu ka radiation operated at 40 kv and 30 ma in the range of 10 90 with a scanning speed of 2 per min the cathode surface properties were characterized by x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps escalab 250xi thermo fisher usa fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ft ir cary630 agilent usa was performed to compare the

the electro fenton reaction was acquired by a toc detector vario toc elementar germany 3 results and discussion 3 1 cathode characteristics the sem results are shown in fig 2 cf presents a three dimensional network structure with a uniform distribution of many interconnected pores the diameter of pores on the cf is approximately 30 μm which benefits aniline adsorption and cf modification the sem results of cnt cu are presented in fig 2 b it can be concluded that the cnts were successfully loaded onto the cf surface and into the pores cnts can provide nanotube structures that can trigger the nanoconfinement effect 21 fig 2 c shows the sem results of ag cu ag was evenly distributed on the surface of the cf metal skeleton the ag particles are dendritic and exhibit a sliced layer structure the sem results of cnt ag cu are shown in fig 2 d a large number of cnts are coated inside the cf metal skeleton ag is also distributed between cf and cnts with a regular octahedral structure and particle sizes of 2 4 μm eds results of cnt ag cu are shown in fig 2 f the mass ratios of cu ag and c on the cnt ag cu surface are 84 8 0 36 and 11 0 respectively this result also indicated that the ag and cnts were successfully loaded onto the cf the xrd results reveal the crystal structures of the materials the xrd results are shown in fig 3 there are three strong diffraction peaks of cf at 44 04 51 07 and 74 74 corresponding to the characteristic diffraction peaks of the 111 200 and 220 crystal planes jcpds no 01 1241 of face centered cubic copper respectively for ag cu in addition to the characteristic copper diffraction peaks the four diffraction peaks at 38 82 45 02 65 36 and 77 86 are the diffraction peaks of the 111 200 220 and 311 crystal planes of face centered cubic ag jcpds no 04 0783 the diffraction peak at 37 18 can be attributed to the increase in the lattice parameters of copper caused by ag loading on the copper foam which makes the 111 peak shift to a lower angle therefore it can be deduced that ag was successfully loaded on the cf even though the diffraction peaks were not very strong because the ag amount was not very high the diffraction peaks characteristic of cnts at 25 78 40 62 and 59 88 are the diffraction peaks of the 300 315 and 161 crystal planes of carbon jcpds no 50 0927 respectively which can also be found in the cnt cu xrd results however these peaks are not very intense nevertheless characteristic diffraction peaks at 37 18 ag 111 shifted 40 62 cnts 315 and 59 88 cnts 161 are very clear in the cnt ag cu xrd results this result indicated that cnts and ag were both loaded onto the cf and a cnt ag cu cathode was successfully obtained moreover no peaks of cuo cu2o or other oxides were found xps results are shown in fig 4 diffraction peaks of cu ag c fe and o were found in fig 4 a the fe peak indicated that the cf was not pure because a trace amount of fe could be introduced in the production of cf high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p are shown in fig 4 b the peaks at 712 3 ev and 720 4 ev correspond to fe2 and fe3 respectively and are caused by the adsorption of fe on the surface of the substrate after oxidizing to fe2 and fe3 in the impregnation reaction fig 4 c shows the high resolution spectra of cu 2p the peak at 932 9 ev corresponds to elemental cu and the peak at 952 2 ev corresponds to cu2 the peaks at 932 6 ev and 952 8 ev correspond to cu the cu2 and cu results indicated that cu on the cf surface was oxidized during the acidification of cf fig 4 d displays the ag 3d high resolution spectra even though the peak intensities are very low the characteristic peaks of metal ag 368 5 ev and 374 5 ev and ag 367 3 ev and 373 8 ev can be found the existence of ag may be caused by the adsorption of ag on the surface of the cnt during the impregnation reaction low peak intensities indicated a low amount of ag loading the peaks of cc at 285 4 ev cc at 284 8 ev co at 286 3 ev and co at 292 26 ev are shown in fig 4 e these peaks can be attributed to the carboxyl groups and other functional groups on the surface of cnts 3 2 aniline removal results aniline removal results are shown in fig 5 the influence of current density on aniline removal is shown in fig 5 a four current density levels were selected 0 625 ma cm2 1 25 ma cm2 2 50 ma cm2 and 5 00 ma cm2 other reaction conditions were fixed an initial aniline concentration of 5 0 mg l aniline an na2so4 concentration of 0 10 mol l na2so4 with na2so4 used as the supporting electrolyte an initial ph of 3 0 an aeration flow rate of 0 15 m3 h and an initial ferrous ion concentration of 0 20 mmol l fe2 0 aniline removal rates over 97 can be obtained after 60 min of reaction at every current density level however the aniline removal velocity increases with increasing current density the aniline removal rates after 30 min of reaction were 84 6 87 1 and 98 0 when the current density was maintained at 0 625 1 25 and 2 50 ma cm2 respectively nevertheless when the current density increased to 5 0 ma cm2 the removal rate achieved after 30 min of reaction was 98 3 obviously the aniline removal rate only increased 0 3 when the current density increased by two times from 2 50 to 5 00 ma cm2 a higher current density leads to more energy consumption therefore 1 25 ma cm2 was selected as the optimal current density condition when considering the aniline removal efficiency and energy consumption the initial ph is a key factor in the electro fenton process 22 the influence of the initial ph on aniline removal was evaluated and the results are shown in fig 5 b the acidic condition is beneficial to the electro fenton process in the conditions of aniline 0 5 0 mg l na2so4 0 10 mol l current density 1 25 ma cm2 aeration flow rate 0 15 m3 h fe2 0 0 20 mmol l the aniline removal rates were 99 3 99 7 97 0 and 91 7 after 60 min of reaction when the initial ph was 1 0 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 respectively note that the aniline removal rate was also over 90 when the initial ph was 7 0 this result indicated that the cnt ag cu cathode has excellent catalytic performance due to the large specific surface area and nanoconfinement effect of the cnt nanostructure in addition ag loaded on the cf could increase the oxygen reduction rate of the cathode 23 and cnts could increase the number of active sites and the adsorption capacity of aniline 24 therefore the heterogeneous fenton reaction on the cathode surface was intensified and promoted the efficient removal of aniline on the cathode surface meanwhile the homogeneous fenton reaction that occurred in the solution phase was no longer the only key reaction path however at ph 9 0 the removal rate of aniline was only 34 1 which may be attributed to the precipitation reaction of fe oh 2 or fe oh 3 hindering the electro fenton catalytic reaction 25 considering efficiency and cost an initial ph of 3 0 was selected as the optimal ph to investigate the effect of different aeration flow rates on the removal of aniline four aeration flow rates were selected 0 05 m3 h 0 10 m3 h 0 15 m3 h and 0 20 m3 h fig 5 c shows that the removal rate of aniline increases from 95 8 to 99 4 with increasing aeration flow rate from 0 05 m3 h to 0 20 m3 h after 60 min of reaction the results indicated that sufficient aeration can promote the capacity of the cathode however at an aeration flow rate of 0 05 m3 h the aniline removal rates can be over 95 therefore the aeration rate is not the key factor meanwhile in this reactor aeration can also promote the mass transfer efficiency 26 27 hence a 0 10 m3 h aeration flow rate was chosen as the optimal condition for low consumption and efficiency the influence of the initial fe2 concentration on the aniline removal results is shown in fig 5 d fe2 0 was set at 0 mmol l 0 05 mmol l 0 10 mmol l 0 20 mmol l and 0 30 mmol l the aniline concentration decreased rapidly during the reactions when the initial fe2 concentration was 0 mmol l the dissolution fe2 and cu2 of cf can act as the fenton catalyst and the aniline removal rate was 85 7 after 60 min of reaction when the initial fe2 concentration increased to 0 20 mmol l aniline degraded faster than the other initial fe2 concentrations in the first 20 min of reaction and the removal rate of aniline reached 99 34 after 60 min of reaction it has been reported 28 that an excess of fe2 can consume oh follow the reaction 8 8 fe 2 o h fe 3 oh therefore an initial fe2 concentration of 0 20 mmol l was selected as the optimal condition used for the further experiments a kinetics study of aniline removal under different conditions was also conducted and the results are listed in table 1 the pseudo first order and second order kinetics fitting results were compared the results revealed that aniline removal in this study followed the pseudo first order kinetics law because the goodness of fit coefficient r2 values approached 100 furthermore first order kinetics rate constants were also obtained the first order kinetics rate constant was 0 0661 min 1 under optimal conditions the kinetics rate constant could be increased by increasing the current density adding more acid increasing the aeration flow rate and adding more fe2 however these methods will also increase the operating cost and the contribution to the aniline removal rate is limited the influence of different cathodes on aniline removal was considered and the results are presented in fig 5 e note that the optimal conditions are different when the different cathodes were used the results are shown in supporting material 1 and the selected optimal conditions are listed in the captions of fig 5 e the results indicated that the cnt ag cu cathode has outstanding aniline removal performance compared to the cf cathode cnt cu could have a similar aniline removal performance to that of cnt ag cu at a higher aeration flow rate although ag cu has the best performance it also needs a higher aeration flow rate a higher current density and the addition of more acid therefore the cnt ag cu cathode could be selected for its remarkable performance and lower consumption the toc results are shown in fig 5 f after 120 min of reaction the toc removal rates were 15 5 23 2 19 5 and 27 3 for the cf ag cu cnt cu and cnt ag cu cathodes respectively after 180 min of reaction the toc removal rates obviously increased and reached 27 8 36 2 29 4 and 42 5 for the cf ag cu cnt cu and cnt ag cu cathodes respectively the cnt ag cu cathode also has the best performance compared to the other cathodes the results compare to other previous studies were shown in table 2 it can be seen that the cnt ag cu cathode also have good performance on aniline removal by electro fenton process 3 3 mechanism analysis to reveal the aniline removal mechanism and electroreduction mechanism of the cnt ag cu cathode eis and cv tests were performed and the results are shown in fig 6 the arc in typical nyquist plot is related to charge transfer at the electrode electrolyte interface and electrode surface fig 6 a shows that the electron transfer resistance of cf ag cu cnt cu and cnt ag cu gradually decreases for sustainable application in industrial and practical purpose very low charge transfer resistance with long cyclic stability is most important key point 33 to obtain the value of various charge transfer parameters for the electrode the equivalent circuit modeling has also been done using z view software with the equivalent circuit inset of the electrode material in porous electrode material the constant phase element cpe are typically modeled as capacitor elements 34 the values of different charge transfer parameters determined by equivalent circuit fitting model are shown in table 3 rs represents the series resistance due to electrolyte solution rct is the surface state resistance that related to the charge transfer from internal to the electrode surface 35 rr represents the reaction resistance on the cathode surface related to reduction reactions cpe1 generally expresses the pseudocapacitive effect of the electrode i e cp or q factor of the electrode cpe2 can determine the contribution of faradic of non faradic charge transfer effect of the electrode material 36 for the cnt ag cu the values of rct and rr are 13 54 ω and 325 6 ω respectively which was much smaller than those for cf rct 88 2 ω rr 3376 ω ag cu rct 102 4 ω rr 810 9 ω and cnt cu rct 94 7 ω rr 1239 ω these results indicated that the electron migration ability of cnt ag cu and is intensified compared with that of cf ag cu and cnt cu in addition the reaction resistance on the cathode surface of cnt ag cu was weakened and the reaction on the cnt ag cu cathode surface could more efficiently it also can be found that after modification with metal ag the values of rr dramatic decline it is indicated that the o2 reduction efficiency of the cathode was improved when ag was loading 37 furthermore cnt loading can reduce the cathode surface state resistance due to its 3d morphology 38 39 and cnts have nanoconfinement effects during the electro fenton reaction hence the cnt ag cu cathode has outstanding aniline removal performance cv test results are presented in fig 6 b the reduction peaks of the cf and ag cu electrodes were at 0 53 v which corresponds to the two electron o2 reduction reaction of the cathode however the peak current was only approximately 0 068 a which indicated that the oxygen reduction reaction was not violent the peak of the cnt cu electrode was at 0 52 v and the current was 0 09 a which indicated that the o2 reduction activity increased after 3d morphology modification by cnts furthermore the cnt ag cu electrode had the highest peak current response at 0 60 v and 0 16 a therefore cnt ag cu have the strongest electrocatalytic activity in addition the peak at 0 06 v can be assigned to the reduction of cu2 the peak at 0 26 v is due to the reduction of fe3 to fe2 in the reactions the cv tests after 30 min of o2 and n2 aeration were also compared and the results are shown in fig 6 c obviously after o2 aeration the peak current of the cnt ag cu electrode was much higher than that after n2 aeration these results verified that two electron o2 reduction occurs and is more efficient on the cnt ag cu cathode surface moreover the redox peaks were not symmetrical which indicated that the reaction was irreversible in this study the ability of the cnt ag cu cathode to generate h2o2 was verified because the h2o2 concentration varies with no aniline and because fe2 existed the results are shown in fig 7 a the h2o2 concentration increased rapidly in the first 30 min of reaction then it tended to remain steady at 0 20 mg l which is not outstanding compared to other reports 20 28 this may be due to cu2 dissolution from cnt ag cu and instantaneous catalytic decomposition of h2o2 resulting in a low concentration oh which has strong oxidation properties was considered the main oxidant for the removal of organic pollutants in the electro fenton system 40 the concentration of oh was also obtained and the results are shown in fig 7 b the rate of oh generation was higher in the first 30 min than between 30 and 60 min of reaction however the concentration of oh remained steady after 30 min of reaction and reached approximately 0 5 μmol l at 60 min of reaction in the fenton system o2 was also reported 41 to react with and degrade organic contaminants to verify which free radical is the key factor of aniline oxidation in this system the oh scavenger glycerol 42 and o2 scavenger p benzoquinone 43 were added the results are presented in fig 7 c the aniline removal rate was lower and only reached 32 8 after 60 min of reaction with 0 01 mmol l glycerol therefore it can be concluded that the aniline removal rate decreased sharply when oh was removed by the scavenger glycerol however the influence of p benzoquinone was not obvious and the aniline removal rate still reached 93 4 after 60 min of reaction hence o2 was not the key factor in aniline removal these results indicated that oh is the fundamental factor of aniline removal in this system in an electro fenton system the cathode metal dissolution process which could affect the cathode catalytic reduction functions is inevitable under acidic conditions therefore cu2 concentration variation was acquired and the results are presented in fig 8 a the cu2 concentration increased in the early reaction period when the initial ph was 3 0 then concentration growth rate slows down after 40 min of reaction although dissolved cu2 has a certain degree of secondary pollution risk the pollution degree is controllable by increasing the ph to 5 0 or higher furthermore the surface morphology of the cnt ag cu cathode after use was also characterized and the results are shown in fig 2 e some defects appeared after the cathode was used however ag was not detected that could be because there is only a little ag ion was released and lower to the instrument detection limit furthermore a large number of ag crystals were still attached to the surface of the cf metal skeleton and evenly distributed among cnts the cnt ag cu cathode still maintains excellent morphology and internal structure after the reaction a comparative analysis of the infrared spectra before and after the use of the cnt ag cu cathode was conducted and the results are shown in fig 8 b after the reaction more abundant groups could be found the peak at 1045 cm 1 corresponded to cn stretching vibrations 44 peaks appearing at 2923 cm 1 and 2988 cm 1 corresponded to ch2 and ch3 stretching vibrations respectively 45 this indicates that the electrode has a certain degree of adsorption on aniline and that aniline degraded intermediates the peaks at 626 cm 1 1385 cm 1 1560 cm 1 1636 cm 1 and 3450 cm 1 which correspond to ch coh co cc and oh stretching vibrations 46 were more intense after the reaction it could be deduced that the cnt ag cu electrode had more active sites after oxidation reactions therefore it could have stable catalytic capacity even after use to verify the stable catalytic capacity of the cnt ag cu electrode a cycle test of aniline removal was performed under the optimal conditions fig 8 c shows that the aniline removal rate can still reach 99 2 after 10 cycles therefore the cnt ag cu electrode has outstanding stability and efficiency in aniline electro fenton removal the mechanism of aniline removal by cnt ag cu is discussed in fig 9 in general the electro fenton process has multiple mechanisms of organic pollutant removal such as o2 reduction cyclic fe3 reduction to fe2 reactions on the cathode surface oxidation on the anode surface and fenton reactions both on the cathode surface and in solution in this study the rich pores and large specific surface area of cnt ag cu provide many active sites ag crystals on the surface of the cathode can greatly improve the efficiency of o2 reduction and promote the generation of h2o2 at the same time the rich pores and large specific surface area of the cnt ag cu cathode were also conducive to the reduction of fe3 to fe2 therefore h2o2 and a stable concentration of fe2 can help oh generation furthermore on the cnt ag cu surface cnts have a unique 3d nanostructure that can enhance the adsorption capacity of aniline and intermediate products therefore the heterogeneous fenton reaction on the cathode surface was also a significant removal path in addition cnts have 30 60 nm average equivalent diameter pore structures which could have a nanoconfinement effect hence active oh free radicals could reach a higher concentration inside the cnts then aniline could be degraded more efficiently by the coupling oxidation of homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton reactions 4 conclusion cnt ag cu was synthesized by ultrasonic oscillation mixing and impregnation metal displacement technology following the low temperature drying method cnt ag cu has outstanding catalytic activity for the electro fenton removal of aniline under optimal conditions a current density of 1 25 ma cm2 an initial ph of 5 0 an aeration flow rate of 0 10 m3 h and a fe2 concentration of 0 20 mmol l the aniline removal rate was over 99 the aniline removal process follows the pseudo first order kinetic law and the reaction rate constant under the optimal condition is 0 0661 min 1 the results of free radical analysis showed that cnt ag cu had an excellent ability to maintain the concentration of oh and the concentration of oh in this system could reach 0 499 μmol l after 60 min of reaction the cnt ag cu cathode has a stable catalytic capacity even after use for 10 cycles and the aniline removal rate can also reach 99 2 multiple coupling mechanisms for cnt ag cu promote the removal of aniline on the one hand the dispersion form of ag improves the two electron o2 reduction reaction and the fe2 cycling efficiency on the other hand the nanoconfinement effect of cnts could also promote the high efficiency of oh generation and aniline removal this study provides a green and

13407,aniline is a refractory pollutant with high toxicity that will cause pollution if discharged without treatment however conventional technology cannot meet the requirements of safe disposal it is necessary to develop novel treatment technology to address this problem and the electro fenton process could be a solution in this study a novel cnt ag cu cathode was synthesized by ag doping and multiwall carbon nanotube cnt 3d morphology modification of copper foam cf the composition structure and morphology of cnt ag cu were obtained the aniline removal rate was over 99 under optimal conditions the kinetic analysis results indicated that aniline removal followed a pseudo first order kinetic law and the reaction rate constant reached 0 0661 min 1 the aniline removal rate also reached 99 2 after the cnt ag cu cathode was used 10 times without further treatment the cnt ag cu cathode had an excellent ability to maintain an oh concentration that reached 0 5 μmol l after 60 min of reaction aniline removal is a coupling multimechanism in which ag loading improves h2o2 generation and the nanoconfinement effect of cnts promotes accumulation of a high concentration of oh graphical abstracts unlabelled image keywords aniline electro fenton carbon nanotubes ag loading 1 introduction aniline is an important raw material that is widely used in dye manufacturing pharmaceutical production and other industrial fields it can cause serious environmental pollution when it is discharged in wastewater 1 2 because it is one of the refractory organic pollutants and difficult to degrade completely by traditional wastewater treatment technology 3 4 hence alternative technology that is efficient and has low energy consumption and low carbon emissions must be developed 5 the electro fenton process which is an advanced oxidation process aop has attracted much attention 6 7 in electro fenton process h2o2 and fe2 can be obtained by electroreduction reactions eqs 1 and 2 8 therefore hydroxyl radicals oh can be generated to sustain the reaction 9 as shown in eq 3 however there is at least one defect in the electro fenton process that is the o2 reduction reaction also has another path 10 11 in which four electrons participate which is shown in eq 4 therefore o2 could be consumed rapidly by this side reaction and be unhelpful to oh generation meanwhile other reduction reactions such as eqs 5 and 6 could also occur on the cathode surface decreasing the current efficiency 12 therefore it is valuable to promote h2o2 generation and fe3 reduction by constructing and designing novel efficient cathodes 1 o 2 2 h 2 e h 2 o 2 2 fe 3 e fe 2 3 fe 2 h 2 o 2 fe 3 o h oh 4 o 2 4 h 4 e 2 h 2 o 5 h 2 o 2 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 o 6 2 h 2 e 2 h 2 in this study copper foam cf was selected as the basic material of the cathode due to its porous structure and large specific surface area 13 14 to promote h2o2 generation ag was loaded onto cf 15 however ag loaded cf cathodes ag cu still have the problems of a narrow ph range and high electrochemical impedance during the electro fenton process in recent years the nanoconfinement effect 16 was found and it could be a solution for novel electro fenton cathode design the nanoconfinement effect refers to a phenomenon where the catalytic radical reaction rate greatly increases and free radicals accumulate in a nanoscale confined space 17 therefore in nanoscale confined spaces organic pollutants can be attacked more easily and degraded more rapidly with relatively high concentrations of free radicals nanoscale confined spaces are mostly found in nanostructured materials multiwall carbon nanotubes cnts are nanostructured materials that are widely used to increase specific surface area and adsorption capacity 18 therefore cnts were chosen in this study to stimulate the nanoconfinement effect on the ag cu cathode surface the cnt ag cu cathode synthesized in this study was identified as the outstanding cathode that can promote aniline removal this provides a new consideration for the practical use of electro fenton technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals all chemical

dimensional network structure with a uniform distribution of many interconnected pores the diameter of pores on the cf is approximately 30 μm which benefits aniline adsorption and cf modification the sem results of cnt cu are presented in fig 2 b it can be concluded that the cnts were successfully loaded onto the cf surface and into the pores cnts can provide nanotube structures that can trigger the nanoconfinement effect 21 fig 2 c shows the sem results of ag cu ag was evenly distributed on the surface of the cf metal skeleton the ag particles are dendritic and exhibit a sliced layer structure the sem results of cnt ag cu are shown in fig 2 d a large number of cnts are coated inside the cf metal skeleton ag is also distributed between cf and cnts with a regular octahedral structure and particle sizes of 2 4 μm eds results of cnt ag cu are shown in fig 2 f the mass ratios of cu ag and c on the cnt ag cu surface are 84 8 0 36 and 11 0 respectively this result also indicated that the ag and cnts were successfully loaded onto the cf the xrd results reveal the crystal structures of the materials the xrd results are shown in fig 3 there are three strong diffraction peaks of cf at 44 04 51 07 and 74 74 corresponding to the characteristic diffraction peaks of the 111 200 and 220 crystal planes jcpds no 01 1241 of face centered cubic copper respectively for ag cu in addition to the characteristic copper diffraction peaks the four diffraction peaks at 38 82 45 02 65 36 and 77 86 are the diffraction peaks of the 111 200 220 and 311 crystal planes of face centered cubic ag jcpds no 04 0783 the diffraction peak at 37 18 can be attributed to the increase in the lattice parameters of copper caused by ag loading on the copper foam which makes the 111 peak shift to a lower angle therefore it can be deduced that ag was successfully loaded on the cf even though the diffraction peaks were not very strong because the ag amount was not very high the diffraction peaks characteristic of cnts at 25 78 40 62 and 59 88 are the diffraction peaks of the 300 315 and 161 crystal planes of carbon jcpds no 50 0927 respectively which can also be found in the cnt cu xrd results however these peaks are not very intense nevertheless characteristic diffraction peaks at 37 18 ag 111 shifted 40 62 cnts 315 and 59 88 cnts 161 are very clear in the cnt ag cu xrd results this result indicated that cnts and ag were both loaded onto the cf and a cnt ag cu cathode was successfully obtained moreover no peaks of cuo cu2o or other oxides were found xps results are shown in fig 4 diffraction peaks of cu ag c fe and o were found in fig 4 a the fe peak indicated that the cf was not pure because a trace amount of fe could be introduced in the production of cf high resolution xps spectra of fe 2p are shown in fig 4 b the peaks at 712 3 ev and 720 4 ev correspond to fe2 and fe3 respectively and are caused by the adsorption of fe on the surface of the substrate after oxidizing to fe2 and fe3 in the impregnation reaction fig 4 c shows the high resolution spectra of cu 2p the peak at 932 9 ev corresponds to elemental cu and the peak at 952 2 ev corresponds to cu2 the peaks at 932 6 ev and 952 8 ev correspond to cu the cu2 and cu results indicated that cu on the cf surface was oxidized during the acidification of cf fig 4 d displays the ag 3d high resolution spectra even though the peak intensities are very low the characteristic peaks of metal ag 368 5 ev and 374 5 ev and ag 367 3 ev and 373 8 ev can be found the existence of ag may be caused by the adsorption of ag on the surface of the cnt during the impregnation reaction low peak intensities indicated a low amount of ag loading the peaks of cc at 285 4 ev cc at 284 8 ev co at 286 3 ev and co at 292 26 ev are shown in fig 4 e these peaks can be attributed to the carboxyl groups and other functional groups on the surface of cnts 3 2 aniline removal results aniline removal results are shown in fig 5 the influence of current density on aniline removal is shown in fig 5 a four current density levels were selected 0 625 ma cm2 1 25 ma cm2 2 50 ma cm2 and 5 00 ma cm2 other reaction conditions were fixed an initial aniline concentration of 5 0 mg l aniline an na2so4 concentration of 0 10 mol l na2so4 with na2so4 used as the supporting electrolyte an initial ph of 3 0 an aeration flow rate of 0 15 m3 h and an initial ferrous ion concentration of 0 20 mmol l fe2 0 aniline removal rates over 97 can be obtained after 60 min of reaction at every current density level however the aniline removal velocity increases with increasing current density the aniline removal rates after 30 min of reaction were 84 6 87 1 and 98 0 when the current density was maintained at 0 625 1 25 and 2 50 ma cm2 respectively nevertheless when the current density increased to 5 0 ma cm2 the removal rate achieved after 30 min of reaction was 98 3 obviously the aniline removal rate only increased 0 3 when the current density increased by two times from 2 50 to 5 00 ma cm2 a higher current density leads to more energy consumption therefore 1 25 ma cm2 was selected as the optimal current density condition when considering the aniline removal efficiency and energy consumption the initial ph is a key factor in the electro fenton process 22 the influence of the initial ph on aniline removal was evaluated and the results are shown in fig 5 b the acidic condition is beneficial to the electro fenton process in the conditions of aniline 0 5 0 mg l na2so4 0 10 mol l current density 1 25 ma cm2 aeration flow rate 0 15 m3 h fe2 0 0 20 mmol l the aniline removal rates were 99 3 99 7 97 0 and 91 7 after 60 min of reaction when the initial ph was 1 0 3 0 5 0 and 7 0 respectively note that the aniline removal rate was also over 90 when the initial ph was 7 0 this result indicated that the cnt ag cu cathode has excellent catalytic performance due to the large specific surface area and nanoconfinement effect of the cnt nanostructure in addition ag loaded on the cf could increase the oxygen reduction rate of the cathode 23 and cnts could increase the number of active sites and the adsorption capacity of aniline 24 therefore the heterogeneous fenton reaction on the cathode surface was intensified and promoted the efficient removal of aniline on the cathode surface meanwhile the homogeneous fenton reaction that occurred in the solution phase was no longer the only key reaction path however at ph 9 0 the removal rate of aniline was only 34 1 which may be attributed to the precipitation reaction of fe oh 2 or fe oh 3 hindering the electro fenton catalytic reaction 25 considering efficiency and cost an initial ph of 3 0 was selected as the optimal ph to investigate the effect of different aeration flow rates on the removal of aniline four aeration flow rates were selected 0 05 m3 h 0 10 m3 h 0 15 m3 h and 0 20 m3 h fig 5 c shows that the removal rate of aniline increases from 95 8 to 99 4 with increasing aeration flow rate from 0 05 m3 h to 0 20 m3 h after 60 min of reaction the results indicated that sufficient aeration can promote the capacity of the cathode however at an aeration flow rate of 0 05 m3 h the aniline removal rates can be over 95 therefore the aeration rate is not the key factor meanwhile in this reactor aeration can also promote the mass transfer efficiency 26 27 hence a 0 10 m3 h aeration flow rate was chosen as the optimal condition for low consumption and efficiency the influence of the initial fe2 concentration on the aniline removal results is shown in fig 5 d fe2 0 was set at 0 mmol l 0 05 mmol l 0 10 mmol l 0 20 mmol l and 0 30 mmol l the aniline concentration decreased rapidly during the reactions when the initial fe2 concentration was 0 mmol l the dissolution fe2 and cu2 of cf can act as the fenton catalyst and the aniline removal rate was 85 7 after 60 min of reaction when the initial fe2 concentration increased to 0 20 mmol l aniline degraded faster than the other initial fe2 concentrations in the first 20 min of reaction and the removal rate of aniline reached 99 34 after 60 min of reaction it has been reported 28 that an excess of fe2 can consume oh follow the reaction 8 8 fe 2 o h fe 3 oh therefore an initial fe2 concentration of 0 20 mmol l was selected as the optimal condition used for the further experiments a kinetics study of aniline removal under different conditions was also conducted and the results are listed in table 1 the pseudo first order and second order kinetics fitting results were compared the results revealed that aniline removal in this study followed the pseudo first order kinetics law because the goodness of fit coefficient r2 values approached 100 furthermore first order kinetics rate constants were also obtained the first order kinetics rate constant was 0 0661 min 1 under optimal conditions the kinetics rate constant could be increased by increasing the current density adding more acid increasing the aeration flow rate and adding more fe2 however these methods will also increase the operating cost and the contribution to the aniline removal rate is limited the influence of different cathodes on aniline removal was considered and the results are presented in fig 5 e note that the optimal conditions are different when the different cathodes were used the results are shown in supporting material 1 and the selected optimal conditions are listed in the captions of fig 5 e the results indicated that the cnt ag cu cathode has outstanding aniline removal performance compared to the cf cathode cnt cu could have a similar aniline removal performance to that of cnt ag cu at a higher aeration flow rate although ag cu has the best performance it also needs a higher aeration flow rate a higher current density and the addition of more acid therefore the cnt ag cu cathode could be selected for its remarkable performance and lower consumption the toc results are shown in fig 5 f after 120 min of reaction the toc removal rates were 15 5 23 2 19 5 and 27 3 for the cf ag cu cnt cu and cnt ag cu cathodes respectively after 180 min of reaction the toc removal rates obviously increased and reached 27 8 36 2 29 4 and 42 5 for the cf ag cu cnt cu and cnt ag cu cathodes respectively the cnt ag cu cathode also has the best performance compared to the other cathodes the results compare to other previous studies were shown in table 2 it can be seen that the cnt ag cu cathode also have good performance on aniline removal by electro fenton process 3 3 mechanism analysis to reveal the aniline removal mechanism and electroreduction mechanism of the cnt ag cu cathode eis and cv tests were performed and the results are shown in fig 6 the arc in typical nyquist plot is related to charge transfer at the electrode electrolyte interface and electrode surface fig 6 a shows that the electron transfer resistance of cf ag cu cnt cu and cnt ag cu gradually decreases for sustainable application in industrial and practical purpose very low charge transfer resistance with long cyclic stability is most important key point 33 to obtain the value of various charge transfer parameters for the electrode the equivalent circuit modeling has also been done using z view software with the equivalent circuit inset of the electrode material in porous electrode material the constant phase element cpe are typically modeled as capacitor elements 34 the values of different charge transfer parameters determined by equivalent circuit fitting model are shown in table 3 rs represents the series resistance due to electrolyte solution rct is the surface state resistance that related to the charge transfer from internal to the electrode surface 35 rr represents the reaction resistance on the cathode surface related to reduction reactions cpe1 generally expresses the pseudocapacitive effect of the electrode i e cp or q factor of the electrode cpe2 can determine the contribution of faradic of non faradic charge transfer effect of the electrode material 36 for the cnt ag cu the values of rct and rr are 13 54 ω and 325 6 ω respectively which was much smaller than those for cf rct 88 2 ω rr 3376 ω ag cu rct 102 4 ω rr 810 9 ω and cnt cu rct 94 7 ω rr 1239 ω these results indicated that the electron migration ability of cnt ag cu and is intensified compared with that of cf ag cu and cnt cu in addition the reaction resistance on the cathode surface of cnt ag cu was weakened and the reaction on the cnt ag cu cathode surface could more efficiently it also can be found that after modification with metal ag the values of rr dramatic decline it is indicated that the o2 reduction efficiency of the cathode was improved when ag was loading 37 furthermore cnt loading can reduce the cathode surface state resistance due to its 3d morphology 38 39 and cnts have nanoconfinement effects during the electro fenton reaction hence the cnt ag cu cathode has outstanding aniline removal performance cv test results are presented in fig 6 b the reduction peaks of the cf and ag cu electrodes were at 0 53 v which corresponds to the two electron o2 reduction reaction of the cathode however the peak current was only approximately 0 068 a which indicated that the oxygen reduction reaction was not violent the peak of the cnt cu electrode was at 0 52 v and the current was 0 09 a which indicated that the o2 reduction activity increased after 3d morphology modification by cnts furthermore the cnt ag cu electrode had the highest peak current response at 0 60 v and 0 16 a therefore cnt ag cu have the strongest electrocatalytic activity in addition the peak at 0 06 v can be assigned to the reduction of cu2 the peak at 0 26 v is due to the reduction of fe3 to fe2 in the reactions the cv tests after 30 min of o2 and n2 aeration were also compared and the results are shown in fig 6 c obviously after o2 aeration the peak current of the cnt ag cu electrode was much higher than that after n2 aeration these results verified that two electron o2 reduction occurs and is more efficient on the cnt ag cu cathode surface moreover the redox peaks were not symmetrical which indicated that the reaction was irreversible in this study the ability of the cnt ag cu cathode to generate h2o2 was verified because the h2o2 concentration varies with no aniline and because fe2 existed the results are shown in fig 7 a the h2o2 concentration increased rapidly in the first 30 min of reaction then it tended to remain steady at 0 20 mg l which is not outstanding compared to other reports 20 28 this may be due to cu2 dissolution from cnt ag cu and instantaneous catalytic decomposition of h2o2 resulting in a low concentration oh which has strong oxidation properties was considered the main oxidant for the removal of organic pollutants in the electro fenton system 40 the concentration of oh was also obtained and the results are shown in fig 7 b the rate of oh generation was higher in the first 30 min than between 30 and 60 min of reaction however the concentration of oh remained steady after 30 min of reaction and reached approximately 0 5 μmol l at 60 min of reaction in the fenton system o2 was also reported 41 to react with and degrade organic contaminants to verify which free radical is the key factor of aniline oxidation in this system the oh scavenger glycerol 42 and o2 scavenger p benzoquinone 43 were added the results are presented in fig 7 c the aniline removal rate was lower and only reached 32 8 after 60 min of reaction with 0 01 mmol l glycerol therefore it can be concluded that the aniline removal rate decreased sharply when oh was removed by the scavenger glycerol however the influence of p benzoquinone was not obvious and the aniline removal rate still reached 93 4 after 60 min of reaction hence o2 was not the key factor in aniline removal these results indicated that oh is the fundamental factor of aniline removal in this system in an electro fenton system the cathode metal dissolution process which could affect the cathode catalytic reduction functions is inevitable under acidic conditions therefore cu2 concentration variation was acquired and the results are presented in fig 8 a the cu2 concentration increased in the early reaction period when the initial ph was 3 0 then concentration growth rate slows down after 40 min of reaction although dissolved cu2 has a certain degree of secondary pollution risk the pollution degree is controllable by increasing the ph to 5 0 or higher furthermore the surface morphology of the cnt ag cu cathode after use was also characterized and the results are shown in fig 2 e some defects appeared after the cathode was used however ag was not detected that could be because there is only a little ag ion was released and lower to the instrument detection limit furthermore a large number of ag crystals were still attached to the surface of the cf metal skeleton and evenly distributed among cnts the cnt ag cu cathode still maintains excellent morphology and internal structure after the reaction a comparative analysis of the infrared spectra before and after the use of the cnt ag cu cathode was conducted and the results are shown in fig 8 b after the reaction more abundant groups could be found the peak at 1045 cm 1 corresponded to cn stretching vibrations 44 peaks appearing at 2923 cm 1 and 2988 cm 1 corresponded to ch2 and ch3 stretching vibrations respectively 45 this indicates that the electrode has a certain degree of adsorption on aniline and that aniline degraded intermediates the peaks at 626 cm 1 1385 cm 1 1560 cm 1 1636 cm 1 and 3450 cm 1 which correspond to ch coh co cc and oh stretching vibrations 46 were more intense after the reaction it could be deduced that the cnt ag cu electrode had more active sites after oxidation reactions therefore it could have stable catalytic capacity even after use to verify the stable catalytic capacity of the cnt ag cu electrode a cycle test of aniline removal was performed under the optimal conditions fig 8 c shows that the aniline removal rate can still reach 99 2 after 10 cycles therefore the cnt ag cu electrode has outstanding stability and efficiency in aniline electro fenton removal the mechanism of aniline removal by cnt ag cu is discussed in fig 9 in general the electro fenton process has multiple mechanisms of organic pollutant removal such as o2 reduction cyclic fe3 reduction to fe2 reactions on the cathode surface oxidation on the anode surface and fenton reactions both on the cathode surface and in solution in this study the rich pores and large specific surface area of cnt ag cu provide many active sites ag crystals on the surface of the cathode can greatly improve the efficiency of o2 reduction and promote the generation of h2o2 at the same time the rich pores and large specific surface area of the cnt ag cu cathode were also conducive to the reduction of fe3 to fe2 therefore h2o2 and a stable concentration of fe2 can help oh generation furthermore on the cnt ag cu surface cnts have a unique 3d nanostructure that can enhance the adsorption capacity of aniline and intermediate products therefore the heterogeneous fenton reaction on the cathode surface was also a significant removal path in addition cnts have 30 60 nm average equivalent diameter pore structures which could have a nanoconfinement effect hence active oh free radicals could reach a higher concentration inside the cnts then aniline could be degraded more efficiently by the coupling oxidation of homogeneous and heterogeneous fenton reactions 4 conclusion cnt ag cu was synthesized by ultrasonic oscillation mixing and impregnation metal displacement technology following the low temperature drying method cnt ag cu has outstanding catalytic activity for the electro fenton removal of aniline under optimal conditions a current density of 1 25 ma cm2 an initial ph of 5 0 an aeration flow rate of 0 10 m3 h and a fe2 concentration of 0 20 mmol l the aniline removal rate was over 99 the aniline removal process follows the pseudo first order kinetic law and the reaction rate constant under the optimal condition is 0 0661 min 1 the results of free radical analysis showed that cnt ag cu had an excellent ability to maintain the concentration of oh and the concentration of oh in this system could reach 0 499 μmol l after 60 min of reaction the cnt ag cu cathode has a stable catalytic capacity even after use for 10 cycles and the aniline removal rate can also reach 99 2 multiple coupling mechanisms for cnt ag cu promote the removal of aniline on the one hand the dispersion form of ag improves the two electron o2 reduction reaction and the fe2 cycling efficiency on the other hand the nanoconfinement effect of cnts could also promote the high efficiency of oh generation and aniline removal this study provides a green and

13408,previously an enhanced nitrogen removal process i e intermittent modified ludzack ettinger imle was developed by incorporating intermittent aeration into the mle process in this research a field demonstration of imle process on enhancing nitrogen removal was conducted in shenzhen guangming wastewater treatment plant wwtp at a daily treatment capacity of 25 000 m3 d results indicated that when operating the imle process with dissolved oxygen do based control mode its effluent chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia concentrations were consistently less than 30 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively similar to the original two stage anoxic oxic a o process with continuous aeration even though the influent had insufficient organic matter bod5 tn 2 5 the effluent tn concentration in the imle was still consistently below the new limit of 10 mg n l with an average and removal rate of 6 1 1 0 mg n l and 78 respectively this performance was similar to that in the two stage a o process equipped with step feed and external carbon addition without the addition of external carbon in the imle process it saved approximately 0 16 chinese yuan for one cubic meter of wastewater treated in addition to eliminating external carbon addition the imle process decreased the air consumption by 20 30 which would also reduce operation cost therefore the imle process operated with appropriate do control could reduce chemical cost and aeration energy use synergistically which provides a cost effective approach for wwtp upgrade graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords municipal wastewater nitrogen removal imle process wastewater treatment plant upgrade intermittent aeration 1 introduction nitrogen is one of most common nutrients that cause eutrophication in water bodies and wastewater is an important nitrogen source 1 3 therefore many wastewater treatment plants wwtp in china which were originally designed to meet the class i b discharge standard 4 are being upgraded to meet the class i a discharge standard that requires an effluent total nitrogen tn of less than 15 mg n l some cities in china have even issued stricter local discharge standards for example the updated discharge standards for wwtps in both beijing city 5 and tianjin city 6 requires the effluent tn less than 10 mg n l 7 9 to meet these new limits post denitrification facilities equipped with the addition of external carbon sources are usually added to enhance tn removal which significantly increases treatment cost and carbon dioxide co2 emission 10 wwtps often use pre anoxic processes to remove tn such as anoxic aerobic a o process 11 12 and anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process 13 14 in the pre anoxic processes mixed liquor return from aerobic zone to the anoxic zone is needed for denitrification however the nitrified mixed liquor in the aerobic zone cannot be completely returned to the pre anoxic zone for denitrification which limits the tn removal performance a post anoxic tank or filter with the addition of an external carbon source has to be used to further improve tn removal and this approach significantly increases treatment costs 11 15 alternatively a two stage or multi stage a o process with a step feed can further improve tn removal efficiency 16 intermittent aeration in the same tank can also create alternating aerobic anoxic condition to enhance tn removal e g the reformed cyclic activated sludge system cass 17 and sequencing batch reactor sbr 18 19 in a previous study we integrated pre anoxic denitrification and intermittent aeration denitrification into one process to form a new process of intermittent modified ludzack ettinger imle 20 the imle process combines the advantages of the two types of denitrification approaches which can reduce the overflow of nitrate and improve the utilization of original organics in the wastewater our previous pilot scale study indicated that the effluent tn concentration could be reduced to approximately 3 0 mg n l with a removal efficiency of 90 when the wastewater contained sufficient organics 20 when the wastewater contained insufficient organics bod5 tn 2 4 the average effluent ammonia and tn were 0 3 and 4 8 mg n l respectively 20 in addition this process could reduce approximately 10 of aeration needs compared to the regular pre anoxic process 20 however whether imle process can be applied in full scale wastewater treatment plants to improve tn removal and reduce aeration energy or not has not been demonstrated shenzhen guangming wwtp used a two stage a o process and the effluent tn had met the class i a discharge standard of 15 mg n l however starting from april 2019 the plant was required to meet a new local tn discharge limit of less than 10 mg n l in order to consistently meet this new requirement external carbon source was added into the 2nd anoxic zone to improve the tn removal however the operation cost increased significantly since then in this study one train of the biological treatment system in guangming wwtp that treated 25 000 m3 d of flow was upgraded to the imle process the tn removal efficiency and aeration energy consumption were monitored in the new process 2 materials and methods 2 1 process upgrade this demonstration study was carried out at shenzhen guangming wwtp which is owned by shenzhen guangming water and environment co ltd guangming wwtp has a total treatment capacity of 300 000 m3 d which were built in two phases the first phase facilities have a design treatment capacity of 150 000 m3 d which include six parallel trains of two stage a o processes as shown in fig 1 a each train has a design treatment capacity of 25 000 m3 d the demonstration test was conducted in one of the six trains the effective volumes for the anaerobic zone 1st anoxic zone 1st oxic zone 2nd anoxic zone and the 2nd oxic zone in this train are 544 2695 3998 3072 and 4144 m3 respectively in order to meet the discharge limit of tn 10 mg n l external carbon source i e sodium acetate solution was added into the 2nd anoxic zone which had increased the treatment cost significantly from march to april in 2020 the bn train was upgraded using imle process demonstrated in our previous pilot scale study as shown in fig 1 b during the upgrade the 1st anoxic zone was remained as the mixing zone in the imle process and the 1st oxic zone 2nd anoxic zone and 2nd oxic zone were combined into an intermittent aeration zone therefore aeration equipment was installed in the 2nd anoxic zone and mixing equipment was installed in the 1st oxic zone 2nd anoxic zone and the 2nd oxic zone making them one intermittent aeration zone with an inflow rate of 25 000 m3 d the hydraulic retention time hrt in the 1st anoxic zone 1st oxic zone 2nd anoxic zone and 2nd oxic zone were 2 6 3 8 2 9 and 4 0 h respectively in the original two stage a o process after modification the hrt in the mixing zone and intermittent aeration zone was 2 6 and 10 7 h in the imle process after these modifications the original internal mixed liquor return and external sludge return facilities were remained the same and the switch between aeration and mixing in the intermittent aeration zone of imle process was controlled by a programmable logic controller plc the aeration on off can be controlled based on time set i e time based control mode or the do concentration i e do based control mode 2 2 process operation after upgrade the tests were carried out in three phases with the daily treatment flow was maintained approximately 25 000 m3 d in each of the phases in the 1st phase it was operated with original two stage a o process setting fig 1 a to obtain baseline data for comparison in the 1st phase sodium acetate solution was added to the 2nd anoxic zone at 200 250 m3 h and the do in the 2nd oxic zone was manually controlled with a desired concentration of 2 3 mg l in the 2nd phase it was operated as an imle process fig 1 b with the aeration on off in the intermittent aeration zone being controlled based on fixed time settings e g 60 min of aeration and 60 min without aeration mixing was performed during the entire time of operation regardless of aeration on and off during the aeration period the do was manually controlled to approximately 2 mg l at the end of the intermittent aeration zone the addition of the external carbon source was gradually reduced until completely stopped on the june 4 2020 in the 3rd phase it was operated as an imle process fig 1 b with the aeration on off in the intermittent aeration zone being controlled based on do concentration at the end of intermittent aeration zone after the aeration was turned on the do gradually increased until reaching the set point e g 2 mg l aeration continued for another 20 min and then was turned off when the do decreased to 0 5 mg l after turning off the aeration the aeration would be turned on in 30 40 min in this phase no external carbon sources were added during the tests the influent chemical oxygen demand cod five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 tn and ammonia concentrations and the effluent cod tn ammonia and nitrate concentrations were measured daily composite samples were used for influent analysis while grab samples collected at 9 am and 15 pm starting from may 29 2020 respectively were used for effluent analysis in addition the daily air consumption rate was recorded as well 2 3 cycling test to understand changes of nh3 and no3 in the intermittent aeration zone in the imle process during the cycling of aeration on and off cycling tests were conducted for a period of 12 h during the 2nd phase during the test the nh3 and no3 concentrations at the end of intermittent aeration zone were tracked in this test the aeration on and off time were set at 60 min vs 60 min meanwhile the inflow rate and concentrations of cod nh3 and tn and the do concentration at the end of intermittent aeration zone were recorded online during the cycling test 2 4 analytical methods in this study cod was measured by dichromate method 21 bod5 was measured by inoculation dilution method 22 tn was measured by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion ultraviolet spectrophotometry 23 nh3 was measured by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry 24 and no3 was measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry 25 sludge concentration was determined by gravimetric method 26 ph was determined by a hach ph meter and do was determined by real time do meter hach sc 200 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal fig 2 shows that the influent cod fluctuated significantly during the tests the average influent cod concentrations in the three phases were 202 52 197 85 and 204 57 mg l table 1 respectively the average effluent cod concentrations in each of the three phases were all approximately 19 mg l and the average removal rates were greater than 90 therefore the imle process had a similar performance on cod removal with the two stage a o process that employed continuous aeration in the biological wastewater treatment process in order to maintain a good nitrification performance the solids retention time srt is generally greater than 10 days and the hydraulic retention time is usually greater than 10 h 27 this srt provides an excessive capacity for organic matter removal therefore intermittent aeration can still achieve excellent cod removal although the aeration time is reduced moreover due to inflow and infiltration to the sewer system and anaerobic digestion in the septic tanks and sewers 28 29 the cod concentration in the influent of wwtps in the south of china is usually low therefore application of intermittent aeration does not impact the cod removal efficiency 3 2 nh3 removal the influent and effluent nh3 concentrations in different phases of the test are shown in fig 3 with average values listed in table 1 since the influent nh3 concentration and inflow rate fluctuated greatly within one day the effluent tn nh3 and nitrate concentrations were also measured in the afternoon when operating with the two stage a o process the effluent nh3 was very stable with an average value of 0 2 0 1 mg n l and removal efficiency of 99 respectively with time based control mode of the imle process phase 2 the average influent nh3 concentration was 19 6 4 6 mg n l and the effluent nh3 concentration fluctuated in the range of 0 04 2 4 mg n l fig 3 the average effluent concentration and removal rate were 0 9 0 9 mg n l and 95 4 table 1 respectively the fluctuation in the effluent nh3 after changing to imle process with time based control was mainly caused by unstable do concentration fig s1 with the time based control mode in the imle process it was difficult to control the do in the desired range by manually control the aeration intensity due to the dramatic fluctuation in influent loading as shown in fig s1 low do has a significant inhibitory effect on nitrification and therefore the effluent nh3 concentration fluctuated significantly 30 after changing into the do based control mode the effluent nh3 concentration became very stable within the range of 0 3 0 5 mg n l although the average influent nh3 concentration increased to 23 1 3 2 mg n l the average effluent concentration and removal rate were 0 4 0 2 mg n l and 98 2 respectively with the do based control mode the aeration time was controlled more accurately fig s2 based on the do concentration and as a result the effluent nh3 concentration and removal efficiency reached a level similar to that of the two stage a o process table 1 3 3 tn removal the influent and effluent tn concentrations and the effluent nitrate concentration in different phases of the operation are shown in fig 3 and the average values are shown in table 1 earlier tests showed that the pilot scale with the two stage a o process combined with step feed enhanced tn removal efficiency significantly with effluent nh4 and no3 of 0 2 and 0 8 mg n l respectively 31 32 in 2018 this testing train was operated with the two stage a o process without adding external carbon sources and the average influent tn was 33 6 1 5 mg n l while the effluent tn fluctuated within the range of 4 5 14 7 mg n l the average effluent tn concentration and removal efficiency were 10 3 2 3 mg n l and 69 3 respectively which met the class i a discharge standard of wwtp in china 4 however the treatment performance in tn removal could not consistently meet the new requirement of less than 10 mg n l after adding an external carbon source to the 2nd anoxic zone of the two stage a o process the effluent tn became less than 8 mg n l consistently with an average and removal efficiency of 5 6 1 4 mg n l and 79 9 table 1 respectively although the addition of the external carbon source had ensured the effluent tn below the new limit the operation cost increased by approximately 0 16 chinese yuan per m3 water after changing to the imle operation the average influent tn concentrations with time and do based control modes were 25 8 4 8 and 27 7 3 8 mg n l respectively fig 4 and table 1 while the effluent tn concentrations in the morning were in the range of 2 9 10 6 and 3 7 9 4 mg n l respectively the average effluent tn concentrations were 7 0 2 0 and 6 1 1 0 mg n l respectively with the average removal efficiencies were 72 8 and 78 0 respectively the average effluent tn in the afternoon was only 4 2 1 4 mg n l with do based control mode these results demonstrated that the imle process equipped the do based control could improve tn removal efficiency and ensure the effluent tn consistently less than 10 mg n l without external carbon addition these results also suggested that the imle process could efficiently remove cod nh3 and tn allowing a similar effluent quality as the two stage a o process equipped with external carbon addition assuming the carbon in the added external carbon source i e ch3coona would be converted into co2 finally it was estimated that the elimination of external carbon addition could reduce approximately 23 3 tons of co2 emission when treating one million cubic meters of wastewater 3 4 changes in concentrations of nh3 and no3 during cycling aeration without addition of an external carbon source the tn removal efficiency in the imle process that was controlled based on do was approximately 10 higher than that in the two stage a o process table 1 as shown in fig 5 a the do in the intermittent aeration zone of the imle process increased and decreased circularly when the aeration was turned on the do increased and this zone was under aerobic condition as a result the nh3 accumulated in the intermittent aeration zone was oxidized to nitrate when the aeration was turned off the nitrate was reduced to n2 by organic carbon and or through endogenous respiration so the nitrate concentration decreased in the imle process the nitrate at the end of intermittent aeration zone was also returned to the pre anoxic zone to be reduced to n2 therefore the combination of denitrification in the pre anoxic zone and in the intermittent aeration zone increased tn removal efficiency which resulted in a similar removal efficiency as the two stage a o with addition of external carbon source to the 2nd anoxic zone during the aeration off period with mixing on in the intermittent aeration zone the inflow was effectively diluted by the mixed liquor therefore the accumulated ammonia concentration at the end of the aeration off period was not high 1 5 2 0 mg n l as shown in fig 5 b in addition the secondary clarifier could serve as a buffering zone to equalize the nh3 concentration as a result the effluent ammonia concentration from the secondary clarifier was consistently low intermittent aeration has also been used to achieve short cut nitrification denitrification and short cut nitrification anaerobic ammonia oxidation 33 however whether these novel nitrogen removal pathways exist or not in the imle process requires further investigation 3 5 air consumption fig 6 shows that when operating with the imle process the daily air consumption was significantly reduced as shown in table 2 when the two stage a o process was used the air consumption per cubic meter of water and per kilogram of cod removal were 3 6 m3 air m3 water and 19 8 m3 air kg cod respectively with time based control mode and do based control mode of the imle process the air consumption per m3 of water was reduced to 2 5 and 2 8 m3 air m3 water respectively and the air consumption per kilogram of cod was reduced to 14 0 and 15 1 m3 air kg cod respectively the results show that the imle process not only improved tn removal efficiency but also reduced the air consumption by 20 30 the reduction in air consumption was mainly due to higher denitrification efficiency reducing the theoretical oxygen demand and the intermittent aeration with more precise do control fig s2 4 conclusions following conclusions were drawn from the field study of imle process in shenzhen guangming wwtp 1 when the imle process was operated with do control mode its effluent cod and ammonia concentrations were consistently less than 30 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively which were equivalent to the two stage a o process with continuous aeration 2 when using imle process do based control mode to treat the organic insufficient wastewater bod5 tn 2 5 the effluent tn concentration was consistently below 10 mg l with an average value and removal efficiency of 6 1 1 0 mg n l and 78 respectively this performance was similar to that of the two stage a o process equipped with addition of external carbon source the elimination of the external carbon addition of the imle process saved approximately 0 16 chinese yuan for treating one cubic meter of wastewater 3 compared to the two stage a o process the imle process reduced the air consumption by 20 30 therefore the imle process operated with do based control mode could synergistically improve tn removal and reduce aeration energy which provides a new approach of wwtp upgrade declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

13408,previously an enhanced nitrogen removal process i e intermittent modified ludzack ettinger imle was developed by incorporating intermittent aeration into the mle process in this research a field demonstration of imle process on enhancing nitrogen removal was conducted in shenzhen guangming wastewater treatment plant wwtp at a daily treatment capacity of 25 000 m3 d results indicated that when operating the imle process with dissolved oxygen do based control mode its effluent chemical oxygen demand cod and ammonia concentrations were consistently less than 30 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively similar to the original two stage anoxic oxic a o process with continuous aeration even though the influent had insufficient organic matter bod5 tn 2 5 the effluent tn concentration in the imle was still consistently below the new limit of 10 mg n l with an average and removal rate of 6 1 1 0 mg n l and 78 respectively this performance was similar to that in the two stage a o process equipped with step feed and external carbon addition without the addition of external carbon in the imle process it saved approximately 0 16 chinese yuan for one cubic meter of wastewater treated in addition to eliminating external carbon addition the imle process decreased the air consumption by 20 30 which would also reduce operation cost therefore the imle process operated with appropriate do control could reduce chemical cost and aeration energy use synergistically which provides a cost effective approach for wwtp upgrade graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords municipal wastewater nitrogen removal imle process wastewater treatment plant upgrade intermittent aeration 1 introduction nitrogen is one of most common nutrients that cause eutrophication in water bodies and wastewater is an important nitrogen source 1 3 therefore many wastewater treatment plants wwtp in china which were originally designed to meet the class i b discharge standard 4 are being upgraded to meet the class i a discharge standard that requires an effluent total nitrogen tn of less than 15 mg n l some cities in china have even issued stricter local discharge standards for example the updated discharge standards for wwtps in both beijing city 5 and tianjin city 6 requires the effluent tn less than 10 mg n l 7 9 to meet these new limits post denitrification facilities equipped with the addition of external carbon sources are usually added to enhance tn removal which significantly increases treatment cost and carbon dioxide co2 emission 10 wwtps often use pre anoxic processes to remove tn such as anoxic aerobic a o process 11 12 and anaerobic anoxic aerobic a2o process 13 14 in the pre anoxic processes mixed liquor return from aerobic zone to the anoxic zone is needed for denitrification however the nitrified mixed liquor in the aerobic zone cannot be completely returned to the pre anoxic zone for denitrification which limits the tn removal performance a post anoxic tank or filter with the addition of an external carbon source has to be used to further improve tn removal and this approach significantly increases treatment costs 11 15 alternatively a two stage or multi stage a o process with a step feed can further improve tn removal efficiency 16 intermittent aeration in the same tank can also create alternating aerobic anoxic condition to enhance tn removal e g the reformed cyclic activated sludge system cass 17 and sequencing batch reactor sbr 18 19 in a previous study we integrated pre anoxic denitrification and intermittent aeration denitrification into one process to form a new process of intermittent modified ludzack ettinger imle 20 the imle process combines the advantages of the two types of denitrification approaches which can reduce the overflow of nitrate and improve the utilization of original organics in the wastewater our previous pilot scale study indicated that the effluent tn concentration could be reduced to approximately 3 0 mg n l with a removal efficiency of 90 when the wastewater contained sufficient organics 20 when the wastewater contained insufficient organics bod5 tn 2 4 the average effluent ammonia and tn were 0 3 and 4 8 mg n l respectively 20 in addition this process could reduce approximately 10 of aeration needs compared to the regular pre anoxic process 20 however whether imle process can be applied in full scale wastewater treatment plants to improve tn removal and reduce aeration energy or not has not been demonstrated shenzhen guangming wwtp used a two stage a o process and the effluent tn had met the class i a discharge standard of 15 mg n l however starting from april 2019 the plant was required to meet a new local tn discharge limit of less than 10 mg n l in order to consistently meet this new requirement external carbon source was added into the 2nd anoxic zone to improve the tn removal however the operation cost increased significantly since then in this study one train of the biological treatment system in guangming wwtp that treated 25 000 m3 d of flow was upgraded to the imle process the tn removal efficiency and aeration energy consumption were monitored in the new process 2 materials and methods 2 1 process upgrade this demonstration study was carried out at shenzhen guangming wwtp which is owned by shenzhen guangming water and environment co ltd guangming wwtp has a total treatment capacity of 300 000 m3 d which were built in two phases the first phase facilities have a design treatment capacity of 150 000 m3 d which include six parallel trains of two stage a o processes as shown in fig 1 a each train has a design treatment capacity of 25 000 m3 d the demonstration test was conducted in one of the six trains the effective volumes for the anaerobic zone 1st anoxic zone 1st oxic zone 2nd anoxic zone and the 2nd oxic zone in this train are 544 2695 3998 3072 and 4144 m3 respectively in order to meet the discharge limit of tn 10 mg n l external carbon source i e sodium acetate solution was added into the 2nd anoxic zone which had increased the treatment cost significantly from march to april in 2020 the bn train was upgraded using imle process demonstrated in our previous pilot scale study as shown in fig 1 b during the upgrade the 1st anoxic zone was remained as the mixing zone in the imle process and the 1st oxic zone 2nd anoxic zone and 2nd oxic zone were combined into an intermittent aeration zone therefore aeration equipment was installed in the 2nd anoxic zone and mixing equipment was installed in the 1st oxic zone 2nd anoxic zone and the 2nd oxic zone making them one intermittent aeration zone with an inflow rate of 25 000 m3 d the hydraulic retention time hrt in the 1st anoxic zone 1st oxic zone 2nd anoxic zone and 2nd oxic zone were 2 6 3 8 2 9 and 4 0 h respectively in the original two stage a o process after modification the hrt in the mixing zone and intermittent aeration zone was 2 6 and 10 7 h in the imle process after these modifications the original internal mixed liquor return and external sludge return facilities were remained the same and the switch between aeration and mixing in the intermittent aeration zone of imle process was controlled by a programmable logic controller plc the aeration on off can be controlled based on time set i e time based control mode or the do concentration i e do based control mode 2 2 process operation after upgrade the tests were carried out in three phases with the daily treatment flow was maintained approximately 25 000 m3 d in each of the phases in the 1st phase it was operated with original two stage a o process setting fig 1 a to obtain baseline data for comparison in the 1st phase sodium acetate solution was added to the 2nd anoxic zone at 200 250 m3 h and the do in the 2nd oxic zone was manually controlled with a desired concentration of 2 3 mg l in the 2nd phase it was operated as an imle process fig 1 b with the aeration on off in the intermittent aeration zone being controlled based on fixed time settings e g 60 min of aeration and 60 min without aeration mixing was performed during the entire time of operation regardless of aeration on and off during the aeration period the do was manually controlled to approximately 2 mg l at the end of the intermittent aeration zone the addition of the external carbon source was gradually reduced until completely stopped on the june 4 2020 in the 3rd phase it was operated as an imle process fig 1 b with the aeration on off in the intermittent aeration zone being controlled based on do concentration at the end of intermittent aeration zone after the aeration was turned on the do gradually increased until reaching the set point e g 2 mg l aeration continued for another 20 min and then was turned off when the do decreased to 0 5 mg l after turning off the aeration the aeration would be turned on in 30 40 min in this phase no external carbon sources were added during the tests the influent chemical oxygen demand cod five day biochemical oxygen demand bod5 tn and ammonia concentrations and the effluent cod tn ammonia and nitrate concentrations were measured daily composite samples were used for influent analysis while grab samples collected at 9 am and 15 pm starting from may 29 2020 respectively were used for effluent analysis in addition the daily air consumption rate was recorded as well 2 3 cycling test to understand changes of nh3 and no3 in the intermittent aeration zone in the imle process during the cycling of aeration on and off cycling tests were conducted for a period of 12 h during the 2nd phase during the test the nh3 and no3 concentrations at the end of intermittent aeration zone were tracked in this test the aeration on and off time were set at 60 min vs 60 min meanwhile the inflow rate and concentrations of cod nh3 and tn and the do concentration at the end of intermittent aeration zone were recorded online during the cycling test 2 4 analytical methods in this study cod was measured by dichromate method 21 bod5 was measured by inoculation dilution method 22 tn was measured by alkaline potassium persulfate digestion ultraviolet spectrophotometry 23 nh3 was measured by nessler s reagent spectrophotometry 24 and no3 was measured by ultraviolet spectrophotometry 25 sludge concentration was determined by gravimetric method 26 ph was determined by a hach ph meter and do was determined by real time do meter hach sc 200 3 results and discussion 3 1 cod removal fig 2 shows that the influent cod fluctuated significantly during the tests the average influent cod concentrations in the three phases were 202 52 197 85 and 204 57 mg l table 1 respectively the average effluent cod concentrations in each of the three phases were all approximately 19 mg l and the average removal rates were greater than 90 therefore the imle process had a similar performance on cod removal with the two stage a o process that employed continuous aeration in the biological wastewater treatment process in order to maintain a good nitrification performance the solids retention time srt is generally greater than 10 days and the hydraulic retention time is usually greater than 10 h 27 this srt provides an excessive capacity for organic matter removal therefore intermittent aeration can still achieve excellent cod removal although the aeration time is reduced moreover due to inflow and infiltration to the sewer system and anaerobic digestion in the septic tanks and sewers 28 29 the cod concentration in the influent of wwtps in the south of china is usually low therefore application of intermittent aeration does not impact the cod removal efficiency 3 2 nh3 removal the influent and effluent nh3 concentrations in different phases of the test are shown in fig 3 with average values listed in table 1 since the influent nh3 concentration and inflow rate fluctuated greatly within one day the effluent tn nh3 and nitrate concentrations were also measured in the afternoon when operating with the two stage a o process the effluent nh3 was very stable with an average value of 0 2 0 1 mg n l and removal efficiency of 99 respectively with time based control mode of the imle process phase 2 the average influent nh3 concentration was 19 6 4 6 mg n l and the effluent nh3 concentration fluctuated in the range of 0 04 2 4 mg n l fig 3 the average effluent concentration and removal rate were 0 9 0 9 mg n l and 95 4 table 1 respectively the fluctuation in the effluent nh3 after changing to imle process with time based control was mainly caused by unstable do concentration fig s1 with the time based control mode in the imle process it was difficult to control the do in the desired range by manually control the aeration intensity due to the dramatic fluctuation in influent loading as shown in fig s1 low do has a significant inhibitory effect on nitrification and therefore the effluent nh3 concentration fluctuated significantly 30 after changing into the do based control mode the effluent nh3 concentration became very stable within the range of 0 3 0 5 mg n l although the average influent nh3 concentration increased to 23 1 3 2 mg n l the average effluent concentration and removal rate were 0 4 0 2 mg n l and 98 2 respectively with the do based control mode the aeration time was controlled more accurately fig s2 based on the do concentration and as a result the effluent nh3 concentration and removal efficiency reached a level similar to that of the two stage a o process table 1 3 3 tn removal the influent and effluent tn concentrations and the effluent nitrate concentration in different phases of the operation are shown in fig 3 and the average values are shown in table 1 earlier tests showed that the pilot scale with the two stage a o process combined with step feed enhanced tn removal efficiency significantly with effluent nh4 and no3 of 0 2 and 0 8 mg n l respectively 31 32 in 2018 this testing train was operated with the two stage a o process without adding external carbon sources and the average influent tn was 33 6 1 5 mg n l while the effluent tn fluctuated within the range of 4 5 14 7 mg n l the average effluent tn concentration and removal efficiency were 10 3 2 3 mg n l and 69 3 respectively which met the class i a discharge standard of wwtp in china 4 however the treatment performance in tn removal could not consistently meet the new requirement of less than 10 mg n l after adding an external carbon source to the 2nd anoxic zone of the two stage a o process the effluent tn became less than 8 mg n l consistently with an average and removal efficiency of 5 6 1 4 mg n l and 79 9 table 1 respectively although the addition of the external carbon source had ensured the effluent tn below the new limit the operation cost increased by approximately 0 16 chinese yuan per m3 water after changing to the imle operation the average influent tn concentrations with time and do based control modes were 25 8 4 8 and 27 7 3 8 mg n l respectively fig 4 and table 1 while the effluent tn concentrations in the morning were in the range of 2 9 10 6 and 3 7 9 4 mg n l respectively the average effluent tn concentrations were 7 0 2 0 and 6 1 1 0 mg n l respectively with the average removal efficiencies were 72 8 and 78 0 respectively the average effluent tn in the afternoon was only 4 2 1 4 mg n l with do based control mode these results demonstrated that the imle process equipped the do based control could improve tn removal efficiency and ensure the effluent tn consistently less than 10 mg n l without external carbon addition these results also suggested that the imle process could efficiently remove cod nh3 and tn allowing a similar effluent quality as the two stage a o process equipped with external carbon addition assuming the carbon in the added external carbon source i e ch3coona would be converted into co2 finally it was estimated that the elimination of external carbon addition could reduce approximately 23 3 tons of co2 emission when treating one million cubic meters of wastewater 3 4 changes in concentrations of nh3 and no3 during cycling aeration without addition of an external carbon source the tn removal efficiency in the imle process that was controlled based on do was approximately 10 higher than that in the two stage a o process table 1 as shown in fig 5 a the do in the intermittent aeration zone of the imle process increased and decreased circularly when the aeration was turned on the do increased and this zone was under aerobic condition as a result the nh3 accumulated in the intermittent aeration zone was oxidized to nitrate when the aeration was turned off the nitrate was reduced to n2 by organic carbon and or through endogenous respiration so the nitrate concentration decreased in the imle process the nitrate at the end of intermittent aeration zone was also returned to the pre anoxic zone to be reduced to n2 therefore the combination of denitrification in the pre anoxic zone and in the intermittent aeration zone increased tn removal efficiency which resulted in a similar removal efficiency as the two stage a o with addition of external carbon source to the 2nd anoxic zone during the aeration off period with mixing on in the intermittent aeration zone the inflow was effectively diluted by the mixed liquor therefore the accumulated ammonia concentration at the end of the aeration off period was not high 1 5 2 0 mg n l as shown in fig 5 b in addition the secondary clarifier could serve as a buffering zone to equalize the nh3 concentration as a result the effluent ammonia concentration from the secondary clarifier was consistently low intermittent aeration has also been used to achieve short cut nitrification denitrification and short cut nitrification anaerobic ammonia oxidation 33 however whether these novel nitrogen removal pathways exist or not in the imle process requires further investigation 3 5 air consumption fig 6 shows that when operating with the imle process the daily air consumption was significantly reduced as shown in table 2 when the two stage a o process was used the air consumption per cubic meter of water and per kilogram of cod removal were 3 6 m3 air m3 water and 19 8 m3 air kg cod respectively with time based control mode and do based control mode of the imle process the air consumption per m3 of water was reduced to 2 5 and 2 8 m3 air m3 water respectively and the air consumption per kilogram of cod was reduced to 14 0 and 15 1 m3 air kg cod respectively the results show that the imle process not only improved tn removal efficiency but also reduced the air consumption by 20 30 the reduction in air consumption was mainly due to higher denitrification efficiency reducing the theoretical oxygen demand and the intermittent aeration with more precise do control fig s2 4 conclusions following conclusions were drawn from the field study of imle process in shenzhen guangming wwtp 1 when the imle process was operated with do control mode its effluent cod and ammonia concentrations were consistently less than 30 mg l and 1 5 mg l respectively which were equivalent to the two stage a o process with continuous aeration 2 when using imle process do based control mode to treat the organic insufficient wastewater bod5 tn 2 5 the effluent tn concentration was consistently below 10 mg l with an average value and removal efficiency of 6 1 1 0 mg n l and 78 respectively this performance was similar to that of the two stage a o process equipped with addition of external carbon source the elimination of the external carbon addition of the imle process saved approximately 0 16 chinese yuan for treating one cubic meter of wastewater 3 compared to the two stage a o process the imle process reduced the air consumption by 20 30 therefore the imle process operated with do based control mode could synergistically improve tn removal and reduce aeration energy which provides a new approach of wwtp upgrade declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

13409,understanding the factors that specify the fouling development in membrane distillation md plays a key role to develop effective control strategies with the aim of providing its widespread use in industrial applications such as textile industry the present study investigated the fouling mechanisms in textile wastewater treatment by direct contact md dcmd employing an advanced in situ optical coherence tomography oct technology allowing to monitor md fouling in real time the oct analysis enabled evaluating the effect of feed temperature flow rate dye concentration on the membrane fouling and the long term performance of md operation that includes a periodical water flushing the permeate flux decrease during the initial stages of experiments was attributed to the existence of attractive hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between the membrane and dye molecules as no cake fouling was observed at the early stages then a flat and homogeneous cake layer was developed with time in all the fouled membranes regardless of the cake layer thickness the long term experiment resulted in both reversible and irreversible fouling and showed that water flushing had limited efficacy against reversible fouling additionally electrostatic repulsive forces occurring between the membrane and textile dye molecules influenced the permeate flux depending on the dye concentration finally among all the operating parameters feed temperature had the highest impact on the membrane fouling and process performance changed the heat transfer activity at the membrane liquid frontier zone in turn leading to variations in the flux graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords direct contact membrane distillation dcmd textile effluent treatment fouling analysis in situ fouling monitoring optical coherence tomography oct 1 introduction the textile industry is one of the most water consuming industries worldwide producing large amounts of wastewater in almost all stages of its manufacturing process 1 2 the water consumption estimated is approximately 300 t for the production of 1 t of textile products 3 produced wastewater from the manufacturing process has a complex composition containing miscellaneous textile dyes inorganic salts heavy metals organics and other pollutants and is categorized into highly harmful effluents to human health and the aquatic environment 4 one potential route with a successful water management strategy to save water sources and to reduce the detrimental impacts of discharging wastewater into water bodies can be the recycling and reuse of the wastewater by utilizing sustainable and cost effective water treatment technology 5 6 membrane distillation md a potentially promising thermal membrane separation process 7 has gained great attention over the last decade due to its unique advantages 8 including relatively lower feed temperatures than conventional thermal treatment units lower operating pressures than pressure driven membrane processes low fouling propensity high water recovery and excellent rejection rate for the pollutants 9 10 md applies a microporous hydrophobic membrane to serve as a barrier between two streams namely hot feed and cold distillate in which a thermally driven force is created in order to enable vapor molecules to pass from the feed side to the other side through the membrane pores 11 md holds two substantial motivations encouraging its use in the applications of textile wastewater treatment 12 first it is able to harness low grade waste heat already available in textile wastewater without an additional heat source need since the wastewater is evacuated from the process with a temperature range of 80 100 c 13 this enables the md to be cost effective by reducing operating costs with lower energy consumption second besides the large amounts of water reclamation with a successful zero liquid discharge approach the dye can be recovered from the wastewater which is also economically desirable for the textile manufacturing companies 14 the dye is a non volatile compound and can be easily separated from the feed solution theoretically up to 100 via md 3 although the md has many key advantages in the treatment of textile wastewater membrane fouling remains a big challenge hindering its widespread application 15 fouling in md leads to an increase in energy consumption a decrease in md flux and reduces membrane lifetime 16 18 the inorganic and organic compounds in textile wastewater interact with each other and then transform into complex colloidal particles and suspended solids 19 the mechanisms of md fouling are explained by the interfacial interactivities between the membrane surface and these compounds 13 since the wastewater has a complex composition its physicochemical interactions with the membrane surface are considered as complicated for multiple reasons such as dispersion and dipole forces and hydrogen bonding moreover the repulsive force between the membrane and the textile wastewater is believed highly associated with membrane hydrophobicity and increases with a higher hydrophobic surface 20 the dyes in textile wastewater contain positively or negatively charged groups that are associated with the type of physicochemical interactions 21 laqbaqbi et al 22 introduced that negatively charged dyes in the wastewater show a lower penetration tendency into the membrane pores because of their repulsive effects against the membrane developing a cake layer composed of flake type dye structure on the active membrane surface area furthermore the authors also stated that dipole dipole interactions between electron releasing nitrogen atoms of dyes enable easily attachment of dye particles on the surface of membrane and into the pores 22 in another study an et al 13 stated that positively charged dyes have a higher fouling and wetting propensity through the membrane foulants interaction the authors concluded that flake type foulants deposited to the surface of membrane can be easily eliminated with water flushing 13 the md fouling caused by textile wastewater has so far been investigated by conventional methods including monitoring flux behavior during md and measuring the water quality on the permeate side 23 25 however these methods are only used as an indicator to predict the occurrence of fouling do not provide information on fouling characterization besides these invasive analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscope sem and atomic force microscope afm have been adopted to investigate fouling mechanisms are used to assess the foulants deposited on the membrane surface after the experiment 20 26 for example laqbaqbi et al 22 performed sem and afm analyses to evaluate the fouling mechanisms in a md unit fed with a simulated textile wastewater solution containing different dyes however these destructive techniques are applied ex situ by taking out the membrane sample from the cell and after the membrane is dried in addition md is a temperature dependent process in which the temperature of feed solution during operation influences the membrane fouling formation thus the fouling structure would be changed when the membrane sample is disassembled from the module 27 the aforementioned techniques do not give much insight into the membrane fouling as they are not able to link between the fouling development and the system performance decrease hence understanding the fouling mechanisms and membrane foulants interactions in md remains a challenge 22 considering the complexity of fouling in md caused by textile wastewater the use of a real time monitoring technique is essential in order to better understand the fouling characteristics as well as interactions at the membrane water interface an in situ visualization technique namely optical coherence tomography oct has been successfully employed recently for the assessment of fouling development in md systems fed with various wastewater quality 28 29 which could also be a suitable method to monitor the md fouling caused by textile wastewater the novelty of this study lies in the comprehensive in situ non destructive real time image analysis of md fouling by oct technology the oct scans enabled a better understanding of fouling mechanisms in md experiments conducted under different operational conditions with providing quantitative fouling thickness and qualitative fouling morphology findings the aim of this study is to investigate the fouling behaviors by a real time monitoring technique in a direct contact md dcmd system operated with textile wastewater as feed solution oct was used for the non destructive and real time monitoring of fouling development on the membrane surface previous studies have shown the capability of oct in analyzing and characterizing membrane bio fouling and scaling for different applications 18 30 the comprehensive examination of fouling formation was performed by investigating the effect of crucial operating parameters such as feed temperature flow rate and dye concentration in addition a long term 3 days experiment combined

membrane has a 0 22 μm average pore size 40 5 porosity 135 5 contact angle and 6 4 bar liquid entry pressure lep more details of these membranes can be found elsewhere 34 2 3 experimental procedures 2 3 1 dcmd test unit a schematic description of the dcmd setup used for textile wastewater treatment is presented in fig 2 the md experiments were carried out using a customized acrylic dcmd module with the dimensions of 6 0 cm length and 1 5 cm width corresponding to a total membrane area of 9 cm2 the laboratory scale dcmd module was designed with a slot at the top side of module in order to online monitor the fouling development the flow rate of feed and permeate sides was constant and two gear pumps l 72 211 70 cole parmer maintained the continuous circulation in a counter current flow mode feed water temperature was kept constant at the desired temperature with an accuracy of 1 c using a heating plate c mag hs7 ika endowed with a contact thermometer ets d5 ika while the temperature of distillate was maintained at 20 1 c using a cooling system f32 he julabo equipped with a coil heat exchanger a data acquisition system 34970a keysight connected to temperature sensors placed at feed and permeate channels was used to record and control the temperatures of both streams the water conductivity on the permeate side was frequently measured using a conductivity meter wtw cond 3310 to control the membrane wetting the amount of distilled water accumulated in the permeate container was measured using an electronic scale ml3002 mettler toledo and the measurements were continuously recorded to a computer with 10 min intervals through a data logger system national instruments labview the water vapor flux j in kg m2h was determined by eq 1 1 j w t a where w is the weight of the distillate collected t is the time of the distillate collection and a is the active membrane area 2 3 2 operating conditions the feed temperature and flow rate effects on md fouling were investigated at 40 80 c feed water temperatures and 250 750 ml min flow rates each single md experiment was started with a textile wastewater of 1 l at the feed and a distilled water of 1 l at the permeate and was conducted in concentrating mode for an operational duration of 24 h after each experiment the used membrane coupon was taken out of the dcmd module and stored at room temperature for further analyses then the long term 3 days operating performance of dcmd for textile wastewater treatment was evaluated by employing a conventional membrane cleaning method water flushing during the cleaning the membrane was washed by circulating distilled water through the feed pipeline with 750 ml min flow rate for 15 min this experiment had 3 filtration cycles with a duration of 24 h for each cycle and the cleaning was carried out after the cycles the feed water was renewed with 1 l solution after each 24 h cycle and the membrane coupon was removed at the end of the experiment the reversible rf and irreversible irf fouling ratios were calculated by eqs 2 4 2 if n j 0 j n j 0 3 tf n j 0 j x n j 0 4 rf n tf n if n the normalized fluxes at the beginning of each filtration cycle after each membrane cleaning and at the end of each filtration cycle are referred as j 0 j n and j x n respectively with the number n 1 3 representing the cycle number 2 3 3 feedwater characterization color and chemical

dried at 103 105 c the conductivity values of the solutions was measured with a portable wtw cond 3310 conductivity meter the turbidity and ph of the wastewater was measured by using a 2100an hach turbidimeter and a cyberscan 6000 ph meter 2 3 4 fouling analysis 2 3 4 1 oct imaging the oct imaging technique has been recently used in situ non invasively to investigate fouling formation during the operation of membrane filtration systems 35 37 the oct uses backscattered light captured by a camera providing continuous non destructive 2d cross sectional or 3d imaging of the membrane area thus enables a successful tracking of the fouling evolution depending on time 2d imaging is usually preferred to depict time dependent cake layer formation as it allows clear and quick visual evaluation whereas 3d imaging is used to introduce a comprehensive view of the surface topography of the fouled membrane in this study in situ non invasive scanning of the fouling was carried out by a spectral domain optical coherence tomography sd oct device ganymede ii thorlabs gmbh at a center wavelength of 930 nm the oct device equipped with a 5 telecentric scan lens thorlabs lsm 03bb provided cross sectional 2d and three dimensional 3d scans taken from a fixed location on the membrane owing to the oct probe placed on the dcmd module the oct scans were acquired with the parameters of a resolution of 1000 1000 400 pixels and an area of 4 0 mm 4 0 mm 1 4 mm width length depth 2d cross sectional and 3d scans were processed by fiji imagej national institute of health usa and avizo field electron and ion company hillsboro or usa software respectively the images were modified by adjusting brightness and contrast and then cropped for visualization purposes the thickness of fouling layers was estimated using a custom code written in matlab the procedure for the calculation is reported elsewhere 35 38 2 3 4 2 identification of the functional groups of the foulants to determine the functional groups of the foulants accumulated on the membrane surface fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were collected in attenuated total reflection atr technique by a perkinelmer spectrum 100 ftir system 39 each spectral measurement was acquired by 32 scans in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 1 cm 1 background correction was performed under the condition of ambient air before starting the measurement the atr sensor was cleaned with hexane prior to each analysis the data were obtained using ftir spectrometer software spectrum 10 installed on a computer 2 3 4 3 hydrophobicity hydrophilicity analysis of the fouled membranes the surface hydrophobicity change of the membranes was evaluated with the water contact angle ca analysis conducted using an optical tensiometer tl 100 attension 40 the ca measurement was performed with the sessile drop method and acquired through the device software oneattension the membrane specimens were first kept at ambient temperature to be dried cut to the proper sizes and then mounted on a smooth glass plate a water droplet of 5 μl was gently put on the membrane surface using an automatic syringe injector equipped with a metal needle and the ca was taken when the angle reached a steady state the analysis for each membrane was repeated three times with the samples extracted from different parts of the membrane to achieve reproducibility and the result was reported as an average value standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of operating parameters on dcmd flux fig 3 a exhibits the effect of different feed temperatures 40 80 c on the permeate flux depending on time it was observed that the permeate flux was significantly influenced by the feed temperature at the beginning of the experiments the initial permeate fluxes showed an increasing trend linked with the feed temperature 15 3 28 0 and 53 3 kg m2h for 40 60 and 80 c respectively these results are consistent with other studies conducted with synthetic textile wastewater consisting of different dyes 22 41 this increment is referred to the increase of transmembrane vapor pressure which represents the driving force of vapor molecules to pass across the membrane dry pores and can be expressed by antoine s equation that describes the exponential behavior of the vapor pressure and temperature however the permeate fluxes were not stable with time in our experiments and the reduction rate depended on the inlet feed temperatures the highest flux decline of 71 2 from 53 3 to 15 3 kg m2h was observed for the highest feed temperature 80 c the lowest decline 26 1 was observed for the case of 40 c in the first 3 h of the experiment after that the flux remained relatively stable the flux decrease can be attributed to attractive interactions between membrane and dye molecules in the initial stage of dcmd the foulants that deposited inside the pores would reduce the turbulence of the solution inside the pores resulting in concentration polarization on the other hand the path length of vapor transport decreases which would lead to less resistance for vapor transport and an increase in the flux the former effect probably surpassed the latter one in time consequently the flux decreased fig 3 b shows the change of permeate flux under different flow rates 250 750 ml min compared to the feed temperature the flow rate had a less impact on the increase of permeate flux a slight flux enhancement 20 occurred when the flow rate was doubled from 250 to 500 ml min it is also worth mentioning that the flux improvement of 80 was recorded at 750 ml min re 3096 as is commonly known the increase in flow rate augments the water vapor flux independently of feed temperature 42 the increase in feed flow intensifies the turbulence in the module resulting in a reduction of the feed solution residence time in the membrane cell thus the effect of both temperature and concentration polarization at high reynolds numbers conditions due to the increased turbulence regime especially at higher feed temperature is reduced depending on the increase of heat transfer coefficient eventually a higher flux is achieved 22 43 the rate of flux decline was also lower at a higher flow rate due to the higher shear force that reduces the accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface the concentration of dye in wastewater is also another important factor affecting the process performance and that needs to be investigated for evaluating the md fouling 13 fig 3 c demonstrates the influence of varying dye concentrations 50 500 mg l in the feed solution on the permeate flux as shown in fig 3 c compared to other experiments the experiment performed with the dye concentration of 500 mg l presented a more decreasing flux trend starting from 350 min which can be explained by the formation of dense dye dye structure on the membrane surface where highest dye concentration deposited the relation between permeate flux and the dye concentration is dependent on the chemical characteristic of the dye and its interaction with the membrane surface cr used in this study is an azo dye and adsorbed to the membrane surface by its sulfonate group see fig 1 the latter can be engaged strongly with positively charged surfaces however the membrane used in this study is negatively charged this caused that the dye molecules were repelled by the membrane surface due to the electrostatic forces repulsive occurring at the membrane liquid interface thereby allowing that more vaporization occurred at this stage owing to the less fouled membrane surface and pores 44 this result explains the initial permeate flux increase depending on the increase of the dye concentration is consistent with the outcomes achieved with other dyes exposed to negatively charged membranes reported elsewhere 5 13 however this effect remained limited over time and flux reduction occurred with the formation of a fouling layer for all the membranes 3 2 long term dcmd experiment most of the dcmd operations reported in the literature aiming the treatment of textile wastewater were run for a short term period and this is believed to be inadequate to monitor the membrane fouling and to evaluate the process performance considering this apart from 24 h experiments a long term 3 days experiment with a conventional periodical cleaning water flush was carried out in this study to get insight into the potential of flux recovery fig 4 a considerable decline in the permeate flux was observed during the first 24 h cycle of the experiment fig 4a the main reason for this is most probably due to intermolecular interactions at the membrane liquid interface which led to partial pore occlusion or pore narrowing at the beginning of the operation the deposited or penetrated foulants at this stage also led to significant irreversible fouling then the formation of a cake layer is believed on the membrane surface over time but this caused mostly reversible fouling rather than irreversible fouling fig 4b after the first md cycle reversible fouling remained relatively stable whereas irreversible fouling showed a slight increase this result shows that the simple cleaning by water flushing in dcmd operation could achieve a partial removal of cake fouling only but not effective for the organic foulants deposited into the membrane pores furthermore permeate water sample taken after each md cycle was characterized and the results showed consistency with this hypothesis table s1 for example all cod results after the cycles were measured below 50 mg l 98 removal efficiency confirming that the passage of organics through the membrane remained limited on the other hand it is worth noting that ph reduced to 3 4 and conductivity increased to 148 9 μs cm after the third md cycle indicating the passage of acidic components from feed to permeate the reason for this deterioration in the permeate water could be explained by the membrane s low chemical resistance to the acidic components two alternative solutions have been proposed to overcome or control the md fouling caused by contaminants in textile wastewater 1 manufacturing membranes with improved surface properties self cleaning antifouling etc 2 developing efficient physical and or chemical cleaning methods 5 shirazi et al 4 developed a dual layer nanofibrous san4 hips membrane and reported that the fabricated membrane showed almost 100 color rejection but a significant flux decline due to the surface fouling with little pore wetting in another research to achieve effective fouling management dow et al 25 assessed the efficiency of different cleaning agents including di water hypochlorite and caustic the authors observed that the caustic cleaning provided the best fouling reversibility with a flux recovery of 79 however they stated that further optimization on the cleaning parameters such as concentration temperature and time is needed it is also worth mentioning that membrane characteristics play an important role in the accumulation of foulants on the membrane occurring with different mechanisms such as attractive hydrophobic interactions between organic components and membrane 45 it has been reported that alkaline solutions such as naoh are effective in removing organic fouling while diluted acidic solutions such as acetic acid are able to eliminate inorganic fouling 45 therefore a specific cleaning method needs to be developed to control or mitigate md fouling considering the characteristic of textile wastewater that contains both organic and inorganic contaminants considering the overall outcomes it can be concluded that in any case membrane cleaning should be done with more frequent intervals for a successful long term md operation thus more research on optimization of the cleaning methods is still needed to control or mitigate the membrane fouling 3 3 characterization of the fouled membranes 3 3 1 real time oct monitoring fig 5 presents 2d cross section images of the membrane taken by oct with time series during the dcmd operation as shown in the oct scans in the early stage no fouling was observed on the membrane surface although a rapid decline in the flux occurred see fig 3 this could be ascribed to intermolecular adhesion forces occurring at the membrane liquid interface after 12 h of dcmd operation a thin fouling layer with a flat surface formed on the membrane it is worth mentioning that the development of the cake layer with time is associated with a gradual decrease of the permeate flux hence an increase in the fouling thickness resulted in a further reduction in flux the flux reduction that occurred owing to the fouling layer evolution can be ascribed to the escalation of the effect of temperature polarization resulting in more heat transfer loss occurring at the thermal boundary layer furthermore the reduction in flux would alleviate the concentration polarization effect leading to getting more stable flux as observed by our data fouling thickness at the end of the 24 h experiment reached an estimated value of 135 μm 3d rendered structures and pictures of cake layers acquired after the experiments carried out at feed temperatures varying between 40 and 80 c are given in fig 6 fouling thickness at 40 c was not detected by oct scans which might be imputed to the limitation of the oct resolution threshold 4 5 μm 38 the photo of the membrane taken for the experiment of 40 c also confirms the little accumulation of foulants comparing to that of all membranes besides the fouling cake thickness at 60 and 80 c was 125 μm and 350 μm respectively this substantial difference in fouling thickness is associated with the intensification of water vapor transfer at higher feed temperatures causing the membrane more exposure to the foulants thereby resulting in severe membrane fouling this result is in agreement with our previous study focussing on the membrane scaling phenomenon in dcmd 46 another set of oct screening was conducted at various flow rates ranging from 250 to 750 ml min fig 7 the average values of fouling thickness estimated for the 250 500 and 750 ml min of 24 h experiments were 180 μm 125 μm 120 μm respectively this result confirms that the increase in flow rate to a certain extent could alleviate the fouling development on the membrane due to shear stress incurred in addition the flow rate contributed to the compression of the foulants on the membrane which led to a flat and homogeneous fouling layer formation dye concentration in the feed solution also influenced the fouling development with differences in fouling thicknesses of 115 μm 165 μm and 135 μm were observed for the 50 250 and 500 mg l dye concentrations respectively fig 8 it was expected that the fouling would enhance with increasing the dye concentration in the feed however in our study a lower thickness was obtained for the experiment of 500 mg l compared to that of 250 mg l which can be attributed to the detachment of formed flakes over time due to exceeding the deposition limit on the membrane it is also important to mention that there is a fouling gradient over the length of the membranes observed from the photos taken for each experimental condition which could play a key role in the temperature polarization as well as water vapor transfer 2d cross sectional oct scans were taken after each 24 h filtration cycle of the long term experiment fig s1 it can be seen that the cake layer visuals taken after each filtration cycle are almost similar but less cake fouling in the first cycle since the foulants first tend to penetrate and accumulate into the membrane pores which confirms the occurrence of irreversible fouling discussed in the previous sections during the cleaning steps by water flushing the detachment of the cake layer refers to reversible fouling from the membrane by expanding the flake type foulants over time was observed fig s2 this result is in agreement with observations reported in the literature on backwashing practices for the purpose of membrane cleaning 47 48 the cleaning process resulted in a partial detachment of the fouling layer expanding the particles on the membrane as shown in the oct image taken after the cleaning process fig s3 which again confirms the occurrence of irreversible fouling followed by partial pore blocking leading to severe flux decline 3 3 2 the functional groups of the foulants the chemical characteristics of organic foulants accumulated on the membrane surface can be examined by identifying functional groups of the foulants using atr ftir spectroscopy 49 fig 9 demonstrates the ftir spectra of the clean and fouled membranes although the membranes used in the experiments showed the same transmittance peaks they demonstrated several different transmittance peaks compared to the pristine membrane detecting at 1000 1115 1431 1645 2925 and 3290 cm 1 indicating the foulants attachment on the membrane surface the peak at 1000 cm 1 indicates the cc bending of alkene while the peak at 1115 cm 1 denotes co stretching of a secondary alcohol the observed band at 1431 cm 1 refers to the bending vibration of ch2 50 the peak at 1645 cm 1 represents cc stretching of alkene 51 whereas the band at 2925 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching of ch alkene bond 52 the final peak at 3290 cm 1 corresponds to oh stretching of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups 53 is attributed to the attachment of cr dye 54 the difference in the spectra of the fouled membrane may be attributed to the existence of hydrophobic interactions that led to the adsorption of the pollutants 55 56 the cr dye used in the study has hydrophobic nature which could have promoted the formation of dye dye structure on the membrane surface as well accordingly hydrophobic adsorptive interactions probably prevailed the repulsive forces with time and led to the development of the fouling layer on the membrane in fact this result is also directly related to the characteristic of membrane material such as hydrophobicity zeta potential which plays role in interaction with the pollutants in the feed water for example it has been reported that ptfe membranes are less prone to fouling than pvdf membranes due to their higher negative zeta potentials that lead to the formation of strong repulsive forces against the negatively charged molecules 13 3 3 3 hydrophobicity hydrophilicity analysis membrane hydrophobicity plays a key role in ensuring a sustainable water vapor permeability in md as the hydrophobic membrane presents a barrier for the liquid phase and only allows the passage of vapor molecules 57 however the hydrophobicity is impaired with the formation of fouling scaling on the membrane surface and its pores leading to membrane wetting or flux reduction 15 contact angle ca measurement according to the sessile drop technique was applied for the new membrane and the fouled membranes used in all experiments to evaluate the membrane hydrophobicity changes caused by fouling in this study the ca values for the fouled membranes were found almost similar therefore an average value with standard error se representing the fouled membranes is reported fig 10 shows the change of ca between clean and fouled membranes the hydrophobicity of membrane was observed to be significantly varied after 24 h md operation reducing from 135 5 pristine membrane to 58 47 2 6 fouled membrane which corresponds to a hydrophobicity loss of around 57 this loss is attributed to the complex composition of the formed cake layer dye dye structure aggregate that totally changes the membrane surface texture is highly associated with the characteristic of the feed solution it is known that the existence of organic compounds in textile effluent is the primary factor affecting the surface properties of the membrane such as hydrophobicity 23 also laqbaqbi et al 22 reported that the hydrophobicity is altered depending on the type of dye in the solution other studies indicated that the hydrophobic interaction of reactive dyes is higher due to the repulsive interaction between their anionic groups and the negatively charged membrane compared to disperse dyes have no charge 41 58 this finding suggests that the surface charge of the membrane is another factor that needs to be considered in md operation a study by an et al 13 is consistent with this hypothesis proved that the ptfe membrane shows better performance with lower wettability thanks to its higher zeta potential along with higher hydrophobicity and small pore size compared to the pvdf membrane it is worth noting that high improvement in water quality parameters of permeate is achieved in all experiments fig s4 table s1 and s2 a slight conductivity increase in permeate water was observed only after the third cycle of the long term experiment thus complete pore wetting did not occur in this investigation 4 conclusions this work rendered a comprehensive analysis of the fouling formation caused by textile wastewater during dcmd operation the effects of major determinants affecting the system performance such as feed temperature flow rate and dye concentration on membrane fouling were investigated by using oct imaging technique and following different analytical methods also the applicability of dcmd with periodical water flushing for the long term application was evaluated based on the fouling reversibility the main findings obtained from the study are as follows 1 the water vapor transfer was promoted by the increase of the feed temperature and flow rate increasing permeate flux as expected dye concentration in the feed incited the repulsive force between the feed and membrane owing to the physicochemical interaction thus influenced the permeate flux the fluxes generally were not stable during the dcmd and showed different decreasing trends depending on the operational conditions over time 2 the textile wastewater caused both reversible and irreversible fouling during long term dcmd with irreversible fouling being dominant compared to reversible fouling water flushing provided a partial detachment of the cake layer but was not efficient for the removal of foulants deposited into the pores 3 in situ oct monitoring allowed the assessment of membrane fouling in real time demonstrating the mechanisms of operating parameters affecting the dcmd performance thanks to the 2d cross sectional and 3d scans it was possible to evaluate the changes in the characteristics of fouling layers no cake fouling was detected at the initial phase corresponding to the rapid decrease of permeate flux which could be attributed to the occurrence of intermolecular interactions 4 a notable decrease was observed in the hydrophobicity of the fouled membrane probably due to the interaction of organics with the membrane but no complete pore wetting was observed 99 9 color rejection during all the experiments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

13409,understanding the factors that specify the fouling development in membrane distillation md plays a key role to develop effective control strategies with the aim of providing its widespread use in industrial applications such as textile industry the present study investigated the fouling mechanisms in textile wastewater treatment by direct contact md dcmd employing an advanced in situ optical coherence tomography oct technology allowing to monitor md fouling in real time the oct analysis enabled evaluating the effect of feed temperature flow rate dye concentration on the membrane fouling and the long term performance of md operation that includes a periodical water flushing the permeate flux decrease during the initial stages of experiments was attributed to the existence of attractive hydrophobic hydrophobic interaction between the membrane and dye molecules as no cake fouling was observed at the early stages then a flat and homogeneous cake layer was developed with time in all the fouled membranes regardless of the cake layer thickness the long term experiment resulted in both reversible and irreversible fouling and showed that water flushing had limited efficacy against reversible fouling additionally electrostatic repulsive forces occurring between the membrane and textile dye molecules influenced the permeate flux depending on the dye concentration finally among all the operating parameters feed temperature had the highest impact on the membrane fouling and process performance changed the heat transfer activity at the membrane liquid frontier zone in turn leading to variations in the flux graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords direct contact membrane distillation dcmd textile effluent treatment fouling analysis in situ fouling monitoring optical coherence tomography oct 1 introduction the textile industry is one of the most water consuming industries worldwide producing large amounts of wastewater in almost all stages of its manufacturing process 1 2 the water consumption estimated is approximately 300 t for the production of 1 t of textile products 3 produced wastewater from the manufacturing process has a complex composition containing miscellaneous textile dyes inorganic salts heavy metals organics and other pollutants and is categorized into highly harmful effluents to human health and the aquatic environment 4 one potential route with a successful water management strategy to save water sources and to reduce the detrimental impacts of discharging wastewater into water bodies can be the recycling and reuse of the wastewater by utilizing sustainable and cost effective water treatment technology 5 6 membrane distillation md a potentially promising thermal membrane separation process 7 has gained great attention over the last decade due to its unique advantages 8 including relatively lower feed temperatures than conventional thermal treatment units lower operating pressures than pressure driven membrane processes low fouling propensity high water recovery and excellent rejection rate for the pollutants 9 10 md applies a microporous hydrophobic membrane to serve as a barrier between two streams namely hot feed and cold distillate in which a thermally driven force is created in order to enable vapor molecules to pass from the feed side to the other side through the membrane pores 11 md holds two substantial motivations encouraging its use in the applications of textile wastewater treatment 12 first it is able to harness low grade waste heat already available in textile wastewater without an additional heat source need since the wastewater is evacuated from the process with a temperature range of 80 100 c 13 this enables the md to be cost effective by reducing operating costs with lower energy consumption second besides the large amounts of water reclamation with a successful zero liquid discharge approach the dye can be recovered from the wastewater which is also economically desirable for the textile manufacturing companies 14 the dye is a non volatile compound and can be easily separated from the feed solution theoretically up to 100 via md 3 although the md has many key advantages in the treatment of textile wastewater membrane fouling remains a big challenge hindering its widespread application 15 fouling in md leads to an increase in energy consumption a decrease in md flux and reduces membrane lifetime 16 18 the inorganic and organic compounds in textile wastewater interact with each other and then transform into complex colloidal particles and suspended solids 19 the mechanisms of md fouling are explained by the interfacial interactivities between the membrane surface and these compounds 13 since the wastewater has a complex composition its physicochemical interactions with the membrane surface are considered as complicated for multiple reasons such as dispersion and dipole forces and hydrogen bonding moreover the repulsive force between the membrane and the textile wastewater is believed highly associated with membrane hydrophobicity and increases with a higher hydrophobic surface 20 the dyes in textile wastewater contain positively or negatively charged groups that are associated with the type of physicochemical interactions 21 laqbaqbi et al 22 introduced that negatively charged dyes in the wastewater show a lower penetration tendency into the membrane pores because of their repulsive effects against the membrane developing a cake layer composed of flake type dye structure on the active membrane surface area furthermore the authors also stated that dipole dipole interactions between electron releasing nitrogen atoms of dyes enable easily attachment of dye particles on the surface of membrane and into the pores 22 in another study an et al 13 stated that positively charged dyes have a higher fouling and wetting propensity through the membrane foulants interaction the authors concluded that flake type foulants deposited to the surface of membrane can be easily eliminated with water flushing 13 the md fouling caused by textile wastewater has so far been investigated by conventional methods including monitoring flux behavior during md and measuring the water quality on the permeate side 23 25 however these methods are only used as an indicator to predict the occurrence of fouling do not provide information on fouling characterization besides these invasive analytical techniques such as scanning electron microscope sem and atomic force microscope afm have been adopted to investigate fouling mechanisms are used to assess the foulants deposited on the membrane surface after the experiment 20 26 for example laqbaqbi et al 22 performed sem and afm analyses to evaluate the fouling mechanisms in a md unit fed with a simulated textile wastewater solution containing different dyes however these destructive techniques are applied ex situ by taking out the membrane sample from the cell and after the membrane is dried in addition md is a temperature dependent process in which the temperature of feed solution during operation influences the membrane fouling formation thus the fouling structure would be changed when the membrane sample is disassembled from the module 27 the aforementioned techniques do not give much insight into the membrane fouling as they are not able to link between the fouling development and the system performance decrease hence understanding the fouling mechanisms and membrane foulants interactions in md remains a challenge 22 considering the complexity of fouling in md caused by textile wastewater the use of a real time monitoring technique is essential in order to better understand the fouling characteristics as well as interactions at the membrane water interface an in situ visualization technique namely optical coherence tomography oct has been successfully employed recently for the assessment of fouling development in md systems fed with various wastewater quality 28 29 which could also be a suitable method to monitor the md fouling caused by textile wastewater the novelty of this study lies in the comprehensive in situ non destructive real time image analysis of md fouling by oct technology the oct scans enabled a better understanding of fouling mechanisms in md experiments conducted under different operational conditions with providing quantitative fouling thickness and qualitative fouling morphology findings the aim of this study is to investigate the fouling behaviors by a real time monitoring technique in a direct contact md dcmd system operated with textile wastewater as feed solution oct was used for the non destructive and real time monitoring of fouling development on the membrane surface previous studies have shown the capability of oct in analyzing and characterizing membrane bio fouling and scaling for different applications 18 30 the comprehensive examination of fouling formation was performed by investigating the effect of crucial operating parameters such as feed temperature flow rate and dye concentration in addition a long term 3 days experiment combined with a conventional membrane cleaning was carried out to evaluate the fouling reversibility and the dcmd performance after the experiments the fouled membranes were characterized by using attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared atr ftir spectroscopy and contact angle device we believe that the outcomes of this study provide insights into md fouling mechanisms in treating textile wastewater by md and thus will be helpful for future industrial scale applications of md technology 2 materials and methods 2 1 textile wastewater the feed water of the dcmd system was a model textile

3 1 dcmd test unit a schematic description of the dcmd setup used for textile wastewater treatment is presented in fig 2 the md experiments were carried out using a customized acrylic dcmd module with the dimensions of 6 0 cm length and 1 5 cm width corresponding to a total membrane area of 9 cm2 the laboratory scale dcmd module was designed with a slot at the top side of module in order to online monitor the fouling development the flow rate of feed and permeate sides was constant and two gear pumps l 72 211 70 cole parmer maintained the continuous circulation in a counter current flow mode feed water temperature was kept constant at the desired temperature with an accuracy of 1 c using a heating plate c mag hs7 ika endowed with a contact thermometer ets d5 ika while the temperature of distillate was maintained at 20 1 c using a cooling system f32 he julabo equipped with a coil heat exchanger a data acquisition system 34970a keysight connected to temperature sensors placed at feed and permeate channels was used to record and control the temperatures of both streams the water conductivity on the permeate side was frequently measured using a conductivity meter wtw cond 3310 to control the membrane wetting the amount of distilled water accumulated in the permeate container was measured using an electronic scale ml3002 mettler toledo and the measurements were continuously recorded to a computer with 10 min intervals through a data logger system national instruments labview the water vapor flux j in kg m2h was determined by eq 1 1 j w t a where w is the weight of the distillate collected t is the time of the distillate collection and a is the active membrane area 2 3 2 operating conditions the feed temperature and flow rate effects on md fouling were investigated at 40 80 c feed water temperatures and 250 750 ml min flow rates each single md experiment was started with a textile wastewater of 1 l at the feed and a distilled water of 1 l at the permeate and was conducted in concentrating mode for an operational duration of 24 h after each experiment the used membrane coupon was taken out of the dcmd module and stored at room temperature for further analyses then the long term 3 days operating performance of dcmd for textile wastewater treatment was evaluated by employing a conventional membrane cleaning method water flushing during the cleaning the membrane was washed by circulating distilled water through the feed pipeline with 750 ml min flow rate for 15 min this experiment had 3 filtration cycles with a duration of 24 h for each cycle and the cleaning was carried out after the cycles the feed water was renewed with 1 l solution after each 24 h cycle and the membrane coupon was removed at the end of the experiment the reversible rf and irreversible irf fouling ratios were calculated by eqs 2 4 2 if n j 0 j n j 0 3 tf n j 0 j x n j 0 4 rf n tf n if n the normalized fluxes at the beginning of each filtration cycle after each membrane cleaning and at the end of each filtration cycle are referred as j 0 j n and j x n respectively with the number n 1 3 representing the cycle number 2 3 3 feedwater characterization color and chemical oxygen demand cod of the wastewater samples were determined by a uv vis spectrophotometer dr 5000 hach the amount of total suspended solids tss were determined by the apha 2540 d standard method tss dried at 103 105 c the conductivity values of the solutions was measured with a portable wtw cond 3310 conductivity meter the turbidity and ph of the wastewater was measured by using a 2100an hach turbidimeter and a cyberscan 6000 ph meter 2 3 4 fouling analysis 2 3 4 1 oct imaging the oct imaging technique has been recently used in situ non invasively to investigate fouling formation during the operation of membrane filtration systems 35 37 the oct uses backscattered light captured by a camera providing continuous non destructive 2d cross sectional or 3d imaging of the membrane area thus enables a successful tracking of the fouling evolution depending on time 2d imaging is usually preferred to depict time dependent cake layer formation as it allows clear and quick visual evaluation whereas 3d imaging is used to introduce a comprehensive view of the surface topography of the fouled membrane in this study in situ non invasive scanning of the fouling was carried out by a spectral domain optical coherence tomography sd oct device ganymede ii thorlabs gmbh at a center wavelength of 930 nm the oct device equipped with a 5 telecentric scan lens thorlabs lsm 03bb provided cross sectional 2d and three dimensional 3d scans taken from a fixed location on the membrane owing to the oct probe placed on the dcmd module the oct scans were acquired with the parameters of a resolution of 1000 1000 400 pixels and an area of 4 0 mm 4 0 mm 1 4 mm width length depth 2d cross sectional and 3d scans were processed by fiji imagej national institute of health usa and avizo field electron and ion company hillsboro or usa software respectively the images were modified by adjusting brightness and contrast and then cropped for visualization purposes the thickness of fouling layers was estimated using a custom code written in matlab the procedure for the calculation is reported elsewhere 35 38 2 3 4 2 identification of the functional groups of the foulants to determine the functional groups of the foulants accumulated on the membrane surface fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were collected in attenuated total reflection atr technique by a perkinelmer spectrum 100 ftir system 39 each spectral measurement was acquired by 32 scans in the range of 4000 400 cm 1 at a resolution of 1 cm 1 background correction was performed under the condition of ambient air before starting the measurement the atr sensor was cleaned with hexane prior to each analysis the data were obtained using ftir spectrometer software spectrum 10 installed on a computer 2 3 4 3 hydrophobicity hydrophilicity analysis of the fouled membranes the surface hydrophobicity change of the membranes was evaluated with the water contact angle ca analysis conducted using an optical tensiometer tl 100 attension 40 the ca measurement was performed with the sessile drop method and acquired through the device software oneattension the membrane specimens were first kept at ambient temperature to be dried cut to the proper sizes and then mounted on a smooth glass plate a water droplet of 5 μl was gently put on the membrane surface using an automatic syringe injector equipped with a metal needle and the ca was taken when the angle reached a steady state the analysis for each membrane was repeated three times with the samples extracted from different parts of the membrane to achieve reproducibility and the result was reported as an average value standard deviation 3 results and discussion 3 1 effect of operating parameters on dcmd flux fig 3 a exhibits the effect of different feed temperatures 40 80 c on the permeate flux depending on time it was observed that the permeate flux was significantly influenced by the feed temperature at the beginning of the experiments the initial permeate fluxes showed an increasing trend linked with the feed temperature 15 3 28 0 and 53 3 kg m2h for 40 60 and 80 c respectively these results are consistent with other studies conducted with synthetic textile wastewater consisting of different dyes 22 41 this increment is referred to the increase of transmembrane vapor pressure which represents the driving force of vapor molecules to pass across the membrane dry pores and can be expressed by antoine s equation that describes the exponential behavior of the vapor pressure and temperature however the permeate fluxes were not stable with time in our experiments and the reduction rate depended on the inlet feed temperatures the highest flux decline of 71 2 from 53 3 to 15 3 kg m2h was observed for the highest feed temperature 80 c the lowest decline 26 1 was observed for the case of 40 c in the first 3 h of the experiment after that the flux remained relatively stable the flux decrease can be attributed to attractive interactions between membrane and dye molecules in the initial stage of dcmd the foulants that deposited inside the pores would reduce the turbulence of the solution inside the pores resulting in concentration polarization on the other hand the path length of vapor transport decreases which would lead to less resistance for vapor transport and an increase in the flux the former effect probably surpassed the latter one in time consequently the flux decreased fig 3 b shows the change of permeate flux under different flow rates 250 750 ml min compared to the feed temperature the flow rate had a less impact on the increase of permeate flux a slight flux enhancement 20 occurred when the flow rate was doubled from 250 to 500 ml min it is also worth mentioning that the flux improvement of 80 was recorded at 750 ml min re 3096 as is commonly known the increase in flow rate augments the water vapor flux independently of feed temperature 42 the increase in feed flow intensifies the turbulence in the module resulting in a reduction of the feed solution residence time in the membrane cell thus the effect of both temperature and concentration polarization at high reynolds numbers conditions due to the increased turbulence regime especially at higher feed temperature is reduced depending on the increase of heat transfer coefficient eventually a higher flux is achieved 22 43 the rate of flux decline was also lower at a higher flow rate due to the higher shear force that reduces the accumulation of foulants on the membrane surface the concentration of dye in wastewater is also another important factor affecting the process performance and that needs to be investigated for evaluating the md fouling 13 fig 3 c demonstrates the influence of varying dye concentrations 50 500 mg l in the feed solution on the permeate flux as shown in fig 3 c compared to other experiments the experiment performed with the dye concentration of 500 mg l presented a more decreasing flux trend starting from 350 min which can be explained by the formation of dense dye dye structure on the membrane surface where highest dye concentration deposited the relation between permeate flux and the dye concentration is dependent on the chemical characteristic of the dye and its interaction with the membrane surface cr used in this study is an azo dye and adsorbed to the membrane surface by its sulfonate group see fig 1 the latter can be engaged strongly with positively charged surfaces however the membrane used in this study is negatively charged this caused that the dye molecules were repelled by the membrane surface due to the electrostatic forces repulsive occurring at the membrane liquid interface thereby allowing that more vaporization occurred at this stage owing to the less fouled membrane surface and pores 44 this result explains the initial permeate flux increase depending on the increase of the dye concentration is consistent with the outcomes achieved with other dyes exposed to negatively charged membranes reported elsewhere 5 13 however this effect remained limited over time and flux reduction occurred with the formation of a fouling layer for all the membranes 3 2 long term dcmd experiment most of the dcmd operations reported in the literature aiming the treatment of textile wastewater were run for a short term period and this is believed to be inadequate to monitor the membrane fouling and to evaluate the process performance considering this apart from 24 h experiments a long term 3 days experiment with a conventional periodical cleaning water flush was carried out in this study to get insight into the potential of flux recovery fig 4 a considerable decline in the permeate flux was observed during the first 24 h cycle of the experiment fig 4a the main reason for this is most probably due to intermolecular interactions at the membrane liquid interface which led to partial pore occlusion or pore narrowing at the beginning of the operation the deposited or penetrated foulants at this stage also led to significant irreversible fouling then the formation of a cake layer is believed on the membrane surface over time but this caused mostly reversible fouling rather than irreversible fouling fig 4b after the first md cycle reversible fouling remained relatively stable whereas irreversible fouling showed a slight increase this result shows that the simple cleaning by water flushing in dcmd operation could achieve a partial removal of cake fouling only but not effective for the organic foulants deposited into the membrane pores furthermore permeate water sample taken after each md cycle was characterized and the results showed consistency with this hypothesis table s1 for example all cod results after the cycles were measured below 50 mg l 98 removal efficiency confirming that the passage of organics through the membrane remained limited on the other hand it is worth noting that ph reduced to 3 4 and conductivity increased to 148 9 μs cm after the third md cycle indicating the passage of acidic components from feed to permeate the reason for this deterioration in the permeate water could be explained by the membrane s low chemical resistance to the acidic components two alternative solutions have been proposed to overcome or control the md fouling caused by contaminants in textile wastewater 1 manufacturing membranes with improved surface properties self cleaning antifouling etc 2 developing efficient physical and or chemical cleaning methods 5 shirazi et al 4 developed a dual layer nanofibrous san4 hips membrane and reported that the fabricated membrane showed almost 100 color rejection but a significant flux decline due to the surface fouling with little pore wetting in another research to achieve effective fouling management dow et al 25 assessed the efficiency of different cleaning agents including di water hypochlorite and caustic the authors observed that the caustic cleaning provided the best fouling reversibility with a flux recovery of 79 however they stated that further optimization on the cleaning parameters such as concentration temperature and time is needed it is also worth mentioning that membrane characteristics play an important role in the accumulation of foulants on the membrane occurring with different mechanisms such as attractive hydrophobic interactions between organic components and membrane 45 it has been reported that alkaline solutions such as naoh are effective in removing organic fouling while diluted acidic solutions such as acetic acid are able to eliminate inorganic fouling 45 therefore a specific cleaning method needs to be developed to control or mitigate md fouling considering the characteristic of textile wastewater that contains both organic and inorganic contaminants considering the overall outcomes it can be concluded that in any case membrane cleaning should be done with more frequent intervals for a successful long term md operation thus more research on optimization of the cleaning methods is still needed to control or mitigate the membrane fouling 3 3 characterization of the fouled membranes 3 3 1 real time oct monitoring fig 5 presents 2d cross section images of the membrane taken by oct with time series during the dcmd operation as shown in the oct scans in the early stage no fouling was observed on the membrane surface although a rapid decline in the flux occurred see fig 3 this could be ascribed to intermolecular adhesion forces occurring at the membrane liquid interface after 12 h of dcmd operation a thin fouling layer with a flat surface formed on the membrane it is worth mentioning that the development of the cake layer with time is associated with a gradual decrease of the permeate flux hence an increase in the fouling thickness resulted in a further reduction in flux the flux reduction that occurred owing to the fouling layer evolution can be ascribed to the escalation of the effect of temperature polarization resulting in more heat transfer loss occurring at the thermal boundary layer furthermore the reduction in flux would alleviate the concentration polarization effect leading to getting more stable flux as observed by our data fouling thickness at the end of the 24 h experiment reached an estimated value of 135 μm 3d rendered structures and pictures of cake layers acquired after the experiments carried out at feed temperatures varying between 40 and 80 c are given in fig 6 fouling thickness at 40 c was not detected by oct scans which might be imputed to the limitation of the oct resolution threshold 4 5 μm 38 the photo of the membrane taken for the experiment of 40 c also confirms the little accumulation of foulants comparing to that of all membranes besides the fouling cake thickness at 60 and 80 c was 125 μm and 350 μm respectively this substantial difference in fouling thickness is associated with the intensification of water vapor transfer at higher feed temperatures causing the membrane more exposure to the foulants thereby resulting in severe membrane fouling this result is in agreement with our previous study focussing on the membrane scaling phenomenon in dcmd 46 another set of oct screening was conducted at various flow rates ranging from 250 to 750 ml min fig 7 the average values of fouling thickness estimated for the 250 500 and 750 ml min of 24 h experiments were 180 μm 125 μm 120 μm respectively this result confirms that the increase in flow rate to a certain extent could alleviate the fouling development on the membrane due to shear stress incurred in addition the flow rate contributed to the compression of the foulants on the membrane which led to a flat and homogeneous fouling layer formation dye concentration in the feed solution also influenced the fouling development with differences in fouling thicknesses of 115 μm 165 μm and 135 μm were observed for the 50 250 and 500 mg l dye concentrations respectively fig 8 it was expected that the fouling would enhance with increasing the dye concentration in the feed however in our study a lower thickness was obtained for the experiment of 500 mg l compared to that of 250 mg l which can be attributed to the detachment of formed flakes over time due to exceeding the deposition limit on the membrane it is also important to mention that there is a fouling gradient over the length of the membranes observed from the photos taken for each experimental condition which could play a key role in the temperature polarization as well as water vapor transfer 2d cross sectional oct scans were taken after each 24 h filtration cycle of the long term experiment fig s1 it can be seen that the cake layer visuals taken after each filtration cycle are almost similar but less cake fouling in the first cycle since the foulants first tend to penetrate and accumulate into the membrane pores which confirms the occurrence of irreversible fouling discussed in the previous sections during the cleaning steps by water flushing the detachment of the cake layer refers to reversible fouling from the membrane by expanding the flake type foulants over time was observed fig s2 this result is in agreement with observations reported in the literature on backwashing practices for the purpose of membrane cleaning 47 48 the cleaning process resulted in a partial detachment of the fouling layer expanding the particles on the membrane as shown in the oct image taken after the cleaning process fig s3 which again confirms the occurrence of irreversible fouling followed by partial pore blocking leading to severe flux decline 3 3 2 the functional groups of the foulants the chemical characteristics of organic foulants accumulated on the membrane surface can be examined by identifying functional groups of the foulants using atr ftir spectroscopy 49 fig 9 demonstrates the ftir spectra of the clean and fouled membranes although the membranes used in the experiments showed the same transmittance peaks they demonstrated several different transmittance peaks compared to the pristine membrane detecting at 1000 1115 1431 1645 2925 and 3290 cm 1 indicating the foulants attachment on the membrane surface the peak at 1000 cm 1 indicates the cc bending of alkene while the peak at 1115 cm 1 denotes co stretching of a secondary alcohol the observed band at 1431 cm 1 refers to the bending vibration of ch2 50 the peak at 1645 cm 1 represents cc stretching of alkene 51 whereas the band at 2925 cm 1 is attributed to the stretching of ch alkene bond 52 the final peak at 3290 cm 1 corresponds to oh stretching of hydrogen bonded hydroxyl groups 53 is attributed to the attachment of cr dye 54 the difference in the spectra of the fouled membrane may be attributed to the existence of hydrophobic interactions that led to the adsorption of the pollutants 55 56 the cr dye used in the study has hydrophobic nature which could have promoted the formation of dye dye structure on the membrane surface as well accordingly hydrophobic adsorptive interactions probably prevailed the repulsive forces with time and led to the development of the fouling layer on the membrane in fact this result is also directly related to the characteristic of membrane material such as hydrophobicity zeta potential which plays role in interaction with the pollutants in the feed water for example it has been reported that ptfe membranes are less prone to fouling than pvdf membranes due to their higher negative zeta potentials that lead to the formation of strong repulsive forces against the negatively charged molecules 13 3 3 3 hydrophobicity hydrophilicity analysis membrane hydrophobicity plays a key role in ensuring a sustainable water vapor permeability in md as the hydrophobic membrane presents a barrier for the liquid phase and only allows the passage of vapor molecules 57 however the hydrophobicity is impaired with the formation of fouling scaling on the membrane surface and its pores leading to membrane wetting or flux reduction 15 contact angle ca measurement according to the sessile drop technique was applied for the new membrane and the fouled membranes used in all experiments to evaluate the membrane hydrophobicity changes caused by fouling in this study the ca values for the fouled membranes were found almost similar therefore an average value with standard error se representing the fouled membranes is reported fig 10 shows the change of ca between clean and fouled membranes the hydrophobicity of membrane was observed to be significantly varied after 24 h md operation reducing from 135 5 pristine membrane to 58 47 2 6 fouled membrane which corresponds to a hydrophobicity loss of around 57 this loss is attributed to the complex composition of the formed cake layer dye dye structure aggregate that totally changes the membrane surface texture is highly associated with the characteristic of the feed solution it is known that the existence of organic compounds in textile effluent is the primary factor affecting the surface properties of the membrane such as hydrophobicity 23 also laqbaqbi et al 22 reported that the hydrophobicity is altered depending on the type of dye in the solution other studies indicated that the hydrophobic interaction of reactive dyes is higher due to the repulsive interaction between their anionic groups and the negatively charged membrane compared to disperse dyes have no charge 41 58 this finding suggests that the surface charge of the membrane is another factor that needs to be considered in md operation a study by an et al 13 is consistent with this hypothesis proved that the ptfe membrane shows better performance with lower wettability thanks to its higher zeta potential along with higher hydrophobicity and small pore size compared to the pvdf membrane it is worth noting that high improvement in water quality parameters of permeate is achieved in all experiments fig s4 table s1 and s2 a slight conductivity increase in permeate water was observed only after the third cycle of the long term experiment thus complete pore wetting did not occur in this investigation 4 conclusions this work rendered a comprehensive analysis of the fouling formation caused by textile wastewater during dcmd operation the effects of major determinants affecting the system performance such as feed temperature flow rate and dye concentration on membrane fouling were investigated by using oct imaging technique and following different analytical methods also the applicability of dcmd with periodical water flushing for the long term application was evaluated based on the fouling reversibility the main findings obtained from the study are as follows 1 the water vapor transfer was promoted by the increase of the feed temperature and flow rate increasing permeate flux as expected dye concentration in the feed incited the repulsive force between the feed and membrane owing to the physicochemical interaction thus influenced the permeate flux the fluxes generally were not stable during the dcmd and showed different decreasing trends depending on the operational conditions over time 2 the textile wastewater caused both reversible and irreversible fouling during long term dcmd with irreversible fouling being dominant compared to reversible fouling water flushing provided a partial detachment of the cake layer but was not efficient for the removal of foulants deposited into the pores 3 in situ oct monitoring allowed the assessment of membrane fouling in real time demonstrating the mechanisms of operating parameters affecting the dcmd performance thanks to the 2d cross sectional and 3d scans it was possible to evaluate the changes in the characteristics of fouling layers no cake fouling was detected at the initial phase corresponding to the rapid decrease of permeate flux which could be attributed to the occurrence of intermolecular interactions 4 a notable decrease was observed in the hydrophobicity of the fouled membrane probably due to the interaction of organics with the membrane but no complete pore wetting was observed 99 9 color rejection during all the experiments declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or
