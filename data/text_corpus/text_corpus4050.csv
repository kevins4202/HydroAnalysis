20250,this paper presents a series of 1g tests to investigate the performance of an innovative light weight gravity installed plate anchor l gipla with the aid of a reusable booster both in normally consolidated nc and lightly over consolidated loc soils a micro electromechanical systems mems accelerometer was used to measure the dynamic penetration process of the l gipla with a booster in clay various factors affecting the final penetration depth of the anchor were investigated including the soil strength characterisation impact velocity anchor shape booster weight and water entrainment effects based on the data obtained from the mems accelerometer the hydrodynamic aspects associated with the water drag force and water entrainment effect during the dynamic penetration of the l gipla were analysed besides theoretical framework and energy based models were proposed to predict the final penetration depth of the l gipla the excess pore water pressure induced by the dynamic penetration of the l gipla and the subsequent dissipation around the anchor were investigated hence the affected regions of the soil due to the dynamic penetration could be estimated finally the

adventured into deeper waters with harsher environments due to the gradual depletion of oil gas fields in shallow waters which leads to a shift in the basic form of offshore platforms from fixed platforms to floating platforms except for offshore oil gas industry floating systems are also widely used for mooring offshore wind turbines floating net cages and wave and tidal energy converters the floating structure is held in position by mooring systems and anchoring foundations a variety of anchor types has been developed to adapt to deepwater environments including suction caissons fines et al 1991 drag installed anchors vryhof anchors 2005 suction embedded plate anchors sepla dove et al 1998 and gravity installed anchors gias lieng et al 1999 medeiros 2001 shelton 2007 among these anchors the gia is attractive due to its cost effective and time efficient properties in the process of dynamic installation shelton et al 2011 torpedo anchors and omni max anchors fig 1 are two types of gias widely used in offshore engineering the torpedo anchor is usually comprised with a cylindrical shaft and four rear fins while the omni max anchor is a plate shaped anchor comprising of three discontinuous flukes and an adjustable loading arm shelton 2007 a typical torpedo anchor t98 is 98 t in weight and an omni max anchor is usually 38 t the final penetration depth of the torpedo anchor within the seabed is relatively high resulted from the large weight and simple geometry compared with that of the omni max anchor liu et al 2016a however the padeye of the torpedo anchor is located at the top of the cylindrical shaft and the holding capacity is primarily provided by the frictional resistance at the soil anchor interface and the anchor self weight for the omni max anchor the padeye is located at the upper side of the loading arm hence the anchor is rotated within the soil when subject to uplift loading the movement and rotation of the omni max anchor within the seabed is known as keying which ensures the anchor to mainly resist normal resistance and hence to possess relatively high capacity to weight ratio shelton et al 2011 liu et al 2016b in order to combine the advantages of omni max and torpedo anchors a hybrid gravity installed anchor is put forward in the present study the hybrid anchor includes a light weight gravity installed plate anchor l gipla and a retrievable booster the l gipla is a plate shaped anchor which is used to provide holding capacity and is installed with the aid of the booster the booster is an installation tool and can help the l gipla to overcome the soil resistance which helps the l gipla to achieve a deep penetration depth within the seabed the hybrid gravity installed anchor in the present study is designed with the properties of deep embedment depth high capacity to weight ratio diving property and low installation cost more details associated with the l gipla and its installation process are given in the next section 2 lightweight gravity installed plate anchor the innovative l gipla shown in fig 1 is primarily comprised of two pieces of flukes and a shank the padeye is located at the top of the shank two types of flukes triangular and peltate shaped flukes are designed hence the two types of l giplas are terms as triangular anchor and peltate anchor respectively the triangular anchor is more prone to penetrate into strong soils such as dense clay and sand while the peltate anchor can provide higher holding capacity as the peltate flukes enlarge the projected area perpendicular to the uplift load acting on the padeye to overcome the offset of gravity centre caused by the shank the included angle between the plane of fluke and the symmetry plane of the shank is larger than 90 both flukes of the triangular anchor and peltate anchor are 5 m in length and 2 m in width and the dry weights of the triangular anchor and peltate anchor are 167 kn and 246 kn respectively compared to the torpedo anchor or omni max anchor both the size and weight of the present l giplas are relatively small or light however the holding capacity of the l gipla is approximately the same with that of the torpedo anchor or omni max anchor and the comparison of the anchor capacity will be discussed at the end of the paper the booster is an installation tool to help the l gipla to overcome the soil resistance and achieve a deeper penetration depth the booster as shown in fig 2 is comprised of a cylindrical shaft and three rear fins the cylindrical shaft is designed with a semi ellipsoidal tip and a retractable rear to reduce the drag force during free fall in water the rear fins attached to the booster rear are beneficial in improving the directional stability of the whole system i e l gipla booster which is termed hybrid anchor in following sections for simplification the booster has been applied to increase the penetration depth of the omni max anchor liu et al 2018a 2018b and the readers are referred to original publications for further details the entire installation process of the hybrid anchor is presented in fig 2 the booster is connected at the tail of the l gipla by a shear pin ensuring that the shaft centre of the booster is in line with the intersection of flukes of the l gipla the free fall process in water stage 1 and dynamic penetration process within the seabed stage 2 of the hybrid anchor are similar to that of a gia after installation the installation line connected at the booster tail is tensioned when the uplift load acting on the shear pin is beyond the allowable shear strength the shear pin is broken and the booster is pulled out of the seabed while the l gipla is remained to be left in the seabed stage 3 therefore the retrievable booster can be re used for the next anchor installation then the mooring chain attached to the padeye of the l gipla is tensioned and the anchor is forced to key to an orientation more perpendicular to the loading direction stage 4 to improve the holding capacity as the padeye is offset and eccentric from the gravity centre the l gipla exhibits diving property under certain conditions with proper uplift loading angle hence the anchor will gain higher capacity as it dives deeper into the seabed preliminary studies by tong et al 2020 indicated that the l gipla can dive deeper into clayey seabed moreover the dynamic penetration process of the l gipla in sand has been preliminarily investigated by large deformation finite element analysis and the numerical results indicated the l gipla will achieve a penetration depth approximately 2 3 times the anchor length with the aid of the booster tong 2020 therefore the l gipla also provides an alternative to offshore wind turbines floating net cages and other renewable devices which are located in relatively shallow waters where the prevalence of layered seabeds is high in order to investigate the final penetration depth of the l gipla within clayey seabed model tests on the laboratory floor at single gravity i e 1g were carried out in kaolin clay to simulate the dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor a series of factors affecting the final penetration depth of the l gipla were analysed which includes the anchor shape booster weight impact velocity undrained shear strength of the soil and potential of water entrainment along the anchor soil interface based on the testing results a theoretical framework using to estimate the soil resistances on the l gipla and the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor was established 3 laboratory model tests 3 1 similarity laws for dynamic penetration of the gia within the seabed the kinetic energy obtained from free fall in water and gravitational energy of the gia are exhausted by the soil resistances on the anchor the similarity relationship for 1g dynamic geotechnical problems such as the dynamic penetration of the gia has been deduced by han et al 2019 the self weight of the anchor plays a dominant role on the final penetration depth hence model tests were designed according to the froude criterion the froude number fr is expressed as 1 f r v g h where v is the anchor velocity g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the height of the anchor the froude criterion requires that the froude number in model scale is equal to that in prototype the corresponding similarity relationships of associated physical quantities are listed in table 1 note for undrained geotechnical problems in clay the loads primarily depend on the cohesive soil strength as opposed to gravitational forces for dynamic penetration of the hybrid anchor the failure mechanism of the soil around the anchor depends on the stress ratio s u γ sʹz s u is the undrained shear strength γ sʹ is the submerged unit weight of the soil and z is the embedment depth rather than the stress level γ sʹz hence reasonable modelling accuracy could be achieved by 1g tests with deliberating the similarity laws the generation and dissipation of pore water pressures were also measured during and after dynamic penetration of the hybrid anchor hence the scale factor of dissipation time is discussed herein the degree of consolidation is associated with the time factor t which is expressed by eq 2 2 t c v t h 2 where c v is the consolidation coefficient t is the dissipation time and h is the length characterising the dissipation path the consolidation coefficient is expressed by eq 3 3 c v k e s γ w where k is the hydraulic conductivity e s is the compression modulus and γ w is the unit weight of water if the same degree of consolidation is wished in 1g tests as that in the prototype the scale factor of time λ t is 4 λ t t m t p 1 λ l 2 λ k λ e s the scale factor of compression modulus for clay is usually λ e s λl the scale factor of hydraulic conductivity is usually considered as unit because same materials are used in model tests and prototype wood 2004 however the hydraulic conductivity experiences an increase with the increase of the void ratio e which is higher in 1g model tests with low stress level in contrasting with that in prototype taylor 1948 deduced a theoretical expression of the hydraulic conductivity as described in eq 5 5 k c d s 2 γ w η e 3 1 e where c is a composite shape factor somehow characterising the shape of typical void spaces within the soil and the tortuosity of the flow path d s is the typical average grain size and η is the dynamic viscosity of water for kaolin clay used in the present model tests the void ratio is e 2 6 with the undrained shear strength s u 0 5 kpa which was the average undrained shear strength in present model tests while the void ratio decreases to e 1 9 corresponding to a prototype strength of s u 20 5 kpa a scale ratio λl 41 was adopted in the present study therefore the scale factor of consolidation time diffusion time is approximately λ t 1 2λl by substituting eq 5 into eq 4 actually the submerged unit weight of the soil in 1g model tests with low stress level is slightly lower than that in prototype however the scale factor of the soil unit weight is considered as unit in the present study as the discrepancy of soil unit weight is limited 3 2 soil preparation spes white kaolin clay was adopted to prepare samples in the present study whose properties are listed in table 2 the samples were consolidated in a strong box with internal dimensions of 2 m length 0 37 m width 0 8 m height as shown in fig 3 both normally consolidated nc and lightly over consolidated loc samples were prepared the hydraulic gradient method zelikson 1969 was adopted to consolidate nc samples the loc sample was prepared by scraping off a certain thickness of soil on the nc sample 3 3 soil strength characterisation soil characterisation tests were performed using a t bar penetrometer length l t 40 mm diameter d t 8 mm from which a continuous profile of undrained shear strength s u was derived using a commonly adopted t bar factor n t 10 5 randolph and houlsby 1984 during tests the t bar was penetrated into the soil with a constant velocity of 1 mm s to ensure undrained conditions typical shear strength profiles of the samples are plotted in fig 4 for nc samples the undrained shear strength s u 1 1z 2 9z kpa for loc samples s u 0 1 2 5z 0 3 4 0z kpa 3 4 model anchors model tests were performed using two model anchors the triangular anchor and peltate anchor as shown in fig 5 a the anchor models are made from stainless steel with a reduced scale of λ l 41 the anchor geometries in model scale and prototype scale are summarized in table 3 a the weights of the triangular and peltate anchor models are 284 4 g and 372 9 g respectively the matching boosters are also made from stainless steel fig 5 b and the corresponding geometries are listed in table 3 b to investigate the effect of booster weight on the final penetration depth of the l gipla four different cylindrical shafts with varied aspect ratios and hence varied weights are designed the four boosters are termed as bi bii biii and biv respectively the weight ratios of the four boosters to the triangular anchor are about 0 9 1 8 2 7 and 4 5 and the weight ratios of the four boosters to the peltate anchor are about 0 6 1 2 1 8 and 3 0 in order to simplify expression the booster bi for the triangular anchor is represented as b0 9 where 0 9 is the weight ratio of the booster to the triangular anchor while for the peltate anchor is represented as b0 6 a micro electromechanical systems mems accelerometer adxl326 16g see fig 5 b is sealed in the cylindrical sleeve towards the rear of the booster to measure the acceleration of the hybrid anchor during the dynamic installation process the anchor velocity and motion displacement can be derived by integrating the acceleration data once and twice respectively the acceleration data were recorded at a frequency of 2 khz 3 5 arrangement of pore pressure transducers the pore water pressure in the soil surrounding the hybrid anchor was measured for some testing cases five pore pressure transducers ppts were fixed to an aluminium frame as shown in fig 6 a the frontal and side view of the frame are detailed shown in fig 6 b three ppts ppt1 ppt2 and ppt3 were horizontally arranged and the distance between two adjacent ppts was 75 mm two more ppts ppt4 and ppt5 were set right below ppt3 and the distance between two adjacent ppts was 100 mm in model tests the transducers of ppt1 ppt2 and ppt3 were embedded with a depth of 100 mm below the mudline from the frontal view the testing site was located right before the vertical frame of the aluminium frame where ppt3 ppt4 and ppt5 were arranged the horizontal distance from the centre of the testing site i e the intersection of flukes of the l gipla to ppt3 was 50 mm w a as shown in fig 6 a and the horizontal distance from the centre of the testing site to ppt2 and ppt1 were 90 mm and 158 mm respectively the ppts were used to measure the accumulation of the excess pore water pressure during the dynamic penetration of the hybrid anchor with a frequency of 2 khz and the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure after the anchor installation with a frequency of 10 hz the data collection of the ppts were stopped until the excess pore pressure had dissipated to a 90 degree 3 6 testing procedures in order to minimise boundary effects a certain distance should be kept between each test site and the box walls the minimum distance was about three times of the diameter of the sphere or spudcan to avoid boundary effects in sphere penetration test and spudcan installation kohan et al 2017 morton et al 2015 therefore the minimum distances were set as 2 7w a from the centre of one test site to the box walls and 3 6w a between two test sites in the present model tests the penetration process with the designed impact velocity was achieved by releasing the anchor at a predetermined height above the mudline at the beginning of the experiment the suspended model anchor was released by burning the release line out allowing the anchor to fall freely in air or water to achieve kinetic energy after dynamic installation the final penetration depth of the anchor was also measured directly using a steel ruler which provided a reference to check the final penetration depth derived from the mems accelerometer moreover a high speed camera was set above the strong box to capture the dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor and the deformation of the surface soil around the anchor 4 testing results 4 1 testing cases a total of 39 model tests were conducted and a series of factors influencing the final penetration depth of the anchor were investigated these factors include the undrained shear strength of the soil shape of the l gipla booster weight impact velocity water entrainment effect and water drag on the hybrid anchor except for cases a36 and a38 all the other tests were carried out in the samples where a 2 mm thick layer of water was maintained above the soil surface to ensure saturated conditions for cases a36 and a38 the water layer above the soil surface was 60 cm about 4 9h a and hence the effects of water drag and water entrainment on the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor could be investigated the water depth of 60 cm is thick enough for the hybrid anchor to be released in water and to reach the pre designed impact velocity the tests details are listed in table 4 4 2 typical testing results the case a36 is adopted herein as a typical case to illustrate the dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor the anchor model is the triangular l gipla with booster b1 8 which was hanging with a 30 cm height above the mudline before release based on the variation of acceleration in fig 7 a the dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor can be divided into four stages in stage 1 z 0 3 m note z 0 means the anchor tip is above the mudline the hybrid anchor is hanging in water and the acceleration is zero in stage 2 0 3 m z 0 the hybrid anchor freely falls in water due to the water drag acting on the hybrid anchor the acceleration gradually reduces with the increase in the fall velocity in stage 3 0 z 0 47 m when the anchor impacts the soil surface the acceleration is rapidly reduced at the initial stage the acceleration maintains positive since the summary of the soil resistance and water drag force on the anchor is lower than the anchor self weight as the anchor penetrates deeper into stronger soils the summary of the soil resistance and water drag force is greater than the anchor self weight thus the anchor starts to decelerate until the velocity drops to zero in stage 4 z 0 47 m the anchor is rest in the soil and the acceleration is again zero the velocity versus motion displacement of the hybrid anchor in case a36 is plotted in fig 7 b it can also be seen from fig 7 b that the velocity continuously increases when the anchor initially impacts the seabed until the soil resistance and water drag force on the anchor are equal to the anchor self weight 5 discussion 5 1 effect of booster weight on penetration depth as is known that the l gipla will achieve a deeper penetration depth with a heavier booster the effect of booster weight on the final penetration depth of the l gipla is shown in fig 8 a with the same impact velocity of 3 44 m s 22 m s in prototype the final penetration depth ratios z e h a z e is the final penetration depth of the l gipla are 3 63 and 4 10 for the triangular anchor with boosters b1 8 and b2 7 respectively therefore the penetration depth ratio of the triangular anchor is increased by 12 9 the holding capacity depends on the strength of the soil surrounding the anchor hence the holding capacity increases significantly as the anchor penetrates deeper into nc or loc soils given that the holding capacity is perpendicular to the soil strength at the centroid of the l gipla the holding capacity of the triangular anchor exhibits an increase of 20 3 as the final penetration depth ratio increasing from 3 63 to 4 10 generally the final penetration depth and hence the holding capacity of the l gipla is notably increased with a heavier booster which can reduce the total number of l giplas needed in a floating system for the peltate anchor the penetration depth ratio increases by 13 6 from 3 52 with booster b1 2 to 4 00 with booster b1 8 and the holding capacity increases by 30 5 it should be noted that the booster b1 8 for the triangular anchor is the same to that of b1 2 for the peltate anchor with the same impact velocity and undrained shear strength the final penetration depth of the triangular anchor with b1 8 is approximately the same to that of the peltate anchor with b1 2 the surface area of the triangular anchor is less than that of the peltate anchor which is beneficial for reducing the frictional resistance and increasing the final penetration depth however the triangular anchor is lighter compared to the peltate anchor which is hampered the final penetration depth overall the final penetration depth ratio of the triangular anchor is approximately the same with that of the peltate anchor by connecting the same booster according to liu et al 2018a a heavier booster is also beneficial in increasing the impact velocity of the hybrid anchor as shown in fig 8 b when the impact velocity increases from 16 m s to 19 m s the final penetration depth ratio increases by 11 3 from 2 84 to 3 16 for the triangular anchor with booster b0 9 and 11 4 from 2 80 to 3 12 for the peltate anchor with booster b0 6 it can be concluded that a heavier booster is helpful in increasing both the kinetic and gravitational energies of the l gipla which encourages the l gipla to penetrate deeper and hence gain higher holding capacity 5 2 effect of water effect on penetration depth for previous model tests investigating the dynamic penetration process of the gia the free fall process in water was usually ignored therefore the soil surface is just spread with a thin layer of water to ensure saturation of the soil hossain et al 2015 without water or with a thin layer of water above the soil surface the water drag force on the gia is underestimated which results in a relative overestimation of the final penetration depth however previous studies by han et al 2019 indicated that some water is trapped at the anchor soil interface as the anchor impacts the soil from water the water entrainment effect can reduce the frictional resistance at the anchor soil interface and hence increase the final penetration depth in order to investigate the water drag and water entrainment effects the hybrid anchor was allowed to impact the soil twice with 60 cm thick layer of water above the mudline and without 2 mm thick layer of water above the mudline water with the same impact velocity four testing cases were conducted and the results are plotted in fig 9 the testing cases of a36 and a38 were released in water and cases of a37 and a39 were released in air as the hybrid anchor initially impacts the seabed the velocity in case a36 is lower than that in case a37 indicating the water drag force reduces the anchor velocity for instance when the velocity v 2 28 m s the penetration depth ratios of cases a36 and a37 are z h a 1 05 and 1 96 respectively however as the hybrid anchor penetrates deeper into the soil the velocity gradient of case a36 is lower than that in case a37 meaning the water entrainment reduces the frictional resistance at the anchor soil interface it can be seen from fig 9 that the effect of water entrainment on penetration depth overweighs the effect of water drag force therefore the penetration depth is relatively conservative for the cases in which the water layer above the mudline is thin fig 10 shows 8 frames of photographs of case a36 and case a37 from fig 10 a it can be seen that for case a36 the surface soil is not displaced or heaved as the anchor impacts the seabed due to the high water pressure above the seabed however the photographs in fig 10 b show that the surface soil surrounding the anchor is displaced radially outwards when the anchor impacts the soil hence the surface water above the seabed cannot be trapped into the anchor soil interface moreover a stable cavity is formed by the passage of the advancing anchor for case a37 while no apparent cavity is formed for case a36 it is assumed that a suction force is created above the anchor in case a36 which encourages the closure of the open cavity 5 3 theoretical analysis on anchor penetration depth the soil and water resistances on the hybrid anchor include the end bearing force f t frictional force f f drag force f d and buoyant force f b as shown in fig 11 the differential equation governing the dynamic penetration of the hybrid anchor within the seabed can be expressed as eq 6 6 m m a z w f t f f f d f b where m is the anchor mass mʹ is the added mass and wʹ is the anchor submerged weight in water the differential equation i e eq 6 was also used to estimate the penetration depth of gias and free fall penetrometers true 1976 chow et al 2014 blake et al 2016 liu et al 2018a indicated that added mass of the omni max anchor during free fall in water is very small and hence can be ignored moreover the added mass for torpedo anchor or free fall cone penetrometer is usually considered as zero in previous studies beard 1981 o beirne et al 2017 therefore for the plate shaped l gipla and torpedo shaped booster in the present study the added mass is also ignored the end bearing force on the hybrid anchor can be expressed as eq 7 7 f t n c s u a t where n c is the bearing capacity factor and a t is the anchor soil contact area on the plane that is perpendicular to the booster shaft the bearing capacity factor of the l gipla is estimated based on that of the rectangular base foundation proposed by liu et al 2017 which is expressed as 8 n c 2 π 1 0 189 b l 0 108 b l 2 c 1 ln 1 c 2 z b b l 0 064 c 1 5 599 b l 0 337 c 2 0 940 8 904 b l b l 0 064 c 1 0 697 0 022 b l c 2 0 284 1 339 b l where l and b are the length and width of the rectangular foundation c 1 and c 2 are parameters associated with the foundation aspect ratio b l and z is the embedment depth of the foundation the frictional force can be expressed as eq 9 9 f f α s u a frict where α is the friction coefficient at the anchor soil interface and a frict is the anchor side area that is in contact with the soil the friction coefficient α is usually valued as the inverse of the soil sensitivity s t for kaolin clay the sensitivity is about 3 estimated by t bar cyclic penetration tests han et al 2019 therefore the friction coefficient α is adopted as 0 33 in the present study the soil buoyant force is given as eq 10 10 f b γ s v dis where v dis is the volume of the soil displaced by the anchor it is generally acknowledged that the undrained shear strength of fine grain soils increases with shear strain rate which is termed as the strain rate effect the strain rate factor r f denoting the enhancement of the undrained shear strength is expressed in eq 11 using the semi logarithmic description einav and randolph 2006 11 s u r f s u ref 1 μ log γ γ ref s u ref where s u ref is the undrained shear strength measured at the reference strain rate μ is the strain rate parameter denoting the rate of strength increase per decade γ is the shear strain rate and γ ref is the reference shear strain rate the shear strain rate can be described as the ratio of the velocity v to the characteristic length d of the penetrometer 12 γ v d for t bar penetrometer the characteristic length is usually selected as the t bar diameter the undrained shear strength of the soil was measured by an 8 mm diameter t bar with a penetration rate of 1 mm s hence the reference shear strain rate is 0 125 s 1 it should be noted that the shear strain rate described in eq 12 is a macro value capturing the strain rate effect of the soil around a projectile in essence the soils at different regions surrounding a projectile exhibit different shear strain rates and hence different strain rate factors for free fall cone penetrometers previous studies have demonstrated that the strain rate factor r f2 of the frictional resistance at the cone shaft is higher than r f1 of the frictional resistance at the cone tip dayal and allen 1975 einav and randolph 2006 steiner et al 2013 chow et al 2017 liu and zhang 2018 einav and randolph 2006 indicated that for an axial loaded cylinder the strain rate factor of the frictional resistance r f2 is approximately 1 2 times of that of the tip resistance i e r f2 1 2r f1 therefore for the hybrid anchor in the present study the strain rate factor in estimating the frictional force is assumed as 1 2 times of that in estimating the end bearing force i e r f2 1 2r f1 and the strain rate factor in estimating the end bearing force is considered to be equal to r f i e r f1 r f in order to estimate the shear strain rate of the soil around the l gipla and booster the characteristic length d in eq 12 is selected as the thickness of the fluke for the l gipla and the diameter of the shaft for the booster the strain rate parameter μ in eq 11 is adopted 0 14 which is determined by the t bar penetration tests in han et al 2019 the drag force f d on the anchor can be expressed as 13 f d 1 2 c d ρ a f v 2 where c d is the drag coefficient ρ is the density of the fluid material and a f is the anchor frontal area in the plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the anchor when estimating the water and soil drag forces the water density and soil saturated density are used respectively in the present study the drag coefficient of the hybrid anchor is assumed as 0 7 han et al 2020 based on the above discussion the dynamic penetration process of hybrid anchors within the nc and loc soils can be predicted by eq 6 and the results are shown in fig 12 it can be seen that both the variation of the velocity and the final penetration depth of the predicted velocity displacement curves are consistent with the measured results indicating that the parameters assumed in eqs 6 13 are reliable the theoretical framework is a useful tool to estimate the final penetration depth of the anchor and analyse the contribution of each force on the final penetration depth 5 4 energy based prediction model on anchor penetration depth compared to the theoretical framework introduced in the above section the energy based tool which will be introduced in this section provides a more efficient approach to estimate the final penetration depth of the gia the empirical equation based on the anchor total energy is expressed as eq 14 14 z e d eff a e total k e a s d eff 2 b where d eff is the effective diameter of the l gipla which is defined as the diameter of a circle with the same frontal area as the triangular anchor or peltate anchor e total 0 5mv 0 2 wʹz e is the total energy of the hybrid anchor k e is the equivalent strength gradient a s is the surface area of the triangular anchor or peltate anchor and a and b are undetermined constants for the nc clay the equivalent strength gradient is equal to the strength gradient i e k e k for the loc clay the equivalent strength gradient k e 2s um kz e z e the experimental data in fig 13 show that the dimensionless penetration depth z e d eff of the hybrid anchor increases monotonically with the increase in the dimensionless total energy e total k e a s d eff 2 the best fit solutions using eq 14 are derived by a 2 16 b 0 36 for the triangular anchor with a booster and a 1 78 b 0 42 for the peltate anchor with a booster the relationship between the dimensionless penetration depth and dimensionless total energy for different types of gias are plotted in fig 14 for comparison gaudin et al 2013 hossain et al 2014 zimmerman et al 2009 it can be seen that with the same dimensionless total energy the dimensionless penetration depth of the torpedo anchor is higher that of the hybrid anchor and omni max anchor the l gipla and omni max anchors are plate shaped anchors hence the soil frictional resistance is relatively large and the anchor weight is relatively light which results in a relative lower dimensionless penetration depth 5 5 comparison with field trials a series of field trials with a relative large scale factor λ l 7 5 is introduced herein for comparison with the present results from small scale 1g tests with λ l 41 the field trials were performed in the yellow sea china at the testing locations water depths were 19 5 20 0 m and the undrained shear strength approximately increases linearly with depth s u 1 2 6z kpa note the undrained shear strength was measured by a free fall ball penetrometer with a booster and more information is given in han et al 2021a 2021b the model hybrid anchor was released from a jack up platform by using a crane capacity 5 t until to a release height of h e 3 83 10 79 m above the mudline then the anchor was allowed to fall freely in water and dynamically impact the seabed during which the acceleration data were measured by a mems accelerometer adxl326 16g the results from field trials are described in table 5 the tilt angle δ t of the hybrid anchor from the axis of symmetry of the anchor to the vertical direction after dynamic penetration could be determined based on the measurements of the horizontal acceleration table 5 shows that δ t 8 for all field trials indicating the hybrid anchor exhibits well directional stability during free fall in water the data from field trials are also depicted in fig 13 for further validating the reliability of results and similarity principles of small scale 1g model tests the dimensionless penetration depth z e d eff from field trials is slightly higher compared with that from the present study corresponding to the same dimensionless energy e total k e a s d eff 2 which is reasonable due to the following three reasons first the shear strain rate of t bar in the present study was 0 125 s 1 which is two orders of magnitude lower than that of hybrid anchors while the shear strain rate of the free fall ball penetrometer with a booster was 101 s 1 which is in the same order in the case of hybrid anchors therefore the undrained shear strength in field tests is relatively overestimated for some extent which leads to a lower e total k e a s d eff 2 corresponding to the same penetration depth z e d eff second most cases in the present study were conducted without considering the potential of water entrainment along the anchor soil interface resulting in relatively conservative final penetration depths third the geometry of the l gipla used in field trials was modified and optimised with tapered fluke and round grinded edges which is beneficial in reducing the end bearing force and increasing the final penetration depth though there exists some discrepancy for penetration depths between small scale 1g model tests and large scale field tests the comparison shown in fig 13 indicates results from small scale 1g mode tests are reliable 5 6 effect of penetration on excess pore pressure in order to investigate the development and dissipation of the excess pore pressure of the soil surrounding the anchor three dynamic penetration cases case a3 a9 and a16 were conducted by measuring the excess pore pressure during and after the dynamic penetration process the setup of five ppts in the vicinity of the hybrid anchor is given in fig 6 b in the three testing cases the hybrid anchor is the triangular anchor with the booster b1 8 which impacted the soil with an impact velocity of v 0 3 44 m s 22 m s in prototype the variation of the excess pore pressure δu against penetration depth of the anchor during dynamic installation for case a16 is plot in fig 15 based on the theory of cavity expansion the extrusion of the surrounding soil induced by the dynamic penetration of the anchor will increase the excess pore pressure randolph et al 1979 the peak values δu p of excess pore pressures at different locations are listed in table 6 it can be concluded that for ppts with the same embedment depth but different radial distances from the anchor the peak value of excess pore pressure increases with decreasing radial distance between the ppt and anchor for ppts with the same radial distance from the anchor but different embedment depths the peak value of excess pore water pressure increases with increasing embedment depth of the ppts based on the variation of the excess pore pressure shown in fig 15 the following key moments are obtained moment a t 0 015 s the penetration depth of the hybrid anchor is 5 cm 0 4h a and the height of the anchor tip relative to ppt3 and ppt2 is 5 cm 1 0w a at this moment the excess pore pressures δu 3 and δu 2 start to increase while δu 1 is approximately zero moment b t 0 046 s the penetration depth of the hybrid anchor is about 16 cm and the height of the anchor tip relative to ppt4 is 4 cm 0 8w a at this moment the excess pore water pressures δu 3 and δu 2 reach peak values of 2 06 kpa and 0 95 kpa meaning the soils around ppt3 and ppt2 are subject to compaction to the largest extent then the excess pore pressures δu 3 and δu 2 begin to decrease indicating the displaced soil caused by the advanced anchor starts to flow back towards the cavity behind the hybrid anchor moment c t 0 066 s the penetration depth of the hybrid anchor is 23 cm and the height of the anchor tip relative to ppt5 is 6 cm 1 2w a at this moment the excess pore pressure δu 4 reaches peak of 3 21 kpa and the excess pore pressure δu 5 starts to increase moment d t 0 107 s the penetration depth of the hybrid anchor is 35 cm and the height of the anchor tip relative to ppt5 is 5 cm 1 0w a at this moment the excess pore pressure δu 5 reaches the peak of 8 08 kpa moreover the excess pore pressures of ppt2 and ppt3 start to increase again which is caused by the rear fins of the booster at moment d the height from the base of the rear fins relative to pp2 and ppt3 is about 3 cm 0 60w a hence the soils surrounding ppt2 and ppt3 are influenced and compressed by the dynamic penetration of the rear fins it can be also seen from fig 15 that for fft2 and ppt3 the excess pore pressure of the second peak value is lower compared to that of the first one which is caused by the following reasons first the width of the rear fins is 30 mm and the fluke width of the l gipla is 48 8 mm therefore the peak excess pore pressure generated by the motion of rear fins is lower second when the rear fins pass through the ppt2 or ppt3 the anchor velocity is lower than that during the flukes passing through ppt2 or ppt3 meaning a lower velocity also results in a lower excess pore pressure throughout the entire dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor the excess pore pressure δu 1 measured by ppt1 is basically unchanged indicating the soil surrounding ppt1 is not disturbed the radial distance from the axis of symmetry of the l gipla to ppt1 is 158 mm 3 2w a therefore the distances of 2 7w a from one test site to box walls and 3 6w a between two test sites set in the present model tests are appropriate to minimise boundary effects as can be seen from fig 15 and table 6 the peak values of the excess pore pressure decrease gradually with increasing radial distance from the ppt to the axis of symmetry of the l gipla in the horizontal direction according to the cavity expansion theory the total stress of the soil in the vicinity of the anchor will increase as the soil is subject to compression during dynamic installation with increasing horizontal distance to the axis of symmetry of the l gipla the degree of soil compression gradually decreases leading to a decrease of excess pore pressure the peak values of the excess pore pressure increase with increasing penetration depth in the vertical direction in nc and loc soils both the undrained shear strength and rigidity index i r g s u g is the shear modulus increase with penetration depth which results in an expansion of the plastic deformation and hence an increase in the excess pore pressure 5 7 interpretation of dissipation test results dissipation tests were conducted at the end of dynamic penetration tests for cases a3 a9 and a16 and the dissipation results of case a16 are shown in fig 16 a moreover the normalised excess pore pressure δu δu i against the dissipation time t is plotted in fig 16 b the normalised excess pore pressure is expressed as δu δu i u u f u i u f where u is the pore pressure at the moment of t u i is the initial pore pressure at 1 s after the end of dynamic penetration and u f is the final pore pressure or hydrostatic pore pressure at the corresponding depth based on the dissipation curves in fig 16 b the dissipation of the excess pore pressure after dynamic penetration test in nc clay can be divided into two types sully et al 1999 classified the dissipation curves of excess pore pressures in piezocone tests as five types for type i the excess pore pressure monotonically decreases during the entire dissipation process meaning the rate of dissipation is faster than the rate of redistribution the dissipation curves of δu 3 δu 4 and δu 5 belong to type i for type ii the excess pore pressure initially increases and then decreases monotonically meaning the redistribution plays a dominant role on the excess pore pressure during the initial dissipation state the dissipation curve of δu 2 belongs to type ii the large gradient of pore pressure around ppt3 will dissipate radially towards ppt2 thus the excess pore pressure around ppt2 exhibits an increase initially for ppt1 the excess pore pressure is nearly zero during the entire dissipation process hence the dissipation trend is not analysed herein the required time is about 2970 s 8700 s 18 000 s or 40 000 s for the soil around ppt4 to reach a 30 50 70 or 90 degree of dissipation of excess pore pressure based on the similarity relationships given in table 1 a period of about 3 8 17 or 38 days after the dynamic installation is needed in the prototype scale for the soil around the anchor to reach a consolidation degree of 30 50 70 or 90 which is beneficial for the regain of the soil strength and hence a regain in anchor holding capacity note the dissipation time is primarily associated with the consolidation coefficient the vertical consolidation coefficient of spes white kaolin is c v 0 52 mm2 s from one dimensional consolidation test under a vertical pressure of 12 5 kpa with a relatively high consolidation coefficient the dissipation time of excess pore water pressure is short in practical applications the consolidation time should be carefully designed on the basis of consolidation coefficient 5 8 comparison with other gias for the hybrid anchors in the present study the final penetration depth ratio ranges from 2 05 to 5 01 with impact velocity of 13 3 25 0 m s in prototype scale the penetration depth ratio z e h a and the corresponding capacity to weight ratio f n w d f n is the anchor holding capacity of the l gipla and other gias are listed in table 7 for comparison the holding capacity of the l gipla is estimated by 15 f n n a a h s u c where n a is the capacity factor which is assumed to be 11 34 for the triangular anchor and 10 27 for the peltate anchor tong et al 2020 a h is the horizontal projected area of the l gipla s u c is the undrained shear strength at the anchor centroid it can be seen that the penetration depth ratio of the l gipla is relatively larger than that of omni max obtained from field centrifuge and 1g tests zimmerman et al 2009 gaudin et al 2013 han et al 2019 both the l gipla and omni max anchor are plate shaped anchors while the former one mobilises higher capacity to weight ratio attributed to the higher penetration depth ratio with the aid of the booster the holding capacity of the torpedo anchor is primarily provided by the frictional resistance at the anchor soil interface while the holding capacity of the l gipla is primarily provided by the normal resistance after keying therefore the capacity to weight ratio of the l gipla is larger than that of torpedo anchors medeiros 2001 o loughlin et al 2004 richardson et al 2009 o beirne et al 2015 as shown in table 7 the holding capacities of the three types of gias are compared herein in hossain et al 2015 the undrained shear strength s u 7 5 2 9z kpa and the weight of the torpedo anchor is w d 1098 kn in prototype when the torpedo anchor is pulled with varied uplift angles the capacity to weight ratio ranges f n w d 1 87 3 29 hence the holding capacity is 2 05 3 61 mn in gaudin et al 2013 the undrained shear strength of calcareous silt is 3 3z kpa and the holding capacity is about 6 mn for the omni max anchor with an initial penetration depth ratio of 1 4 for case a32 in the present study the undrained shear strength s u 2 9z kpa and the final penetration depth ratio of the peltate anchor is 3 73 based on eq 15 the holding capacity of the peltate anchor is about 8 0 mn in the above three cases the undrained shear strengths are similar and the present l gipla possesses the highest holding capacity while with lightest weight overall the l gipla provides an efficient alternative for offshore anchoring systems 6 conclusions a light gravity installed plate anchor is proposed in the present study which is dynamically installed with a retrievable booster compared with other types of gias the l gipla provides roughly equivalent holding capacity whilst with smaller size and lighter weight in order to investigate the dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor within clayey soils 1g model tests were conducted and various factors influencing the final penetration depth of the anchor are discussed the primary results are summarized as follows 1 the booster connected at the rear of the l gipla provides an efficient approach to increase the final penetration depth of the l gipla the final penetration depth ratio of the l gipla can reach 2 1 5 0 with impact velocity of 13 3 25 0 m s and undrained shear strength of 1 5z 4 3z kpa 2 the water entrainment effect reduces the friction coefficient and hence the frictional resistance at the anchor soil interface such that the final penetration depth of the anchor derived from non water conditions is somewhat conservative 3 due to the dynamic installation the soil in the vicinity of the hybrid anchor is compressed and the excess pore pressure increases rapidly the maximum excess pore pressure in the soil increases with increasing penetration depth of the anchor and decreases radially the soil with a radial distance from the axis of symmetry of the hybrid anchor larger than 3 2w a is not disturbed during the dynamic penetration 4 after dynamic installation the excess pore pressure in the soil around the hybrid anchor is dissipated radially outwards a period of about 3 8 17 or 38 days is required for the excess pore pressure to dissipate to a degree of 30 50 70 or 90 5 an energy based model and a theoretical framework using to predict the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor are proposed the former provides a tool for efficiently prediction of the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor and the latter is with the ability of analysing the effect of each force on the penetration depth of the anchor further investigations associated with the l gipla includes the hydrodynamic characteristics during free fall in water dynamic installation in sandy seabed complex motion trajectory and capacity mobilisation

20250,this paper presents a series of 1g tests to investigate the performance of an innovative light weight gravity installed plate anchor l gipla with the aid of a reusable booster both in normally consolidated nc and lightly over consolidated loc soils a micro electromechanical systems mems accelerometer was used to measure the dynamic penetration process of the l gipla with a booster in clay various factors affecting the final penetration depth of the anchor were investigated including the soil strength characterisation impact velocity anchor shape booster weight and water entrainment effects based on the data obtained from the mems accelerometer the hydrodynamic aspects associated with the water drag force and water entrainment effect during the dynamic penetration of the l gipla were analysed besides theoretical framework and energy based models were proposed to predict the final penetration depth of the l gipla the excess pore water pressure induced by the dynamic penetration of the l gipla and the subsequent dissipation around the anchor were investigated hence the affected regions of the soil due to the dynamic penetration could be estimated finally the

adventured into deeper waters with harsher environments due to the gradual depletion of oil gas fields in shallow waters which leads to a shift in the basic form of offshore platforms from fixed platforms to floating platforms except for offshore oil gas industry floating systems are also widely used for mooring offshore wind turbines floating net cages and wave and tidal energy converters the floating structure is held in position by mooring systems and anchoring foundations a variety of anchor types has been developed to adapt to deepwater environments including suction caissons fines et al 1991 drag installed anchors vryhof anchors 2005 suction embedded plate anchors sepla dove et al 1998 and gravity installed anchors gias lieng et al 1999 medeiros 2001 shelton 2007 among these anchors the gia is attractive due to its cost effective and time efficient properties in the process of dynamic installation shelton et al 2011 torpedo anchors and omni max anchors fig 1 are two types of gias widely used in offshore engineering the torpedo anchor is usually comprised with a cylindrical shaft and four rear fins while the omni max anchor is a plate shaped anchor comprising of three discontinuous flukes and an adjustable loading arm shelton 2007 a typical torpedo anchor t98 is 98 t in weight and an omni max anchor is usually 38 t the final penetration depth of the torpedo anchor within the seabed is relatively high resulted from the large weight and simple geometry compared with that of the omni max anchor liu et al 2016a however the padeye of the torpedo anchor is located at the top of the cylindrical shaft and the holding capacity is primarily provided by the frictional resistance at the soil anchor interface and the anchor self weight for the omni max anchor the padeye is located at the upper side of the loading arm hence the anchor is rotated within the soil when subject to uplift loading the movement and rotation of the omni max anchor within the seabed is known as keying which ensures the anchor to mainly resist normal resistance and hence to possess relatively high capacity to weight ratio shelton et al 2011 liu et al 2016b in order to combine the advantages of omni max and torpedo anchors a hybrid gravity installed anchor is put forward in the present study the hybrid anchor includes a light weight gravity installed plate anchor l gipla and a retrievable booster the l gipla is a plate shaped anchor which is used to provide holding capacity and is installed with the aid of the booster the booster is an installation tool and can help the l gipla to overcome the soil resistance which helps the l gipla to achieve a deep penetration depth within the seabed the hybrid gravity installed anchor in the present study is designed with the properties of deep embedment depth high capacity to weight ratio diving property and low installation cost more details associated with the l gipla and its installation process are given in the next section 2 lightweight gravity installed plate anchor the innovative l gipla shown in fig 1 is primarily comprised of two pieces of flukes and a shank the padeye is located at the top of the shank two types of flukes triangular and peltate shaped flukes are designed hence the two types of l giplas are terms as triangular anchor and peltate anchor respectively the triangular anchor is more prone to penetrate into strong soils such as dense clay and sand while the peltate anchor can provide higher holding capacity as the peltate flukes enlarge the projected area perpendicular to the uplift load acting on the padeye to overcome the offset of gravity centre caused by the shank the included angle between the plane of fluke and the symmetry plane of the shank is larger than 90 both flukes of the triangular anchor and peltate anchor are 5 m in length and 2 m in width and the dry weights of the triangular anchor and peltate anchor are 167 kn and 246 kn respectively compared to the torpedo anchor or omni max anchor both the size and weight of the present l giplas are relatively small or light however the holding capacity of the l gipla is approximately the same with that of the torpedo anchor or omni max anchor and the comparison of the anchor capacity will be discussed at the end of the paper the booster is an installation tool to help the l gipla to overcome the soil resistance and achieve a deeper penetration depth the booster as shown in fig 2 is comprised of a cylindrical shaft and three rear fins the cylindrical shaft is designed with a semi ellipsoidal tip and a retractable rear to reduce the drag force during free fall in water the rear fins attached to the booster rear are beneficial in improving the directional stability of the whole system i e l gipla booster which is termed hybrid anchor in following sections for simplification the booster has been applied to increase the penetration depth of the omni max anchor liu et al 2018a 2018b and the readers are referred to original publications for further details the entire installation process of the hybrid anchor is presented in fig 2 the booster is connected at the tail of the l gipla by a shear pin ensuring that the shaft centre of the booster is in line with the intersection of flukes of the l gipla the free fall process in water stage 1 and dynamic penetration process within the seabed stage 2 of the hybrid anchor are similar to that of a gia after installation the installation line connected at the booster tail is tensioned when the uplift load acting on the shear pin is beyond the allowable shear strength the shear pin is broken and the booster is pulled out of the seabed while the l gipla is remained to be left in the seabed stage 3 therefore the retrievable booster can be re used for the next anchor installation then the mooring chain attached to the padeye of the l gipla is tensioned and the anchor is forced to key to an orientation more perpendicular to the loading direction stage 4 to improve the holding capacity as the padeye is offset and eccentric from the gravity centre the l gipla exhibits diving property under certain conditions with proper uplift loading angle hence the anchor will gain higher capacity as it dives deeper into the seabed preliminary studies by tong et al 2020 indicated that the l gipla can dive deeper into clayey seabed moreover the dynamic penetration process of the l gipla in sand has been preliminarily investigated by large deformation finite element analysis and the numerical results indicated the l gipla will achieve a penetration depth approximately 2 3 times the anchor length with the aid of the booster tong 2020 therefore the l gipla also provides an alternative to offshore wind turbines floating net cages and other renewable devices which are located in relatively shallow waters where the prevalence of layered seabeds is high in order to investigate the final penetration depth of the l gipla within clayey seabed model tests on the laboratory floor at single gravity i e 1g were carried out in kaolin clay to simulate the dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor a series of factors affecting the final penetration depth of the l gipla were analysed which includes the anchor shape booster weight impact velocity undrained shear strength of the soil and potential of water entrainment along the anchor soil interface based on the testing results a theoretical framework using to estimate the soil resistances on the l gipla and the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor was established 3 laboratory model tests 3 1 similarity laws for dynamic penetration of the gia within the seabed the kinetic energy obtained from free fall in water and gravitational energy of the gia are exhausted by the soil resistances on the anchor the similarity relationship for 1g dynamic geotechnical problems such as the dynamic penetration of the gia has been deduced by han et al 2019 the self weight of the anchor plays a dominant role on the final penetration depth hence model tests were designed according to the froude criterion the froude number fr is expressed as 1 f r v g h where v is the anchor velocity g is the gravitational acceleration and h is the height of the anchor the froude criterion requires that the froude number in model scale is equal to that in prototype the corresponding similarity relationships of associated physical quantities are listed in table 1 note for undrained geotechnical problems in clay the loads primarily depend on the cohesive soil strength as opposed to gravitational forces for dynamic penetration of the hybrid anchor the failure mechanism of the soil around the anchor depends on the stress ratio s u γ sʹz s u is the undrained shear strength γ sʹ is the submerged unit weight of the soil and z is the embedment depth rather than the stress level γ sʹz hence reasonable modelling accuracy could be achieved by 1g tests with deliberating the similarity laws the generation and dissipation of pore water pressures were also measured during and after dynamic penetration of the hybrid anchor hence the scale factor of dissipation time is discussed herein the degree of consolidation is associated with the time factor t which is expressed by eq 2 2 t c v t h 2 where c v is the consolidation coefficient t is the dissipation time and h is the length characterising the dissipation path the consolidation coefficient is expressed by eq 3 3 c v k e s γ w where k is the hydraulic conductivity e s is the compression modulus and γ w is the unit weight of water if the same degree of consolidation is wished in 1g tests as that in the prototype the scale factor of time λ t is 4 λ t t m t p 1 λ l 2 λ k λ e s the scale factor of compression modulus for clay is usually λ e s λl the scale factor of hydraulic conductivity is usually considered as unit because same materials are used in model tests and prototype wood 2004 however the hydraulic conductivity experiences an increase with the increase of the void ratio e which is higher in 1g model tests with low stress level in contrasting with that in prototype taylor 1948 deduced a theoretical expression of the hydraulic conductivity as described in eq 5 5 k c d s 2 γ w η e 3 1 e where c is a composite shape factor somehow characterising the shape of typical void spaces within the soil and the tortuosity of the flow path d s is the typical average grain size and η is the dynamic viscosity of water for kaolin clay used in the present model tests the void ratio is e 2 6 with the undrained shear strength s u 0 5 kpa which was the average undrained shear strength in present model tests while the void ratio decreases to e 1 9 corresponding to a prototype strength of s u 20 5 kpa a scale ratio λl 41 was adopted in the present study therefore the scale factor of consolidation time diffusion time is approximately λ t 1 2λl by substituting eq 5 into eq 4 actually the submerged unit weight of the soil in 1g model tests with low stress level is slightly lower than that in prototype however the scale factor of the soil unit weight is considered as unit in the present study as the discrepancy of soil unit weight is limited 3 2 soil preparation spes white kaolin clay was adopted to prepare samples in the present study whose properties are listed in table 2 the samples were consolidated in a strong box with internal dimensions of 2 m length 0 37 m width 0 8 m height as shown in fig 3 both normally consolidated nc and lightly over consolidated loc samples were prepared the hydraulic gradient method zelikson 1969 was adopted to consolidate nc samples the loc sample was prepared by scraping off a certain thickness of soil on the nc sample 3 3 soil strength characterisation soil characterisation tests were performed using a t bar penetrometer length l t 40 mm diameter d t 8 mm from which a continuous profile of undrained shear strength s u was derived using a commonly adopted t bar factor n t 10 5 randolph and houlsby 1984 during tests the t bar was penetrated into the soil with a constant velocity of 1 mm s to ensure undrained conditions typical shear strength profiles of the samples are plotted in fig 4 for nc samples the undrained shear strength s u 1 1z 2 9z kpa for loc samples s u 0 1 2 5z 0 3 4 0z kpa 3 4 model anchors model tests were performed using two model anchors the triangular anchor and peltate anchor as shown in fig 5 a the anchor models are made from stainless steel with a reduced scale of λ l 41 the anchor geometries in model scale and prototype scale are summarized in table 3 a the weights of the triangular and peltate anchor models are 284 4 g and 372 9 g respectively the matching boosters are also made from stainless steel fig 5 b and the corresponding geometries are listed in table 3 b to investigate the effect of booster weight on the final penetration depth of the l gipla four different cylindrical shafts with varied aspect ratios and hence varied weights are designed the four boosters are termed as bi bii biii and biv respectively the weight ratios of the four boosters to the triangular anchor are about 0 9 1 8 2 7 and 4 5 and the weight ratios of the four boosters to the peltate anchor are about 0 6 1 2 1 8 and 3 0 in order to simplify expression the booster bi for the triangular anchor is represented as b0 9 where 0 9 is the weight ratio of the booster to the triangular anchor while for the peltate anchor is represented as b0 6 a micro electromechanical systems mems accelerometer adxl326 16g see fig 5 b is sealed in the cylindrical sleeve towards the rear of the booster to measure the acceleration of the hybrid anchor during the dynamic installation process the anchor velocity and motion displacement can be derived by integrating the acceleration data once and twice respectively the acceleration data were recorded at a frequency of 2 khz 3 5 arrangement of pore pressure transducers the pore water pressure in the soil surrounding the hybrid anchor was measured for some testing cases five pore pressure transducers ppts were fixed to an aluminium frame as shown in fig 6 a the frontal and side view of the frame are detailed shown in fig 6 b three ppts ppt1 ppt2 and ppt3 were horizontally arranged and the distance between two adjacent ppts was 75 mm two more ppts ppt4 and ppt5 were set right below ppt3 and the distance between two adjacent ppts was 100 mm in model tests the transducers of ppt1 ppt2 and ppt3 were embedded with a depth of 100 mm below the mudline from the frontal view the testing site was located right before the vertical frame of the aluminium frame where ppt3 ppt4 and ppt5 were arranged the horizontal distance from the centre of the testing site i e the intersection of flukes of the l gipla to ppt3 was 50 mm w a as shown in fig 6 a and the horizontal distance from the centre of the testing site to ppt2 and ppt1 were 90 mm and 158 mm respectively the ppts were used to measure the accumulation of the excess pore water pressure during the dynamic penetration of the hybrid anchor with a frequency of 2 khz and the dissipation of the excess pore water pressure after the anchor installation with a frequency of 10 hz the data collection of the ppts were stopped until the excess pore pressure had dissipated to a 90 degree 3 6 testing procedures in order to minimise boundary effects a certain distance should be kept between each test site and the box walls the minimum distance was about three times of the diameter of the sphere or spudcan to avoid boundary effects in sphere penetration test and spudcan installation kohan et al 2017 morton et al 2015 therefore the minimum distances were set as 2 7w a from the centre of one test site to the box walls and 3 6w a between two test sites in the present model tests the penetration process with the designed impact velocity was achieved by releasing the anchor at a predetermined height above the mudline at the beginning of the experiment the suspended model anchor was released by burning the release line out allowing the anchor to fall freely in air or water to achieve kinetic energy after dynamic installation the final penetration depth of the anchor was also measured directly using a steel ruler which provided a reference to check the final penetration depth derived from the mems accelerometer moreover a high speed camera was set above the strong box to capture the dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor and the deformation of the surface soil around the anchor 4 testing results 4 1 testing cases a total of 39 model tests were conducted and a series of factors influencing the final penetration depth of the anchor were investigated these factors include the undrained shear strength of the soil shape of the l gipla booster weight impact velocity water entrainment effect and water drag on the hybrid anchor except for cases a36 and a38 all the other tests were carried out in the samples where a 2 mm thick layer of water was maintained above the soil surface to ensure saturated conditions for cases a36 and a38 the water layer above the soil surface was 60 cm about 4 9h a and hence the effects of water drag and water entrainment on the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor could be investigated the water depth of 60 cm is thick enough for the hybrid anchor to be released in water and to reach the pre designed impact velocity the tests details are listed in table 4 4 2 typical testing results the case a36 is adopted herein as a typical case to illustrate the dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor the anchor model is the triangular l gipla with booster b1 8 which was hanging with a 30 cm height above the mudline before release based on the variation of acceleration in fig 7 a the dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor can be divided into four stages in stage 1 z 0 3 m note z 0 means the anchor tip is above the mudline the hybrid anchor is hanging in water and the acceleration is zero in stage 2 0 3 m z 0 the hybrid anchor freely falls in water due to the water drag acting on the hybrid anchor the acceleration gradually reduces with the increase in the fall velocity in stage 3 0 z 0 47 m when the anchor impacts the soil surface the acceleration is rapidly reduced at the initial stage the acceleration maintains positive since the summary of the soil resistance and water drag force on the anchor is lower than the anchor self weight as the anchor penetrates deeper into stronger soils the summary of the soil resistance and water drag force is greater than the anchor self weight thus the anchor starts to decelerate until the velocity drops to zero in stage 4 z 0 47 m the anchor is rest in the soil and the acceleration is again zero the velocity versus motion displacement of the hybrid anchor in case a36 is plotted in fig 7 b it can also be seen from fig 7 b that the velocity continuously increases when the anchor initially impacts the seabed until the soil resistance and water drag force on the anchor are equal to the anchor self weight 5 discussion 5 1 effect of booster weight on penetration depth as is known that the l gipla will achieve a deeper penetration depth with a heavier booster the effect of booster weight on the final penetration depth of the l gipla is shown in fig 8 a with the same impact velocity of 3 44 m s 22 m s in prototype the final penetration depth ratios z e h a z e is the final penetration depth of the l gipla are 3 63 and 4 10 for the triangular anchor with boosters b1 8 and b2 7 respectively therefore the penetration depth ratio of the triangular anchor is increased by 12 9 the holding capacity depends on the strength of the soil surrounding the anchor hence the holding capacity increases significantly as the anchor penetrates deeper into nc or loc soils given that the holding capacity is perpendicular to the soil strength at the centroid of the l gipla the holding capacity of the triangular anchor exhibits an increase of 20 3 as the final penetration depth ratio increasing from 3 63 to 4 10 generally the final penetration depth and hence the holding capacity of the l gipla is notably increased with a heavier booster which can reduce the total number of l giplas needed in a floating system for the peltate anchor the penetration depth ratio increases by 13 6 from 3 52 with booster b1 2 to 4 00 with booster b1 8 and the holding capacity increases by 30 5 it should be noted that the booster b1 8 for the triangular anchor is the same to that of b1 2 for the peltate anchor with the same impact velocity and undrained shear strength the final penetration depth of the triangular anchor with b1 8 is approximately the same to that of the peltate anchor with b1 2 the surface area of the triangular anchor is less than that of the peltate anchor which is beneficial for reducing the frictional resistance and increasing the final penetration depth however the triangular anchor is lighter compared to the peltate anchor which is hampered the final penetration depth overall the final penetration depth ratio of the triangular anchor is approximately the same with that of the peltate anchor by connecting the same booster according to liu et al 2018a a heavier booster is also beneficial in increasing the impact velocity of the hybrid anchor as shown in fig 8 b when the impact velocity increases from 16 m s to 19 m s the final penetration depth ratio increases by 11 3 from 2 84 to 3 16 for the triangular anchor with booster b0 9 and 11 4 from 2 80 to 3 12 for the peltate anchor with booster b0 6 it can be concluded that a heavier booster is helpful in increasing both the kinetic and gravitational energies of the l gipla which encourages the l gipla to penetrate deeper and hence gain higher holding capacity 5 2 effect of water effect on penetration depth for previous model tests investigating the dynamic penetration process of the gia the free fall process in water was usually ignored therefore the soil surface is just spread with a thin layer of water to ensure saturation of the soil hossain et al 2015 without water or with a thin layer of water above the soil surface the water drag force on the gia is underestimated which results in a relative overestimation of the final penetration depth however previous studies by han et al 2019 indicated that some water is trapped at the anchor soil interface as the anchor impacts the soil from water the water entrainment effect can reduce the frictional resistance at the anchor soil interface and hence increase the final penetration depth in order to investigate the water drag and water entrainment effects the hybrid anchor was allowed to impact the soil twice with 60 cm thick layer of water above the mudline and without 2 mm thick layer of water above the mudline water with the same impact velocity four testing cases were conducted and the results are plotted in fig 9 the testing cases of a36 and a38 were released in water and cases of a37 and a39 were released in air as the hybrid anchor initially impacts the seabed the velocity in case a36 is lower than that in case a37 indicating the water drag force reduces the anchor velocity for instance when the velocity v 2 28 m s the penetration depth ratios of cases a36 and a37 are z h a 1 05 and 1 96 respectively however as the hybrid anchor penetrates deeper into the soil the velocity gradient of case a36 is lower than that in case a37 meaning the water entrainment reduces the frictional resistance at the anchor soil interface it can be seen from fig 9 that the effect of water entrainment on penetration depth overweighs the effect of water drag force therefore the penetration depth is relatively conservative for the cases in which the water layer above the mudline is thin fig 10 shows 8 frames of photographs of case a36 and case a37 from fig 10 a it can be seen that for case a36 the surface soil is not displaced or heaved as the anchor impacts the seabed due to the high water pressure above the seabed however the photographs in fig 10 b show that the surface soil surrounding the anchor is displaced radially outwards when the anchor impacts the soil hence the surface water above the seabed cannot be trapped into the anchor soil interface moreover a stable cavity is formed by the passage of the advancing anchor for case a37 while no apparent cavity is formed for case a36 it is assumed that a suction force is created above the anchor in case a36 which encourages the closure of the open cavity 5 3 theoretical analysis on anchor penetration depth the soil and water resistances on the hybrid anchor include the end bearing force f t frictional force f f drag force f d and buoyant force f b as shown in fig 11 the differential equation governing the dynamic penetration of the hybrid anchor within the seabed can be expressed as eq 6 6 m m a z w f t f f f d f b where m is the anchor mass mʹ is the added mass and wʹ is the anchor submerged weight in water the differential equation i e eq 6 was also used to estimate the penetration depth of gias and free fall penetrometers true 1976 chow et al 2014 blake et al 2016 liu et al 2018a indicated that added mass of the omni max anchor during free fall in water is very small and hence can be ignored moreover the added mass for torpedo anchor or free fall cone penetrometer is usually considered as zero in previous studies beard 1981 o beirne et al 2017 therefore for the plate shaped l gipla and torpedo shaped booster in the present study the added mass is also ignored the end bearing force on the hybrid anchor can be expressed as eq 7 7 f t n c s u a t where n c is the bearing capacity factor and a t is the anchor soil contact area on the plane that is perpendicular to the booster shaft the bearing capacity factor of the l gipla is estimated based on that of the rectangular base foundation proposed by liu et al 2017 which is expressed as 8 n c 2 π 1 0 189 b l 0 108 b l 2 c 1 ln 1 c 2 z b b l 0 064 c 1 5 599 b l 0 337 c 2 0 940 8 904 b l b l 0 064 c 1 0 697 0 022 b l c 2 0 284 1 339 b l where l and b are the length and width of the rectangular foundation c 1 and c 2 are parameters associated with the foundation aspect ratio b l and z is the embedment depth of the foundation the frictional force can be expressed as eq 9 9 f f α s u a frict where α is the friction coefficient at the anchor soil interface and a frict is the anchor side area that is in contact with the soil the friction coefficient α is usually valued as the inverse of the soil sensitivity s t for kaolin clay the sensitivity is about 3 estimated by t bar cyclic penetration tests han et al 2019 therefore the friction coefficient α is adopted as 0 33 in the present study the soil buoyant force is given as eq 10 10 f b γ s v dis where v dis is the volume of the soil displaced by the anchor it is generally acknowledged that the undrained shear strength of fine grain soils increases with shear strain rate which is termed as the strain rate effect the strain rate factor r f denoting the enhancement of the undrained shear strength is expressed in eq 11 using the semi logarithmic description einav and randolph 2006 11 s u r f s u ref 1 μ log γ γ ref s u ref where s u ref is the undrained shear strength measured at the reference strain rate μ is the strain rate parameter denoting the rate of strength increase per decade γ is the shear strain rate and γ ref is the reference shear strain rate the shear strain rate can be described as the ratio of the velocity v to the characteristic length d of the penetrometer 12 γ v d for t bar penetrometer the characteristic length is usually selected as the t bar diameter the undrained shear strength of the soil was measured by an 8 mm diameter t bar with a penetration rate of 1 mm s hence the reference shear strain rate is 0 125 s 1 it should be noted that the shear strain rate described in eq 12 is a macro value capturing the strain rate effect of the soil around a projectile in essence the soils at different regions surrounding a projectile exhibit different shear strain rates and hence different strain rate factors for free fall cone penetrometers previous studies have demonstrated that the strain rate factor r f2 of the frictional resistance at the cone shaft is higher than r f1 of the frictional resistance at the cone tip dayal and allen 1975 einav and randolph 2006 steiner et al 2013 chow et al 2017 liu and zhang 2018 einav and randolph 2006 indicated that for an axial loaded cylinder the strain rate factor of the frictional resistance r f2 is approximately 1 2 times of that of the tip resistance i e r f2 1 2r f1 therefore for the hybrid anchor in the present study the strain rate factor in estimating the frictional force is assumed as 1 2 times of that in estimating the end bearing force i e r f2 1 2r f1 and the strain rate factor in estimating the end bearing force is considered to be equal to r f i e r f1 r f in order to estimate the shear strain rate of the soil around the l gipla and booster the characteristic length d in eq 12 is selected as the thickness of the fluke for the l gipla and the diameter of the shaft for the booster the strain rate parameter μ in eq 11 is adopted 0 14 which is determined by the t bar penetration tests in han et al 2019 the drag force f d on the anchor can be expressed as 13 f d 1 2 c d ρ a f v 2 where c d is the drag coefficient ρ is the density of the fluid material and a f is the anchor frontal area in the plane perpendicular to the axis of symmetry of the anchor when estimating the water and soil drag forces the water density and soil saturated density are used respectively in the present study the drag coefficient of the hybrid anchor is assumed as 0 7 han et al 2020 based on the above discussion the dynamic penetration process of hybrid anchors within the nc and loc soils can be predicted by eq 6 and the results are shown in fig 12 it can be seen that both the variation of the velocity and the final penetration depth of the predicted velocity displacement curves are consistent with the measured results indicating that the parameters assumed in eqs 6 13 are reliable the theoretical framework is a useful tool to estimate the final penetration depth of the anchor and analyse the contribution of each force on the final penetration depth 5 4 energy based prediction model on anchor penetration depth compared to the theoretical framework introduced in the above section the energy based tool which will be introduced in this section provides a more efficient approach to estimate the final penetration depth of the gia the empirical equation based on the anchor total energy is expressed as eq 14 14 z e d eff a e total k e a s d eff 2 b where d eff is the effective diameter of the l gipla which is defined as the diameter of a circle with the same frontal area as the triangular anchor or peltate anchor e total 0 5mv 0 2 wʹz e is the total energy of the hybrid anchor k e is the equivalent strength gradient a s is the surface area of the triangular anchor or peltate anchor and a and b are undetermined constants for the nc clay the equivalent strength gradient is equal to the strength gradient i e k e k for the loc clay the equivalent strength gradient k e 2s um kz e z e the experimental data in fig 13 show that the dimensionless penetration depth z e d eff of the hybrid anchor increases monotonically with the increase in the dimensionless total energy e total k e a s d eff 2 the best fit solutions using eq 14 are derived by a 2 16 b 0 36 for the triangular anchor with a booster and a 1 78 b 0 42 for the peltate anchor with a booster the relationship between the dimensionless penetration depth and dimensionless total energy for different types of gias are plotted in fig 14 for comparison gaudin et al 2013 hossain et al 2014 zimmerman et al 2009 it can be seen that with the same dimensionless total energy the dimensionless penetration depth of the torpedo anchor is higher that of the hybrid anchor and omni max anchor the l gipla and omni max anchors are plate shaped anchors hence the soil frictional resistance is relatively large and the anchor weight is relatively light which results in a relative lower dimensionless penetration depth 5 5 comparison with field trials a series of field trials with a relative large scale factor λ l 7 5 is introduced herein for comparison with the present results from small scale 1g tests with λ l 41 the field trials were performed in the yellow sea china at the testing locations water depths were 19 5 20 0 m and the undrained shear strength approximately increases linearly with depth s u 1 2 6z kpa note the undrained shear strength was measured by a free fall ball penetrometer with a booster and more information is given in han et al 2021a 2021b the model hybrid anchor was released from a jack up platform by using a crane capacity 5 t until to a release height of h e 3 83 10 79 m above the mudline then the anchor was allowed to fall freely in water and dynamically impact the seabed during which the acceleration data were measured by a mems accelerometer adxl326 16g the results from field trials are described in table 5 the tilt angle δ t of the hybrid anchor from the axis of symmetry of the anchor to the vertical direction after dynamic penetration could be determined based on the measurements of the horizontal acceleration table 5 shows that δ t 8 for all field trials indicating the hybrid anchor exhibits well directional stability during free fall in water the data from field trials are also depicted in fig 13 for further validating the reliability of results and similarity principles of small scale 1g model tests the dimensionless penetration depth z e d eff from field trials is slightly higher compared with that from the present study corresponding to the same dimensionless energy e total k e a s d eff 2 which is reasonable due to the following three reasons first the shear strain rate of t bar in the present study was 0 125 s 1 which is two orders of magnitude lower than that of hybrid anchors while the shear strain rate of the free fall ball penetrometer with a booster was 101 s 1 which is in the same order in the case of hybrid anchors therefore the undrained shear strength in field tests is relatively overestimated for some extent which leads to a lower e total k e a s d eff 2 corresponding to the same penetration depth z e d eff second most cases in the present study were conducted without considering the potential of water entrainment along the anchor soil interface resulting in relatively conservative final penetration depths third the geometry of the l gipla used in field trials was modified and optimised with tapered fluke and round grinded edges which is beneficial in reducing the end bearing force and increasing the final penetration depth though there exists some discrepancy for penetration depths between small scale 1g model tests and large scale field tests the comparison shown in fig 13 indicates results from small scale 1g mode tests are reliable 5 6 effect of penetration on excess pore pressure in order to investigate the development and dissipation of the excess pore pressure of the soil surrounding the anchor three dynamic penetration cases case a3 a9 and a16 were conducted by measuring the excess pore pressure during and after the dynamic penetration process the setup of five ppts in the vicinity of the hybrid anchor is given in fig 6 b in the three testing cases the hybrid anchor is the triangular anchor with the booster b1 8 which impacted the soil with an impact velocity of v 0 3 44 m s 22 m s in prototype the variation of the excess pore pressure δu against penetration depth of the anchor during dynamic installation for case a16 is plot in fig 15 based on the theory of cavity expansion the extrusion of the surrounding soil induced by the dynamic penetration of the anchor will increase the excess pore pressure randolph et al 1979 the peak values δu p of excess pore pressures at different locations are listed in table 6 it can be concluded that for ppts with the same embedment depth but different radial distances from the anchor the peak value of excess pore pressure increases with decreasing radial distance between the ppt and anchor for ppts with the same radial distance from the anchor but different embedment depths the peak value of excess pore water pressure increases with increasing embedment depth of the ppts based on the variation of the excess pore pressure shown in fig 15 the following key moments are obtained moment a t 0 015 s the penetration depth of the hybrid anchor is 5 cm 0 4h a and the height of the anchor tip relative to ppt3 and ppt2 is 5 cm 1 0w a at this moment the excess pore pressures δu 3 and δu 2 start to increase while δu 1 is approximately zero moment b t 0 046 s the penetration depth of the hybrid anchor is about 16 cm and the height of the anchor tip relative to ppt4 is 4 cm 0 8w a at this moment the excess pore water pressures δu 3 and δu 2 reach peak values of 2 06 kpa and 0 95 kpa meaning the soils around ppt3 and ppt2 are subject to compaction to the largest extent then the excess pore pressures δu 3 and δu 2 begin to decrease indicating the displaced soil caused by the advanced anchor starts to flow back towards the cavity behind the hybrid anchor moment c t 0 066 s the penetration depth of the hybrid anchor is 23 cm and the height of the anchor tip relative to ppt5 is 6 cm 1 2w a at this moment the excess pore pressure δu 4 reaches peak of 3 21 kpa and the excess pore pressure δu 5 starts to increase moment d t 0 107 s the penetration depth of the hybrid anchor is 35 cm and the height of the anchor tip relative to ppt5 is 5 cm 1 0w a at this moment the excess pore pressure δu 5 reaches the peak of 8 08 kpa moreover the excess pore pressures of ppt2 and ppt3 start to increase again which is caused by the rear fins of the booster at moment d the height from the base of the rear fins relative to pp2 and ppt3 is about 3 cm 0 60w a hence the soils surrounding ppt2 and ppt3 are influenced and compressed by the dynamic penetration of the rear fins it can be also seen from fig 15 that for fft2 and ppt3 the excess pore pressure of the second peak value is lower compared to that of the first one which is caused by the following reasons first the width of the rear fins is 30 mm and the fluke width of the l gipla is 48 8 mm therefore the peak excess pore pressure generated by the motion of rear fins is lower second when the rear fins pass through the ppt2 or ppt3 the anchor velocity is lower than that during the flukes passing through ppt2 or ppt3 meaning a lower velocity also results in a lower excess pore pressure throughout the entire dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor the excess pore pressure δu 1 measured by ppt1 is basically unchanged indicating the soil surrounding ppt1 is not disturbed the radial distance from the axis of symmetry of the l gipla to ppt1 is 158 mm 3 2w a therefore the distances of 2 7w a from one test site to box walls and 3 6w a between two test sites set in the present model tests are appropriate to minimise boundary effects as can be seen from fig 15 and table 6 the peak values of the excess pore pressure decrease gradually with increasing radial distance from the ppt to the axis of symmetry of the l gipla in the horizontal direction according to the cavity expansion theory the total stress of the soil in the vicinity of the anchor will increase as the soil is subject to compression during dynamic installation with increasing horizontal distance to the axis of symmetry of the l gipla the degree of soil compression gradually decreases leading to a decrease of excess pore pressure the peak values of the excess pore pressure increase with increasing penetration depth in the vertical direction in nc and loc soils both the undrained shear strength and rigidity index i r g s u g is the shear modulus increase with penetration depth which results in an expansion of the plastic deformation and hence an increase in the excess pore pressure 5 7 interpretation of dissipation test results dissipation tests were conducted at the end of dynamic penetration tests for cases a3 a9 and a16 and the dissipation results of case a16 are shown in fig 16 a moreover the normalised excess pore pressure δu δu i against the dissipation time t is plotted in fig 16 b the normalised excess pore pressure is expressed as δu δu i u u f u i u f where u is the pore pressure at the moment of t u i is the initial pore pressure at 1 s after the end of dynamic penetration and u f is the final pore pressure or hydrostatic pore pressure at the corresponding depth based on the dissipation curves in fig 16 b the dissipation of the excess pore pressure after dynamic penetration test in nc clay can be divided into two types sully et al 1999 classified the dissipation curves of excess pore pressures in piezocone tests as five types for type i the excess pore pressure monotonically decreases during the entire dissipation process meaning the rate of dissipation is faster than the rate of redistribution the dissipation curves of δu 3 δu 4 and δu 5 belong to type i for type ii the excess pore pressure initially increases and then decreases monotonically meaning the redistribution plays a dominant role on the excess pore pressure during the initial dissipation state the dissipation curve of δu 2 belongs to type ii the large gradient of pore pressure around ppt3 will dissipate radially towards ppt2 thus the excess pore pressure around ppt2 exhibits an increase initially for ppt1 the excess pore pressure is nearly zero during the entire dissipation process hence the dissipation trend is not analysed herein the required time is about 2970 s 8700 s 18 000 s or 40 000 s for the soil around ppt4 to reach a 30 50 70 or 90 degree of dissipation of excess pore pressure based on the similarity relationships given in table 1 a period of about 3 8 17 or 38 days after the dynamic installation is needed in the prototype scale for the soil around the anchor to reach a consolidation degree of 30 50 70 or 90 which is beneficial for the regain of the soil strength and hence a regain in anchor holding capacity note the dissipation time is primarily associated with the consolidation coefficient the vertical consolidation coefficient of spes white kaolin is c v 0 52 mm2 s from one dimensional consolidation test under a vertical pressure of 12 5 kpa with a relatively high consolidation coefficient the dissipation time of excess pore water pressure is short in practical applications the consolidation time should be carefully designed on the basis of consolidation coefficient 5 8 comparison with other gias for the hybrid anchors in the present study the final penetration depth ratio ranges from 2 05 to 5 01 with impact velocity of 13 3 25 0 m s in prototype scale the penetration depth ratio z e h a and the corresponding capacity to weight ratio f n w d f n is the anchor holding capacity of the l gipla and other gias are listed in table 7 for comparison the holding capacity of the l gipla is estimated by 15 f n n a a h s u c where n a is the capacity factor which is assumed to be 11 34 for the triangular anchor and 10 27 for the peltate anchor tong et al 2020 a h is the horizontal projected area of the l gipla s u c is the undrained shear strength at the anchor centroid it can be seen that the penetration depth ratio of the l gipla is relatively larger than that of omni max obtained from field centrifuge and 1g tests zimmerman et al 2009 gaudin et al 2013 han et al 2019 both the l gipla and omni max anchor are plate shaped anchors while the former one mobilises higher capacity to weight ratio attributed to the higher penetration depth ratio with the aid of the booster the holding capacity of the torpedo anchor is primarily provided by the frictional resistance at the anchor soil interface while the holding capacity of the l gipla is primarily provided by the normal resistance after keying therefore the capacity to weight ratio of the l gipla is larger than that of torpedo anchors medeiros 2001 o loughlin et al 2004 richardson et al 2009 o beirne et al 2015 as shown in table 7 the holding capacities of the three types of gias are compared herein in hossain et al 2015 the undrained shear strength s u 7 5 2 9z kpa and the weight of the torpedo anchor is w d 1098 kn in prototype when the torpedo anchor is pulled with varied uplift angles the capacity to weight ratio ranges f n w d 1 87 3 29 hence the holding capacity is 2 05 3 61 mn in gaudin et al 2013 the undrained shear strength of calcareous silt is 3 3z kpa and the holding capacity is about 6 mn for the omni max anchor with an initial penetration depth ratio of 1 4 for case a32 in the present study the undrained shear strength s u 2 9z kpa and the final penetration depth ratio of the peltate anchor is 3 73 based on eq 15 the holding capacity of the peltate anchor is about 8 0 mn in the above three cases the undrained shear strengths are similar and the present l gipla possesses the highest holding capacity while with lightest weight overall the l gipla provides an efficient alternative for offshore anchoring systems 6 conclusions a light gravity installed plate anchor is proposed in the present study which is dynamically installed with a retrievable booster compared with other types of gias the l gipla provides roughly equivalent holding capacity whilst with smaller size and lighter weight in order to investigate the dynamic penetration process of the hybrid anchor within clayey soils 1g model tests were conducted and various factors influencing the final penetration depth of the anchor are discussed the primary results are summarized as follows 1 the booster connected at the rear of the l gipla provides an efficient approach to increase the final penetration depth of the l gipla the final penetration depth ratio of the l gipla can reach 2 1 5 0 with impact velocity of 13 3 25 0 m s and undrained shear strength of 1 5z 4 3z kpa 2 the water entrainment effect reduces the friction coefficient and hence the frictional resistance at the anchor soil interface such that the final penetration depth of the anchor derived from non water conditions is somewhat conservative 3 due to the dynamic installation the soil in the vicinity of the hybrid anchor is compressed and the excess pore pressure increases rapidly the maximum excess pore pressure in the soil increases with increasing penetration depth of the anchor and decreases radially the soil with a radial distance from the axis of symmetry of the hybrid anchor larger than 3 2w a is not disturbed during the dynamic penetration 4 after dynamic installation the excess pore pressure in the soil around the hybrid anchor is dissipated radially outwards a period of about 3 8 17 or 38 days is required for the excess pore pressure to dissipate to a degree of 30 50 70 or 90 5 an energy based model and a theoretical framework using to predict the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor are proposed the former provides a tool for efficiently prediction of the final penetration depth of the hybrid anchor and the latter is with the ability of analysing the effect of each force on the penetration depth of the anchor further investigations associated with the l gipla includes the hydrodynamic characteristics during free fall in water dynamic installation in sandy seabed complex motion trajectory and capacity mobilisation

20251,experimental investigations were performed for a circular cantilevered cylinder located in a circulating water channel the cylinder of mass ratio 1 78 and aspect ratio of 17 8 was vertically fixed at one end and its other end was free to oscillate in the stream wise and lateral directions the reduced velocities of the flow past the cylinder ranging from 0 65 to 5 18 corresponded to reynolds numbers between 6 38 103 and 5 1 104 at the inlet of the water channel a laser doppler velocimetry system measured stream wise and span wise flow velocity profiles and calculated the corresponding turbulence intensities for differing reduced velocities cylinder accelerations displacements and forces acting on the cylinder in the stream wise and lateral directions were measured vortex shedding frequencies were compared with cylinder response frequencies in the stream wise and lateral directions strouhal numbers were obtained at different water channel depths and widths

viv referred to as the oscillating motions caused by the flow past a slender body interacting with the fluid is part of the more general category of fluid structure interaction fsi this viv affects many engineering applications such as offshore oil platforms drilling risers offshore wind turbine towers heat exchanger tubes bridges factory chimneys etc due to the complexity of viv it seemed appropriate to summarize the most relevant parameters associated with viv research table 1 lists these non dimensional parameters over many years intensive surveys on the experimental investigation of viv were conducted see e g king 1977 sarpkaya 2004 bearman 1984 2011 and williamson and govardhan 2008 king 1977 sarpkaya 2004 bearman 1984 2011 williamson and govardhan 2008 and konstantinidis et al 2020 modelled the one degree of freedom 1 dof lateral motion of a rigid circular cylinder fixed at one end thus we first investigated a circular cylinder oscillating in 1 dof to improve the understanding of viv phenomena then we discussed and presented our results for a circular cylinder oscillating in 2 dof in table 1 1 1 the viv of a cylinder oscillating in 1 dof williamson and roshko 1988 at the reynolds number range of 300 r e 1000 performed experiments with a rigid cylinder forced to oscillate in the lateraldirection only 1 dof they introduced the term wavelength ratio defined as λ d u t e d where t e 1 f n is the cylinder s lateralnatural oscillation period this ratio is generally referred to as the reduced velocity u r they captured many vortex patterns occurring at this ratio such as a single vortex s a pair of vortices p a karman vortex street consisting of two single vortices 2s and when λ d exceeds a certain value the vortex pairs that change their sign and deviate from the wake s centreline creating two pair of vortices 2p according to williamson and roshko 1988 this altered vortex pattern is responsible for an abrupt change of the measured lift force on a cylinder they also discussed the development of p s and 2s 2p vortex patterns occurring at different reduced velocities and they mapped regions of vortex patterns generated for cylinders of differing vibration in the stream wise direction fujarra et al 2001 exploring viv of an elastomeric cylinder supported on a spring and enforced in the stream wise direction by flexible aluminium plates found that the response was similar to the elastic re strained rigid cylinder and that three responses occur at low mass damping they suggested scrutinizing the wake using the piv system to determine the surrounding wake vortices williamson and jauvtis 2004 flemming and williamson 2005 and cagney and balabani 2014 showed that stream wise oscillations indeed affect these lateraloscillations for cylinders of low mass ratio for a rigid cylinder of mass ratio less than six attached to a pendulum on a horizontal plate over the tank williamson and jauvtis 2004 found that the stream wise oscillations surprisingly increase the lateraloscillations massively with amplitudes up to three times larger than the amplitudes of the stream wise oscillations they used a particle image velocimetry piv system to capture the shape of the vortex pattern behind the rigid cylinder oscillating in the stream wise and lateraldirections in each half cycle the two degrees of freedom motions 2 dof generated a triplet of strong new vortices referred to as the 2t mode which resembled the 2p mode instead of the 2p mode obtained by williamson and roshko 1988 the 2t vortices increase the energy transferred from the fluid to the cylinder and amplify the cylinder s oscillation in both directions they discovered that by accounting for the additional degree of freedom the cylinder oscillates in three modes this new response branch of the 2t mode is known as the super upper su branch 1 2 the viv of a cylinder oscillate in 2 dof examining a rigid pivoted cylinder free to oscillated in 2 dof flemming and williamson 2005 captured a pattern consisting of a pair of co rotating vortices of the same sign in each half of the cycle called the 2c mode cagney and balabani 2014 examined a pivoted cylinder free to vibrate in 2 dof and compared results with their pervious results obtained with a cylinder free to move in the stream wise direction only see cagney and balabani 2013a b they noticed that the additional degree of freedom affects the overall dynamics of the cylinder wake system the phase shift between the lateral and stream wise oscillations decreases linearly with increasing u r and the measured very small normalized stream wise and lateral responses were less than 0 1d another investigation of pesce and fujarra 2000 of a clamped flexible cylinder for the same damping as that of khalak and williamson 1996 1997 yielded a jump characterized by lower and upper branches occurring at u r 8 3 blevins and coughran 2009 noticed that the amplitudes of an elastically supported rigid cylinder for the 2 dof response exceed those of the 1 dof response for the same damping and mass sanchis et al 2008 testing a circular cylinder fixed by a torsional spring and free to move in 2 dof arrived at the same conclusion in that the oscillations increase dramatically for a cylinder mass ratio of less than six the study of prastianto et al 2009 of a rigid cylinder free to vibrate in 2 dof did not notice incremental oscillations at low values of u r the 2d oscillation trajectories at the tip of the cylinder were measured and drawn for 1 94 ur 6 79 and maximum re 18000 they did not capture the famous shape of figure of eight trajectory other researchers studied the free cantilevered cylinder for a mass ratio of less than the critical mass ratio jeon and gharib 2001 investigated a cylinder under forced stream wise and lateralvibration to represent realistic motions they observed the 2p vortex mode only in the lateralmotion with a maximum displacement of half of the cylinder diameter and a phase shift that resulted in a figure eight shaped lissajous trajectory pattern according to sarpkaya 1995 for a bi harmonically oscillating structure such as a cylinder experiencing stream wise and lateral motions the drag coefficient and the span excitation increase at larger ratios of f nx f ny where f nx and f ny are the cylinder s natural frequency in the stream wise x direction and the lateral y direction respectively according to williamson and jauvtis 2004 govardhan williamson 2000 2002 obtained the theoretical critical mass ratio of m crit 0 52 of a cylinder below this value the synchronization regime becomes huge leong and wei 2008 studied the forced 2 dof response of a circular cylinder of mass ratio m 0 45 which is less than the critical mass ratio using the piv and a laser induced fluorescence lif system to visualize the flow obtained no lower branch vortex patterns nevertheless they captured the p s wake mode our recent work tödter et al 201 9a b and 2021 dealt with viv induced flow of a fully and a partially submerged circular cylinder in a water channel to measure the dynamic response by using a triaxial accelerometer and by digital image correlation dic for the submerged cylinder the mass ratio of m 0 56 was close to the theoretical critical mass ratio see govardhan and c williamson 2000 2002 for the partially submerged cylinder it was m 0 72 peak to peak lateral responses for the fully and the partially submerged cylinders exceeded peak to peak stream wise responses kheirkhah et al 2012 studied viv for a pivoted and a rigid circular cylinder forced to oscillate in 2 dof in flows at re 2100 for a range of 1 94 ur 6 79 their results showed that in the synchronization regime the frequencies in both directions are equal to the body natural frequencies and the cylinder oscillates with elliptic trajectories they introduced the mathematical model to describe the elliptic and figure eight shaped trajectories they observed that the elliptic trajectory occurs fx fy fn and the figure eight shaped trajectory at fx 2fy kheirkhah et al 2016 used the lif technique to visualize the wake patterns and two laser based displacement sensors to measure the dynamic response of an oscillating circular cylinder they studied the wake patterns for the elliptic cylinder trajectory only considering a cylinder with m 15 9 and ar 0 645 the experiment was done for two cases ζ 0 007 and 0 01 at ur 6 6 corresponding to re 2100 the investigated different wake modes along the length of cylinder span occurred at tz l 0 35 and 0 16 of the cylinder length respectively they captured two counter rotating pairs of vortices 2p per cycle at both positions el sheshtawy et al 2021 studied experimentally and numerically the lock in case for a cantilevered cylinder oscillated in 2 dof in flows that induced lock in conditions at re 5 104 they specified the lock in case when the vortex shedding frequency is close or equal to a natural frequency of vibration of the cylinder we summarised relevant published results dealing with a circular cylinder oscillating in 2 dof in table 2 this table lists the main parameters according to the type of restoring characteristic fluid flow medium aspect ratio mass ratio and degrees of freedom 1 3 strouhal number for the oscillating cylinders as listed in table 1 the definition of the strouhal number st is based on the vortex shedding frequency for a fixed cylinder fs for an oscillating cylinder the universal wake strouhal number st was introduced by roshko 1954 1955 roshko s investigation considered also the effect of a wake splitter plate attached to a fixed circular cylinder whereby the st is based on the shedding vortex frequency of the oscillating cylinder fv y only few studies considered the variation of the strouhal number of an oscillating cylinder gonçalves et al 2013b 2015 assumed that the lateral frequency fy s1 equals the strouhal frequency fv y based on this assumption they calculated the strouhal like number stl fy s1d u for low mass ratio cylinders with a wide range of cylinder aspect ratios later on tödter et al 2021 used the same concept to calculate the stl and compared the results with the normal st for three different reduced velocities sumner et al 2004 obtained the strouhal number for stationary cylinders of different aspect ratios ranging between three and nine stappenbelt and lalji 2008 estimating the strouhal number for various cylinders oscillating in that 1 dof of mass ratios between 2 36 and 12 96 observed that the strouhal number differs for each mass ratio the m 1 04 the maximum re 18600 1 4 main objectives here we experimentally investigated a acircular cantilever cylinder oscillated in oscillate in the stream wise and lateral directions the cylinder of mass ratio 1 78 was vertically fixed at one end and its other end was free to 2 dof the reduced velocities of the flow past the cylinder ranging from 0 65 to 5 18 corresponded to reynolds numbers between 6 38 103 and 5 10 104 at the inlet of the water channel a laser doppler velocimetry system measured streamwise and spanwise flow velocity profiles and calculated the corresponding turbulence intensities also most studies concentrated on the shape of the vortex shedding patterns and its effect on the oscillating displacement and their trajectories to our knowledge estimating the strouhal number for the oscillating cylinder at various reduced velocities based on the shedding frequency was never undertaken to fill this gap we measured the universal wake strouhal number for a cylinder freely oscillating in the transverse and lateral directions based on the shedding frequency at different reduced velocities a question that has not been answered till now is do the differing vortex shapes cause the strouhal frequency and the associated strouhal number to change at different locations along the cylinder to answer this question we systematically measured the strouhal number at different water depths around the cylinder in addition we calculated the shedding vortex frequencies and we compared these with frequencies of the cylinder s oscillating lateral and transverse displacements furthermore we directly measured the forces acting on the cylinder in the streamwise and lateral directions calculated the inertia forces and determined the streamwise and lateral coefficients and compare the results for the stationary cylinder from the literature review 2 experimental setup physical tests were conducted in the circulating water channel of the institute of ship technology ocean engineering and transport systems ismt of the university of duisburg essen the channel s test section measures 6 0 m in length 1 47 m in width and 0 67 m in depth the top graph of fig 1 presents the configuration of this circulating water channel and its equipment glass side walls and a plexiglas covered top facilitated optical measurements as shown in fig 1 the vertical flexible hollow cantilevered cylinder made of teflon had an outer diameter of 31 4 mm an inner diameter of 15 0 mm and a length of 600 mm its aspect ratio was ar 17 8 and its mass ratio was m 1 78 a distance of 70 0 mm separated the free end of the cylinder and the plexiglas cover which was far enough away to eliminate boundary layer effects the reynolds number of the flow past the cylinder ranged between 6 38 103 re 51 02 104 underneath its top a triaxial disynet da3802 accelerometer was located inside the cylinder to record oscillating accelerations a three dimensional printed plastic cap sealed with o rings prevented water entry the accelerometer measured static and dynamic accelerations up to 15g where g is the gravitational acceleration the accelerometer s size was 15 mm by 15 mm by 15 mm and it weighed of 15 0 g the accelerometer signals were sampled using the data acquisition system hbm quantumx with a sampling rate of 2400 hz the vertical distance between the accelerometer s centreline and its tip was about 10 mm the connecting cables were guided through the cylinder wall a distance of 80 mm over its lower end and on top of the channel bottom to prevent interactions between cabling and cylinder excitation prastianto at al 2009 and tödter et al 2019a b 2021 employed the same technique to measure cylinder dynamic responses a stainless steel sleeve of 15 mm outer diameter and 70 mm length having a central m8 threaded blind hole was glued inside the lower end of the cylinder this sleeve connected the cylinder to a schunk theta si 1500 240 force torque load cell sensor having a force resolution of 0 5 n a measurement range of 500 n and a torque resolution of 0 05 nm with a measurement range of 240 nm the load cell located underneath the water channel in a separate box and connected to its data acquisition card supplied by the manufacture was calibrated to monitor six degrees of freedom forces and torques an ni pcie 6320 multifunctional i o device collected the data fukuoka et al 2016 employed the same measurement method to measure forces acting on a stationary cylinder for each test an offset measurement for the accelerometer and the load cell was previously carried out a two dimensional backward dantec ldv system measured stream wise and spanwise velocities ux and uy the system s two laser wave lengths were 514 5 and 488 nm the water in the circulating water channel was seeded with tiny hollow glass spheres of diameters ranging between 9 and 13 μm the focal length of the fibre flow probe was 800 mm its beam diameter was 2 2 mm and the transit length of its measuring volume was 0 0991 mm the ldv s probe was mounted on a triaxially traversing system which moved with an accuracy of 0 01 mm 620 mm in the stream wise and lateral directions and 690 mm in the vertical direction at varying steps with a velocity of up to 25 mm s the dantec flow software and the stepper motor unit isel c142 4 automatically controlled the system s lateral motion the origin of the coordinate system defining the lateral motion was located at the cylinder s centre the random seeds passing through the ldv measuring volume recorded flow velocities at random time instances these velocities interpolated over equal time steps obtained a constant sampling rate a fast fourier transformation fft then determined the shedding frequencies see roberts and ajmani 1986 and zhang 2010 for additional details of the ldv system s measuring technique and its application see zhang 2010 and albrecht et al 2013 the ldv system the accelerometer the load cell and the differential pressure sensor were synchronized to measure the flow velocities the corresponding cylinder responses and the forces acting on the cylinder the free stream velocity was measured locally in front of the cylinder using a schiltknecht mini water 20 flow meter and behind the cylinder using a pitot tube and a krohne optibar dp 7060 c 30 differential pressure sensor the pitot tube connected to the data acquisition system measured differential pressures at velocities up to 2 40 m s with a resolution of 0 0106 m s and an accuracy of 98 08 the frequently measured water temperature ranged from 15 5 0 1 to 18 4 0 1 c 2 1 uncertainty of experimental measurements measurement accuracy generally refers to the relative agreement between experimental data and comparative true values the difference between the true value and the measured value is the measurement error in most measuring cases the true value of the measured quantity is unknown therefore the error of the measured value has to be estimated and the estimation of this error is called the measurement uncertainty coleman et al 1995 we obtained our estimated uncertainties by following the guide of the expression of uncertainty in measurements of the international organization for standardization iso and the recommendations of the ais standard s 071 1995 we assumed that all our measured results were gaussian distributed thus the statistical properties of a gaussian distribution of a sample of measurements consist of a finite number of measurements drawn from their distribution where m is the mean value of a set of measurements n calculated as follows 1 m m i n f o r i 1 2 n and δ is the standard deviation calculated as follows 2 δ m i m n 1 f o r i 1 2 n for a set of measured values approximately 68 of the actual values are within one standard deviation δ for a 95 confidence level the actual values will be within 1 96 δ and for 99 7 confidence level the actual values will be within 3 00 δ recall that the mean value of the measured m of a sample population of a repeating measuring number z is drawn from this same the gaussian parent distribution it is normally distributed with a standard deviation δ z then the expected portability prob of the measured value within 95 is expressed as follows 3 p r o b m 1 96 δ z μ m 1 96 δ z 0 95 the uncertainty for a parameter m which depends on many parameters m i is obtained as follows 4 m f m 1 m 2 m 3 m i f o r i 1 2 n the uncertainty for a parameter m is u m and it is evaluated as follows 5 u m m m i u m i f o r i 1 2 n where u m 1 is the uncertainty for each measured variable m i the above equation was used to estimate the uncertainty of relevant parameters such as u c x u c y and st the uncertainty of the strouhal number u s t is estimated as follows 6 u s t d u f s y 1 u 2 d u d u 2 f s y 1 d u u u 2 2 where u f s y 1 u d and u u are the uncertainties of the shedding frequency the cylinder diameter and in inlet free stream velocity respectively the u s t is then rewritten as follows 7 u s t s t u f s y 1 f s y 1 2 u d d 2 u u u 2 and for the force in x direction coefficient cx the uncertainty u c x is as follows 8 u c x c x u f x f x 2 2 u u u 2 u ρ ρ 2 u a a 2 where u x u u u ρ and u a are the uncertainties of the force in x direction the inlet free stream velocity the fluid density can be neglected and the cylinders projected area respectively for the force in y direction coefficient c y the uncertainty u c y is as follows 9 u c y c y u f y f y 2 2 u u u 2 u ρ ρ 2 u a a 2 where u l is the uncertainty in the lift force for simplicity we neglected the uncertainty of the density u ρ the uncertainty in normalized oscillation in y direction uay can be expressed as follows 10 u a y a y u y y 2 u d d 2 and for the uncertainty in normalized oscillation in y direction u ay as follows 11 u a x a x u x x 2 u d d 2 where u y u x u d are the uncertainties in measuring the lateral and stream wise cylinder response and the uncertainties in measuring the cylinder diameter the uncertainty in normalized vertical position in the channel along the cylinder s length u t z l as follows 12 u t z l t z l u t z t z 2 u l l 2 where u t z and t z are the uncertainty in the moving the transverse system in z direction and the position in z direction respectively the u l and l are the uncertainty in the measuring the depth and the depth of the circulation channel respectively the estimation of the total error in the measurement is the summation of two components a systematic bias error and a random precision error the systematic error is the fixed error in the measuring tool and it be always for any measurement however the random error is the error due to the measurement procedures and it will be different for each measurement see coleman and steele 2018 the pervious description was used to estimate the random error and the systematic was supplied by the manufacture for each measuring tools matlab codes processed measured data and estimated measurement uncertainties 3 natural frequencies and damping ratios ten repetitive decay tests in air and in water obtained the cylinder s natural frequencies and the associated damping ratios see tödter et al 2019b 2021 for each test run the cylinder was returned to its rest position so that hysteresis effects did not have to be considered to remove unwanted signal noise the cylinder s decaying response was low pass filtered at 400 hz and high pass filtered at 4 hz an fft analysis of the cylinder s stream wise and lateral acceleration signals from all ten repetitive decay tests evaluated the power spectral density psd fig 2 presents samples of repetitive time series and the associated psd of the cylinder s decaying stream wise acceleration a x obtained from three such tests in air and in water these spectral densities demonstrated that peak values of stream wise accelerations whether obtained in air or in water all occurred at nearly the same frequency the percentage difference between mean frequencies was only about 2 8 in air and about 0 5 in water theoretically stream wise and lateral natural frequencies are equal because of the cylinder s symmetric geometry to estimate the uncertainties of natural frequencies and damping ratios we calculated uncertainties based on all ten repetitive measurements as described above table 3 summarizes our resulting mean values of stream wise natural frequency f nx lateral natural frequency f ny damping ratio ζ and their uncertainties based on a confidence interval of 95 as the decay of cylinder amplitudes oscillating at the natural frequency in water was largely due to hydrodynamic added mass effects damping ratios were measured in air because the air s low density led to more accurate approximations of natural frequencies konstantinidis et al 2020 therefore we dispensed with estimating damping ratios in water the decay test was evaluated also using the 6 dof piezoelectric transducer fig 3 presents three samples of the cylinder s natural frequencies in air and in water their measurement uncertainties were almost the same as the uncertainty limits of the accelerometer see fig 2 carlucci and brown 1983 used the same physical analogy to explain the small difference between the cylinders natural frequencies in air and water they introduced the ratio between the total mass and the single phase liquid hydrodynamic mass and described it as follows 13 r m d i s m t o t where mdis is the liquid displacement mass of the cylinder and mtot is the sum of the cylinder mass and mdis altering a cylinder s mass ratio affected its natural frequency and consequently also the associated ratio of the natural frequencies in air and in water table 4 lists results of decay tests with two cylinders one made of teflon and the other made of polyvinyl chloride pvc the pvc circular cylinder form our last experimental tödter et al 2021 the tests were performed under the same conditions in the same circulation channel diameter and aspect ratio of both cylinders were the same and the measurement tools used for the tests were identical as seen the weight the cylinders are made of affected the natural frequency ratio between in the air and water specifically for the teflon cylinder the measured ratio fny w fny a equals 0 875 and for the pvc cylinder with its lower mass ratio the measured ratio fny w fny a equals 0 585 the cylinder s oscillating displacements were determined by integrating measured accelerations twice by measuring the rate of the decaying amplitudes of this underdamped system we obtained the logarithmic decrement δ which is related to the damping ratio by the following expression 14 δ 1 n ln y n y n 1 2 π ζ 1 ζ 2 where y n y n 1 are two successive oscillation peaks and n is any integer number of successive positive amplitude peaks see blevins 2009 and tödter et al 2021 fig 4 plots the decrements from five successive amplitudes versus the root mean squares r m s term of 1 which is a measure of the system s damping ratio ζ obtained from four exemplary tests of the cylinder oscillating in air the straight dotted line drawn through these decaying amplitudes represented the linear fit of the measured damping induced amplitude decay the difference between linearly predicted values and measurements was based on a maximum residual of 0 0229 the generally favourable correlation confirmed that the system s damping was linear 4 inlet velocity profiles and turbulence intensities to acquire fluid structure interaction benchmark data needed to validate numerical predictions was challenging because it was difficult to simultaneously obtain structural deformations and the associated velocity profiles and turbulence intensities see park et al 2008 for each case the ldv system was employed to measure stream wise velocities u x and span wise velocities u y of the water circulating in the channel as shown in the lower graphs of fig 5 the top graph of fig 5 schematically portrays the circulating water channel showing the position of the vertical grid plane this plane was positioned a distance of ten cylinder diameters in front of the cylinder i e at a normalized distance of t x d 10 from the cylinder s centreline and it extended horizontally from t y d 5 to t y d 5 and a vertically from t z d 5 to t z d 5 from the central free stream flow direction flow velocities were measured at each of the 11 horizontal grid line intersection points on this plane the ldv s tracker captured the free stream velocities from about 1000 particles which required about 30s for each spatially measured point for the seven free stream inlet velocities of u 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 m s these measurements were performed at seven depths which were specified by the normalized vertical positions of t z l 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 a total of 77 average mean free stream velocities u xm were obtained on 11 horizontal gird points and plotted against horizontal distance t y d in fig 5 these plots represent profiles of mean free stream velocities u xm obtained for the seven inlet velocities u x at the seven vertical depth positions t z l the seven plots in fig 6 corresponding to the seven free stream inlet velocities we considered show that although free stream velocities decrease with increasing depth decreasing t z l this decrease is about 10 between t z l 0 9 and t z l 0 3 this decrease was significant because the variation of u xm over t y d for each t z l is less than 3 for all inlet velocities u the variation of u xm at different depths t z l led us to consider them as varying with depth the associated uncertainties of the ldv system s measurements were determined by satisfying the ittc recommendations park et al 2008 the resulting uncertainty based on all measured velocities turned out to be between 0 1 and 0 2 for our cases we assumed the uncertainty to equal the larger value of 0 2 thus we determined values of the mean free stream inlet velocity u xm as listed in table 5 where u 95 is the sum of u xm and its estimated uncertainty based on the 95 confidence level the spanwise velocity u y for each point on the grid plane was also measured their values turned out to be less than 0 02 m s in all cases and therefore neglected the r m s values of free stream velocity u x rms were less than 0 006 m s the r m s values of the spanwise velocities u y rms less than 0 002 m s in addition we estimated the uncertainty of the vertical plane s dimension to be 0 000625 mm the estimate of turbulence intensity at each point t u based on the stream wise and lateral velocities measured in the water channel was calculated as follows 15 t u 0 5 u x 2 u y 2 u x m 2 u y m 2 where u x 2 and u y 2 are the r m s values of the fluctuating velocities in the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively recall that for each inlet velocity u this turbulence intensity was calculated at all 77 points on the vertical grid plane table 5 lists values of free stream velocity u its uncertainty u 95 and the associated turbulence intensity with its uncertainty tu95 based on confidence interval of 95 fig 7 presents the associated histograms of turbulence intensities and the normally distributed psd of turbulence intensity for each of the seven inlet velocities considered as seen the normal distributions of tu turned out to be symmetric about their mean values 5 stream wise and lateral cylinder response the fig 8 a b plot time series of normalized stream wise displacement a x and lateral displacement a y obtained for u r 5 18 over a duration of 2500 s as seen the peak amplitudes of a y 0 95 are close to the amplitudes obtained by jeon and gharib 2001 for a cylinder mounted as an inverted pendulum furthermore the cylinder s lateral oscillations are nearly periodic over the time trace of 2500 s duration corresponding to an upper branch response to elucidate this phenomenon the two centre graphs of fig 8 c d plot these time series over a duration of only 10 s together with time series of hilbert transformed see khalak and williamson 1999 maxima of cylinder displacements in the stream wise direction a x max and the lateral direction a y max here identified by blue lines as seen peak values of lateral oscillation a y are about twice as large as peak values of stream wise oscillation a x the two bottom graphs of fig 8 e f present the corresponding histograms as distributed probability density function pdf of the cylinder s stream wise and lateral displacement maxima as seen the ax max distribution is almost symmetric and represent nearly a bell shaped curve about their mean values and ay max distribution is little bit deviate from the bell shaped curve this led us to conclude that a super upper branch vortex shedding pattern was generated jeon and gharib 2001 the two top graphs of fig 9 a b plot time series of normalized stream wise displacement a x normalized lateral displacement a y and their corresponding histograms as distributed probability density function pdf obtained for u r 4 64 over a duration of 2 500s the two bottom graphs time series of a x and a y and their corresponding probability density function pdf obtained for u r 3 88 albeit over a duration of only 1 500s for u r 4 64 peak values of a y are about twice as large as peak values of a x which is also substantiated by their corresponding histograms as seen the normal distributions of maximum displacements are not symmetric about their mean values and their spectral densities indicate that the oscillating amplitudes are not homogeneous two peaks of different heights occurring at different frequencies characterize a x max and a y max bimodal spectral densities and the value of the first peak exceeds the value of the second peak meaning that the highest peaks of a x max and a y max occurred more frequently than the lower peaks in this case the cylinder executed two oscillations namely a smaller one of amplitudes a x 0 07 and a y 0 30 and a larger one of amplitudes a x 0 17 and a y 0 50 according to jeon and gharib 2001 during transition from upper to initial branches the cylinder s lateral displacement is irregular and wang et al 2017 referred to this phenomenon as competing modes of vortex shedding as shown in figs 8 and 9 the cylinder oscillates nearly symmetrically and therefore we documented only the positive values however we considered the two values when estimating their uncertainties for u r 3 88 the time series of a x and a y displacements extended over 1 500s as seen oscillations of a x and a y are more regular than for the case of u r 4 64 this suggested that the cylinder executed initial branch oscillations although the peaks of a x and a y are homogeneous the corresponding spectral densities of a x max and a y max are nearly symmetric about their mean values due to the cylinder s complex two degrees of freedom motions we decided to describe in more detail not only their viv induced maxima but also their accompanying higher number of cycles fig 10 presents box plots of normalized cylinder displacements a x and a y and normalized cylinder accelerations a x g and a y g versus reduced velocities u r in these plots symbol represents the median value the middle horizontal line inside the box the mean value the upper and lower boundaries of a box 75 and 25 of the total values respectively and the small lines above and below a box the 91 and 9 of the total values respectively the top left box plots in fig 10 show that for reduced velocities of 1 3 u r 4 0 a x first increases then decreases and finally increases again cagney balabani 2013a and gonçalves et al 2013b documented a similar behaviour at low reduced velocities of 0 6 u r 1 94 the small lateral displacements were due to the absence of viv effects while the larger stream wise displacements were caused by the drag force acting on the cylinder as shown in fig 9 there are two peaks in the transverse direction of differing values however by increasing the ur as shown in fig 8 we noticed that there are also two peaks values for the transverse oscillation and they are close to each other fig 11 a b present the maximum normalized stream wise and lateral cylinder tip response with their uncertainties estimated based on the equations 10 and 11 versus reduced velocity values ur respectively the two bottom graphs of fig 10 c d plot normalized values of stream wise acceleration a x g and lateral acceleration a y g for low values of u r 1 3 the accelerations are negligibly small for u r 1 3 only the stream wise acceleration increases up to a x g 1 8 at u r 2 6 then it decreases to a x g 0 5 at u r 2 6 and finally continues to rise with increasing u r whereas the lateral acceleration rises continually with increasing values of u r the median value of a y g remains nearly the same for 0 6 u r 3 0 while for u r 4 2 a x g a y g for u r 5 18 a y g experiences a comparatively wide variation and consequently the associated inertial force acting on the cylinder also fluctuated a great deal for this u r 5 18 maximum a x g 8 5 and maximum a y g 7 6 the limited strength of the cantilevered teflon cylinder prevented us from considering higher values of u r and therefore we captured only the initial and upper branches of the associated viv our maximum response amplitudes compared closest to those of gonçalves et al 2013b as they considered different mass ratios we compared the case with a mass ratio closest to our mass ratio i e the case of m 1 0 and this for the two aspect ratios of ar 1 5 and 2 0 fig 11 plots against u r our maximum displacements a x max and a y max together with those of gonçalves et al 2013a however gonçalves et al 2013a investigated cylinders of differing aspect ratios ar 1 5 and 2 0 although their experimental setup also dealt with cantilevered cylinders oscillating in 2 dof and the mass ratios were close to those of our circular cylinder see table 2 this comparison helped us to assess the behaviour of different aspect ratio cantilevered cylinders oscillating in 2 dof as seen an increased aspect ratio caused larger oscillations consequentially our lateral displacements are higher than those for the lower aspect ratio cylinder however for low ur values our lateral displacements are close to those obtained for the other aspect ratio cylinders furthermore the functional relationship of our stream wise displacement has the same shape in general a higher aspect ratio caused the stream wise and lateral cylinder response to increase goncalves et al 2013b obtained a similar behaviour 6 displacement and acceleration trajectories fig 12 presents trajectories of the cylinder s normalized stream wise and lateral displacements and stream wise and lateral accelerations obtained at a point 10 mm below the top of the cylinder for reduced velocities of ur 5 18 4 44 3 90 3 24 2 60 and 1 94 black lines represent trajectories from all experiments obtained over the 30min duration red lines trajectories obtained over the last 10s duration recall that at low reduced velocities of 0 6 ur 1 94 the cylinder remained stationary because viv effects were absent basically these oscillation and acceleration trajectories change with increasing ur for the low ur 1 94 graphs k and l largely dominated in stream wise displacements and accelerations govern the oscillating displacements and accelerations for an increased value of ur 2 60 graph i the lateral displacement increases until the shape of the trajectories resemble that of a one sided compressed spring and then the acceleration trajectory starts to develop a new pattern graph j for u r 3 90 and 3 24 new patterns are formed as shown in graphs e and g gradually approaching the shape of a lying banana whereby in graphs f and h the lateral accelerations approach their stream wise values again forming a new shape a further increase of u r 4 44 graph c causes a figure eight lissajous shape to develop with a lateral displacement of about 0 5d while lateral accelerations graph d exceed the stream wise accelerations and the acceleration trajectory s shape is similar to the one captured by prastianto et al 2009 for the even higher value of u r 5 18 graph a the lissajous shape develops with a lateral displacement of about 0 8d which was also obtained by other researchers see williamson and jauvtis 2004 flemming and williamson 2005 cagney and balabani 2014 and gonçalves et al 2013a whereby the acceleration trajectories clearly take on a new shape graph b these authors also showed that the highest oscillation amplitude occurs at reduced velocities of 5 0 ur 9 0 and the associated figure eight shaped trajectory is evidence of coupling between stream wise and lateral cylinder responses 7 frequencies of the oscillating cylinder and the shed vortices as many other studies i e gonçalves et al 2015 stappenbelt and lalji 2008 and tödter et al 2021 assumed that f y s1 and f v y are equal we first set out to scrutinize this assumption at 22 points along the centreline behind the cylinder starting from a distance of 0 05d from the cylinder s top down to 10d at steps of 0 1d for the first ten points and continuing at steps of 1 0d for the next 12 steps all measurements were taken at the cylinder s mid plane t z l 0 5 fig 13 presents power spectral densities of stream wise and lateral cylinder accelerations psd ax and psd ay respectively and power spectral densities for the streamwise and spanwise velocities psd u and psd v respectively for reduced velocities of 5 18 4 54 3 89 3 24 2 60 and 1 94 black lines identify densities of stream wise accelerations and stream wise flow velocity frequencies blue lines densities of lateral accelerations and span wise flow velocity frequencies the shed frequencies f u x and f v y were obtained by evaluating their psds via fft analyses of stream wise and span wise flow velocities measured at these 22 points by the ldv system the ldv system tracked the velocities of small particles in the fluid flow as the number of particles arrived irregularly the measured velocities were measured at random time instants a special procedure performed the fft of the ldv signals see roberts and ajmani 1986 adrian and yao 1986 as these frequencies were the same at the entire 22 points for each u r only results for the one single point at t x d 2 5 were documented graph a of fig 13 presents the psds for acceleration of the cylinder while defining the first dominant frequency in the stream wise direction as f x s1 the first dominant frequency the lateral direction as f y s1 and the second dominant frequency in the lateral direction as f y s2 for u r 5 18 two values represent the f y s1 6 586 hz and the f y s2 19 760 hz while the f x s1 13 18 hz the f x s1 equals about twice f y s1 while the f x s1 equals about threefold the f y s2 graph b of fig 13 shows vortex shedding frequencies f u x and f v y the f u x almost equals as the f x s1 and f v y almost equals f y s1 but their amplitudes differ these frequency relationships ratios agree with those of prastianto et al 2009 graphs c and d of fig 13 present power spectral densities for f x s1 f y s1 f y s2 and f u x and f v y for u r 4 54 graphs e and f of fig 13 power spectral densities for u r 3 89 the frequency ratios are the same as those for u r 5 18 for u r 5 18 and 4 54 f x s1 f n x and f n y while f v y f n x and f n y for 3 89 u r 1 40 f x s1 f n x and f n y and there are no frequencies f v y according to khalak and williamson 1999 two trajectory shapes are captured namely a lissajous trajectory and an eight shaped trajectory this situation embodies a so called soft synchronization or lock in which corresponds to f y s1 2 f x s1 the elliptic trajectory at which f y s1 f x s1 is also consistent with the findings of wang et al 2017 prastianto et al 2009 pointed out that the difference in frequencies is responsible for the stream wise and lateral cylinder motions i e the shape of trajectory the graph a of fig 14 plots ratios f y s1 f x s1 and f y s2 f x s1 against u r for u r 1 94 and 2 59 the ratio f x s1 f y s1 1 while for u r 3 24 the ratio f x s1 f y s1 2 jeon and gharib 2001 and blevins and coughran 2009 came to the same conclusion and gonçalves et al 2013a confirmed this result for a cylinder with an aspect ratio greater than unity for u r 3 89 the ratio f y s2 f x s1 1 5 indicating the appearance of the second frequency f y s2 with f y s2 f y s1 3 vortex shedding frequencies are given as values normalized against the cylinder s natural frequencies i e as f x s f nx for the stream wise shedding frequency and as f x s1 f ny and f y s2 f ny for the first and second stream wise shedding frequencies respectively as shown the value of f x s f nx is close to unity for u r 1 94 and 2 60 and it then increases linearly to reach the highest value of 1 91 at u r 5 18 ratios f y s2 f ny are always higher than ratios f y s2 f ny for all values of u r the lock in case in our experiments occurred at f y s2 f ny 1 28 and f y s1 f ny 0 65 we obtained a more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon by observing that at a higher inlet flow velocity the increase of the shedding frequency was reduced more than for the case of a fixed cylinder and this resulted in a greater reduction of the strouhal number compared to the normal case of st 0 2 this was due to the relatively large cylinder oscillations which generated eddies that affected the viv vortices recall that the definition of the strouhal number is related to the vortex shedding frequency f s for a fixed cylinder strouhal 1878 roshko 1954 1955 introduced the universal wake strouhal number st for vortex shedding from bluff bodies which they defined it as follows 16 s t f s d u s t u u b d d for a vibrating cylinder he considered two shear layers of distance d one layer with a certain wake width and another layer with the velocity just outside the layers equal to u b which is the mean velocity at separation many researchers estimated the value of the d over a somewhat limited range of reynolds number see own and griffin 1978 later bearman 1967 used both splitter plates and base bleeding of low velocity air to separate the base flow and vortex formation bearman s results were in a good agreement with roshko s measurements recall that most of the cited studies assumed that st remains constant for different values of ur only a few researchers namely gonçalves et al 2015 stappenbelt and lalji 2008 and tödter et al 2021 tried to measure the strouhal like number for different inlet velocities and in contrast to our measurements they found that the strouhal like number decreases with diminishing ur in the present study we will apply the simple physics arguments introduced by roshko 1954 1955 due to difficult to measure or estimate the values of d and u b in our experiment we directly measured the shedding vortex frequency the stream wise vortex shedding frequancy based on that we caculated the st vs ur and the ratio of d u b vs re from the equation 13 as shown in fig 15 a b respectively fig 15 a plots the associated shedding vortex strouhal number st against ur as seen a straight line closely represents the decrease of the shedding vortex strouhal number with increasing ur fig 15 b shows the values of d u b which are decreased from 0 16 to 0 018 by increasing the re it can be concluded at least in our experiment that the effect of d u b will be increased by increasing the re until 5 x 104 and it will almost the same for ur 5 18 the a b and c graphs of fig 16 present psds for vortices shed at three positions behind the cylinder these positions were located at different water depths of tz l 0 90 0 75 and 0 50 these positions extended from the top of the cylinder to its bottom black stars in fig 16 d present the value of st for these three positions along the cylinder s length sumner et al 2004 considered the possibility of vortices being shed at varying frequencies along the height of a stationary cylinder especially at positions near the cylinder s free top end therefore for comparison purposes we included in this graph also the shedding frequencies they obtained for stationary cylinders with aspect ratios of ar 5 7 and 9 fig 16 b shows that an increasing ar led to a decreasing st this finding agreed with that of goncalves et al 2013a which meant that the strouhal number was affected by the aspect ratio they also found that the strouhal number for a cylinder with aspect ratios of 2 0 1 7 and 1 5 decreased at reduced velocities ranging from 0 5 ur 5 the experiments of leong and wei 2008 examining a high aspect ratio cylinder with a mass ratio below the critical mass ratio demonstrated that at low reduced velocities the strouhal number was almost equal to 0 21 while for reduced velocities 2 5 the strouhal number was reduced up to 0 16 for all cases the almost constant strouhal number of st 0 128 resulted for ur 4 54 graphs of fig 17 present psds for stream wise psd u and span wise psd v frequencies measured at the five locations of ty l 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 and 2 0 at tz l 0 50 on the central vertical grid plane and at tx l 2 5 behind the cylinder the vortex shedding frequencies are almost equal consequently the value of the strouhal number of is nearly equal i e st 0 14 at tz l 0 5 8 forces acting on the oscillating cylinder according to lighthill 1986 the stream wise and lateral forces due to the viv acting on an oscillating cylinder each consist of two components of which the first component is the stream wise and lateral added mass force f ax and f ay respectively this force is an inertial force caused by the cylinder s oscillating stream wise and lateral accelerations here calculated as follows 17 f a x c a m d x t 18 f a y c a m d y t where ca 1 0 is the cylinder s added mass coefficient md π ρ d 2 l 4 is its displaced fluid mass and x t and y t are respectively its stream wise and lateral accelerations fluid forces acting on a vibrating circular cylinder may be larger than those acting on a stationary cylinder khalak and williamson 1997 only the drag force acts on a stationary cylinder while on an oscillating cylinder two primary force components namely the drag and inertia forces act on the cylinder thus the fluid induced forces acting on oscillating cylinder are higher than the forces acting on a fixed cylinder the second component is the vortex force also known as the additional vorticity force caused by the vorticity in flow field around a cylinder and thereby generating shedded vortices however due to the difficulty of measuring this force it was here estimated by subtracting the inertial force from the total force acting on the cylinder following the procedure of goverdhan williamson 2000 and jeon and gharib 2001 we assumed that the cylinder s oscillations the total forces and the vortex force components are harmonic functions we measured forces directly for a cylinder of ar 17 8 m 1 78 and ζ 0 00492 thus the mass damping product m ζ 0 00876 fig 18 shows box plots of total stream wise force fx total lateral force fy and fig 19 shows of maximum and mean stream wise force coefficients cx total lateral force coefficients cy versus reduced velocity ur with their uncertainties the uncertainties were estimated based on the equations 8 and 9 fig 20 shows box plots of stream wise inertia force fax and lateral inertia force fay versus reduced velocity ur as seen in fig 18 total forces fx and fy increase with rising ur and fx is always higher than fy indicating that the stream wise forces had a significant effect on the lateral force thus the viv force component contributed significantly to the total force acting on the oscillating cylinder for 1 94 ur 2 6 12 56 103 re 18 84 103 the cx has a value of about 1 3 while for 2 6 ur 3 9 18 84 103 re 28 12 103 the cx decreases to about 1 4 for flows in the critical region at 1 3 104 re 4 104 these cx values are close to those for a stationary cylinder which is a cx 1 2 see schlichting 1979 however for ur 4 44 and 5 18 corresponding to re 4 4 104 and 5 104 the cx increases to 1 65 and 2 02 respectively for 1 94 ur 2 6 12 56 103 re 18 84 103 the cy has values of 0 945 and 1 164 respectively while for 2 6 ur 3 9 18 84 103 re 28 12 103 the cy decreases to 0 84 however for ur 4 44 and 5 18 corresponding to re 4 4 104 and 5 104 the cy increases to 1 13 and 1 41 respectively in our experiments the greatest mean force coefficient in the x direction was cx mean 1 02 at ur 5 18 its maximum value was cx max 2 02 the greatest mean force coefficient in the y direction was cy mean 0 56 at ur 5 18 its maximum value was cy max 1 4 fig 21 presents trajectories of the cylinder s normalized lateral and transverse displacements and lateral and transverse accelerations obtained at a point 10 mm below the top of the cylinder for reduced

recall that at low reduced velocities of 0 6 u r 1 94 the cylinder remained stationary because viv effects were absent basically these oscillation and acceleration trajectories change with increasing u r for the low u r 1 94 graphs k and l largely laterally dominated displacements and accelerations govern the oscillating displacements and accelerations for an increased value of u r 2 60 graph i the transverse displacement increases until the shape of the trajectories resemble that of a one sided compressed spring and then the acceleration trajectory starts to develop a new pattern graph j for u r 3 90 and 3 24 new patterns are formed as shown in graphs e and g gradually approaching the shape of a lying banana whereby in graphs f and h the transverse accelerations approach their lateral values again forming a new shape a further increase of u r 4 44 graph c causes a figure eight lissajous shape to develop with a transverse displacement of about 0 5d while transverse accelerations graph d exceed the lateral accelerations and the acceleration trajectory s shape is similar to the one captured by prastianto et al 2009 for the even higher value of u r 5 18 graph a the lissajous shape develops with a transverse displacement of about 0 8d which was also obtained by other researchers cagney and balabani 2014 flemming and williamson 2005 gonçalves et al 2013 williamson and jauvtis 2004 whereby the acceleration trajectories clearly take on a new shape graph b the fluctuating forces in the x direction were about 67 higher than those measured for a stationary cylinder the general measurement uncertainties were less than 3 5 but they were about 5 at the lower end of the measurement range see tödter et al 2021 recall that we determined the total force acting on the cylinder using the load cell to obtain the instantaneous potential inertial forces based on the accelerations recorded by the accelerometers 9 concluding remarks this extensive experimental investigation dealt with vortex induced vibration for a cantilevered circular cylinder free to oscillate in a circulating water channel decay tests in air and in water were performed to obtain cylinder first mode natural frequencies and associated damping ratios the first mode natural frequencies in air and water were obtained from the accelerometer and the piezoelectric transducer shedding frequencies in air and water in both directions were equal i e fxn fyn we found also that the ratio of natural frequencies in air and water were fny w fny a 0 875 which may have been due to the ratios between the m mtot 1 021 while we discovered that for the a cylinder with the same conditions and the same aspect ratio 18 75 as the fny w fny a 0 585 may be due to m mtot 0 278 a ldv system measured free stream velocity profiles at the inlet of the circulating water channel turbulence intensities for all inlet flow conditions were calculated for 0 355 0 020 m s u 1 503 0 079 m s the 2 245 0 33 tu95 1 985 0 24 the turbulance intensity decreased by increasing the inlet flow stream velocity u however the difference between the tu95 values with their uncertainty are small for are the flow stream velocities we compared our stream wise and lateral oscillations with the work of goncalves et al 2013b at different ar 1 5 and 5 at the same reduced velocities and almost mass ratio we observed at least in our experiment that by increasing the aspect ratio the values of the stream wise and stream wise cylinder responses increased oscillating cylinder accelerations displacements and force trajectories were presented as two dimensional trajectories for the even higher value of ur 5 18 the lissajous shape develops with a lateral displacement of about 0 8d which was also obtained by other whereby the acceleration trajectories clearly take on a new shape in a quite evident coupling between the stream wise and stream wise cylinder responses for different reduced velocities the corresponding oscillating cylinder frequencies in the stream wise and lateral directions were compared to shedding frequencies of streamwise and spanwise velocities the dominant shedding frequencies equalled the laterally oscillating frequencies of the cylinder only for 3 89 ur 5 18 for ur 3 24 the ratio of stream wise to lateral frequencies equalled two while for ur 1 943 and 2 591 this ratio equalled unity the normal strouhal number was calculated based on the shedding frequencies however for the oscillating cylinders a universal wake strouhal number st for a vortex shedding from bluff bodies was introduced by roshko 1954 1955 based on calculated frequencies of the span wise flow velocities measured by the ldv system the st for different reduced velocities decreased almost linearly from 0 201 at ur 0 6 to 0 141 at ur 5 18 at different depths and widths the strouhal number was almost constant for each reduced velocity considered we compared our results the st measured they obtained for stationary cylinders with aspect ratios of ar 5 7 and 9 measured by sumner et al 2004 increasing the aspect ratio led to a decreasing st which was also is agreed with that stated by goncalves et al 2013a the value of the strouhal number is affected by the aspect ratio value for the flow in critical region of 1 3 104 re 4 104 the drag coefficient of the oscillating cylinder was close to that of the stationary cylinder of c x 1 2 however for u r 4 44 and 5 18 corresponding to re 4 4 104 and 5 104 respectively the c x increased to 1 65 and 2 02 in the stream wise direction the fluctuating forces were about 66 67 higher than the forces measured for a stationary cylinder these experiments were performed to provide reliable benchmark data suitable for numerical validation of

20251,experimental investigations were performed for a circular cantilevered cylinder located in a circulating water channel the cylinder of mass ratio 1 78 and aspect ratio of 17 8 was vertically fixed at one end and its other end was free to oscillate in the stream wise and lateral directions the reduced velocities of the flow past the cylinder ranging from 0 65 to 5 18 corresponded to reynolds numbers between 6 38 103 and 5 1 104 at the inlet of the water channel a laser doppler velocimetry system measured stream wise and span wise flow velocity profiles and calculated the corresponding turbulence intensities for differing reduced velocities cylinder accelerations displacements and forces acting on the cylinder in the stream wise and lateral directions were measured vortex shedding frequencies were compared with cylinder response frequencies in the stream wise and lateral directions strouhal numbers were obtained at different water channel depths and widths coefficients of forces acting in the cylinder and trajectories of the cylinder s motions and accelerations were presented and analyzed the main objectives were to investigate the effect of relevant parameters for a cylinder oscillating in 2 dof such as measuring the universal wake strouhal number the universal strouhal number calculations were based on the vortex shedding frequency and then compared with published data directly measured shedding vortex frequencies at different locations around the cylinder and at different reduced velocities were compared with the frequencies of a stationary cylinder to obtain further insight of shedding vortex frequencies directly measured were cylinder accelerations cylinder oscillations and inertial forces acting on the cylinder and their trajectories the maximum oscillation recorded in the lateral direction of the cylinder recorded was 0 8d where d is the cylinder diameter at which the lock in phenomenon was observed and figure eight shaped lissajous trajectory patterns were captured the universal wake strouhal number for different reduced velocities decreased almost linearly from 0 201 at ur 0 6 to 0 141 at ur 5 18 at different depths and widths the strouhal number was almost constant for each reduced velocity considered another objective was to directly measure the forces coefficients the stream wise force coefficients were close to the coefficients for the stationary cylinder and at higher reynolds numbers they increased furthermore the uncertainty methods used here were explained in details and low uncertainties of measured values substantiated the reliability of our results the experiments provided reliable benchmark data suitable for numerical validation of vortex induced vibration for a circular cylinder

viv referred to as the oscillating motions caused by the flow past a slender body interacting with the fluid is part of the more general category of fluid structure interaction fsi this viv affects many engineering applications such as offshore oil platforms drilling risers offshore wind turbine towers heat exchanger tubes bridges factory chimneys etc due to the complexity of viv it seemed appropriate to summarize the most relevant parameters associated with viv research table 1 lists these non dimensional parameters over many years intensive surveys on the experimental investigation of viv were conducted see e g king 1977 sarpkaya 2004 bearman 1984 2011 and williamson and govardhan 2008 king 1977 sarpkaya 2004 bearman 1984 2011 williamson and govardhan 2008 and konstantinidis et al 2020 modelled the one degree of freedom 1 dof lateral motion of a rigid circular cylinder fixed at one end thus we first investigated a circular cylinder oscillating in 1 dof to improve the understanding of viv phenomena then we discussed and presented our results for a circular cylinder oscillating in 2 dof in table 1 1 1 the viv of a cylinder oscillating in 1 dof williamson and roshko 1988 at the reynolds number range of 300 r e 1000 performed experiments with a rigid cylinder forced to oscillate in the lateraldirection only 1 dof they introduced the term wavelength ratio defined as λ d u t e d where t e 1 f n is the cylinder s lateralnatural oscillation period this ratio is generally referred to as the reduced velocity u r they captured many vortex patterns occurring at this ratio such as a single vortex s a pair of vortices p a karman vortex street consisting of two single vortices 2s and when λ d exceeds a certain value the vortex pairs that change their sign and deviate from the wake s centreline creating two pair of vortices 2p according to williamson and roshko 1988 this altered vortex pattern is responsible for an abrupt change of the measured lift force on a cylinder they also discussed the development of p s and 2s 2p vortex patterns occurring at different reduced velocities and they mapped regions of vortex patterns generated for cylinders of differing vibration in the stream wise direction fujarra et al 2001 exploring viv of an elastomeric cylinder supported on a spring and enforced in the stream wise direction by flexible aluminium plates found that the response was similar to the elastic re strained rigid cylinder and that three responses occur at low mass damping they suggested scrutinizing the wake using the piv system to determine the surrounding wake vortices williamson and jauvtis 2004 flemming and williamson 2005 and cagney and balabani 2014 showed that stream wise oscillations indeed affect these lateraloscillations for cylinders of low mass ratio for a rigid cylinder of mass ratio less than six attached to a pendulum on a horizontal plate over the tank williamson and jauvtis 2004 found that the stream wise oscillations surprisingly increase the lateraloscillations massively with amplitudes up to three times larger than the amplitudes of the stream wise oscillations they used a particle image velocimetry piv system to capture the shape of the vortex pattern behind the rigid cylinder oscillating in the stream wise and lateraldirections in each half cycle the two degrees of freedom motions 2 dof generated a triplet of strong new vortices referred to as the 2t mode which resembled the 2p mode instead of the 2p mode obtained by williamson and roshko 1988 the 2t vortices increase the energy transferred from the fluid to the cylinder and amplify the cylinder s oscillation in both directions they discovered that by accounting for the additional degree of freedom the cylinder oscillates in three modes this new response branch of the 2t mode is known as the super upper su branch 1 2 the viv of a cylinder oscillate in 2 dof examining a rigid pivoted cylinder free to oscillated in 2 dof flemming and williamson 2005 captured a pattern consisting of a pair of co rotating vortices of the same sign in each half of the cycle called the 2c mode cagney and balabani 2014 examined a pivoted cylinder free to vibrate in 2 dof and compared results with their pervious results obtained with a cylinder free to move in the stream wise direction only see cagney and balabani 2013a b they noticed that the additional degree of freedom affects the overall dynamics of the cylinder wake system the phase shift between the lateral and stream wise oscillations decreases linearly with increasing u r and the measured very small normalized stream wise and lateral responses were less than 0 1d another investigation of pesce and fujarra 2000 of a clamped flexible cylinder for the same damping as that of khalak and williamson 1996 1997 yielded a jump characterized by lower and upper branches occurring at u r 8 3 blevins and coughran 2009 noticed that the amplitudes of an elastically supported rigid cylinder for the 2 dof response exceed those of the 1 dof response for the same damping and mass sanchis et al 2008 testing a circular cylinder fixed by a torsional spring and free to move in 2 dof arrived at the same conclusion in that the oscillations increase dramatically for a cylinder mass ratio of less than six the study of prastianto et al 2009 of a rigid cylinder free to vibrate in 2 dof did not notice incremental oscillations at low values of u r the 2d oscillation trajectories at the tip of the cylinder were measured and drawn for 1 94 ur 6 79 and maximum re 18000 they did not capture the famous shape of figure of eight trajectory other researchers studied the free cantilevered cylinder for a mass ratio of less than the critical mass ratio jeon and gharib 2001 investigated a cylinder under forced stream wise and lateralvibration to represent realistic motions they observed the 2p vortex mode only in the lateralmotion with a maximum displacement of half of the cylinder diameter and a phase shift that resulted in a figure eight shaped lissajous trajectory pattern according to sarpkaya 1995 for a bi harmonically oscillating structure such as a cylinder experiencing stream wise and lateral motions the drag coefficient and the span excitation increase at larger ratios of f nx f ny where f nx and f ny are the cylinder s natural frequency in the stream wise x direction and the lateral y direction respectively according to williamson and jauvtis 2004 govardhan williamson 2000 2002 obtained the theoretical critical mass ratio of m crit 0 52 of a cylinder below this value the synchronization regime becomes huge leong and wei 2008 studied the forced 2 dof response of a circular cylinder of mass ratio m 0 45 which is less than the critical mass ratio using the piv and a laser induced fluorescence lif system to visualize the flow obtained no lower branch vortex patterns nevertheless they captured the p s wake mode our recent work tödter et al 201 9a b and 2021 dealt with viv induced flow of a fully and a partially submerged circular cylinder in a water channel to measure the dynamic response by using a triaxial accelerometer and by digital image correlation dic for the submerged cylinder the mass ratio of m 0 56 was close to the theoretical critical mass ratio see govardhan and c williamson 2000 2002 for the partially submerged cylinder it was m 0 72 peak to peak lateral responses for the fully and the partially submerged cylinders exceeded peak to peak stream wise responses kheirkhah et al 2012 studied viv for a pivoted and a rigid circular cylinder forced to oscillate in 2 dof in flows at re 2100 for a range of 1 94 ur 6 79 their results showed that in the synchronization regime the frequencies in both directions are equal to the body natural frequencies and the cylinder oscillates with elliptic trajectories they introduced the mathematical model to describe the elliptic and figure eight shaped trajectories they observed that the elliptic trajectory occurs fx fy fn and the figure eight shaped trajectory at fx 2fy kheirkhah et al 2016 used the lif technique to visualize the wake patterns and two laser based displacement sensors to measure the dynamic response of an oscillating circular cylinder they studied the wake patterns for the elliptic cylinder trajectory only considering a cylinder with m 15 9 and ar 0 645 the experiment was done for two cases ζ 0 007 and 0 01 at ur 6 6 corresponding to re 2100 the investigated different wake modes along the length of cylinder span occurred at tz l 0 35 and 0 16 of the cylinder length respectively they captured two counter rotating pairs of vortices 2p per cycle at both positions el sheshtawy et al 2021 studied experimentally and numerically the lock in case for a cantilevered cylinder oscillated in 2 dof in flows that induced lock in conditions at re 5 104 they specified the lock in case when the vortex shedding frequency is close or equal to a natural frequency of vibration of the cylinder we summarised relevant published results dealing with a circular cylinder oscillating in 2 dof in table 2 this table lists the main parameters according to the type of restoring characteristic fluid flow medium aspect ratio mass ratio and degrees of freedom 1 3 strouhal number for the oscillating cylinders as listed in table 1 the definition of the strouhal number st is based on the vortex shedding frequency for a fixed cylinder fs for an oscillating cylinder the universal wake strouhal number st was introduced by roshko 1954 1955 roshko s investigation considered also the effect of a wake splitter plate attached to a fixed circular cylinder whereby the st is based on the shedding vortex frequency of the oscillating cylinder fv y only few studies considered the variation of the strouhal number of an oscillating cylinder gonçalves et al 2013b 2015 assumed that the lateral frequency fy s1 equals the strouhal frequency fv y based on this assumption they calculated the strouhal like number stl fy s1d u for low mass ratio cylinders with a wide range of cylinder aspect ratios later on tödter et al 2021 used the same concept to calculate the stl and compared the results with the normal st for three different reduced velocities sumner et al 2004 obtained the strouhal number for stationary cylinders of different aspect ratios ranging between three and nine stappenbelt and lalji 2008 estimating the strouhal number for various cylinders oscillating in that 1 dof of mass ratios between 2 36 and 12 96 observed that the strouhal number differs for each mass ratio the m 1 04 the maximum re 18600 1 4 main objectives here we experimentally investigated a acircular cantilever cylinder oscillated in oscillate in the stream wise and lateral directions the cylinder of mass ratio 1 78 was vertically fixed at one end and its other end was free to 2 dof the reduced velocities of the flow past the cylinder ranging from 0 65 to 5 18 corresponded to reynolds numbers between 6 38 103 and 5 10 104 at the inlet of the water channel a laser doppler velocimetry system measured streamwise and spanwise flow velocity profiles and calculated the corresponding turbulence intensities also most studies concentrated on the shape of the vortex shedding patterns and its effect on the oscillating displacement and their trajectories to our knowledge estimating the strouhal number for the oscillating cylinder at various reduced velocities based on the shedding frequency was never undertaken to fill this gap we measured the universal wake strouhal number for a cylinder freely oscillating in the transverse and lateral directions based on the shedding frequency at different reduced velocities a question that has not been answered till now is do the differing vortex shapes cause the strouhal frequency and the associated strouhal number to change at different locations along the cylinder to answer this question we systematically measured the strouhal number at different water depths around the cylinder in addition we calculated the shedding vortex frequencies and we compared these with frequencies of the cylinder s oscillating lateral and transverse displacements furthermore we directly measured the forces acting on the cylinder in the streamwise and lateral directions calculated the inertia forces and determined the streamwise and lateral coefficients and compare the results for the stationary cylinder from the literature review 2 experimental setup physical tests were conducted in the circulating water channel of the institute of ship technology ocean engineering and transport systems ismt of the university of duisburg essen the channel s test section measures 6 0 m in length 1 47 m in width and 0 67 m in depth the top graph of fig 1 presents the configuration of this circulating water channel and its equipment glass side walls and a plexiglas covered top facilitated optical measurements as shown in fig 1 the vertical flexible hollow cantilevered cylinder made of teflon had an outer diameter of 31 4 mm an inner diameter of 15 0 mm and a length of 600 mm its aspect ratio was ar 17 8 and its mass ratio was m 1 78 a distance of 70 0 mm separated the free end of the cylinder and the plexiglas cover which was far enough away to eliminate boundary layer effects the reynolds number of the flow past the cylinder ranged between 6 38 103 re 51 02 104 underneath its top a triaxial disynet da3802 accelerometer was located inside the cylinder to record oscillating accelerations a three dimensional printed plastic cap sealed with o rings prevented water entry the accelerometer measured static and dynamic accelerations up to 15g where g is the gravitational acceleration the accelerometer s size was 15 mm by 15 mm by 15 mm and it weighed of 15 0 g the accelerometer signals were sampled using the data acquisition system hbm quantumx with a sampling rate of 2400 hz the vertical distance between the accelerometer s centreline and its tip was about 10 mm the connecting cables were guided through the cylinder wall a distance of 80 mm over its lower end and on top of the channel bottom to prevent interactions between cabling and cylinder excitation prastianto at al 2009 and tödter et al 2019a b 2021 employed the same technique to measure cylinder dynamic responses a stainless steel sleeve of 15 mm outer diameter and 70 mm length having a central m8 threaded blind hole was glued inside the lower end of the cylinder this sleeve connected the cylinder to a schunk theta si 1500 240 force torque load cell sensor having a force resolution of 0 5 n a measurement range of 500 n and a torque resolution of 0 05 nm with a measurement range of 240 nm the load cell located underneath the water channel in a separate box and connected to its data acquisition card supplied by the manufacture was calibrated to monitor six degrees of freedom forces and torques an ni pcie 6320 multifunctional i o device collected the data fukuoka et al 2016 employed the same measurement method to measure forces acting on a stationary cylinder for each test an offset measurement for the accelerometer and the load cell was previously carried out a two dimensional backward dantec ldv system measured stream wise and spanwise velocities ux and uy the system s two laser wave lengths were 514 5 and 488 nm the water in the circulating water channel was seeded with tiny hollow glass spheres of diameters ranging between 9 and 13 μm the focal length of the fibre flow probe was 800 mm its beam diameter was 2 2 mm and the transit length of its measuring volume was 0 0991 mm the ldv s probe was mounted on a triaxially traversing system which moved with an accuracy of 0 01 mm 620 mm in the stream wise and lateral directions and 690 mm in the vertical direction at varying steps with a velocity of up to 25 mm s the dantec flow software and the stepper motor unit isel c142 4 automatically controlled the system s lateral motion the origin of the coordinate system defining the lateral motion was located at the cylinder s centre the random seeds passing through the ldv measuring volume recorded flow velocities at random time instances these velocities interpolated over equal time steps obtained a constant sampling rate a fast fourier transformation fft then determined the shedding frequencies see roberts and ajmani 1986 and zhang 2010 for additional details of the ldv system s measuring technique and its application see zhang 2010 and albrecht et al 2013 the ldv system the accelerometer the load cell and the differential pressure sensor were synchronized to measure the flow velocities the corresponding cylinder responses and the forces acting on the cylinder the free stream velocity was measured locally in front of the cylinder using a schiltknecht mini water 20 flow meter and behind the cylinder using a pitot tube and a krohne optibar dp 7060 c 30 differential pressure sensor the pitot tube connected to the data acquisition system measured differential pressures at velocities up to 2 40 m s with a resolution of 0 0106 m s and an accuracy of 98 08 the frequently measured water temperature ranged from 15 5 0 1 to 18 4 0 1 c 2 1 uncertainty of experimental measurements measurement accuracy generally refers to the relative agreement between experimental data and comparative true values the difference between the true value and the measured value is the measurement error in most measuring cases the true value of the measured quantity is unknown therefore the error of the measured value has to be estimated and the estimation of this error is called the measurement uncertainty coleman et al 1995 we obtained our estimated uncertainties by following the guide of the expression of uncertainty in measurements of the international organization for standardization iso and the recommendations of the ais standard s 071 1995 we assumed that all our measured results were gaussian distributed thus the statistical properties of a gaussian distribution of a sample of measurements consist of a finite number of measurements drawn from their distribution where m is the mean value of a set of measurements n calculated as follows 1 m m i n f o r i 1 2 n and δ is the standard deviation calculated as follows 2 δ m i m n 1 f o r i 1 2 n for a set of measured values approximately 68 of the actual values are within one standard deviation δ for a 95 confidence level the actual values will be within 1 96 δ and for 99 7 confidence level the actual values will be within 3 00 δ recall that the mean value of the measured m of a sample population of a repeating measuring number z is drawn from this same the gaussian parent distribution it is normally distributed with a standard deviation δ z then the expected portability prob of the measured value within 95 is expressed as follows 3 p r o b m 1 96 δ z μ m 1 96 δ z 0 95 the uncertainty for a parameter m which depends on many parameters m i is obtained as follows 4 m f m 1 m 2 m 3 m i f o r i 1 2 n the uncertainty for a parameter m is u m and it is evaluated as follows 5 u m m m i u m i f o r i 1 2 n where u m 1 is the uncertainty for each measured variable m i the above equation was used to estimate the uncertainty of relevant parameters such as u c x u c y and st the uncertainty of the strouhal number u s t is estimated as follows 6 u s t d u f s y 1 u 2 d u d u 2 f s y 1 d u u u 2 2 where u f s y 1 u d and u u are the uncertainties of the shedding frequency the cylinder diameter and in inlet free stream velocity respectively the u s t is then rewritten as follows 7 u s t s t u f s y 1 f s y 1 2 u d d 2 u u u 2 and for the force in x direction coefficient cx the uncertainty u c x is as follows 8 u c x c x u f x f x 2 2 u u u 2 u ρ ρ 2 u a a 2 where u x u u u ρ and u a are the uncertainties of the force in x direction the inlet free stream velocity the fluid density can be neglected and the cylinders projected area respectively for the force in y direction coefficient c y the uncertainty u c y is as follows 9 u c y c y u f y f y 2 2 u u u 2 u ρ ρ 2 u a a 2 where u l is the uncertainty in the lift force for simplicity we neglected the uncertainty of the density u ρ the uncertainty in normalized oscillation in y direction uay can be expressed as follows 10 u a y a y u y y 2 u d d 2 and for the uncertainty in normalized oscillation in y direction u ay as follows 11 u a x a x u x x 2 u d d 2 where u y u x u d are the uncertainties in measuring the lateral and stream wise cylinder response and the uncertainties in measuring the cylinder diameter the uncertainty in normalized vertical position in the channel along the cylinder s length u t z l as follows 12 u t z l t z l u t z t z 2 u l l 2 where u t z and t z are the uncertainty in the moving the transverse system in z direction and the position in z direction respectively the u l and l are the uncertainty in the measuring the depth and the depth of the circulation channel respectively the estimation of the total error in the measurement is the summation of two components a systematic bias error and a random precision error the systematic error is the fixed error in the measuring tool and it be always for any measurement however the random error is the error due to the measurement procedures and it will be different for each measurement see coleman and steele 2018 the pervious description was used to estimate the random error and the systematic was supplied by the manufacture for each measuring tools matlab codes processed measured data and estimated measurement uncertainties 3 natural frequencies and damping ratios ten repetitive decay tests in air and in water obtained the cylinder s natural frequencies and the associated damping ratios see tödter et al 2019b 2021 for each test run the cylinder was returned to its rest position so that hysteresis effects did not have to be considered to remove unwanted signal noise the cylinder s decaying response was low pass filtered at 400 hz and high pass filtered at 4 hz an fft analysis of the cylinder s stream wise and lateral acceleration signals from all ten repetitive decay tests evaluated the power spectral density psd fig 2 presents samples of repetitive time series and the associated psd of the cylinder s decaying stream wise acceleration a x obtained from three such tests in air and in water these spectral densities demonstrated that peak values of stream wise accelerations whether obtained in air or in water all occurred at nearly the same frequency the percentage difference between mean frequencies was only about 2 8 in air and about 0 5 in water theoretically stream wise and lateral natural frequencies are equal because of the cylinder s symmetric geometry to estimate the uncertainties of natural frequencies and damping ratios we calculated uncertainties based on all ten repetitive measurements as described above table 3 summarizes our resulting mean values of stream wise natural frequency f nx lateral natural frequency f ny damping ratio ζ and their uncertainties based on a confidence interval of 95 as the decay of cylinder amplitudes oscillating at the natural frequency in water was largely due to hydrodynamic added mass effects damping ratios were measured in air because the air s low density led to more accurate approximations of natural frequencies konstantinidis et al 2020 therefore we dispensed with estimating damping ratios in water the decay test was evaluated also using the 6 dof piezoelectric transducer fig 3 presents three samples of the cylinder s natural frequencies in air and in water their measurement uncertainties were almost the same as the uncertainty limits of the accelerometer see fig 2 carlucci and brown 1983 used the same physical analogy to explain the small difference between the cylinders natural frequencies in air and water they introduced the ratio between the total mass and the single phase liquid hydrodynamic mass and described it as follows 13 r m d i s m t o t where mdis is the liquid displacement mass of the cylinder and mtot is the sum of the cylinder mass and mdis altering a cylinder s mass ratio affected its natural frequency and consequently also the associated ratio of the natural frequencies in air and in water table 4 lists results of decay tests with two cylinders one made of teflon and the other made of polyvinyl chloride pvc the pvc circular cylinder form our last experimental tödter et al 2021 the tests were performed under the same conditions in the same circulation channel diameter and aspect ratio of both cylinders were the same and the measurement tools used for the tests were identical as seen the weight the cylinders are made of affected the natural frequency ratio between in the air and water specifically for the teflon cylinder the measured ratio fny w fny a equals 0 875 and for the pvc cylinder with its lower mass ratio the measured ratio fny w fny a equals 0 585 the cylinder s oscillating displacements were determined by integrating measured accelerations twice by measuring the rate of the decaying amplitudes of this underdamped system we obtained the logarithmic decrement δ which is related to the damping ratio by the following expression 14 δ 1 n ln y n y n 1 2 π ζ 1 ζ 2 where y n y n 1 are two successive oscillation peaks and n is any integer number of successive positive amplitude peaks see blevins 2009 and tödter et al 2021 fig 4 plots the decrements from five successive amplitudes versus the root mean squares r m s term of 1 which is a measure of the system s damping ratio ζ obtained from four exemplary tests of the cylinder oscillating in air the straight dotted line drawn through these decaying amplitudes represented the linear fit of the measured damping induced amplitude decay the difference between linearly predicted values and measurements was based on a maximum residual of 0 0229 the generally favourable correlation confirmed that the system s damping was linear 4 inlet velocity profiles and turbulence intensities to acquire fluid structure interaction benchmark data needed to validate numerical predictions was challenging because it was difficult to simultaneously obtain structural deformations and the associated velocity profiles and turbulence intensities see park et al 2008 for each case the ldv system was employed to measure stream wise velocities u x and span wise velocities u y of the water circulating in the channel as shown in the lower graphs of fig 5 the top graph of fig 5 schematically portrays the circulating water channel showing the position of the vertical grid plane this plane was positioned a distance of ten cylinder diameters in front of the cylinder i e at a normalized distance of t x d 10 from the cylinder s centreline and it extended horizontally from t y d 5 to t y d 5 and a vertically from t z d 5 to t z d 5 from the central free stream flow direction flow velocities were measured at each of the 11 horizontal grid line intersection points on this plane the ldv s tracker captured the free stream velocities from about 1000 particles which required about 30s for each spatially measured point for the seven free stream inlet velocities of u 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 0 1 2 1 4 and 1 6 m s these measurements were performed at seven depths which were specified by the normalized vertical positions of t z l 0 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 a total of 77 average mean free stream velocities u xm were obtained on 11 horizontal gird points and plotted against horizontal distance t y d in fig 5 these plots represent profiles of mean free stream velocities u xm obtained for the seven inlet velocities u x at the seven vertical depth positions t z l the seven plots in fig 6 corresponding to the seven free stream inlet velocities we considered show that although free stream velocities decrease with increasing depth decreasing t z l this decrease is about 10 between t z l 0 9 and t z l 0 3 this decrease was significant because the variation of u xm over t y d for each t z l is less than 3 for all inlet velocities u the variation of u xm at different depths t z l led us to consider them as varying with depth the associated uncertainties of the ldv system s measurements were determined by satisfying the ittc recommendations park et al 2008 the resulting uncertainty based on all measured velocities turned out to be between 0 1 and 0 2 for our cases we assumed the uncertainty to equal the larger value of 0 2 thus we determined values of the mean free stream inlet velocity u xm as listed in table 5 where u 95 is the sum of u xm and its estimated uncertainty based on the 95 confidence level the spanwise velocity u y for each point on the grid plane was also measured their values turned out to be less than 0 02 m s in all cases and therefore neglected the r m s values of free stream velocity u x rms were less than 0 006 m s the r m s values of the spanwise velocities u y rms less than 0 002 m s in addition we estimated the uncertainty of the vertical plane s dimension to be 0 000625 mm the estimate of turbulence intensity at each point t u based on the stream wise and lateral velocities measured in the water channel was calculated as follows 15 t u 0 5 u x 2 u y 2 u x m 2 u y m 2 where u x 2 and u y 2 are the r m s values of the fluctuating velocities in the streamwise and spanwise directions respectively recall that for each inlet velocity u this turbulence intensity was calculated at all 77 points on the vertical grid plane table 5 lists values of free stream velocity u its uncertainty u 95 and the associated turbulence intensity with its uncertainty tu95 based on confidence interval of 95 fig 7 presents the associated histograms of turbulence intensities and the normally distributed psd of turbulence intensity for each of the seven inlet velocities considered as seen the normal distributions of tu turned out to be symmetric about their mean values 5 stream wise and lateral cylinder response the fig 8 a b plot time series of normalized stream wise displacement a x and lateral displacement a y obtained for u r 5 18 over a duration of 2500 s as seen the peak amplitudes of a y 0 95 are close to the amplitudes obtained by jeon and gharib 2001 for a cylinder mounted as an inverted pendulum furthermore the cylinder s lateral oscillations are nearly periodic over the time trace of 2500 s duration corresponding to an upper branch response to elucidate this phenomenon the two centre graphs of fig 8 c d plot these time series over a duration of only 10 s together with time series of hilbert transformed see khalak and williamson 1999 maxima of cylinder displacements in the stream wise direction a x max and the lateral direction a y max here identified by blue lines as seen peak values of lateral oscillation a y are about twice as large as peak values of stream wise oscillation a x the two bottom graphs of fig 8 e f present the corresponding histograms as distributed probability density function pdf of the cylinder s stream wise and lateral displacement maxima as seen the ax max distribution is almost symmetric and represent nearly a bell shaped curve about their mean values and ay max distribution is little bit deviate from the bell shaped curve this led us to conclude that a super upper branch vortex shedding pattern was generated jeon and gharib 2001 the two top graphs of fig 9 a b plot time series of normalized stream wise displacement a x normalized lateral displacement a y and their corresponding histograms as distributed probability density function pdf obtained for u r 4 64 over a duration of 2 500s the two bottom graphs time series of a x and a y and their corresponding probability density function pdf obtained for u r 3 88 albeit over a duration of only 1 500s for u r 4 64 peak values of a y are about twice as large as peak values of a x which is also substantiated by their corresponding histograms as seen the normal distributions of maximum displacements are not symmetric about their mean values and their spectral densities indicate that the oscillating amplitudes are not homogeneous two peaks of different heights occurring at different frequencies characterize a x max and a y max bimodal spectral densities and the value of the first peak exceeds the value of the second peak meaning that the highest peaks of a x max and a y max occurred more frequently than the lower peaks in this case the cylinder executed two oscillations namely a smaller one of amplitudes a x 0 07 and a y 0 30 and a larger one of amplitudes a x 0 17 and a y 0 50 according to jeon and gharib 2001 during transition from upper to initial branches the cylinder s lateral displacement is irregular and wang et al 2017 referred to this phenomenon as competing modes of vortex shedding as shown in figs 8 and 9 the cylinder oscillates nearly symmetrically and therefore we documented only the positive values however we considered the two values when estimating their uncertainties for u r 3 88 the time series of a x and a y displacements extended over 1 500s as seen oscillations of a x and a y are more regular than for the case of u r 4 64 this suggested that the cylinder executed initial branch oscillations although the peaks of a x and a y are homogeneous the corresponding spectral densities of a x max and a y max are nearly symmetric about their mean values due to the cylinder s complex two degrees of freedom motions we decided to describe in more detail not only their viv induced maxima but also their accompanying higher number of cycles fig 10 presents box plots of normalized cylinder displacements a x and a y and normalized cylinder accelerations a x g and a y g versus reduced velocities u r in these plots symbol represents the median value the middle horizontal line inside the box the mean value the upper and lower boundaries of a box 75 and 25 of the total values respectively and the small lines above and below a box the 91 and 9 of the total values respectively the top left box plots in fig 10 show that for reduced velocities of 1 3 u r 4 0 a x first increases then decreases and finally increases again cagney balabani 2013a and gonçalves et al 2013b documented a similar behaviour at low reduced velocities of 0 6 u r 1 94 the small lateral displacements were due to the absence of viv effects while the larger stream wise displacements were caused by the drag force acting on the cylinder as shown in fig 9 there are two peaks in the transverse direction of differing values however by increasing the ur as shown in fig 8 we noticed that there are also two peaks values for the transverse oscillation and they are close to each other fig 11 a b present the maximum normalized stream wise and lateral cylinder tip response with their uncertainties estimated based on the equations 10 and 11 versus reduced velocity values ur respectively the two bottom graphs of fig 10 c d plot normalized values of stream wise acceleration a x g and lateral acceleration a y g for low values of u r 1 3 the accelerations are negligibly small for u r 1 3 only the stream wise acceleration increases up to a x g 1 8 at u r 2 6 then it decreases to a x g 0 5 at u r 2 6 and finally continues to rise with increasing u r whereas the lateral acceleration rises continually with increasing values of u r the median value of a y g remains nearly the same for 0 6 u r 3 0 while for u r 4 2 a x g a y g for u r 5 18 a y g experiences a comparatively wide variation and consequently the associated inertial force acting on the cylinder also fluctuated a great deal for this u r 5 18 maximum a x g 8 5 and maximum a y g 7 6 the limited strength of the cantilevered teflon cylinder prevented us from considering higher values of u r and therefore we captured only the initial and upper branches of the associated viv our maximum response amplitudes compared closest to those of gonçalves et al 2013b as they considered different mass ratios we compared the case with a mass ratio closest to our mass ratio i e the case of m 1 0 and this for the two aspect ratios of ar 1 5 and 2 0 fig 11 plots against u r our maximum displacements a x max and a y max together with those of gonçalves et al 2013a however gonçalves et al 2013a investigated cylinders of differing aspect ratios ar 1 5 and 2 0 although their experimental setup also dealt with cantilevered cylinders oscillating in 2 dof and the mass ratios were close to those of our circular cylinder see table 2 this comparison helped us to assess the behaviour of different aspect ratio cantilevered cylinders oscillating in 2 dof as seen an increased aspect ratio caused larger oscillations consequentially our lateral displacements are higher than those for the lower aspect ratio cylinder however for low ur values our lateral displacements are close to those obtained for the other aspect ratio cylinders furthermore the functional relationship of our stream wise displacement has the same shape in general a higher aspect ratio caused the stream wise and lateral cylinder response to increase goncalves et al 2013b obtained a similar behaviour 6 displacement and acceleration trajectories fig 12 presents trajectories of the cylinder s normalized stream wise and lateral displacements and stream wise and lateral accelerations obtained at a point 10 mm below the top of the cylinder for reduced velocities of ur 5 18 4 44 3 90 3 24 2 60 and 1 94 black lines represent trajectories from all experiments obtained over the 30min duration red lines trajectories obtained over the last 10s duration recall that at low reduced velocities of 0 6 ur 1 94 the cylinder remained stationary because viv effects were absent basically these oscillation and acceleration trajectories change with increasing ur for the low ur 1 94 graphs k and l largely dominated in stream wise displacements and accelerations govern the oscillating displacements and accelerations for an increased value of ur 2 60 graph i the lateral displacement increases until the shape of the trajectories resemble that of a one sided compressed spring and then the acceleration trajectory starts to develop a new pattern graph j for u r 3 90 and 3 24 new patterns are formed as shown in graphs e and g gradually approaching the shape of a lying banana whereby in graphs f and h the lateral accelerations approach their stream wise values again forming a new shape a further increase of u r 4 44 graph c causes a figure eight lissajous shape to develop with a lateral displacement of about 0 5d while lateral accelerations graph d exceed the stream wise accelerations and the acceleration trajectory s shape is similar to the one captured by prastianto et al 2009 for the even higher value of u r 5 18 graph a the lissajous shape develops with a lateral displacement of about 0 8d which was also obtained by other researchers see williamson and jauvtis 2004 flemming and williamson 2005 cagney and balabani 2014 and gonçalves et al 2013a whereby the acceleration trajectories clearly take on a new shape graph b these authors also showed that the highest oscillation amplitude occurs at reduced velocities of 5 0 ur 9 0 and the associated figure eight shaped trajectory is evidence of coupling between stream wise and lateral cylinder responses 7 frequencies of the oscillating cylinder and the shed vortices as many other studies i e gonçalves et al 2015 stappenbelt and lalji 2008 and tödter et al 2021 assumed that f y s1 and f v y are equal we first set out to scrutinize this assumption at 22 points along the centreline behind the cylinder starting from a distance of 0 05d from the cylinder s top down to 10d at steps of 0 1d for the first ten points and continuing at steps of 1 0d for the next 12 steps all measurements were taken at the cylinder s mid plane t z l 0 5 fig 13 presents power spectral densities of stream wise and lateral cylinder accelerations psd ax and psd ay respectively and power spectral densities for the streamwise and spanwise velocities psd u and psd v respectively for reduced velocities of 5 18 4 54 3 89 3 24 2 60 and 1 94 black lines identify densities of stream wise accelerations and stream wise flow velocity frequencies blue lines densities of lateral accelerations and span wise flow velocity frequencies the shed frequencies f u x and f v y were obtained by evaluating their psds via fft analyses of stream wise and span wise flow velocities measured at these 22 points by the ldv system the ldv system tracked the velocities of small particles in the fluid flow as the number of particles arrived irregularly the measured velocities were measured at random time instants a special procedure performed the fft of the ldv signals see roberts and ajmani 1986 adrian and yao 1986 as these frequencies were the same at the entire 22 points for each u r only results for the one single point at t x d 2 5 were documented graph a of fig 13 presents the psds for acceleration of the cylinder while defining the first dominant frequency in the stream wise direction as f x s1 the first dominant frequency the lateral direction as f y s1 and the second dominant frequency in the lateral direction as f y s2 for u r 5 18 two values represent the f y s1 6 586 hz and the f y s2 19 760 hz while the f x s1 13 18 hz the f x s1 equals about twice f y s1 while the f x s1 equals about threefold the f y s2 graph b of fig 13 shows vortex shedding frequencies f u x and f v y the f u x almost equals as the f x s1 and f v y almost equals f y s1 but their amplitudes differ these frequency relationships ratios agree with those of prastianto et al 2009 graphs c and d of fig 13 present power spectral densities for f x s1 f y s1 f y s2 and f u x and f v y for u r 4 54 graphs e and f of fig 13 power spectral densities for u r 3 89 the frequency ratios are the same as those for u r 5 18 for u r 5 18 and 4 54 f x s1 f n x and f n y while f v y f n x and f n y for 3 89 u r 1 40 f x s1 f n x and f n y and there are no frequencies f v y according to khalak and williamson 1999 two trajectory shapes are captured namely a lissajous trajectory and an eight shaped trajectory this situation embodies a so called soft synchronization or lock in which corresponds to f y s1 2 f x s1 the elliptic trajectory at which f y s1 f x s1 is also consistent with the findings of wang et al 2017 prastianto et al 2009 pointed out that the difference in frequencies is responsible for the stream wise and lateral cylinder motions i e the shape of trajectory the graph a of fig 14 plots ratios f y s1 f x s1 and f y s2 f x s1 against u r for u r 1 94 and 2 59 the ratio f x s1 f y s1 1 while for u r 3 24 the ratio f x s1 f y s1 2 jeon and gharib 2001 and blevins and coughran 2009 came to the same conclusion and gonçalves et al 2013a confirmed this result for a cylinder with an aspect ratio greater than unity for u r 3 89 the ratio f y s2 f x s1 1 5 indicating the appearance of the second frequency f y s2 with f y s2 f y s1 3 vortex shedding frequencies are given as values normalized against the cylinder s natural frequencies i e as f x s f nx for the stream wise shedding frequency and as f x s1 f ny and f y s2 f ny for the first and second stream wise shedding frequencies respectively as shown the value of f x s f nx is close to unity for u r 1 94 and 2 60 and it then increases linearly to reach the highest value of 1 91 at u r 5 18 ratios f y s2 f ny are always higher than ratios f y s2 f ny for all values of u r the lock in case in our experiments occurred at f y s2 f ny 1 28 and f y s1 f ny 0 65 we obtained a more comprehensive understanding of this phenomenon by observing that at a higher inlet flow velocity the increase of the shedding frequency was reduced more than for the case of a fixed cylinder and this resulted in a greater reduction of the strouhal number compared to the normal case of st 0 2 this was due to the relatively large cylinder oscillations which generated eddies that affected the viv vortices recall that the definition of the strouhal number is related to the vortex shedding frequency f s for a fixed cylinder strouhal 1878 roshko 1954 1955 introduced the universal wake strouhal number st for vortex shedding from bluff bodies which they defined it as follows 16 s t f s d u s t u u b d d for a vibrating cylinder he considered two shear layers of distance d one layer with a certain wake width and another layer with the velocity just outside the layers equal to u b which is the mean velocity at separation many researchers estimated the value of the d over a somewhat limited range of reynolds number see own and griffin 1978 later bearman 1967 used both splitter plates and base bleeding of low velocity air to separate the base flow and vortex formation bearman s results were in a good agreement with roshko s measurements recall that most of the cited studies assumed that st remains constant for different values of ur only a few researchers namely gonçalves et al 2015 stappenbelt and lalji 2008 and tödter et al 2021 tried to measure the strouhal like number for different inlet velocities and in contrast to our measurements they found that the strouhal like number decreases with diminishing ur in the present study we will apply the simple physics arguments introduced by roshko 1954 1955 due to difficult to measure or estimate the values of d and u b in our experiment we directly measured the shedding vortex frequency the stream wise vortex shedding frequancy based on that we caculated the st vs ur and the ratio of d u b vs re from the equation 13 as shown in fig 15 a b respectively fig 15 a plots the associated shedding vortex strouhal number st against ur as seen a straight line closely represents the decrease of the shedding vortex strouhal number with increasing ur fig 15 b shows the values of d u b which are decreased from 0 16 to 0 018 by increasing the re it can be concluded at least in our experiment that the effect of d u b will be increased by increasing the re until 5 x 104 and it will almost the same for ur 5 18 the a b and c graphs of fig 16 present psds for vortices shed at three positions behind the cylinder these positions were located at different water depths of tz l 0 90 0 75 and 0 50 these positions extended from the top of the cylinder to its bottom black stars in fig 16 d present the value of st for these three positions along the cylinder s length sumner et al 2004 considered the possibility of vortices being shed at varying frequencies along the height of a stationary cylinder especially at positions near the cylinder s free top end therefore for comparison purposes we included in this graph also the shedding frequencies they obtained for stationary cylinders with aspect ratios of ar 5 7 and 9 fig 16 b shows that an increasing ar led to a decreasing st this finding agreed with that of goncalves et al 2013a which meant that the strouhal number was affected by the aspect ratio they also found that the strouhal number for a cylinder with aspect ratios of 2 0 1 7 and 1 5 decreased at reduced velocities ranging from 0 5 ur 5 the experiments of leong and wei 2008 examining a high aspect ratio cylinder with a mass ratio below the critical mass ratio demonstrated that at low reduced velocities the strouhal number was almost equal to 0 21 while for reduced velocities 2 5 the strouhal number was reduced up to 0 16 for all cases the almost constant strouhal number of st 0 128 resulted for ur 4 54 graphs of fig 17 present psds for stream wise psd u and span wise psd v frequencies measured at the five locations of ty l 2 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 and 2 0 at tz l 0 50 on the central vertical grid plane and at tx l 2 5 behind the cylinder the vortex shedding frequencies are almost equal consequently the value of the strouhal number of is nearly equal i e st 0 14 at tz l 0 5 8 forces acting on the oscillating cylinder according to lighthill 1986 the stream wise and lateral forces due to the viv acting on an oscillating cylinder each consist of two components of which the first component is the stream wise and lateral added mass force f ax and f ay respectively this force is an inertial force caused by the cylinder s oscillating stream wise and lateral accelerations here calculated as follows 17 f a x c a m d x t 18 f a y c a m d y t where ca 1 0 is the cylinder s added mass coefficient md π ρ d 2 l 4 is its displaced fluid mass and x t and y t are respectively its stream wise and lateral accelerations fluid forces acting on a vibrating circular cylinder may be larger than those acting on a stationary cylinder khalak and williamson 1997 only the drag force acts on a stationary cylinder while on an oscillating cylinder two primary force components namely the drag and inertia forces act on the cylinder thus the fluid induced forces acting on oscillating cylinder are higher than the forces acting on a fixed cylinder the second component is the vortex force also known as the additional vorticity force caused by the vorticity in flow field around a cylinder and thereby generating shedded vortices however due to the difficulty of measuring this force it was here estimated by subtracting the inertial force from the total force acting on the cylinder following the procedure of goverdhan williamson 2000 and jeon and gharib 2001 we assumed that the cylinder s oscillations the total forces and the vortex force components are harmonic functions we measured forces directly for a cylinder of ar 17 8 m 1 78 and ζ 0 00492 thus the mass damping product m ζ 0 00876 fig 18 shows box plots of total stream wise force fx total lateral force fy and fig 19 shows of maximum and mean stream wise force coefficients cx total lateral force coefficients cy versus reduced velocity ur with their uncertainties the uncertainties were estimated based on the equations 8 and 9 fig 20 shows box plots of stream wise inertia force fax and lateral inertia force fay versus reduced velocity ur as seen in fig 18 total forces fx and fy increase with rising ur and fx is always higher than fy indicating that the stream wise forces had a significant effect on the lateral force thus the viv force component contributed significantly to the total force acting on the oscillating cylinder for 1 94 ur 2 6 12 56 103 re 18 84 103 the cx has a value of about 1 3 while for 2 6 ur 3 9 18 84 103 re 28 12 103 the cx decreases to about 1 4 for flows in the critical region at 1 3 104 re 4 104 these cx values are close to those for a stationary cylinder which is a cx 1 2 see schlichting 1979 however for ur 4 44 and 5 18 corresponding to re 4 4 104 and 5 104 the cx increases to 1 65 and 2 02 respectively for 1 94 ur 2 6 12 56 103 re 18 84 103 the cy has values of 0 945 and 1 164 respectively while for 2 6 ur 3 9 18 84 103 re 28 12 103 the cy decreases to 0 84 however for ur 4 44 and 5 18 corresponding to re 4 4 104 and 5 104 the cy increases to 1 13 and 1 41 respectively in our experiments the greatest mean force coefficient in the x direction was cx mean 1 02 at ur 5 18 its maximum value was cx max 2 02 the greatest mean force coefficient in the y direction was cy mean 0 56 at ur 5 18 its maximum value was cy max 1 4 fig 21 presents trajectories of the cylinder s normalized lateral and transverse displacements and lateral and transverse accelerations obtained at a point 10 mm below the top of the cylinder for reduced velocities of u r 5 18 4 44 3 90 3 24 2 60 and 1 94 black lines represent trajectories from all experiments obtained over the 30 min duration red lines trajectories obtained over the last 10s duration recall that at low reduced velocities of 0 6 u r 1 94 the cylinder remained stationary because viv effects were absent basically these oscillation and acceleration trajectories change with increasing u r for the low u r 1 94 graphs k and l largely laterally dominated displacements and accelerations govern the oscillating displacements and accelerations for an increased value of u r 2 60 graph i the transverse displacement increases until the shape of the trajectories resemble that of a one sided compressed spring and then the acceleration trajectory starts to develop a new pattern graph j for u r 3 90 and 3 24 new patterns are formed as shown in graphs e and g gradually approaching the shape of a lying banana whereby in graphs f and h the transverse accelerations approach their lateral values again forming a new shape a further increase of u r 4 44 graph c causes a figure eight lissajous shape to develop with a transverse displacement of about 0 5d while transverse accelerations graph d exceed the lateral accelerations and the acceleration trajectory s shape is similar to the one captured by prastianto et al 2009 for the even higher value of u r 5 18 graph a the lissajous shape develops with a transverse displacement of about 0 8d which was also obtained by other researchers cagney and balabani 2014 flemming and williamson 2005 gonçalves et al 2013 williamson and jauvtis 2004 whereby the acceleration trajectories clearly take on a new shape graph b the fluctuating forces in the x direction were about 67 higher than those measured for a stationary cylinder the general measurement uncertainties were less than 3 5 but they were about 5 at the lower end of the measurement range see tödter et al 2021 recall that we determined the total force acting on the cylinder using the load cell to obtain the instantaneous potential inertial forces based on the accelerations recorded by the accelerometers 9 concluding remarks this extensive experimental investigation dealt with vortex induced vibration for a cantilevered circular cylinder free to oscillate in a circulating water channel decay tests in air and in water were performed to obtain cylinder first mode natural frequencies and associated damping ratios the first mode natural frequencies in air and water were obtained from the accelerometer and the piezoelectric transducer shedding frequencies in air and water in both directions were equal i e fxn fyn we found also that the ratio of natural frequencies in air and water were fny w fny a 0 875 which may have been due to the ratios between the m mtot 1 021 while we discovered that for the a cylinder with the same conditions and the same aspect ratio 18 75 as the fny w fny a 0 585 may be due to m mtot 0 278 a ldv system measured free stream velocity profiles at the inlet of the circulating water channel turbulence intensities for all inlet flow conditions were calculated for 0 355 0 020 m s u 1 503 0 079 m s the 2 245 0 33 tu95 1 985 0 24 the turbulance intensity decreased by increasing the inlet flow stream velocity u however the difference between the tu95 values with their uncertainty are small for are the flow stream velocities we compared our stream wise and lateral oscillations with the work of goncalves et al 2013b at different ar 1 5 and 5 at the same reduced velocities and almost mass ratio we observed at least in our experiment that by increasing the aspect ratio the values of the stream wise and stream wise cylinder responses increased oscillating cylinder accelerations displacements and force trajectories were presented as two dimensional trajectories for the even higher value of ur 5 18 the lissajous shape develops with a lateral displacement of about 0 8d which was also obtained by other whereby the acceleration trajectories clearly take on a new shape in a quite evident coupling between the stream wise and stream wise cylinder responses for different reduced velocities the corresponding oscillating cylinder frequencies in the stream wise and lateral directions were compared to shedding frequencies of streamwise and spanwise velocities the dominant shedding frequencies equalled the laterally oscillating frequencies of the cylinder only for 3 89 ur 5 18 for ur 3 24 the ratio of stream wise to lateral frequencies equalled two while for ur 1 943 and 2 591 this ratio equalled unity the normal strouhal number was calculated based on the shedding frequencies however for the oscillating cylinders a universal wake strouhal number st for a vortex shedding from bluff bodies was introduced by roshko 1954 1955 based on calculated frequencies of the span wise flow velocities measured by the ldv system the st for different reduced velocities decreased almost linearly from 0 201 at ur 0 6 to 0 141 at ur 5 18 at different depths and widths the strouhal number was almost constant for each reduced velocity considered we compared our results the st measured they obtained for stationary cylinders with aspect ratios of ar 5 7 and 9 measured by sumner et al 2004 increasing the aspect ratio led to a decreasing st which was also is agreed with that stated by goncalves et al 2013a the value of the strouhal number is affected by the aspect ratio value for the flow in critical region of 1 3 104 re 4 104 the drag coefficient of the oscillating cylinder was close to that of the stationary cylinder of c x 1 2 however for u r 4 44 and 5 18 corresponding to re 4 4 104 and 5 104 respectively the c x increased to 1 65 and 2 02 in the stream wise direction the fluctuating forces were about 66 67 higher than the forces measured for a stationary cylinder these experiments were performed to provide reliable benchmark data suitable for numerical validation of vortex induced vibration for a circular cylinder oscillating in two degrees of freedom in flows of low reduced velocities credit authorship contribution statement hassan el sheshtawy investigation

damage and contributes reference significance for engineering application keywords hull girder damage identification probabilistic neural network pnn natural frequency optimization algorithm 1 introduction ship damage will bring a non negligible impact on the ship s local strength and total strength which will threaten the safety and normal use of the ship therefore scholars have conducted relevant studies on different types of ship damage wang et al 2002 such as explosion damage gan et al 2019 grounding damage abubakar and dow 2013 and collision damage hogström and ringsberg 2012 kuznecovs et al 2020 relevant researches most concentrates on the forward problems of ship damage identification which means that ship local damage information can be identified when load input and ship structures are known however this kind of forward problem is oriented to the damage assessment and analysis in the late stage after damage occurs and the hull strength checking and structural optimization design in the initial stage before hull construction the hull strength especially the total strength cannot be obtained immediately when the damage occurs during a mission it is very important to in real time obtain the damaging impact on the ship for subsequent decision making and damage control traditionally due to the complexity of ship damage and the limitation of accessibility diving surveys and sling surveys are usually adopted however the accessible ship damage information is only limited to the size and morphology of the breach when the damage occurs which fails to quantify the damage of the hull girder at present the inverse finite element method ifem based on the comparison of the numerical strain reconstructions and their experimental counterparts has been successfully applied to ship health monitoring without considering any prior knowledge of the material properties the loading condition luca colombo et al 2021 the changing environment peeters and de roeck 2001 sohn 2007 worden et al 2002 and the influence of different operational conditions l colombo et al 2019 mingyang li li et al 2020 focused on the application of ifem methodology to thin walled cylindrical structures representing the columns of floating offshore installations by using a newly introduced damage parameter ifem accurately identified the correct damage locations and sizes in kefal and oterkus 2016 displacement and stress monitoring of a panamax container ship were accomplished based on ifem methodology conclusions illustrated that the ifem owned great performance in structural health monitoring systems and commonly referred as displacement and stress monitoring or shape and stress sensing however for the further identification of residual total strength of the hull girder ifem is not enough because it ends up with the full field displacements strains and stresses of a structure and there still exists a difference for total strength identification on the other hand in an underwater explosive environment the strain data of key parts are often missing which makes it difficult for the application of ifem in zhang et al 2021 a novel method was proposed to calculate strength loss based on stiffness loss obtained by vibration parameters section modulus was taken as the strength index to illustrate the relationship between stiffness loss and strength loss of the damaged hull girder with the increasing demand for ship intelligence it is urgent to develop a new method in practical engineering to fully mine the information contained in the existing data to effectively identify the damage of the hull girder and obtain the damage data of hull strength vibration based damage identification fan and qiao 2011 proves to be an effective means which uses the change of dynamic parameters of the structure to identify the structural damage this technology has been frequently applied in the fields of aeronautical engineering huang et al 2018 and bridge engineering moughty and casas 2017 and has achieved a good effect among them methods based on artificial intelligence hossain et al 2017 and deep learning are widely used rafiei and adeli 2018 the current prevailing artificial intelligence technology avoids the mechanical mechanism and can obtain explicit or implicit relationship by training the damage database zhang et al 2020 jiang jiang et al 2011 proposed a novel two stage structural damage detection approach using fuzzy neural networks fnn and data fusion techniques for structural health monitoring and damage detection particularly for cases where the measurement data is enormous and with uncertainties structural modal parameters derived from structural vibration responses are fed into an fnn as the input and the output values from the fnn were defuzzified to produce a rough structural damage assessment the proposed approach had been applied to a 7 degree of freedom building model for structural damage detection and proved to be feasible efficient and satisfactory bijan samali samali et al 2012 presented a vibration based damage identification method that utilized damage fingerprints embedded in frequency response functions to identify location and severity of notch type damage in a framed structure artificial neural networks were used to map changes in frequency response function to damage characteristics the results from both numerical and experimental investigations showed the proposed method was effective and robust for detecting notch type damage in structures zhi xin tan tan et al 2020 developed and applied a procedure for detecting damage in a composite slab on girder bridge structure comprising of a reinforced concrete slab and three steel beams using vibration characteristics and artificial neural network which is used in conjunction with modal strain energy based damage index for locating and quantifying damage in the steel beams lin lin et al 2017 proposed a novel damage detection approach to automatically extract features from low level sensor data through deep learning a deep convolutional neural network was designed to learn features and identify damage locations a novel strategy for localized damage identification in plate like structures was presented by h salehi salehi et al 2019 numerous features extracted from cumulative acceleration on dynamically loaded plates were used to determine damage indication parameters a simply supported aluminum plate under distributed harmonic loading was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed damage detection strategy results showed that the proposed method was capable of identifying damage even in the presence of high noise levels optimization algorithms fan and qiao 2011 hou and xia 2021 moughty and casas 2017 were also used for damage identification ant colony optimization algorithm was presented to detect and assess structural damages from changes in natural frequencies by aditi majumdar majumdar et al 2012 the truss like structures were selected as the objects to assess the damages by using first few natural frequencies results showed that the developed method can detect and estimate the amount of damages with satisfactory precision silva silva et al 2016 proposed a novel unsupervised and nonparametric genetic algorithm for decision boundary analysis to support the structural damage detection process which revealed to have better classification performance and suggest its applicability for real world structural health monitoring applications over 265 non linear finite element analyses of panels with various locations and sizes of pitting corrosion had been carried out by duo ok ok et al 2007 the artificial neural network ann method was applied to derive a formula to predict ultimate strength reduction of ship locally corroded plates a budipriyanto budipriyanto et al 2007 developed a scheme for identifying damage on a cross stiffened plate of a tanker ship model and a neural network technique was used to form the function which was used as the damage indicator ahmed a elshafey elshafey et al 2010 discussed the damage detection in offshore jacket platforms subjected to random loads using a combined method of random decrement signature and neural networks convolutional neural network cnn had attracted the attention of many researchers for hull structural damage detection due to its better efficiency ma and wang 2021 yao et al 2019 and the vibration response was often used as the network input zubaydi et al 2002 the above literature suggests that it is an effective method to identify structural damage based on structural vibration parameters by artificial neural networks this paper proposes a damage identification method based on pnn to indirectly predict and identify the hull girder damage which is realized through the variation of natural frequencies of the hull girder pnn combined with radial basis function rbf neural network and classical probability density estimation principle has a simple structure and high classification accuracy in this paper the natural frequency variation optimized by the normalization method is taken as the input of the network and the damage location and degree are taken as the output of the network the database under various damage conditions is obtained by the migration matrix method particle swarm optimization pso and genetic algorithm ga are used to search for the best smoothing factor that has an important influence on network recognition results and the effects of different parameters of the optimization algorithm on smoothing factor and results are analyzed then test sets are used to verify the recognition effect of the network model 2 damage identification method of hull girder 2 1 basic assumption of hull girder damage the damage of the ship is macroscopically manifested as deformation and fracture etc but from the mechanical point of view it is manifested as the decrease of the mass and stiffness of the structure and the change of its inherent properties such as natural frequency and mode shape the local damage will cause a slight change in the mass of the hull girder but the stiffness reduction will become a serious threat to the hull girder strength therefore this paper only considers the stiffness reduction the stiffness loss is taken as the index to describe the damage extent the main parameters of the ship studied in this paper are shown in table 1 the ship is divided into 20 units the stiffness and mass of each section are assumed to be constant see fig 1 the hull girder stiffness is given as follows 1 k e i where k is the bending stiffness e is the elastic modulus i is the moment of inertia of the section assuming that damage does not change the properties of structural materials the damage degree of ship can be represented by reducing the moment of inertia which can be determined by the following formula 2 i i p i i i where i i is the moment of inertia of the damaged section i i is the moment of inertia of the intact section p i indicates the extent of damage then 3 k i p i k i where k i is the bending stiffness of the damaged section k i is the bending stiffness of the intact section 2 2 damage identification theory based on natural frequency the natural frequency change caused by stiffness loss of hull girder can be expressed as 4 k δ k ω 2 δ ω 2 m x δ x 0 it is assumed that the mass of the ship is constant after damage and the second order term is ignored zhang et al 2020 5 δ ω i 2 x i t δ k x i x i t m x i the detailed derivation of eq 5 is shown in appendix a in eq 5 i is the ith order of the mode k is the structural stiffness matrix is the change of stiffness matrix m is the mass matrix ω 2 is the square of the natural frequency x is the mode shape δ x is the change of mode shape the change in the natural frequency of mode i of a structure due to localized damage is a function of the position vector of the damage n and the reduction in stiffness caused by the damage δ k thus 6 δ ω i f i δ k n where the index i is the subscript that corresponds to the ith natural frequency changes expanding this function about the undamaged state δ k 0 and ignoring second order terms yields 7 δ ω i f i 0 n δ k f i δ k 0 n when the ship is intact there is no frequency change without damage 8 f i 0 n 0 so eq 7 can be expressed as 9 δ ω i δ k h i n where h i n f i δ k 0 n similarly 10 δ ω j δ k h j n where the index j is the subscript that corresponds to the jth natural frequency changes thus provided that the change in stiffness is independent of frequency 11 δ ω i δ ω j h i n h j n h n therefore the change ratio of any two order natural frequencies is only related to the damage location however different damage positions or degrees may lead to the same change of a certain order of natural frequency it is difficult to accurately identify the damage only from a single mode therefore considering the practical application five modes of natural frequencies are selected to create the database 2 3 establishment of hull girder damage database in this paper damage conditions are set according to the vulnerability of the ship the damage is set from unit 4 to unit 17 separately with damage extent from 0 to 50 through the transfer matrix method which is proven to be effective by ccs china classification society the natural frequencies of the damaged hull girder under 700 damage conditions are calculated and the principle of the transfer matrix method see appendix b for detailed description is as follows 12 x 20 r s 20 s 19 s 2 s 1 x 1 l where x i is the state vector of the unit at the boundary superscripts l and r indicate left and right end respectively s i is the inter span matrix s i s i p s i f and s i p 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 ω 2 m i 0 0 1 s i f 1 l i l i 2 2 e i i i l i 3 6 e i i i 0 1 l i e i i i l i 2 2 e i i i 0 0 1 l i 0 0 0 1 according to the boundary conditions of the hull girder eq 13 namely bending moment and shear force the natural frequencies can be obtained by solving eq 12 13 m 1 r f 1 r 0 m 20 l f 20 l 0 when the damage occurs the natural frequency and mode shapes of the hull girder will change however the change in the mode shape curve is not obvious compared with frequency in general the peak point and node position of the mode shape curve will not greatly change due to tiny damage therefore in fig 2 the mode shape curve is introduced only to explore the relationship between natural frequency difference and the mode shape characteristics of flexural vibration of the hull girder with the increase of damage extent the absolute value of the natural frequency difference becomes larger fig 2 and the difference in the natural frequency is positively correlated with the damage extent moreover it can be seen that the natural frequency changes differently for different damaged units the natural frequency difference is small when the damage locates near the vibration nodes and is large when the damage locates at the amplitude position marked with shadow in fig 2 according to the damage identification theory based on natural frequency the index natural frequency change nfc is used to normalize the data 14 n f c i j δ ω i δ ω j j 2 5 where δ ω i δ ω j denote the natural frequency difference of order i and order j respectively the damage index of the same damage unit can be defined as the vector n i 15 n i n f c 12 n f c 13 n f c 14 n f c 15 the normalization method is used to optimize the data 16 n f c max max n f c 12 n f c 13 n f c 14 n f c 15 the normalized input vector n 1 i is 17 n 1 i n f c 12 n f c max n f c 13 n f c max n f c 14 n f c max n f c 15 n f c max fig 3 shows the normalized natural frequency database characteristics it can be seen that part of the original natural frequency data presents an aggregation phenomenon which makes it difficult for the damage features contained in the database to be classified by the neural network after normalization the distribution of data points in the database is relatively divergent which can help well distinguish and retain the characteristics of the data 3 the basic theory of pnn based on optimization algorithm 3 1 pnn pnn is commonly used for pattern classification zhou et al 2014 which is based on bayesian theory it has a prior probability h 1 p c 1 h 2 p c 2 and h 1 h 2 1 assumed that there exists an input vector x x 1 x 2 x n the vector shows n kinds of possible outcomes of a random event the outcomes of the events are classified according to equation 18 18 c c 1 p c 1 x p c 2 x c 2 p c 1 x p c 2 x given the condition c 1 the probability of x is p c 1 x according to bayesian theory the contingent probability of this event is 19 p c 1 x p c 1 p x c 1 p x during classification the input vector is usually assigned to the category with large contingent probability however errors can also inevitably occur resulting the classification errors therefore the classification method needs to be appropriately modified if we define the event a i as assigning the vector x to the result c i and λ i j as the loss of assigning a result originally belonging to c j to c i the expected risk of the loss is defined as equation 20 20 r c i x λ i j p c j x then the classification can be adjusted as 21 c c 1 r c 1 x p c 2 x c 2 r c 1 x p c 2 x the pnn structure can be divided into four layers namely the input layer the sample layer the summation layer and the output layer as shown in fig 4 the first layer of the network is the input layer in which the dimension of the input vector x and the number of neurons should be the same the second layer of the network is set as the sample layer and the relationship between the input vector x and the j th neuron of the i th sample is shown in eq 22 in the following formula x i j represents the central value of each neuron node in each sample layer σ represents the smoothing factor and d represents the total number of neurons in each sample layer 22 ϕ ij x 1 2 π 1 2 σ d e x x i j x x i j t σ 2 the third layer of the network is the summation layer used to calculate the average value of samples of the same category in the sample layer eq 23 the parameter l represents the number of neurons in the i th sample 23 v i 1 l j 1 l ϕ i j the last layer of the network is set as the output layer and the category corresponding to the highest probability in the network summation layer is set as the output result as shown in eq 24 24 y a r g m a x v i in the pnn model smoothing factors can have a great impact on the output results in this paper pso and ga are used to optimize the pnn structure the following will introduce the two intelligent optimization algorithms and adjust the parameters of the two optimization algorithms to make the smoothing factor optimization process more efficient 3 2 pso 3 2 1 theory of pso particle swarm optimization pso hou and xia 2021 has learned from bird feeding behavior that when each bird s current location is known from the food it is most efficient to search around the bird closest to the food pso is an evolutionary algorithm based on swarm iteration and has been widely used q yang 2021 when solving the global optimal solution of the problem the pso searches all particles in the same d dimensional space and evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of the current position of the particle with the fitness value with the update of the iteration the historical best position of the i th particle p i p i 1 p i 2 p i d and the historical best position of all particles p g p g 1 p g 2 p g d are saved the velocity iteration formula and position update formula of particle i are shown in eq 25 and eq 26 where c 1 and c 2 are learning factors ω is inertia weight r 1 and r 2 are random numbers in 0 1 v i d k is the d th dimensional component of the velocity vector of particle i during the k th iteration x i d k is the d th dimensional component of the position vector of particle i during the k th iteration p i d k is the best position searched in each iteration p g d k is the optimal population position found in all iterations fig 5 the steps of the original pso algorithm are as follows step 1 initialize set all involved parameters in pso algorithm lower limit and upper limit of searching space learning factors the maximum number of iterations of algorithm or convergence precision the velocity range of particle randomly initialize position and velocity of each particle step 2 evaluate each particle calculate the fitness value of each particle and record the current optimal position and global optimal position of each particle according to the fitness value step 3 update the state of the particle adopt eq 25 to update the velocity and position of each particle step 4 verify the ending condition is reached or not if the current number of iterations reaches preset maximum times or the final result is less than convergence precision stop iteration and output optimal solution or go back to step 2 3 2 2 network design the optimal smoothing factor is obtained by using pso to adjust the network to make it more efficient and accurate the accuracy of the recognition results of the training set is taken as the fitness function the optimal smoothing factor corresponding to the maximum value of the fitness function is retained through the continuous iteration process and then is used as the basic parameter of the neural network to identify the test set the network design process is shown in fig 6 3 2 3 parameter setting of pso for pso learning factor maximum velocity number of particles and inertia weight will have a certain impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the optimization algorithm during every iteration in this paper the influence of various factors will be considered to determine the optimal parameters of the optimization algorithm 1 learning factors the learning factors c 1 and c 2 measure the relationship between the particle s own extremum and the global extremum so as to determine the random acceleration of particle movement in general if c 1 is bigger than c 2 it will cause the particle to jump out of the original search range if c 2 is bigger than c 1 it is easier to converge to the local minimum during the search therefore after comprehensive consideration the two are set as equal values suganthan 1999 2 maximum velocity the maximum velocity v m a x is set to avoid the particle step size being too large or too small during the iteration a large step size may cause the particle to miss the global optimal value while a small step size may cause the particle to mature prematurely thus converging to the local optimal value in general consideration the maximum velocity limit of particles is set as v m a x 1 2 in this paper peer et al 2003 after testing the pso pnn network has good optimization ability and convergence speed under the maximum speed limit 3 number of particles the number of particles in the pso algorithm needs to be designed according to the specific problem the number of particles not only needs to ensure the ability of global searching for the optimal value but also needs to consider the computational efficiency six different population sizes 35 10 15 20 40 50 is selected respectively results show that when the population size is less than 35 it has a greater influence on the smoothing factors and fitness values of the algorithm with the increase of population the efficiency of the algorithm iterating to the optimal smoothing factor is increased and the final optimal smoothing factor iteration result is about 0 26 the maximum value of the fitness function corresponding to the final optimal smoothing factor is 0 957 however when the population size exceeds 35 fig 7 the algorithm becomes no longer sensitive to the population size and even results in a decrease in the fitness value np 40 fig 8 considering the reliability and efficiency of the algorithm the number of particles is finally set to 35 in the pso algorithm architecture the final iteration result of fitness value i e identification accuracy depends on the iteration results of the smoothing factor as can be seen from fig 7 when n 40 the smoothing factor eventually iterates to 0 1 when n 10 15 20 35 50 the smoothing factors are iterated to about 0 255 and the corresponding fitness values are all about 0 957 at this time which indicates that the network achieves the best effect the above results illustrate that when the smoothing factor iterates to about 0 255 the identification effect of the network reaches the best in the design of the pso algorithm the iterative process of smoothing factor depends on the initial position and velocity of particles the calculation method of the initial position of particles based on matlab is pn linspace 0 1 4 n the initial velocity calculation method of the particle is v vmax 2 rand 1 n 1 the updating formula of the velocity in the iteration process is v w v c1 r pbest pn c2 r gbest pn where w is the inertia weight c1 and c2 are the learning factors r is a vector composed of random numbers between 0 and 1 pbest is the best position in the iteration process gbest is the best smoothing factor in the iteration process and pn is the current position of the particle it can be concluded that the iterative results of the smoothing factor have certain randomness and it will be affected by the initial position and velocity of particles n will not only affect the initial position distribution of particles but also affect the initial velocity of each particle when n 40 due to the initial position and the randomness of velocity update the algorithm falls into a local optimum in the iteration process then the smoothing factor is iterated to about 0 1 and the fitness value reaches about 0 942 the optimal smoothing factor about 0 255 could not be found thus the optimal recognition effect could not be achieved 4 inertia weight the inertial weight ω is particularly important to the convergence performance of the algorithm when ω increases it can make the particle have enough global searching ability when ω reduces the local search ability of the particle is enhanced therefore an appropriate inertial weight selection strategy is essential to improve the searching ability of the algorithm the following shows three common different inertial weights eqs 27 29 g yang 2007 which can better balance the global search and local search capabilities of the algorithm and the effectiveness will be discussed and compared linear inertial weight liw 27 ω t ω max t max t ω max ω min t max parabolic inertial weight piw 28 ω t ω max ω max ω min t t max 2 downtrend inertial weight diw 29 ω t ω max ω max ω min 2 t t max t t max 2 where ω m a x is the maximum of inertia weight ω m i n is the minimum of inertia weight t is the current iteration step the above three methods are compared by examples below in the algorithm based on the aforementioned identification results of different parameters the number of particles is set to 35 the maximum number of iterations is set to 50 the initial weight coefficient is set to 0 5 the learning factors c 1 and c 2 are set to 2 and the maximum flight velocity of particles is set to 1 2 the results are shown in fig 9 by comprehensive comparison of the above three inertial weight methods the liw method has a slower convergence rate and the fitness function reaches the maximum after the 36th iteration at which time the inertial weight is 0 76 in the sixth iteration the piw method finds a relatively good solution with high efficiency and a corresponding inertial weight of 0 893 the diw method gets the optimal weight in the 14th iteration and the corresponding inertia weight was 0 66 however the maximum fitness function of the diw method is less than that of the liw method and piw method considering the iteration efficiency the piw method is chosen in this paper to optimize the inertia weight of pso 3 3 ga 3 3 1 theory of ga genetic algorithm ga hou and xia 2021 is a computational model of the biological evolution process that simulates the natural selection and the genetic mechanism of darwin s biological evolution it is a method to search for the optimal solution by simulating the natural evolution process a genetic algorithm takes all individuals in a population as the object and uses randomization method to guide the efficient search of coded parameter space silva et al 2016 its main feature is to operate on the structure object directly without the limitation of derivation and function continuity its flow chart is shown in fig 10 the algorithm can be represented by the following mathematical model 30 s g a c e p 0 n φ γ ψ t where c represents the individual coding mode e represents individual fitness evaluation function p 0 represents the initial population n denotes population size φ represents the selection operator γ represents the crossover operator ψ represents the mutation operator t is the condition under which the algorithm stops in this paper ga is used to obtain the optimal smoothing factor of pnn by searching the maximum of the fitness function which represents the identification accuracy 3 3 2 network design the identification accuracy of the sample set is taken as the fitness function and the individuals with higher fitness in the population are retained by the roulette method repeat the above steps to complete the iterative operation and generate individuals with larger fitness values through continuous reproduction to achieve the maximum identification accuracy and obtain the best smoothing factor in this section the smoothing factor is optimized based on ga and the accuracy of the results of the sample data is taken as the fitness function to evaluate the optimization effect the network design process is shown in fig 11 3 3 3 parameter setting of ga for ga population size np and chromosome string length l will have a great influence on its performance and these two parameters should be reasonably selected and controlled in the process of population evolution so that the genetic algorithm can reach the optimal solution with the best search trajectory the influence of the two parameters on the accuracy and efficiency of the training results will be discussed below 1 population size np the population size has an impact on the efficiency of the optimization algorithm the larger the population size is the more likely it is to find the global solution and the running time is also relatively long but the smaller population size will lead to the convergence of the search before maturity in this paper given that np 10 16 20 convergence stagnation occurs due to the small population size and the maximum fitness function is kept at 0 9428 although large population sizes not only increase the fitness function calculation there was little difference after population size reaches a certain number fig 12 np 30 40 50 therefore considering the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm comprehensively the population size is set to 30 2 chromosome string length l the choice of chromosome string length depends on the accuracy of the solution to a particular problem the higher the accuracy required the longer the chromosome string length is but the more computation time required in this paper the chromosome string length of 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 is selected respectively to discuss the convergence characteristics and results of the optimal smoothing factor and fitness function as can be seen from fig 13 as l increases the efficiency of iterating to the best smoothing factor and fitness value increases when l reaches 10 only 5 steps are needed to iterate to the optimal fitness value 0 9571 when the number of bit strings is greater than 10 the effect of l on the iteration efficiency almost does not change the smoothing factor is about 0 256 and the fitness value reaches 0 9571 therefore l of 10 is selected as the parameter of the neural network based on ga 3 crossover in this paper the smoothing factor which is used in the chromosomes is selected as the object optimized by ga to improve the accuracy of the network binary coding is adopted to represent each chromosome as a string composed of 0 and 1 this paper then uses double point crossing to randomly select two intersections on the chromosome and then exchanges the substrings between the intersections to obtain two new individuals take chromosome length of 8 as an example when pc rand the chromosomes are crossed as shown in fig 14 when pc rand no update is made pc represents the crossover rate and rand represents a random number between 0 and 1 4 mutation the mutation is the substitution of the gene values on some gene sites in the chromosome sequence with other alleles on the gene site to form a new individual in this paper when pm rand the chromosome is mutated to change the 0 in the binary number to 1 1 to 0 when pm rand no mutation is updated pm represents the mutation rate 4 identification results of hull girder damage in this paper the network is trained through the training set and the identification accuracy is taken as the fitness value of the network through the iterative process the network fitness values under different smoothing factors are compared to find the optimal smoothing factor then the optimal smoothing factor obtained by the pso and ga is taken as the basic parameter of the pnn network and the test set is input into the optimized pnn network to obtain the damage identification results fourteen damaged units are used to simulate the damage each unit is set at a 1 interval with the damage extent ranged from 0 to 50 a total of 700 damage conditions are used as the training set among them the data with damage extent of 1 5 10 20 30 35 40 and 50 are selected as the optimization set to achieve the best smoothing factor of the neural network the test set contains the data corresponding to the damage extent of 13 and 23 which has been included in the training set to test whether the optimized neural network can retain the identification accuracy of the original data furthermore the test set contains the data corresponding to the damage extent of 28 5 33 5 and 48 5 which is also obtained by the migration matrix method to explore the identification effect of data with a certain level of precision as can be seen from the results the identification accuracy of most cases with damage extent of 13 and 23 is 0 which reflects that the neural network can still retain the accuracy of the original database after training and optimization however when the damage extent is 28 5 33 5 and 48 5 the identification results produce certain errors which indicates that the identification results of the neural network will produce errors under certain accuracy requirements results also show that ga shows better efficiency and only takes 5 steps to iterate to the optimal smoothing factor 0 255 the damage location accuracy of the results reaches 100 the damage extent identification results and errors are shown in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively the average error is 1 38 and the maximum error is 26 3 only case 38 which indicates a good damage identification effect although case 38 occurs large error 5 conclusions in this paper the damage identification of hull girder based on the probabilistic neural network pnn method is investigated in actual engineering it is difficult for ship damage to be detected and evaluated in real time this paper aims to indirectly locate and quantify the hull girder damage through the variation of the natural frequency parameters the migration matrix method is selected to obtain the natural frequency database of the hull girder under various damage conditions and the normalization method is used to optimize the database the particle swarm optimization pso and the genetic algorithm ga are embedded in the pnn respectively to search for the best smoothing factor then test sets including 70 damage cases are carried out to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the network the conclusions are as follows 1 the establishment of the damage database is the key to damage identification based on intelligent methods the migration matrix method can be utilized to obtain the natural frequency database of the hull girder under various damage conditions 2 processing the natural frequency database by normalization method can effectively maintain the total database size while enhancing the data feature recognition and the network s ability to sense parameter changes allowing it to effectively identify hull girder damage 3 the change of natural frequency of the hull girder after the damage is related to the damage location when the damage is located close to the vibration node the natural frequencies of the corresponding order change little when the damage is near the amplitude point the natural frequencies vary a lot 4 for the case studied in this paper network models using both pso and ga allow the smoothing factor to converge to an optimal value when the fitness function reaches its maximum ga is more efficient than pso because it iterates to the optimal smoothing factor in fewer steps 5 based on the artificial intelligence method for hull girder damage identification it is not necessary to derive the mapping relationship between damage and natural frequency from a traditional mechanical point of view the damage agent model for hull girder can be created by the training of a sufficient database and the location and extent of damage can be efficiently output under the input of the natural frequency of unknown damage conditions this method investigates hull girder damage from an inverse problem perspective which uses an intelligent approach to solve the damage this method provides a technical reference for practical application in engineering 6 future applications in this paper the feasibility and effectiveness of the hull girder damage identification based on frequency parameters are analyzed theoretically the results show that this method can effectively realize the damage identification of hull girder the important application background of this method is the underwater explosion damage identification of hull girder for military ships it is very difficult to locate and quantify the damage by field survey when damage occurs below the waterline and this investigation develops a novel method that can indirectly identify the ship explosion damage different from the signals which mostly come from the natural environment or artificial secondary incentives for structural health monitoring shm of civil engineering and bridge engineering the explosion damage identification of the hull girder is hoped to be realized by using the accompanying signals during the explosion damage event rather than by using environmental or artificial secondary excitation loading on the one hand the projectile body attack can cause the phenomenon of fragments throwing out of the hull or gas escaping from the hull which will cause a counterforce to the hull and generate the total vibration response of the hull girder on the other hand the shock wave and bubble pulsating load caused by the underwater explosion can also cause the total vibration response of the hull girder the explosion damage signal under the explosion load has a high amplitude and is mixed with high frequency signals local vibration signals and low frequency signals total vibration signals in this case the damage signals contain noise signals high frequency signals however decay faster then the hull girder gradually shows whip type motion i e total vibration and at this time the signal form is mainly the low frequency signal with total vibration which contains the damage information of the damaged hull girder the dynamic parameters of the hull girder under this condition can be obtained immediately by collecting the total vibration signals in this stage to identify the hull girder damage credit authorship contribution statement yin zhang methodology creation of models

damage and contributes reference significance for engineering application keywords hull girder damage identification probabilistic neural network pnn natural frequency optimization algorithm 1 introduction ship damage will bring a non negligible impact on the ship s local strength and total strength which will threaten the safety and normal use of the ship therefore scholars have conducted relevant studies on different types of ship damage wang et al 2002 such as explosion damage gan et al 2019 grounding damage abubakar and dow 2013 and collision damage hogström and ringsberg 2012 kuznecovs et al 2020 relevant researches most concentrates on the forward problems of ship damage identification which means that ship local damage information can be identified when load input and ship structures are known however this kind of forward problem is oriented to the damage assessment and analysis in the late stage after damage occurs and the hull strength checking and structural optimization design in the initial stage before hull construction the hull strength especially the total strength cannot be obtained immediately when the damage occurs during a mission it is very important to in real time obtain the damaging impact on the ship for subsequent decision making and damage control traditionally due to the complexity of ship damage and the limitation of accessibility diving surveys and sling surveys are usually adopted however the accessible ship damage information is only limited to the size and morphology of the breach when the damage occurs which fails to quantify the damage of the hull girder at present the inverse finite element method ifem based on the comparison of the numerical strain reconstructions and their experimental counterparts has been successfully applied to ship health monitoring without considering any prior knowledge of the material properties the loading condition luca colombo et al 2021 the changing environment peeters and de roeck 2001 sohn 2007 worden et al 2002 and the influence of different operational conditions l colombo et al 2019 mingyang li li et al 2020 focused on the application of ifem methodology to thin walled cylindrical structures representing the columns of floating offshore installations by using a newly introduced damage parameter ifem accurately identified the correct damage locations and sizes in kefal and oterkus 2016 displacement and stress monitoring of a panamax container ship were accomplished based on ifem methodology conclusions illustrated that the ifem owned great performance in structural health monitoring systems and commonly referred as displacement and stress monitoring or shape and stress sensing however for the further identification of residual total strength of the hull girder ifem is not enough because it ends up with the full field displacements strains and stresses of a structure and there still exists a difference for total strength identification on the other hand in an underwater explosive environment the strain data of key parts are often missing which makes it difficult for the application of ifem in zhang et al 2021 a novel method was proposed to calculate strength loss based on stiffness loss obtained by vibration parameters section modulus was taken as the strength index to illustrate the relationship between stiffness loss and strength loss of the damaged hull girder with the increasing demand for ship intelligence it is urgent to develop a new method in practical engineering to fully mine the information contained in the existing data to effectively identify the damage of the hull girder and obtain the damage data of hull strength vibration based damage identification fan and qiao 2011 proves to be an effective means which uses the change of dynamic parameters of the structure to identify the structural damage this technology has been frequently applied in the fields of aeronautical engineering huang et al 2018 and bridge engineering moughty and casas 2017 and has achieved a good effect among them methods based on artificial intelligence hossain et al 2017 and deep learning are widely used rafiei and adeli 2018 the current prevailing artificial intelligence technology avoids the mechanical mechanism and can obtain explicit or implicit relationship by training the damage database zhang et al 2020 jiang jiang et al 2011 proposed a novel two stage structural damage detection approach using fuzzy neural networks fnn and data fusion techniques for structural health monitoring and damage detection particularly for cases where the measurement data is enormous and with uncertainties structural modal parameters derived from structural vibration responses are fed into an fnn as the input and the output values from the fnn were defuzzified to produce a rough structural damage assessment the proposed approach had been applied to a 7 degree of freedom building model for structural damage detection and proved to be feasible efficient and satisfactory bijan samali samali et al 2012 presented a vibration based damage identification method that utilized damage fingerprints embedded in frequency response functions to identify location and severity of notch type damage in a framed structure artificial neural networks were used to map changes in frequency response function to damage characteristics the results from both numerical and experimental investigations showed the proposed method was effective and robust for detecting notch type damage in structures zhi xin tan tan et al 2020 developed and applied a procedure for detecting damage in a composite slab on girder bridge structure comprising of a reinforced concrete slab and three steel beams using vibration characteristics and artificial neural network which is used in conjunction with modal strain energy based damage index for locating and quantifying damage in the steel beams lin lin et al 2017 proposed a novel damage detection approach to automatically extract features from low level sensor data through deep learning a deep convolutional neural network was designed to learn features and identify damage locations a novel strategy for localized damage identification in plate like structures was presented by h salehi salehi et al 2019 numerous features extracted from cumulative acceleration on dynamically loaded plates were used to determine damage indication parameters a simply supported aluminum plate under distributed harmonic loading was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed damage detection strategy results showed that the proposed method was capable of identifying damage even in the presence of high noise levels optimization algorithms fan and qiao 2011 hou and xia 2021 moughty and casas 2017 were also used for damage identification ant colony optimization algorithm was presented to detect and assess structural damages from changes in natural frequencies by aditi majumdar majumdar et al 2012 the truss like structures were selected as the objects to assess the damages by using first few natural frequencies results showed that the developed method can detect and estimate the amount of damages with satisfactory precision silva silva et al 2016 proposed a novel unsupervised and nonparametric genetic algorithm for decision boundary analysis to support the structural damage detection process which revealed to have better classification performance and suggest its applicability for real world structural health monitoring applications over 265 non linear finite element analyses of panels with various locations and sizes of pitting corrosion had been carried out by duo ok ok et al 2007 the artificial neural network ann method was applied to derive a formula to predict ultimate strength reduction of ship locally corroded plates a budipriyanto budipriyanto et al 2007 developed a scheme for identifying damage on a cross stiffened plate of a tanker ship model and a neural network technique was used to form the function which was used as the damage indicator ahmed a elshafey elshafey et al 2010 discussed the damage detection in offshore jacket platforms subjected to random loads using a combined method of random decrement signature and neural networks convolutional neural network cnn had attracted the attention of many researchers for hull structural damage detection due to its better efficiency ma and wang 2021 yao et al 2019 and the vibration response was often used as the network input zubaydi et al 2002 the above literature suggests that it is an effective method to identify structural damage based on structural vibration parameters by artificial neural networks this paper proposes a damage identification method based on pnn to indirectly predict and identify the hull girder damage which is realized through the variation of natural frequencies of the hull girder pnn combined with radial basis function rbf neural network and classical probability density estimation principle has a simple structure and high classification accuracy in this paper the natural frequency variation optimized by the normalization method is taken as the input of the network and the damage location and degree are taken as the output of the network the database under various damage conditions is obtained by the migration matrix method particle swarm optimization pso and genetic algorithm ga are used to search for the best smoothing factor that has an important influence on network recognition results and the effects of different parameters of the optimization algorithm on smoothing factor and results are analyzed then test sets are used to verify the recognition effect of the network model 2 damage identification method of hull girder 2 1 basic assumption of hull girder damage the damage of the ship is macroscopically manifested as deformation and fracture etc but from the mechanical point of view it is manifested as the decrease of the mass and stiffness of the structure and the change of its inherent properties such as natural frequency and mode shape the local damage will cause a slight change in the mass of the hull girder but the stiffness reduction will become a serious threat to the hull girder strength therefore this paper only considers the stiffness reduction the stiffness loss is taken as the index to describe the damage extent the main parameters of the ship studied in this paper are shown in table 1 the ship is divided into 20 units the stiffness and mass of each section are assumed to be constant see fig 1 the hull girder stiffness is given as follows 1 k e i where k is the bending stiffness e is the elastic modulus i is the moment of inertia of the section assuming that damage does not change the properties of structural materials the damage degree of ship can be represented by reducing the moment of inertia which can be determined by the following formula 2 i i p i i i where i i is the moment of inertia of the damaged section i i is the moment of inertia of the intact section p i indicates the extent of damage then 3 k i p i k i where k i is the bending stiffness of the damaged section k i is the bending stiffness of the intact section 2 2 damage identification theory based on natural frequency the natural frequency change caused by stiffness loss of hull girder can be expressed as 4 k δ k ω 2 δ ω 2 m x δ x 0 it is assumed that the mass of the ship is constant after damage and the second order term is ignored zhang et al 2020 5 δ ω i 2 x i t δ k x i x i t m x i the detailed derivation of eq 5 is shown in appendix a in eq 5 i is the ith order of the mode k is the structural stiffness matrix is the change of stiffness matrix m is the mass matrix ω 2 is the square of the natural frequency x is the mode shape δ x is the change of mode shape the change in the natural frequency of mode i of a structure due to localized damage is a function of the position vector of the damage n and the reduction in stiffness caused by the damage δ k thus 6 δ ω i f i δ k n where the index i is the subscript that corresponds to the ith natural frequency changes expanding this function about the undamaged state δ k 0 and ignoring second order terms yields 7 δ ω i f i 0 n δ k f i δ k 0 n when the ship is intact there is no frequency change without damage 8 f i 0 n 0 so eq 7 can be expressed as 9 δ ω i δ k h i n where h i n f i δ k 0 n similarly 10 δ ω j δ k h j n where the index j is the subscript that corresponds to the jth natural frequency changes thus provided that the change in stiffness is independent of frequency 11 δ ω i δ ω j h i n h j n h n therefore the change ratio of any two order natural frequencies is only related to the damage location however different damage positions or degrees may lead to the same change of a certain order of natural frequency it is difficult to accurately identify the damage only from a single mode therefore considering the practical application five modes of natural frequencies are selected to create the database 2 3 establishment of hull girder damage database in this paper damage conditions are set according to the vulnerability of the ship the damage is set from unit 4 to unit 17 separately with damage extent from 0 to 50 through the transfer matrix method which is proven to be effective by ccs china classification society the natural frequencies of the damaged hull girder under 700 damage conditions are calculated and the principle of the transfer matrix method see appendix b for detailed description is as follows 12 x 20 r s 20 s 19 s 2 s 1 x 1 l where x i is the state vector of the unit at the boundary superscripts l and r indicate left and right end respectively s i is the inter span matrix s i s i p s i f and s i p 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 ω 2 m i 0 0 1 s i f 1 l i l i 2 2 e i i i l i 3 6 e i i i 0 1 l i e i i i l i 2 2 e i i i 0 0 1 l i 0 0 0 1 according to the boundary conditions of the hull girder eq 13 namely bending moment and shear force the natural frequencies can be obtained by solving eq 12 13 m 1 r f 1 r 0 m 20 l f 20 l 0 when the damage occurs the natural frequency and mode shapes of the hull girder will change however the change in the mode shape curve is not obvious compared with frequency in general the peak point and node position of the mode shape curve will not greatly change due to tiny damage therefore in fig 2 the mode shape curve is introduced only to explore the relationship between natural frequency difference and the mode shape characteristics of flexural vibration of the hull girder with the increase of damage extent the absolute value of the natural frequency difference becomes larger fig 2 and the difference in the natural frequency is positively correlated with the damage extent moreover it can be seen that the natural frequency changes differently for different damaged units the natural frequency difference is small when the damage locates near the vibration nodes and is large when the damage locates at the amplitude position marked with shadow in fig 2 according to the damage identification theory based on natural frequency the index natural frequency change nfc is used to normalize the data 14 n f c i j δ ω i δ ω j j 2 5 where δ ω i δ ω j denote the natural frequency difference of order i and order j respectively the damage index of the same damage unit can be defined as the vector n i 15 n i n f c 12 n f c 13 n f c 14 n f c 15 the normalization method is used to optimize the data 16 n f c max max n f c 12 n f c 13 n f c 14 n f c 15 the normalized input vector n 1 i is 17 n 1 i n f c 12 n f c max n f c 13 n f c max n f c 14 n f c max n f c 15 n f c max fig 3 shows the normalized natural frequency database characteristics it can be seen that part of the original natural frequency data presents an aggregation phenomenon which makes it difficult for the damage features contained in the database to be classified by the neural network after normalization the distribution of data points in the database is relatively divergent which can help well distinguish and retain the characteristics of the data 3 the basic theory of pnn based on optimization algorithm 3 1 pnn pnn is commonly used for pattern classification zhou et al 2014 which is based on bayesian theory it has a prior probability h 1 p c 1 h 2 p c 2 and h 1 h 2 1 assumed that there exists an input vector x x 1 x 2 x n the vector shows n kinds of possible outcomes of a random event the outcomes of the events are classified according to equation 18 18 c c 1 p c 1 x p c 2 x c 2 p c 1 x p c 2 x given the condition c 1 the probability of x is p c 1 x according to bayesian theory the contingent probability of this event is 19 p c 1 x p c 1 p x c 1 p x during classification the input vector is usually assigned to the category with large contingent probability however errors can also inevitably occur resulting the classification errors therefore the classification method needs to be appropriately modified if we define the event a i as assigning the vector x to the result c i and λ i j as the loss of assigning a result originally belonging to c j to c i the expected risk of the loss is defined as equation 20 20 r c i x λ i j p c j x then the classification can be adjusted as 21 c c 1 r c 1 x p c 2 x c 2 r c 1 x p c 2 x the pnn structure can be divided into four layers namely the input layer the sample layer the summation layer and the output layer as shown in fig 4 the first layer of the network is the input layer in which the dimension of the input vector x and the number of neurons should be the same the second layer of the network is set as the sample layer and the relationship between the input vector x and the j th neuron of the i th sample is shown in eq 22 in the following formula x i j represents the central value of each neuron node in each sample layer σ represents the smoothing factor and d represents the total number of neurons in each sample layer 22 ϕ ij x 1 2 π 1 2 σ d e x x i j x x i j t σ 2 the third layer of the network is the summation layer used to calculate the average value of samples of the same category in the sample layer eq 23 the parameter l represents the number of neurons in the i th sample 23 v i 1 l j 1 l ϕ i j the last layer of the network is set as the output layer and the category corresponding to the highest probability in the network summation layer is set as the output result as shown in eq 24 24 y a r g m a x v i in the pnn model smoothing factors can have a great impact on the output results in this paper pso and ga are used to optimize the pnn structure the following will introduce the two intelligent optimization algorithms and adjust the parameters of the two optimization algorithms to make the smoothing factor optimization process more efficient 3 2 pso 3 2 1 theory of pso particle swarm optimization pso hou and xia 2021 has learned from bird feeding behavior that when each bird s current location is known from the food it is most efficient to search around the bird closest to the food pso is an evolutionary algorithm based on swarm iteration and has been widely used q yang 2021 when solving the global optimal solution of the problem the pso searches all particles in the same d dimensional space and evaluates the advantages and disadvantages of the current position of the particle with the fitness value with the update of the iteration the historical best position of the i th particle p i p i 1 p i 2 p i d and the historical best position of all particles p g p g 1 p g 2 p g d are saved the velocity iteration formula and position update formula of particle i are shown in eq 25 and eq 26 where c 1 and c 2 are learning factors ω is inertia weight r 1 and r 2 are random numbers in 0 1 v i d k is the d th dimensional component of the velocity vector of particle i during the k th iteration x i d k is the d th dimensional component of the position vector of particle i during the k th iteration p i d k is the best position searched in each iteration p g d k is the optimal population position found in all iterations fig 5 the steps of the original pso algorithm are as follows step 1 initialize set all involved parameters in pso algorithm lower limit and upper limit of searching space learning factors the maximum number of iterations of algorithm or convergence precision the velocity range of particle randomly initialize position and velocity of each particle step 2 evaluate each particle calculate the fitness value of each particle and record the current optimal position and global optimal position of each particle according to the fitness value step 3 update the state of the particle adopt eq 25 to update the velocity and position of each particle step 4 verify the ending condition is reached or not if the current number of iterations reaches preset maximum times or the final result is less than convergence precision stop iteration and output optimal solution or go back to step 2 3 2 2 network design the optimal smoothing factor is obtained by using pso to adjust the network to make it more efficient and accurate the accuracy of the recognition results of the training set is taken as the fitness function the optimal smoothing factor corresponding to the maximum value of the fitness function is retained through the continuous iteration process and then is used as the basic parameter of the neural network to identify the test set the network design process is shown in fig 6 3 2 3 parameter setting of pso for pso learning factor maximum velocity number of particles and inertia weight will have a certain impact on the efficiency and accuracy of the optimization algorithm during every iteration in this paper the influence of various factors will be considered to determine the optimal parameters of the optimization algorithm 1 learning factors the learning factors c 1 and c 2 measure the relationship between the particle s own extremum and the global extremum so as to determine the random acceleration of particle movement in general if c 1 is bigger than c 2 it will cause the particle to jump out of the original search range if c 2 is bigger than c 1 it is easier to converge to the local minimum during the search therefore after comprehensive consideration the two are set as equal values suganthan 1999 2 maximum velocity the maximum velocity v m a x is set to avoid the particle step size being too large or too small during the iteration a large step size may cause the particle to miss the global optimal value while a small step size may cause the particle to mature prematurely thus converging to the local optimal value in general consideration the maximum velocity limit of particles is set as v m a x 1 2 in this paper peer et al 2003 after testing the pso pnn network has good optimization ability and convergence speed under the maximum speed limit 3 number of particles the number of particles in the pso algorithm needs to be designed according to the specific problem the number of particles not only needs to ensure the ability of global searching for the optimal value but also needs to consider the computational efficiency six different population sizes 35 10 15 20 40 50 is selected respectively results show that when the population size is less than 35 it has a greater influence on the smoothing factors and fitness values of the algorithm with the increase of population the efficiency of the algorithm iterating to the optimal smoothing factor is increased and the final optimal smoothing factor iteration result is about 0 26 the maximum value of the fitness function corresponding to the final optimal smoothing factor is 0 957 however when the population size exceeds 35 fig 7 the algorithm becomes no longer sensitive to the population size and even results in a decrease in the fitness value np 40 fig 8 considering the reliability and efficiency of the algorithm the number of particles is finally set to 35 in the pso algorithm architecture the final iteration result of fitness value i e identification accuracy depends on the iteration results of the smoothing factor as can be seen from fig 7 when n 40 the smoothing factor eventually iterates to 0 1 when n 10 15 20 35 50 the smoothing factors are iterated to about 0 255 and the corresponding fitness values are all about 0 957 at this time which indicates that the network achieves the best effect the above results illustrate that when the smoothing factor iterates to about 0 255 the identification effect of the network reaches the best in the design of the pso algorithm the iterative process of smoothing factor depends on the initial position and velocity of particles the calculation method of the initial position of particles based on matlab is pn linspace 0 1 4 n the initial velocity calculation method of the particle is v vmax 2 rand 1 n 1 the updating formula of the velocity in the iteration process is v w v c1 r pbest pn c2 r gbest pn where w is the inertia weight c1 and c2 are the learning factors r is a vector composed of random numbers between 0 and 1 pbest is the best position in the iteration process gbest is the best smoothing factor in the iteration process and pn is the current position of the particle it can be concluded that the iterative results of the smoothing factor have certain randomness and it will be affected by the initial position and velocity of particles n will not only affect the initial position distribution of particles but also affect the initial velocity of each particle when n 40 due to the initial position and the randomness of velocity update the algorithm falls into a local optimum in the iteration process then the smoothing factor is iterated to about 0 1 and the fitness value reaches about 0 942 the optimal smoothing factor about 0 255 could not be found thus the optimal recognition effect could not be achieved 4 inertia weight the inertial weight ω is particularly important to the convergence performance of the algorithm when ω increases it can make the particle have enough global searching ability when ω reduces the local search ability of the particle is enhanced therefore an appropriate inertial weight selection strategy is essential to improve the searching ability of the algorithm the following shows three common different inertial weights eqs 27 29 g yang 2007 which can better balance the global search and local search capabilities of the algorithm and the effectiveness will be discussed and compared linear inertial weight liw 27 ω t ω max t max t ω max ω min t max parabolic inertial weight piw 28 ω t ω max ω max ω min t t max 2 downtrend inertial weight diw 29 ω t ω max ω max ω min 2 t t max t t max 2 where ω m a x is the maximum of inertia weight ω m i n is the minimum of inertia weight t is the current iteration step the above three methods are compared by examples below in the algorithm based on the aforementioned identification results of different parameters the number of particles is set to 35 the maximum number of iterations is set to 50 the initial weight coefficient is set to 0 5 the learning factors c 1 and c 2 are set to 2 and the maximum flight velocity of particles is set to 1 2 the results are shown in fig 9 by comprehensive comparison of the above three inertial weight methods the liw method has a slower convergence rate and the fitness function reaches the maximum after the 36th iteration at which time the inertial weight is 0 76 in the sixth iteration the piw method finds a relatively good solution with high efficiency and a corresponding inertial weight of 0 893 the diw method gets the optimal weight in the 14th iteration and the corresponding inertia weight was 0 66 however the maximum fitness function of the diw method is less than that of the liw method and piw method considering the iteration efficiency the piw method is chosen in this paper to optimize the inertia weight of pso 3 3 ga 3 3 1 theory of ga genetic algorithm ga hou and xia 2021 is a computational model of the biological evolution process that simulates the natural selection and the genetic mechanism of darwin s biological evolution it is a method to search for the optimal solution by simulating the natural evolution process a genetic algorithm takes all individuals in a population as the object and uses randomization method to guide the efficient search of coded parameter space silva et al 2016 its main feature is to operate on the structure object directly without the limitation of derivation and function continuity its flow chart is shown in fig 10 the algorithm can be represented by the following mathematical model 30 s g a c e p 0 n φ γ ψ t where c represents the individual coding mode e represents individual fitness evaluation function p 0 represents the initial population n denotes population size φ represents the selection operator γ represents the crossover operator ψ represents the mutation operator t is the condition under which the algorithm stops in this paper ga is used to obtain the optimal smoothing factor of pnn by searching the maximum of the fitness function which represents the identification accuracy 3 3 2 network design the identification accuracy of the sample set is taken as the fitness function and the individuals with higher fitness in the population are retained by the roulette method repeat the above steps to complete the iterative operation and generate individuals with larger fitness values through continuous reproduction to achieve the maximum identification accuracy and obtain the best smoothing factor in this section the smoothing factor is optimized based on ga and the accuracy of the results of the sample data is taken as the fitness function to evaluate the optimization effect the network design process is shown in fig 11 3 3 3 parameter setting of ga for ga population size np and chromosome string length l will have a great influence on its performance and these two parameters should be reasonably selected and controlled in the process of population evolution so that the genetic algorithm can reach the optimal solution with the best search trajectory the influence of the two parameters on the accuracy and efficiency of the training results will be discussed below 1 population size np the population size has an impact on the efficiency of the optimization algorithm the larger the population size is the more likely it is to find the global solution and the running time is also relatively long but the smaller population size will lead to the convergence of the search before maturity in this paper given that np 10 16 20 convergence stagnation occurs due to the small population size and the maximum fitness function is kept at 0 9428 although large population sizes not only increase the fitness function calculation there was little difference after population size reaches a certain number fig 12 np 30 40 50 therefore considering the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithm comprehensively the population size is set to 30 2 chromosome string length l the choice of chromosome string length depends on the accuracy of the solution to a particular problem the higher the accuracy required the longer the chromosome string length is but the more computation time required in this paper the chromosome string length of 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 is selected respectively to discuss the convergence characteristics and results of the optimal smoothing factor and fitness function as can be seen from fig 13 as l increases the efficiency of iterating to the best smoothing factor and fitness value increases when l reaches 10 only 5 steps are needed to iterate to the optimal fitness value 0 9571 when the number of bit strings is greater than 10 the effect of l on the iteration efficiency almost does not change the smoothing factor is about 0 256 and the fitness value reaches 0 9571 therefore l of 10 is selected as the parameter of the neural network based on ga 3 crossover in this paper the smoothing factor which is used in the chromosomes is selected as the object optimized by ga to improve the accuracy of the network binary coding is adopted to represent each chromosome as a string composed of 0 and 1 this paper then uses double point crossing to randomly select two intersections on the chromosome and then exchanges the substrings between the intersections to obtain two new individuals take chromosome length of 8 as an example when pc rand the chromosomes are crossed as shown in fig 14 when pc rand no update is made pc represents the crossover rate and rand represents a random number between 0 and 1 4 mutation the mutation is the substitution of the gene values on some gene sites in the chromosome sequence with other alleles on the gene site to form a new individual in this paper when pm rand the chromosome is mutated to change the 0 in the binary number to 1 1 to 0 when pm rand no mutation is updated pm represents the mutation rate 4 identification results of hull girder damage in this paper the network is trained through the training set and the identification accuracy is taken as the fitness value of the network through the iterative process the network fitness values under different smoothing factors are compared to find the optimal smoothing factor then the optimal smoothing factor obtained by the pso and ga is taken as the basic parameter of the pnn network and the test set is input into the optimized pnn network to obtain the damage identification results fourteen damaged units are used to simulate the damage each unit is set at a 1 interval with the damage extent ranged from 0 to 50 a total of 700 damage conditions are used as the training set among them the data with damage extent of 1 5 10 20 30 35 40 and 50 are selected as the optimization set to achieve the best smoothing factor of the neural network the test set contains the data corresponding to the damage extent of 13 and 23 which has been included in the training set to test whether the optimized neural network can retain the identification accuracy of the original data furthermore the test set contains the data corresponding to the damage extent of 28 5 33 5 and 48 5 which is also obtained by the migration matrix method to explore the identification effect of data with a certain level of precision as can be seen from the results the identification accuracy of most cases with damage extent of 13 and 23 is 0 which reflects that the neural network can still retain the accuracy of the original database after training and optimization however when the damage extent is 28 5 33 5 and 48 5 the identification results produce certain errors which indicates that the identification results of the neural network will produce errors under certain accuracy requirements results also show that ga shows better efficiency and only takes 5 steps to iterate to the optimal smoothing factor 0 255 the damage location accuracy of the results reaches 100 the damage extent identification results and errors are shown in fig 15 and fig 16 respectively the average error is 1 38 and the maximum error is 26 3 only case 38 which indicates a good damage identification effect although case 38 occurs large error 5 conclusions in this paper the damage identification of hull girder based on the probabilistic neural network pnn method is investigated in actual engineering it is difficult for ship damage to be detected and evaluated in real time this paper aims to indirectly locate and quantify the hull girder damage through the variation of the natural frequency parameters the migration matrix method is selected to obtain the natural frequency database of the hull girder under various damage conditions and the normalization method is used to optimize the database the particle swarm optimization pso and the genetic algorithm ga are embedded in the pnn respectively to search for the best smoothing factor then test sets including 70 damage cases are carried out to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the network the conclusions are as follows 1 the establishment of the damage database is the key to damage identification based on intelligent methods the migration matrix method can be utilized to obtain the natural frequency database of the hull girder under various damage conditions 2 processing the natural frequency database by normalization method can effectively maintain the total database size while enhancing the data feature recognition and the network s ability to sense parameter changes allowing it to effectively identify hull girder damage 3 the change of natural frequency of the hull girder after the damage is related to the damage location when the damage is located close to the vibration node the natural frequencies of the corresponding order change little when the damage is near the amplitude point the natural frequencies vary a lot 4 for the case studied in this paper network models using both pso and ga allow the smoothing factor to converge to an optimal value when the fitness function reaches its maximum ga is more efficient than pso because it iterates to the optimal smoothing factor in fewer steps 5 based on the artificial intelligence method for hull girder damage identification it is not necessary to derive the mapping relationship between damage and natural frequency from a traditional mechanical point of view the damage agent model for hull girder can be created by the training of a sufficient database and the location and extent of damage can be efficiently output under the input of the natural frequency of unknown damage conditions this method investigates hull girder damage from an inverse problem perspective which uses an intelligent approach to solve the damage this method provides a technical reference for practical application in engineering 6 future applications in this paper the feasibility and effectiveness of the hull girder damage identification based on frequency parameters are analyzed theoretically the results show that this method can effectively realize the damage identification of hull girder the important application background of this method is the underwater explosion damage identification of hull girder for military ships it is very difficult to locate and quantify the damage by field survey when damage occurs below the waterline and this investigation develops a novel method that can indirectly identify the ship explosion damage different from the signals which mostly come from the natural environment or artificial secondary incentives for structural health monitoring shm of civil engineering and bridge engineering the explosion damage identification of the hull girder is hoped to be realized by using the accompanying signals during the explosion damage event rather than by using environmental or artificial secondary excitation loading on the one hand the projectile body attack can cause the phenomenon of fragments throwing out of the hull or gas escaping from the hull which will cause a counterforce to the hull and generate the total vibration response of the hull girder on the other hand the shock wave and bubble pulsating load caused by the underwater explosion can also cause the total vibration response of the hull girder the explosion damage signal under the explosion load has a high amplitude and is mixed with high frequency signals local vibration signals and low frequency signals total vibration signals in this case the damage signals contain noise signals high frequency signals however decay faster then the hull girder gradually shows whip type motion i e total vibration and at this time the signal form is mainly the low frequency signal with total vibration which contains the damage information of the damaged hull girder the dynamic parameters of the hull girder under this condition can be obtained immediately by collecting the total vibration signals in this stage to identify the hull girder damage credit authorship contribution statement yin zhang methodology creation of models

20253,in this work the phenomenon of the wave reflection has been studied using a self developed passive extinction system twenty one type of waves were generated in the laboratory using a piston type

multiphase vof was designed and validated according to the free surface displacement ɳ i and the calculation of the kr values both type of validations were successful so this model was used in order to determine kr values at slopes that could not be physically reached by the extinction system the obtained results allowed to determine the minimum kr values for each set of experiments and finding a

viscosity m t2 l 1 λ wavelength l 1 introduction wave reflection is a phenomenon that may occur in some experimental facilities such as wave flumes or tanks when the induced waves interact with any total or partially submerged structure that may be the object of study or the boundary of the fluid domain as a result of this interaction new waves with different properties are re generated modifying the swell scenario these types of experimental facilities are widely used to analyse the behaviour of new devices such as wave energy converters wecs zhao et al 2019 or floating structures xie et al 2019 at small scale and representative sea conditions because of their relative low cost and great effectiveness in the case of wecs part of the energy of the incident wave will not be absorbed to produce energy and it will be dissipated by viscous friction in the structure itself while another fraction will be reflected and or re emitted by radiation in the case of mobile devices on the other hand the interaction of extreme waves with offshore wind power structures can put at risk the structural integrity of the anchoring systems as well as disturb the stability of the wind turbine with significant variations of its optimal orientation with respect to the wind incidence in this way the study of wave dissipation and reflection becomes an important issue for the behaviour of different structures subjected to the action of the wave esteban alcalá et al 2020 therefore the wave characteristics need to be perfectly controlled and consequently the reflection occurring in these facilities must be minimized the present study analyses the reflection produced by a passive absorption system installed in a wave flume consisting of a mobile structure with parabolic profile the adaptive geometry of such system allows optimizing the dissipation of the incident waves according to the specific wave generation wave flumes focus on developing two dimensional wave trains so that the infrastructure has to be narrow enough to avoid three dimensional effects izquierdo et al 2019a tutar and veci 2016 in parallel the flume has to be long enough to guarantee fully developed waves as a whole the facility can be divided into three different regions generation propagation and extinction areas the first one or generation area is made up of the wave maker and the length of the flume where the wave is directly affected by the inertia of the movement of the paddle the total length of this area depends on the characteristics of the wave being required a reference distance of twice the wavelength to consider the wave completely developed izquierdo et al 2019a mainly two types of wave maker present a widespread use in this experimental research field the piston type used to generate shallow water waves h λ 0 05 and characterized by elliptical trajectories and the flap type used to generate deep water waves h λ 0 5 and characterized by circular trajectories were h m is the depth and λ m is the wavelength while both types are capable to generate waves at intermediate water depths 0 05 h λ 0 5 and distinguished by elliptical trajectories but not as narrow as shallow waters waves piston type wave makers are more suitable to encompass this region edinburgh designs ltd 2016 machado et al 2018 the second one so called propagation area consists of the section of the flume where the wave once fully developed travels along the flume without suffering any significant modification on its wavelength period height or shape this is the appropriate zone to carry out most of the research activities such as experiments with floating structures or wecs finally the extinction area that usually consists of a structure where the wave energy is partially passive systems or completely active systems dissipated while active wave absorbers can completely neutralize the energy of the incident wave and therefore avoid the reflection this is not the case for passive absorbers that are cheaper and easier to install allowing a significant energy absorption by reducing considerably the wave reflection ouellet and datta 1986 there exists a wide range of different configurations and designs of passive wave absorbers with a permeable lim 2014 madsen 1983 or impermeable tiedeman et al 2012 structure it has been reported that the amount of energy absorption depends on their geometry ouellet and datta 1986 being the parabolic profile the option that produces a highly effective energy absorption with lower use of the available length of the flume ouellet and datta 1986 tiedeman et al 2012 hitherto not any complete study has been reported in the literature that explicitly describes the optimum conditions that minimize the reflection of the waves in a parabolic type passive wave absorber due to the fact that the reflection phenomenon is directly related to the instantaneous characteristics of the wave structure interaction i e wavelength period and height in this study a wide range of monochromatic waves have been studied and the dependence of the reflection phenomenon on the wave parametric domain has been analysed in deep to determine the reflection and its corresponding coefficient the incident and reflected waves have to be fully characterized on the one hand the incident wave is defined by the movement of the wave maker which is programmed based on the laboratory wave generation methods s a hughes 1993 on the other hand the reflected wave will depend on the physical properties of the type of absorption system such as the profile position slope roughness and elevation once the incident wave is partially reflected it travels towards the opposite direction of the incoming incident waves generating the wave profile named resultant wave being the superposition of the reflected and incident waves the study of the reflection phenomenon consists of the characterization of the aforementioned wave profiles as a function of the characteristics and position of the absorption system available in the wave flume in wave flumes with passive absorption systems the reflection phenomenon can be characterized by any of the methods available in literature frigaard and brorsen 1995 goda and suzuki n d isaacson 1991 mansard and funke 1980 that define the reflection coefficient kr as the ratio of reflected wave height to incident wave height h m besides the coefficient can also be calculated with a spatial method that compares the wave heights in the antinode h max m and the node h min m of the resultant wave from the superposition isaacson 1991 as defined in equation 1 1 k r h m a x h m i n h m a x h m i n isaacson 1991 compared different methods for the characterization of the reflection by using fixed probes goda suzuki goda and suzuki n d presented a method with two probes and measured the phase shift between signals and the wave height at each measuring point they applied a fast fourier transform method in order to create a flexible and versatile tool that can work with both regular and irregular waves considering irregular waves as a sum of different regular waves however this technique shows some limitations when the spacing between probes is equal to half the wavelength or any of its multiples in order to verify this method they compared the results obtained placing the probes at different distances for several runs of two regular waves mansard funke mansard and funke 1980 used three probes to measure their phase shift and the wave height defining the wave profile in each probe as the summation of the discrete harmonically related fourier components besides isaacson presented another method based on the wave height measurements at three points excluding the phase shift measurements because in certain cases they may be inaccurate although all the previously described methods are based on the frequency domain frigaard brorsen frigaard and brorsen 1995 presented a time domain based method which is anyway out of the approach of this study moreover mora et al 2018 presented a mathematical solution for long waves propagating along a slender harbour with a convergent divergent region analysing the phenomena that take place in this type of structures and comparing the theoretical formulas with a numerical and analytical models in addition the passive parabolic absorption system can be characterized in terms of reflection coefficient as a function of the iribarren number i r iribarren r nogales 1949 2 i r tan α h λ 0 where α is the sloping angle formed by the imaginary straight line that joins the extreme points of the surface and free surface of the water and λ0 is the wavelength of the wave developed in deep water with its characteristic period battjes 1974 proposed using the i r number to determine the reflection and dissipation absorption of the waves on the breakwater slope among many other applications during the last decades several researchers modified i r number according to the applications developed as was mentioned in díaz carrasco et al 2020 in addition numerical wave flumes nwf the computational counterpart of the experimental wave flumes ewf are commonly used in order to have a better understanding of any related phenomenon in the first steps of the design numerical studies are mainly carried out in 2d developed models that reproduce wave propagation and their interaction with fixed viviano et al 2018 or floating structures xie et al 2019 based on numerical solutions of the fundamental equations corresponding to the fluid motion for the simulation of wave generation either for piston or flap type wave makers the moving boundary option is used altomare et al 2017 two main models are used nowadays the volume of fluid vof a mesh dependant multiphase eulerian model hirt and nichols 1981 which has been previously used for the characterization of waves izquierdo et al 2019a and it is also commonly used to study the performance of floating bruinsma et al 2018 or fixed structures lópez et al 2014 besides smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model has arisen as another interesting option it is a meshless model that defines the movement and interactions of spherical particles based on navier stokes equations higuera et al 2015 it has been used in the solution of several case studies such as breaking waves dalrymple and rogers 2006 green waters gómez gesteira et al 2005 or the behaviour of floating bodies under extreme wave conditions zhao and hu 2012 2 aims and methodology the objective of this study is to provide a clear procedure for the determination of the reflection coefficient kr measuring its lowest value for each independent wave generated based on the detailed study of a self developed passive extinction system installed in a wave flume of reference the most important achievement of this work is the characterization of this system because it is a new concept for energy dissipation that stands out because of its versatility in terms of adaptability to achieve the highest wave energy dissipation rate among the existing methods for the calculation of the kr value the one proposed by mansard funke was used aiming to determine the overall position of the absorption system that guarantees the highest wave energy dissipation the work encompasses the design of a nwf based on vof model further validated through the corresponding experimental tests performed in a particular case study of a ewf consequently the experimental outcomes will be compared according to the method presented by mansard funke as obtained for the numerical and experimental wave flumes the nwf was then used to determine the k r of those constrain positions of the extinction system 3 experimental and numerical approach a significant number of experimental tests and numerical simulations were performed in water at several depths 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m using a piston type wave maker several type of regular waves are analysed in waters of intermediate and deep depths covering the linear airy and non linear stokes 2nd order regions of the le méhauté chart see fig 5 by modifying the period 0 636 t s 1 526 and the height 0 010 h m 0 064 respectively in order to define the inclination of the parabolic structure the slope α of the imaginary straight line joining the opposite ends has been used in the range of 3 α 17 the time interval elapsed for each experiment ends when the re reflection occurs in the generation paddle and it is determined according to the velocity propagation of the waves c all the data have been processed by using matlab r2019a mathworks n d 3 1 experimental wave flume the ewf is 12 5 m long 0 60 m wide and 0 7 m high u izquierdo l galera calero i albaina g a esteban a aristondo 2019 the structure consists of laminated and tempered glass walls supported by a stainless steel platform the waves are generated through the commercial software delta asda v5 electronics 2019 that controls the delta ac asda a2 series servo drive and servo motor the servo motor is connected to a k series linear actuator km60 10 roller screw model which is attached to a paddle that is partially submerged in water see fig 1 the software allows the paddle to follow a sinusoidal movement or any other higher order movement that turns into a progressive acceleration deceleration pattern for the generation of waves based on the laboratory wave generation methods and applying to a piston type wave maker s a hughes 1993 the movement pattern of the servo drive is specified position and velocity as a function of time according to the parameters of the desired wave λ t h and h once these parameters are specified the servo drive engaged the servo motor and the servo motor moves the piston that is attached to the paddle the expressions relating the paddle displacement and the generated waves for a piston type wave maker is defined in equation 3 and the second order wave board

surface displacement ɳ exp i as a function of time t with a sampling time interval of δt 3 ms for each wave probe the main properties of the equipment described above are detailed in izquierdo et al 2019b the first probe position is set at 6 0 m from the wave generating position and the distance between consecutive probes is stablished according to the criteria described in goda and suzuki n d depending on each wave s parameters the extinction region consists of a self designed passive absorption system with a parabolic solid area of 1 5 m length that can be adjusted manually by modifying the height c the slope b or the elevation d through precision screws as depicted below in fig 2 the parabola that defines the shape of the surface of the self designed extinction system is based on ouellet and datta 1986 and it corresponds to the following equation 9 y m m 200 0 023 x 9 10 5 x 2 the design of this extinction system permits to be adapted depending on the depth the type of wave or the type of study being carried out in the flume in height and angle in addition the surface which is completely smooth for this study could also be substituted by any other type of surface such as rough or perforated 3 2 numerical wave flume 3 2 1 governing equations conservation equations most known as navier stokes equations are used to define the behaviour of newtonian fluids these equations are the mass conservation 10 and the momentum conservation 11 equations that in an incompressible fluid can be defined as 10 u i 0 11 u i t u i u i 1 ρ p ν 2 u i g where u i is the velocity of the flow in each of the dimensions being i 1 2 3 ρ the density of the fluid p the pressure ν the dynamic viscosity and g the gravity vector these equations can define all the states of a flow from laminar to turbulent states where a lot of eddies of different sizes appear due to the energy cascade effect this defines the energy transmission from larger eddies to smaller ones repeatedly until the smallest eddies are dissipated by viscous effects or heat dissipation the direct application of these equations known as direct numerical simulations dns is possible however this approach has a high computational cost due to the calculation of all turbulent scales besides simplified approaches have been used for engineering applications throughout the last decades with great accuracy the most common approach is to apply the reynolds decomposition to the navier stokes equation 12 this decomposition focusses on the mean and fluctuating values of the fluid velocity in a certain point 12 u i x t u i x u i x t where u i is the velocity in a certain point in each instant time u i x is the mean value of the velocity in that point and u i x t are the fluctuations of the velocity in space and time thus the application of this decomposition generates the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations this process introduces new components to the equations such as the reynolds stress tensors τ i j in the momentum equation the mass and momentum equations for rans are 13 u i 0 14 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ x j p δ i j 2 μ s i j τ i j g where u j is the time averaged fluid flow ρ is the density p is the pressure μ is the viscosity i j equals to 1 2 and 3 which are the three spatial dimensions δ ij is the kronecker function s ij is the viscosity tensor and τ i j is the reynolds stresses 15 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i 16 τ i j ρ u i u j for this study star ccm software has been used for the rans approach that we imposed into the numerical simulations the fluctuation reynolds stresses are modelled with the boussinesq hypothesis 17 τ i j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k t μ t u i x i δ ij where μ t is the eddy viscosity and kt the turbulent kinetic energy this model inserts two new variables to the navier stokes equations generating an open system thereby more equations are needed to close the system to do that a two equation turbulence model is inserted for this aim the model is the low

where εt is the energy dissipation rate and cε1 cε2 cμ σk and σε are model coefficients rans equations are used with a second order temporal discretization eulerian multiphase vof unsteady model is implemented to define both fluids taken also into account the effects of gravity and surface tension respectively galera calero and izquierdo 2020 hirt and nichols 1981 the volume fraction can be defined as the percentage of the cell volume that one fluid occupies which transport equation can be defined as 21 α i t α i u i 0 where α i is the volume fraction t the time and u i is the flow velocity vector the free surface orientation is defined by determining in which direction the value varies more rapidly which defines the normal direction of the free surface in each cell the computational results were recorded by defining the corresponding vertical planes for each computational wave probe results in terms of free surface displacement ɳ com i as a function of time were acquired in each time step of the simulation the properties of each fluid are defined as follows guide 2015 22 ρ i α i ρ i 23 μ i α i ν i α i ρ i and ν i are calculated for each cell all over the computational domain the k ε provides a general description of turbulence by means of two transport equations one for the kinetic energy k i and another for the turbulence dissipation rate ε windt et al 2018 besides previous work has been developed with this turbulence model achieving successful validation results izquierdo et al 2019a it was selected because the two layer approach is valid for low and high wall y values providing a better definition of the near wall treatment 3 2 2 definition of the geometry and movement of the wave generator a 2d numerical wave flume nwf containing two phases water and surrounding air has been built galera calero et al 2020 the nwf is 12 0 m length and 0 7 m high when compared to the ewf for the nwf the volume of water behind the wave maker 0 5 m length is neglected because it is considered as a solid mobile wall without water movement between both volumes the solid mobile wall reproduces accurately the behaviour of the wave maker with a morphing grid velocity condition which allows defining its velocity variation during each cycle in the corresponding simulation see fig 3 the movement of the paddle depends on the wave to be generated being linear airy and non linear stokes 2nd order waves the last modelled in this study this implies the use of motion equations that control the displacement of the paddle according to each specific wave to be generated these equations are obtained from the theory of the wave maker s a hughes 1993 and are set up in the software that controls the paddle 24 x t a cos 2 π t t where a is the amplitude of the curve which is equal to half of a stroke s 2 being t the period and t the time interval for the linear wave deriving equation 24 the mathematical equation for linear waves 25 that defines the velocity of the paddle as a function of time is obtained 25 v t 2 a t π sin 2 π t t to reproduce non linear waves the movement equation of the paddle is defined as follows 26 x t a 1 cos 2 π t t a 2 cos 4 π t t where a 1 is the amplitude of the primary wave a 2 the amplitude of the secondary wave t is the period and t is the time dependant variable for the non linear wave deriving equation 26 the corresponding velocity of the paddle is obtained 27 27 v t 2 a 1 t π sin 2 π t t 4 a 2 t π sin 4 π t t fig 3 shows the general scheme of the boundaries of the computational domain the top wall is defined as a pressure outlet which allows the air to move throughout freely while the bottom is defined as a wall both have a boundary constraint plane to allow the movement of the wave maker which is defined as a moving wall all the boundaries defined as walls have a non slip condition to reproduce the same effect that the physical boundaries have in the experimental flume being these boundaries the end wall the bottom and the extinction system this system is numerically reproduced by two parabolic walls both fixed and with non slip conditions the position of the parabolic walls defines the desired angle of the extinction system which must be specified in each experiment being the angle defined by the straight line that joins the highest and lowest point of the extinction system and the horizontal direction 3 2 3 mesh definition the mesh has been optimized through a mesh sensitivity analysis aiming for reducing the computational cost but achieving the most accurate definition of the free surface displacement this has been carried out by defining several areas in the domain 1 the area where the fluid is only air 2 the area where a free surface displacement is studied 3 the area where there is always water and two areas of special interest the generation paddle and the extinction beach respectively all of these areas can be observed in detail in fig 4 while the area in which the fluid is always air 1 the base cell size is a square of 20 cm the area closer to the free surface is meshed with significantly smaller cells adjusting their size to the wave height and wavelength for this last since the propagation of the wave is much faster than the proper free surface elevation the horizontal displacement is faster than the vertical one quadrilateral cells have been used with an aspect ratio ar of 4 0 being quadrilateral cells of 1 5 mm 6 0 mm length x height besides a growth factor of 1 3 is imposed in the extinction system surface to achieve a good definition of the wave breaking for the area where there is always water 3 cells with an ar 2 0 are used being quadrilateral cells of 2 0 mm 4 0 mm length x height finally prism layers were generated for the areas of the generation paddle and the extinction system respectively for them 20 and 13 prism layers with a stretching coefficient of 1 2 and 1 3 and a total thickness of 3 0 cm and 1 0 cm respectively were generated the total amount of cells for the lowest wave height tested in each depth is 637641 for h 0 3 m 727266 for h 0 4 m and 610715 for h 0 5 m this allows simulating 30 s in approximately 10 h using a time step of 0 001 s and 5 inner iterations in a dell precision 7920 with 24 xeon cores and ram of 32 gb workstation the cell size was calculated based on the courant number limitation being always lower than 0 40 for the second order waves and lower than 0 87 for the first order waves 4 experimental campaign the experimental tests were defined considering the length of the wave flume and the capacity of the servo motor in addition for all the experiments the maximum and minimum wave heights were delimited in order to avoid the trough passing under the extinction system or the peak to overflow it each wave was defined as follows first the depth of the experiment was decided then based on the non dimensional le méhauté chart see next fig 5 a specific value of the x axis coordinate was selected to define the t next the value of h was calculated from the corresponding value of the y axis coordinate subsequently the wavelength was obtained through the wave dispersion relation given by equation 27 27b λ g t 2 2 π t a n h 2 π h λ and finally the movement of the paddle was specified as described in equations 3 and 4 thereby 21 waves were theoretically defined as was previously mentioned covering the linear and non linear regions in a wide range of t h and λ as shown in table 1 the modification of α would allow obtaining a trend and determining the lowest kr value corresponding to the highest wave energy absorption for each experiment α of the extinction system was set by modifying the vertical position of the opposite ends the coordinate for the beginning of the paddle y 1 that is always submerged and the coordinate for the end of the paddle y 2 that is always above the free surface the value α was increased for each experiment at intervals of 2 for the ranges specified in the last column of table 1 moreover it was also taken into account the horizontal displacement of the extinction system in order to define the mesh for each h and α as it is discussed in section 4 results and discussion for some waves it was not possible to experimentally determine the lowest kr value because of design constraints that make impossible setting the extinction systems in limiting positions so that the minimum value would be achieved once the validation of the computational model was carried out the kr values of those positions were determined 4 1 validation of the computational model a triple comparative between theoretical experimental and computational results in terms of t h and λ was carried out in order to validate the computational model ensuring the reliability of the calculated kr values the free surface displacement of the experimental and computationally acquired signals ɳ com i and ɳ exp i provides information about how accurate the computational model reproduces the waves generated in the flume for both experimental and computational experiments the phase shift was measured between the signals acquired by two consecutive probes which also permitted to calculate the wave propagation velocity c m s fig 6 contains the signal information during the time interval corresponding a complete experiment generation propagation and reflection for a particular wave measured by one of the probes the wave 11 is selected because it represents approximately the average values of the analysed parameters h t h and λ the parameters of the experimental and numerically generated waves were calculated by using matlab r2019a to fit their free surface signal to the corresponding wave theory equations linear or non linear for the case of wave11 represented in fig 6 the experimental and computational data ranged between 8 2 t s 13 5 the ones corresponding to the propagation period were fitted to a non linear wave equation during this time interval the wave is considered fully developed and therefore it is not yet influenced by the reflection besides the data used for the calculation of the kr value are inside the time interval 15 5 t s 17 9 from this the signal acquired by the wave probes would correspond to a re reflected wave train and therefore the data would not be valid for this study the fittings carried out for both experimental and computational signals provided the corresponding results in terms of t h and λ as well as the value of the square of pearson s product moment correlation coefficient r 2 on the one hand the average among all the experiments carried out for the calculated r 2 is 97 6 and the comparison between experimental and computational signals fitting provided a r 2 value higher than 99 5 see fig 7 on the other hand the measured t h and λ were compared with the analytical values given by the wave theory in order to calculate the corresponding relative errors for almost all the experiments errors below 3 were measured and for some punctual experiments below 5 this demonstrated an appropriate operation of all the components of the wave flume and a successful design of the numerical model finally the validation experiments aimed to prove the validity of the model by comparing results for several h t α and vertical positions of the extinction system y 1 y 2 thus two specific positions were selected with completely different coordinates two angles for which minimum kr values were experimentally calculated and for both cases most of the waves reproduced in the laboratory at those conditions fig 8 shows a comparative test between experimental and numerical results in terms of the kr value both calculated by the method of mansard funke both the tendency and the kr values are very close to each other taking into account that this coefficient is a mathematical division of values of which two of them are obtained after 17 s it can be affirmed that the results reflect successful computational simulations this computational model is therefore valid for the cases in which the trend followed was not completely clear or it seemed that the minimum of the kr values was not reached as it was previously commented this happened for the experiments carried out at h 0 5 m so that these specific experiments were numerically reproduced and the results showed that none of the computational results offered a new minimum kr value 5 results and discussion results have been analysed to determine the minimum kr value as a function of a non dimensional parameter h y 1 λ defined by the relation between the effective vertical distance of the extinction system h y 1 with the wavelength λ this parameter defines the relative length of the liquid depth that is covered by the vertical projection of the extinction system h y 1 with respect to the size of the wave given by the wavelength λ a higher value of this parameter will lead to a greater interaction of the extinction system with the larger orbitals of the fluid particles of the wave i e the ones closer to the free surface on the contrary a smaller bottom gap below the extinction system would allow the wave passing through and reflect directly on the vertical wall end of the flume in fig 9 the results obtained at h 0 3 m are shown as calculated by the mansard funke method in this fig 9 the corresponding fittings to a second order polynomial equation have been represented in order to analyse the trend of the kr value and determine the influence of the submersion of the extinction system for all the waves generated at low h y 1 λ values the highest kr values were calculated and once the minimum values were achieved at intermediate h y 1 λ values the kr increases again when the submersion of the paddle was the minimum this reveals that the highest energy dissipation rate is never obtained when the extinction system is completely submerged in a similar way the same approach has been carried out for the experiments at h 0 4 and 0 5 m achieving same conclusions however the increase of the kr value is also related with the ir number then analogous trends can be also obtained as a function of ir number which is shown in fig 10 for waves generated at h 0 5 m the ir number defined in equation 2 depends on the sloping angle and the wavelength of the wave developed in deep water the trends obtained in this fig 10 are very similar to the ones shown in fig 9 highest energy dissipation rate is obtained when the extinction system is partially submerged in general when kr is represented as a function of h y 1 h y 1 λ or ir analogous tendencies are obtained or the contrary ones when represented against y1 however the increasing kr values can also be explained according to the breaking behaviour of waves because the ir number has been used to define different types of breaking according to the following intervals ir 0 5 spilling 0 5 ir 3 3 plunging and ir 3 3 collapsing surging battjes 1974 based on this classification the waves generated in this work corresponds to the spilling and plunging breakings the higher the value of the ir number the less dissipative and more reflective the type of wave breaking becomes in the extinction system the enhancement of spilling far from surging mode should be pursued in order to minimize the value of the reflection coefficient this makes the self designed system a very useful and effective extinction system to minimize the reflection of any generated wave in the next fig 11 a comparison between spilling and plunging type of breaking can be observed as simulated for wave 4 ir 0 32 spilling and wave 7 ir 1 97 plunging the captures show clearly the evolution of the waves when breaking while wave 4 travels through a large part of the extinction system smoothly and with enough time until the next incoming wave interacts wave 7 breaks abruptly and in a short part of the extinction system the next fig 12 shows the relationship between kr and h y 1 λ divided in several intervals of ir the first interval corresponds to the spilling type of breaking and the others are four intervals comprehended into the plunging type of breaking fig 12 comprises all the experiments carried out with the 21 different waves several intervals were defined for the plunging type breaking in order to reduce the dispersion of the results when shown with their corresponding fittings to a potential equation at low h y 1 λ values the highest kr values were calculated and according to this type of breaking the lowest kr values were calculated for spilling it can also be appreciated the influence of the submerged part of the extinction system for the energy dissipation decreasing at higher h y 1 λ values in this figure it can also be clearly appreciated the increase of kr values at a constant h y 1 λ when increasing ir number values in the contrary way fig 13 represents the influence of the ir number having divided several intervals of h y 1 λ here it can more clearly be observed that kr values increase at increasing ir numbers however it is more evident the successful design of the extinction system because of the smooth increase of the kr values at increasing ir number when h y 1 λ value is high in addition to the previous results the corresponding correlation between the minimum calculated kr values h y 1 λ and ir number was obtained as a function of the dispersion parameter kh this triple approach provides a universal relationship in terms of these three parameters aiming to achieve the minimum kr value fig 14 left shows how the lower relative period and wavelength of the wave higher kh the higher the possibility to dissipate the wave and minimize the reflection coefficient by an optimized position of the parabolic extinction system in addition fig 14 right defines the optimum configuration to get such a minimum value of kr in a dimensionless way in terms of the surf parameter ir and the vertical coverage h y 1 λ it can be noticed that relative longer waves need a shorter vertical coverage of the wave by the parabolic system and a slightly higher value of the surf parameter ir to get a minimum reflection coefficient the particular system used for the wave energy dissipation complicated the possibility of comparing results with other similar systems because most of them are attached to the bottom of the flume and were carried out mostly in deep water waves battjes 1974 hodaei et al 2016 ish m and raju 2004 ouellet and datta 1986 puspita et al 2019 while all of those systems are completely static the extinction system presented here allows obtaining various sloping angles and vertical positions which seems to be the key factor to minimize the reflection along the flume nonetheless the results have been compared with those obtained in other models reported in specialized literature as shown in table 2 the results obtained in the present work have been compared with those of puspita et al 2019 hodaei et al 2016 and puspita et al 2020 it is worth noting the benefit of using a parabolic extinction system with smaller values of reflection coefficient in comparison to the more traditional plane inclined plate in the present piece of research a methodology to optimise the geometric location of the parabolic profile in relation of the properties of the incident wave has been developed as a consequence minimum values of the reflection coefficient below the reference of kr 0 08 have been achieved which implies a significant comparative improvement within the available passive extinction methods in addition focusing on characteristics of the absorption systems of the literature it seems possible to continue reducing the reflection along the flume by perforating the surface of the absorption system which will be considered in future work 6 conclusions the phenomenon of the reflection has been studied using a self developed passive extinction system installed in a wave flume of 12 5 m long 0 60 m wide and 0 7 m high the slope of this absorption system can be modified as well as its vertical end position which increased the possibility to find the optimal position for the wave energy dissipation a significant number of experimental tests were reproduced in the laboratory by means of a piston type wave maker several depths h of 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m respectively periods 0 636 t s 1 526 wave heights 0 010 h m 0 064 slopes 3 α 17 and vertical positions 0 005 y1 m 0 279 at h 0 3 m 0 008 y1 m 0 385 at h 0 4 m 0 098 y1 m 0 465 at h 0 5 m and y2 m defined by y1 m and α of the extinction system covering the linear airy and non linear stokes 2nd order regions of the le méhauté chart were studied a computational model based on the eulerian multiphase vof unsteady model was designed to reflect through simulations any of the conditions that can be reproduced in the experimental wave flume a successful validation of the computational model was carried out being the simulations checked by two different ways on the one hand a validation based on the free surface displacement ɳ i by comparing the theoretical experimental and numerical signals and on the other hand a validation based on the calculation of the kr values was carried out both ways were successfully achieved because the error was negligible in addition this model was used in order to determine kr values at slopes that could not be physically reached by the extinction system which was very useful to determine certain trends at h 0 5 m the calculated kr experimental results were analysed in terms of a non dimensional h y 1 λ parameter which relates the energy dissipation with the part of the extinction system that is submerged the main conclusion achieved is that the maximum energy dissipation strongly depends on its vertical position in addition the experimental results have also been analysed with respect to the ir number in this case the relation of the type of breaking with the energy dissipation have been confirmed however it has also been valid to confirm that the highest energy dissipation rate is never obtained when the extinction system is attached to the bottom of the flume being needed to rise it to minimize the reflection furthermore the minimum kr values were extracted among all the experiments and condition tested these results together with h y 1 λ and the ir number were compared as a function of the dispersion parameter kh having as a result a universal relationship between them therefore these results clearly demonstrated the successful design of this extinction system that could be adapted to achieve the highest energy dissipation depending on the type of wave generated this study will continue analyzing the influence of the porosity in the surface of the self design extinction system in addition the numerical model will be used in future experiments to determine the reflection in breakwaters containing an owc credit authorship contribution statement u izquierdo calibration of the resistive type wave probes and

20253,in this work the phenomenon of the wave reflection has been studied using a self developed passive extinction system twenty one type of waves were generated in the laboratory using a piston type wave maker the variation of the reflection coefficient kr was studied at several depths h m of 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 periods 0 636 t s 1 526 wave heights 0 010 h m 0 064 slopes 3 α 17 and vertical end positions of the extinction system y1 m and y2 m defined by y1 m and α covering the linear and non linear regions of the le méhauté chart in parallel an unsteady numerical model based on the eulerian multiphase vof was designed and validated according to the free surface displacement ɳ i and the calculation of the kr values both type of validations were successful so this model was used in order to determine kr values at slopes that could not be physically reached by the extinction system the obtained results allowed to determine the minimum kr values for each set of experiments and finding a

viscosity m t2 l 1 λ wavelength l 1 introduction wave reflection is a phenomenon that may occur in some experimental facilities such as wave flumes or tanks when the induced waves interact with any total or partially submerged structure that may be the object of study or the boundary of the fluid domain as a result of this interaction new waves with different properties are re generated modifying the swell scenario these types of experimental facilities are widely used to analyse the behaviour of new devices such as wave energy converters wecs zhao et al 2019 or floating structures xie et al 2019 at small scale and representative sea conditions because of their relative low cost and great effectiveness in the case of wecs part of the energy of the incident wave will not be absorbed to produce energy and it will be dissipated by viscous friction in the structure itself while another fraction will be reflected and or re emitted by radiation in the case of mobile devices on the other hand the interaction of extreme waves with offshore wind power structures can put at risk the structural integrity of the anchoring systems as well as disturb the stability of the wind turbine with significant variations of its optimal orientation with respect to the wind incidence in this way the study of wave dissipation and reflection becomes an important issue for the behaviour of different structures subjected to the action of the wave esteban alcalá et al 2020 therefore the wave characteristics need to be perfectly controlled and consequently the reflection occurring in these facilities must be minimized the present study analyses the reflection produced by a passive absorption system installed in a wave flume consisting of a mobile structure with parabolic profile the adaptive geometry of such system allows optimizing the dissipation of the incident waves according to the specific wave generation wave flumes focus on developing two dimensional wave trains so that the infrastructure has to be narrow enough to avoid three dimensional effects izquierdo et al 2019a tutar and veci 2016 in parallel the flume has to be long enough to guarantee fully developed waves as a whole the facility can be divided into three different regions generation propagation and extinction areas the first one or generation area is made up of the wave maker and the length of the flume where the wave is directly affected by the inertia of the movement of the paddle the total length of this area depends on the characteristics of the wave being required a reference distance of twice the wavelength to consider the wave completely developed izquierdo et al 2019a mainly two types of wave maker present a widespread use in this experimental research field the piston type used to generate shallow water waves h λ 0 05 and characterized by elliptical trajectories and the flap type used to generate deep water waves h λ 0 5 and characterized by circular trajectories were h m is the depth and λ m is the wavelength while both types are capable to generate waves at intermediate water depths 0 05 h λ 0 5 and distinguished by elliptical trajectories but not as narrow as shallow waters waves piston type wave makers are more suitable to encompass this region edinburgh designs ltd 2016 machado et al 2018 the second one so called propagation area consists of the section of the flume where the wave once fully developed travels along the flume without suffering any significant modification on its wavelength period height or shape this is the appropriate zone to carry out most of the research activities such as experiments with floating structures or wecs finally the extinction area that usually consists of a structure where the wave energy is partially passive systems or completely active systems dissipated while active wave absorbers can completely neutralize the energy of the incident wave and therefore avoid the reflection this is not the case for passive absorbers that are cheaper and easier to install allowing a significant energy absorption by reducing considerably the wave reflection ouellet and datta 1986 there exists a wide range of different configurations and designs of passive wave absorbers with a permeable lim 2014 madsen 1983 or impermeable tiedeman et al 2012 structure it has been reported that the amount of energy absorption depends on their geometry ouellet and datta 1986 being the parabolic profile the option that produces a highly effective energy absorption with lower use of the available length of the flume ouellet and datta 1986 tiedeman et al 2012 hitherto not any complete study has been reported in the literature that explicitly describes the optimum conditions that minimize the reflection of the waves in a parabolic type passive wave absorber due to the fact that the reflection phenomenon is directly related to the instantaneous characteristics of the wave structure interaction i e wavelength period and height in this study a wide range of monochromatic waves have been studied and the dependence of the reflection phenomenon on the wave parametric domain has been analysed in deep to determine the reflection and its corresponding coefficient the incident and reflected waves have to be fully characterized on the one hand the incident wave is defined by the movement of the wave maker which is programmed based on the laboratory wave generation methods s a hughes 1993 on the other hand the reflected wave will depend on the physical properties of the type of absorption system such as the profile position slope roughness and elevation once the incident wave is partially reflected it travels towards the opposite direction of the incoming incident waves generating the wave profile named resultant wave being the superposition of the reflected and incident waves the study of the reflection phenomenon consists of the characterization of the aforementioned wave profiles as a function of the characteristics and position of the absorption system available in the wave flume in wave flumes with passive absorption systems the reflection phenomenon can be characterized by any of the methods available in literature frigaard and brorsen 1995 goda and suzuki n d isaacson 1991 mansard and funke 1980 that define the reflection coefficient kr as the ratio of reflected wave height to incident wave height h m besides the coefficient can also be calculated with a spatial method that compares the wave heights in the antinode h max m and the node h min m of the resultant wave from the superposition isaacson 1991 as defined in equation 1 1 k r h m a x h m i n h m a x h m i n isaacson 1991 compared different methods for the characterization of the reflection by using fixed probes goda suzuki goda and suzuki n d presented a method with two probes and measured the phase shift between signals and the wave height at each measuring point they applied a fast fourier transform method in order to create a flexible and versatile tool that can work with both regular and irregular waves considering irregular waves as a sum of different regular waves however this technique shows some limitations when the spacing between probes is equal to half the wavelength or any of its multiples in order to verify this method they compared the results obtained placing the probes at different distances for several runs of two regular waves mansard funke mansard and funke 1980 used three probes to measure their phase shift and the wave height defining the wave profile in each probe as the summation of the discrete harmonically related fourier components besides isaacson presented another method based on the wave height measurements at three points excluding the phase shift measurements because in certain cases they may be inaccurate although all the previously described methods are based on the frequency domain frigaard brorsen frigaard and brorsen 1995 presented a time domain based method which is anyway out of the approach of this study moreover mora et al 2018 presented a mathematical solution for long waves propagating along a slender harbour with a convergent divergent region analysing the phenomena that take place in this type of structures and comparing the theoretical formulas with a numerical and analytical models in addition the passive parabolic absorption system can be characterized in terms of reflection coefficient as a function of the iribarren number i r iribarren r nogales 1949 2 i r tan α h λ 0 where α is the sloping angle formed by the imaginary straight line that joins the extreme points of the surface and free surface of the water and λ0 is the wavelength of the wave developed in deep water with its characteristic period battjes 1974 proposed using the i r number to determine the reflection and dissipation absorption of the waves on the breakwater slope among many other applications during the last decades several researchers modified i r number according to the applications developed as was mentioned in díaz carrasco et al 2020 in addition numerical wave flumes nwf the computational counterpart of the experimental wave flumes ewf are commonly used in order to have a better understanding of any related phenomenon in the first steps of the design numerical studies are mainly carried out in 2d developed models that reproduce wave propagation and their interaction with fixed viviano et al 2018 or floating structures xie et al 2019 based on numerical solutions of the fundamental equations corresponding to the fluid motion for the simulation of wave generation either for piston or flap type wave makers the moving boundary option is used altomare et al 2017 two main models are used nowadays the volume of fluid vof a mesh dependant multiphase eulerian model hirt and nichols 1981 which has been previously used for the characterization of waves izquierdo et al 2019a and it is also commonly used to study the performance of floating bruinsma et al 2018 or fixed structures lópez et al 2014 besides smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph model has arisen as another interesting option it is a meshless model that defines the movement and interactions of spherical particles based on navier stokes equations higuera et al 2015 it has been used in the solution of several case studies such as breaking waves dalrymple and rogers 2006 green waters gómez gesteira et al 2005 or the behaviour of floating bodies under extreme wave conditions zhao and hu 2012 2 aims and methodology the objective of this study is to provide a clear procedure for the determination of the reflection coefficient kr measuring its lowest value for each independent wave generated based on the detailed study of a self developed passive extinction system installed in a wave flume of reference the most important achievement of this work is the characterization of this system because it is a new concept for energy dissipation that stands out because of its versatility in terms of adaptability to achieve the highest wave energy dissipation rate among the existing methods for the calculation of the kr value the one proposed by mansard funke was used aiming to determine the overall position of the absorption system that guarantees the highest wave energy dissipation the work encompasses the design of a nwf based on vof model further validated through the corresponding experimental tests performed in a particular case study of a ewf consequently the experimental outcomes will be compared according to the method presented by mansard funke as obtained for the numerical and experimental wave flumes the nwf was then used to determine the k r of those constrain positions of the extinction system 3 experimental and numerical approach a significant number of experimental tests and numerical simulations were performed in water at several depths 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m using a piston type wave maker several type of regular waves are analysed in waters of intermediate and deep depths covering the linear airy and non linear stokes 2nd order regions of the le méhauté chart see fig 5 by modifying the period 0 636 t s 1 526 and the height 0 010 h m 0 064 respectively in order to define the inclination of the parabolic structure the slope α of the imaginary straight line joining the opposite ends has been used in the range of 3 α 17 the time interval elapsed for each experiment ends when the re reflection occurs in the generation paddle and it is determined according to the velocity propagation of the waves c all the data have been processed by using matlab r2019a mathworks n d 3 1 experimental wave flume the ewf is 12 5 m long 0 60 m wide and 0 7 m high u izquierdo l galera calero i albaina g a esteban a aristondo 2019 the structure consists of laminated and tempered glass walls supported by a stainless steel platform the waves are generated through the commercial software delta asda v5 electronics 2019 that controls the delta ac asda a2 series servo drive and servo motor the servo motor is connected to a k series linear actuator km60 10 roller screw model which is attached to a paddle that is partially submerged in water see fig 1 the software allows the paddle to follow a sinusoidal movement or any other higher order movement that turns into a progressive acceleration deceleration pattern for the generation of waves based on the laboratory wave generation methods and applying to a piston type wave maker s a hughes 1993 the movement pattern of the servo drive is specified position and velocity as a function of time according to the parameters of the desired wave λ t h and h once these parameters are specified the servo drive engaged the servo motor and the servo motor moves the piston that is attached to the paddle the expressions relating the paddle displacement and the generated waves for a piston type wave maker is defined in equation 3 and the second order wave board

surface displacement ɳ exp i as a function of time t with a sampling time interval of δt 3 ms for each wave probe the main properties of the equipment described above are detailed in izquierdo et al 2019b the first probe position is set at 6 0 m from the wave generating position and the distance between consecutive probes is stablished according to the criteria described in goda and suzuki n d depending on each wave s parameters the extinction region consists of a self designed passive absorption system with a parabolic solid area of 1 5 m length that can be adjusted manually by modifying the height c the slope b or the elevation d through precision screws as depicted below in fig 2 the parabola that defines the shape of the surface of the self designed extinction system is based on ouellet and datta 1986 and it corresponds to the following equation 9 y m m 200 0 023 x 9 10 5 x 2 the design of this extinction system permits to be adapted depending on the depth the type of wave or the type of study being carried out in the flume in height and angle in addition the surface which is completely smooth for this study could also be substituted by any other type of surface such as rough or perforated 3 2 numerical wave flume 3 2 1 governing equations conservation equations most known as navier stokes equations are used to define the behaviour of newtonian fluids these equations are the mass conservation 10 and the momentum conservation 11 equations that in an incompressible fluid can be defined as 10 u i 0 11 u i t u i u i 1 ρ p ν 2 u i g where u i is the velocity of the flow in each of the dimensions being i 1 2 3 ρ the density of the fluid p the pressure ν the dynamic viscosity and g the gravity vector these equations can define all the states of a flow from laminar to turbulent states where a lot of eddies of different sizes appear due to the energy cascade effect this defines the energy transmission from larger eddies to smaller ones repeatedly until the smallest eddies are dissipated by viscous effects or heat dissipation the direct application of these equations known as direct numerical simulations dns is possible however this approach has a high computational cost due to the calculation of all turbulent scales besides simplified approaches have been used for engineering applications throughout the last decades with great accuracy the most common approach is to apply the reynolds decomposition to the navier stokes equation 12 this decomposition focusses on the mean and fluctuating values of the fluid velocity in a certain point 12 u i x t u i x u i x t where u i is the velocity in a certain point in each instant time u i x is the mean value of the velocity in that point and u i x t are the fluctuations of the velocity in space and time thus the application of this decomposition generates the reynolds averaged navier stokes rans equations this process introduces new components to the equations such as the reynolds stress tensors τ i j in the momentum equation the mass and momentum equations for rans are 13 u i 0 14 u i t u j u i x j 1 ρ x j p δ i j 2 μ s i j τ i j g where u j is the time averaged fluid flow ρ is the density p is the pressure μ is the viscosity i j equals to 1 2 and 3 which are the three spatial dimensions δ ij is the kronecker function s ij is the viscosity tensor and τ i j is the reynolds stresses 15 s i j 1 2 u i x j u j x i 16 τ i j ρ u i u j for this study star ccm software has been used for the rans approach that we imposed into the numerical simulations the fluctuation reynolds stresses are modelled with the boussinesq hypothesis 17 τ i j μ t u i x j u j x i 2 3 ρ k t μ t u i x i δ ij where μ t is the eddy viscosity and kt the turbulent kinetic energy this model inserts two new variables to the navier stokes equations generating an open system thereby more equations are needed to close the system to do that a two equation turbulence model is inserted for this aim the model is the low

where εt is the energy dissipation rate and cε1 cε2 cμ σk and σε are model coefficients rans equations are used with a second order temporal discretization eulerian multiphase vof unsteady model is implemented to define both fluids taken also into account the effects of gravity and surface tension respectively galera calero and izquierdo 2020 hirt and nichols 1981 the volume fraction can be defined as the percentage of the cell volume that one fluid occupies which transport equation can be defined as 21 α i t α i u i 0 where α i is the volume fraction t the time and u i is the flow velocity vector the free surface orientation is defined by determining in which direction the value varies more rapidly which defines the normal direction of the free surface in each cell the computational results were recorded by defining the corresponding vertical planes for each computational wave probe results in terms of free surface displacement ɳ com i as a function of time were acquired in each time step of the simulation the properties of each fluid are defined as follows guide 2015 22 ρ i α i ρ i 23 μ i α i ν i α i ρ i and ν i are calculated for each cell all over the computational domain the k ε provides a general description of turbulence by means of two transport equations one for the kinetic energy k i and another for the turbulence dissipation rate ε windt et al 2018 besides previous work has been developed with this turbulence model achieving successful validation results izquierdo et al 2019a it was selected because the two layer approach is valid for low and high wall y values providing a better definition of the near wall treatment 3 2 2 definition of the geometry and movement of the wave generator a 2d numerical wave flume nwf containing two phases water and surrounding air has been built galera calero et al 2020 the nwf is 12 0 m length and 0 7 m high when compared to the ewf for the nwf the volume of water behind the wave maker 0 5 m length is neglected because it is considered as a solid mobile wall without water movement between both volumes the solid mobile wall reproduces accurately the behaviour of the wave maker with a morphing grid velocity condition which allows defining its velocity variation during each cycle in the corresponding simulation see fig 3 the movement of the paddle depends on the wave to be generated being linear airy and non linear stokes 2nd order waves the last modelled in this study this implies the use of motion equations that control the displacement of the paddle according to each specific wave to be generated these equations are obtained from the theory of the wave maker s a hughes 1993 and are set up in the software that controls the paddle 24 x t a cos 2 π t t where a is the amplitude of the curve which is equal to half of a stroke s 2 being t the period and t the time interval for the linear wave deriving equation 24 the mathematical equation for linear waves 25 that defines the velocity of the paddle as a function of time is obtained 25 v t 2 a t π sin 2 π t t to reproduce non linear waves the movement equation of the paddle is defined as follows 26 x t a 1 cos 2 π t t a 2 cos 4 π t t where a 1 is the amplitude of the primary wave a 2 the amplitude of the secondary wave t is the period and t is the time dependant variable for the non linear wave deriving equation 26 the corresponding velocity of the paddle is obtained 27 27 v t 2 a 1 t π sin 2 π t t 4 a 2 t π sin 4 π t t fig 3 shows the general scheme of the boundaries of the computational domain the top wall is defined as a pressure outlet which allows the air to move throughout freely while the bottom is defined as a wall both have a boundary constraint plane to allow the movement of the wave maker which is defined as a moving wall all the boundaries defined as walls have a non slip condition to reproduce the same effect that the physical boundaries have in the experimental flume being these boundaries the end wall the bottom and the extinction system this system is numerically reproduced by two parabolic walls both fixed and with non slip conditions the position of the parabolic walls defines the desired angle of the extinction system which must be specified in each experiment being the angle defined by the straight line that joins the highest and lowest point of the extinction system and the horizontal direction 3 2 3 mesh definition the mesh has been optimized through a mesh sensitivity analysis aiming for reducing the computational cost but achieving the most accurate definition of the free surface displacement this has been carried out by defining several areas in the domain 1 the area where the fluid is only air 2 the area where a free surface displacement is studied 3 the area where there is always water and two areas of special interest the generation paddle and the extinction beach respectively all of these areas can be observed in detail in fig 4 while the area in which the fluid is always air 1 the base cell size is a square of 20 cm the area closer to the free surface is meshed with significantly smaller cells adjusting their size to the wave height and wavelength for this last since the propagation of the wave is much faster than the proper free surface elevation the horizontal displacement is faster than the vertical one quadrilateral cells have been used with an aspect ratio ar of 4 0 being quadrilateral cells of 1 5 mm 6 0 mm length x height besides a growth factor of 1 3 is imposed in the extinction system surface to achieve a good definition of the wave breaking for the area where there is always water 3 cells with an ar 2 0 are used being quadrilateral cells of 2 0 mm 4 0 mm length x height finally prism layers were generated for the areas of the generation paddle and the extinction system respectively for them 20 and 13 prism layers with a stretching coefficient of 1 2 and 1 3 and a total thickness of 3 0 cm and 1 0 cm respectively were generated the total amount of cells for the lowest wave height tested in each depth is 637641 for h 0 3 m 727266 for h 0 4 m and 610715 for h 0 5 m this allows simulating 30 s in approximately 10 h using a time step of 0 001 s and 5 inner iterations in a dell precision 7920 with 24 xeon cores and ram of 32 gb workstation the cell size was calculated based on the courant number limitation being always lower than 0 40 for the second order waves and lower than 0 87 for the first order waves 4 experimental campaign the experimental tests were defined considering the length of the wave flume and the capacity of the servo motor in addition for all the experiments the maximum and minimum wave heights were delimited in order to avoid the trough passing under the extinction system or the peak to overflow it each wave was defined as follows first the depth of the experiment was decided then based on the non dimensional le méhauté chart see next fig 5 a specific value of the x axis coordinate was selected to define the t next the value of h was calculated from the corresponding value of the y axis coordinate subsequently the wavelength was obtained through the wave dispersion relation given by equation 27 27b λ g t 2 2 π t a n h 2 π h λ and finally the movement of the paddle was specified as described in equations 3 and 4 thereby 21 waves were theoretically defined as was previously mentioned covering the linear and non linear regions in a wide range of t h and λ as shown in table 1 the modification of α would allow obtaining a trend and determining the lowest kr value corresponding to the highest wave energy absorption for each experiment α of the extinction system was set by modifying the vertical position of the opposite ends the coordinate for the beginning of the paddle y 1 that is always submerged and the coordinate for the end of the paddle y 2 that is always above the free surface the value α was increased for each experiment at intervals of 2 for the ranges specified in the last column of table 1 moreover it was also taken into account the horizontal displacement of the extinction system in order to define the mesh for each h and α as it is discussed in section 4 results and discussion for some waves it was not possible to experimentally determine the lowest kr value because of design constraints that make impossible setting the extinction systems in limiting positions so that the minimum value would be achieved once the validation of the computational model was carried out the kr values of those positions were determined 4 1 validation of the computational model a triple comparative between theoretical experimental and computational results in terms of t h and λ was carried out in order to validate the computational model ensuring the reliability of the calculated kr values the free surface displacement of the experimental and computationally acquired signals ɳ com i and ɳ exp i provides information about how accurate the computational model reproduces the waves generated in the flume for both experimental and computational experiments the phase shift was measured between the signals acquired by two consecutive probes which also permitted to calculate the wave propagation velocity c m s fig 6 contains the signal information during the time interval corresponding a complete experiment generation propagation and reflection for a particular wave measured by one of the probes the wave 11 is selected because it represents approximately the average values of the analysed parameters h t h and λ the parameters of the experimental and numerically generated waves were calculated by using matlab r2019a to fit their free surface signal to the corresponding wave theory equations linear or non linear for the case of wave11 represented in fig 6 the experimental and computational data ranged between 8 2 t s 13 5 the ones corresponding to the propagation period were fitted to a non linear wave equation during this time interval the wave is considered fully developed and therefore it is not yet influenced by the reflection besides the data used for the calculation of the kr value are inside the time interval 15 5 t s 17 9 from this the signal acquired by the wave probes would correspond to a re reflected wave train and therefore the data would not be valid for this study the fittings carried out for both experimental and computational signals provided the corresponding results in terms of t h and λ as well as the value of the square of pearson s product moment correlation coefficient r 2 on the one hand the average among all the experiments carried out for the calculated r 2 is 97 6 and the comparison between experimental and computational signals fitting provided a r 2 value higher than 99 5 see fig 7 on the other hand the measured t h and λ were compared with the analytical values given by the wave theory in order to calculate the corresponding relative errors for almost all the experiments errors below 3 were measured and for some punctual experiments below 5 this demonstrated an appropriate operation of all the components of the wave flume and a successful design of the numerical model finally the validation experiments aimed to prove the validity of the model by comparing results for several h t α and vertical positions of the extinction system y 1 y 2 thus two specific positions were selected with completely different coordinates two angles for which minimum kr values were experimentally calculated and for both cases most of the waves reproduced in the laboratory at those conditions fig 8 shows a comparative test between experimental and numerical results in terms of the kr value both calculated by the method of mansard funke both the tendency and the kr values are very close to each other taking into account that this coefficient is a mathematical division of values of which two of them are obtained after 17 s it can be affirmed that the results reflect successful computational simulations this computational model is therefore valid for the cases in which the trend followed was not completely clear or it seemed that the minimum of the kr values was not reached as it was previously commented this happened for the experiments carried out at h 0 5 m so that these specific experiments were numerically reproduced and the results showed that none of the computational results offered a new minimum kr value 5 results and discussion results have been analysed to determine the minimum kr value as a function of a non dimensional parameter h y 1 λ defined by the relation between the effective vertical distance of the extinction system h y 1 with the wavelength λ this parameter defines the relative length of the liquid depth that is covered by the vertical projection of the extinction system h y 1 with respect to the size of the wave given by the wavelength λ a higher value of this parameter will lead to a greater interaction of the extinction system with the larger orbitals of the fluid particles of the wave i e the ones closer to the free surface on the contrary a smaller bottom gap below the extinction system would allow the wave passing through and reflect directly on the vertical wall end of the flume in fig 9 the results obtained at h 0 3 m are shown as calculated by the mansard funke method in this fig 9 the corresponding fittings to a second order polynomial equation have been represented in order to analyse the trend of the kr value and determine the influence of the submersion of the extinction system for all the waves generated at low h y 1 λ values the highest kr values were calculated and once the minimum values were achieved at intermediate h y 1 λ values the kr increases again when the submersion of the paddle was the minimum this reveals that the highest energy dissipation rate is never obtained when the extinction system is completely submerged in a similar way the same approach has been carried out for the experiments at h 0 4 and 0 5 m achieving same conclusions however the increase of the kr value is also related with the ir number then analogous trends can be also obtained as a function of ir number which is shown in fig 10 for waves generated at h 0 5 m the ir number defined in equation 2 depends on the sloping angle and the wavelength of the wave developed in deep water the trends obtained in this fig 10 are very similar to the ones shown in fig 9 highest energy dissipation rate is obtained when the extinction system is partially submerged in general when kr is represented as a function of h y 1 h y 1 λ or ir analogous tendencies are obtained or the contrary ones when represented against y1 however the increasing kr values can also be explained according to the breaking behaviour of waves because the ir number has been used to define different types of breaking according to the following intervals ir 0 5 spilling 0 5 ir 3 3 plunging and ir 3 3 collapsing surging battjes 1974 based on this classification the waves generated in this work corresponds to the spilling and plunging breakings the higher the value of the ir number the less dissipative and more reflective the type of wave breaking becomes in the extinction system the enhancement of spilling far from surging mode should be pursued in order to minimize the value of the reflection coefficient this makes the self designed system a very useful and effective extinction system to minimize the reflection of any generated wave in the next fig 11 a comparison between spilling and plunging type of breaking can be observed as simulated for wave 4 ir 0 32 spilling and wave 7 ir 1 97 plunging the captures show clearly the evolution of the waves when breaking while wave 4 travels through a large part of the extinction system smoothly and with enough time until the next incoming wave interacts wave 7 breaks abruptly and in a short part of the extinction system the next fig 12 shows the relationship between kr and h y 1 λ divided in several intervals of ir the first interval corresponds to the spilling type of breaking and the others are four intervals comprehended into the plunging type of breaking fig 12 comprises all the experiments carried out with the 21 different waves several intervals were defined for the plunging type breaking in order to reduce the dispersion of the results when shown with their corresponding fittings to a potential equation at low h y 1 λ values the highest kr values were calculated and according to this type of breaking the lowest kr values were calculated for spilling it can also be appreciated the influence of the submerged part of the extinction system for the energy dissipation decreasing at higher h y 1 λ values in this figure it can also be clearly appreciated the increase of kr values at a constant h y 1 λ when increasing ir number values in the contrary way fig 13 represents the influence of the ir number having divided several intervals of h y 1 λ here it can more clearly be observed that kr values increase at increasing ir numbers however it is more evident the successful design of the extinction system because of the smooth increase of the kr values at increasing ir number when h y 1 λ value is high in addition to the previous results the corresponding correlation between the minimum calculated kr values h y 1 λ and ir number was obtained as a function of the dispersion parameter kh this triple approach provides a universal relationship in terms of these three parameters aiming to achieve the minimum kr value fig 14 left shows how the lower relative period and wavelength of the wave higher kh the higher the possibility to dissipate the wave and minimize the reflection coefficient by an optimized position of the parabolic extinction system in addition fig 14 right defines the optimum configuration to get such a minimum value of kr in a dimensionless way in terms of the surf parameter ir and the vertical coverage h y 1 λ it can be noticed that relative longer waves need a shorter vertical coverage of the wave by the parabolic system and a slightly higher value of the surf parameter ir to get a minimum reflection coefficient the particular system used for the wave energy dissipation complicated the possibility of comparing results with other similar systems because most of them are attached to the bottom of the flume and were carried out mostly in deep water waves battjes 1974 hodaei et al 2016 ish m and raju 2004 ouellet and datta 1986 puspita et al 2019 while all of those systems are completely static the extinction system presented here allows obtaining various sloping angles and vertical positions which seems to be the key factor to minimize the reflection along the flume nonetheless the results have been compared with those obtained in other models reported in specialized literature as shown in table 2 the results obtained in the present work have been compared with those of puspita et al 2019 hodaei et al 2016 and puspita et al 2020 it is worth noting the benefit of using a parabolic extinction system with smaller values of reflection coefficient in comparison to the more traditional plane inclined plate in the present piece of research a methodology to optimise the geometric location of the parabolic profile in relation of the properties of the incident wave has been developed as a consequence minimum values of the reflection coefficient below the reference of kr 0 08 have been achieved which implies a significant comparative improvement within the available passive extinction methods in addition focusing on characteristics of the absorption systems of the literature it seems possible to continue reducing the reflection along the flume by perforating the surface of the absorption system which will be considered in future work 6 conclusions the phenomenon of the reflection has been studied using a self developed passive extinction system installed in a wave flume of 12 5 m long 0 60 m wide and 0 7 m high the slope of this absorption system can be modified as well as its vertical end position which increased the possibility to find the optimal position for the wave energy dissipation a significant number of experimental tests were reproduced in the laboratory by means of a piston type wave maker several depths h of 0 3 0 4 and 0 5 m respectively periods 0 636 t s 1 526 wave heights 0 010 h m 0 064 slopes 3 α 17 and vertical positions 0 005 y1 m 0 279 at h 0 3 m 0 008 y1 m 0 385 at h 0 4 m 0 098 y1 m 0 465 at h 0 5 m and y2 m defined by y1 m and α of the extinction system covering the linear airy and non linear stokes 2nd order regions of the le méhauté chart were studied a computational model based on the eulerian multiphase vof unsteady model was designed to reflect through simulations any of the conditions that can be reproduced in the experimental wave flume a successful validation of the computational model was carried out being the simulations checked by two different ways on the one hand a validation based on the free surface displacement ɳ i by comparing the theoretical experimental and numerical signals and on the other hand a validation based on the calculation of the kr values was carried out both ways were successfully achieved because the error was negligible in addition this model was used in order to determine kr values at slopes that could not be physically reached by the extinction system which was very useful to determine certain trends at h 0 5 m the calculated kr experimental results were analysed in terms of a non dimensional h y 1 λ parameter which relates the energy dissipation with the part of the extinction system that is submerged the main conclusion achieved is that the maximum energy dissipation strongly depends on its vertical position in addition the experimental results have also been analysed with respect to the ir number in this case the relation of the type of breaking with the energy dissipation have been confirmed however it has also been valid to confirm that the highest energy dissipation rate is never obtained when the extinction system is attached to the bottom of the flume being needed to rise it to minimize the reflection furthermore the minimum kr values were extracted among all the experiments and condition tested these results together with h y 1 λ and the ir number were compared as a function of the dispersion parameter kh having as a result a universal relationship between them therefore these results clearly demonstrated the successful design of this extinction system that could be adapted to achieve the highest energy dissipation depending on the type of wave generated this study will continue analyzing the influence of the porosity in the surface of the self design extinction system in addition the numerical model will be used in future experiments to determine the reflection in breakwaters containing an owc credit authorship contribution statement u izquierdo calibration of the resistive type wave probes and

transmission cables suspension bridges electronic components and hot wire anemometry hasheminejad et al 2014 2018 rashidi et al 2016 hong and shah 2018 liu et al 2020 this fundamental problem has been comprehensively studied within the fluid dynamics community since the early works of strouhal 1878 and von karman 1912 it could involve various complications such as vortex induced vibration viv flow induced noise fin amplified lift and drag forces reduced structural fatigue life and even disastrous structural collapse therefore suppression of vortex shedding and structural viv through modification of wake vortex dynamics is of great interest owing to its potential environmental and economic aftermaths however many materials of biological and industrial importance exhibit complex

fluid semen saliva sharma et al 2016 lu et al 2017 anandharamakrishnan and ishwarya 2019 kannojiya et al 2020 tao et al 2020 numerous authors have investigated the external flows of structured fluids over variously shaped fixed or rotating cylinders since the experimental work of shah et al 1962 for example patnana et al 2009 used a finite volume method fvm based solver to numerically investigate the 2d unsteady cross flow flow of incompressible power law fluids past an unconfined stationary circular cylinder panda and chhabra 2010 numerically solved the continuity and momentum equations to

flow past an unconfined circular cylinder xiong et al 2019 used finite volume numerical simulations based on the nonlinear fene p model to investigate the viscoelastic polymeric fluid flow effects on passive viv control of an elastically mounted circular cylinder over a wide range of reynolds numbers thakur et al 2019 investigated the momentum and forced convection heat transfer characteristics of an asymmetrically confined isothermal rotating cylinder immersed in a power law fluid just recently khan et al 2020 used openfoam to carry out a detailed numerical study on the flow and heat transfer phenomena from a rotating cylinder submerged in a streaming viscoelastic fene p fluid there are three main methodologies for suppression of vortex shedding and modification of wake destructive behavior behind bluff bodies and elastic obstacles namely passive control active non feedback open loop control and active closed loop control obtaining significant reductions of structural viv over a broad range of operating conditions by using the traditional passive control techniques without increasing the mean drag force is a very difficult and challenging task these methods which do not

alternatively application of active feedback control techniques can be far more effective in postponing flow separation and suppressing vortex generation owing to their valuable capability in adjusting to diverse and unforeseen structural and environmental operating conditions such techniques normally make use of sensor signals to activate externally driven actuators with an appropriate control algorithm in a holistic framework numerous investigators have recommended a number of active control methodologies to cope with wake vortices e g see refs hasheminejad et al 2014 rashidi et al 2016 hasheminejad et al 2018 for recent reviews for example du and sun 2015 utilized the immersed boundary method to present an active control method based on forcing rotary oscillations for

in mitigating cylinder vortex induced vibrations rabiee and esmaeili 2020 used the fuzzy pid control strategy for active flow induced vibration suppression of two elastically mounted tandem arranged identical circular cylinders at a low reynolds number hebrero et al 2020 proposed the use of plasma actuators in order to control the vortex induced vibration phenomena originated by airflow around an elastically mounted rigid circular cylinder mallik and santra 2020 investigated the capability of a sampled data time delay proportional integral derivative pid controller to mitigate the large amplitude cylinder oscillations viv in the lock in region the above brief review clearly suggests that although there is a voluminous body of literature exploiting a wide range of passive and active methodologies to suppress viv response of flexible bluff bodies and structures submerged in newtonian fluids intelligent control of one or two degrees of freedom viv of an elastically suspended cylinder in laminar cross flow of power law fluids has not yet been rigorously investigated therefore the main thrust of current work is to utilize the two dimensional unsteady incompressible power law flow model in real time collaboration with the traditional closed loop proportional force and moment based controllers to remove this significant break in the literature in this regard the main novelties of the work can more specifically be described in two folds i detailed numerical investigation of effects of power law rheology on coupled 2 dof vortex induced vibrations global flow parameters and vortex shedding patterns of an elastically mounted cylinder set in the lock in regime of non newtonian power law cross flow ii comparison of effectiveness of two distinct active closed loop control configurations i e the force and moment based controllers in a real time collaborative numerical simulation framework for viv suppression of the elastic cylinder for a wide range of power law index parameters the presented results can principally assist in understanding the shear thinning and shear thickening effects on the classic cylinder viv problem as the first step towards analyzing the more complex problems rabiee and esmaeili 2020 peng et al 2020 mishra et al 103196 it is of great practical interest for hydro elastic engineers dealing with high amplitude coupled 2dof

et al 2019 he 2020 dey et al 2020a 2020b lastly the presented relatively extensive set of simulation data can supplement the upcoming experimental studies besides providing valuable insights on design development and operational assessment of novel active viv control procedures and devices hasheminejad et al 2014 2018 rashidi et al 2016 mallik and santra 2020 gedikli et al 2019 konstantinidis 2019 azadiyazdi 2020 2 basic governing equations consider the 2d unsteady flow of an incompressible power law fluid over an elastically mounted two degrees of freedom circular cylinder of diameter d with a uniform stream velocity u as depicted in fig 1a thus the flow phenomenon can be described by the continuity and momentum equations in the form patnana et al 2009 bird 2002 1 u x x u y y 0 2a u x t u x u x x u y u x y p x 1 re τ x x x τ y x y 2b u y t u x u y x u y u y y p y 1 re τ y x x τ y y y where p is the pressure re ρ d n u 2 n m 0 is the reynolds number and ρ m 0 n denote fluid density power

deformation tensor η m 0 i 2 2 n 1 2 denotes the fluid scalar viscosity function and i 2 i j ε i j ε j i ε x x 2 ε y y 2 2 ε x y 2 is the second invariant of the rate of deformation bird 2002 note that n 1 corresponds to the newtonian fluid behavior n 1 denotes shear thinning behavior and n 1 is linked to shear thickening behavior patnana et al 2009 after direct substitution of eq 3 into eq 2

unit length acting on cylindrical surface similarly the lift coefficient can be written in the form c l 2 f l ρ u 2 d c lp c lf in which f l is the lift force per unit length acting on cylindrical surface furthermore the frictional and pressure parts of the lift and drag coefficients can be determined from patnana et al 2009 5 c lf 2 f lf ρ u 2 d 2 n 1 re s τ y x n x τ y y n y d s c lp 2 f lp ρ

and f df f lf and f dp f lp refer to the frictional and pressure components of the drag and lift forces respectively patnana et al 2009 fig 1b illustrates the details of the relatively large computational domain adopted in the present study the elastically mounted unconfined cylinder of total mass m experiences unsteady fluid forces under the in line free stream flow which leads to the rigid body motion in both cross flow and in line directions thus the elastic cylinder can be modeled as a simple mass spring damper oscillating system with identical stiffness and damping parameters in both directions i e k x k y k and c x c y c and with the standard governing equations of motion in the form hasheminejad et al 2014 6 x f d c x k x m y f l c y k y m where y y y refer to the cylinder transverse crosswise acceleration velocity and displacement while x x x denote the same quantities in the x direction also by adopting the following non dimensionalization parameters for the in line cross flow displacements y y d x x d time t t u d mass ratio m 4 m π ρ d 2 reduced velocity u u f n d and damping ratio ξ c 2 m k the cylinder equations of motion in the non dimensional form

it is supposed that the natural structural frequency of the mass damper spring system does not depend on the flow speed and the damping coefficient ξ is set to equal to zero in order to attain a large response amplitude also to explore the effect of the reynolds number at a fixed structural natural frequency f n the dependence of the reduced velocity on the reynolds number for a cylinder of circular cross section is set as u u f n d 16 6 re prasanth and mittal 2008 lastly the dimensionless frequency of the vortex shedding or the strouhal number is defined as st f v d u in which f v is the frequency of the vortex shedding 3 controller design and configurations the proportional integral derivative pid controllers are recognized as the best controllers used in industrial control processes mainly owing to their simple structure and robust performance in a wide range of operating conditions accordingly the transfer function of a pid controller in its standard form is given as 8 g c s k p k i s k d s k p 1 t i s 1 t d s where k p k i and k d refer to the proportional integral and derivative gains respectively and with the associated time constants defined as t i k p k i and t

various response forms for a given process in this paper we shall use two distinct active closed loop control methods to effectively suppress the vortex induced vibrations viv of the elastic cylinder by utilization of a proper feedback signal simple diagrams of the flow configuration and applied control algorithms are shown in fig 2 a and b the first control method fig 2a is based on application of an oscillating angular velocity of the general form ω t a rot sin 2 π f rot t where a rot f rot refer to amplitude and rotational oscillation frequency of the angular velocity respectively in the second control method fig 2b the cylinder oscillations are attenuated by direct application of the transverse control force f a t the output responses in the closed loop control systems are continuously measured by proper displacement and force sensors which transform the measurement signals into electric signals that are eventually fed back to the controller as the controller continually has information about system performance it can make the appropriate adjustments to keep the output in desired condition in the first control configuration fig 2a the cylinder lift force f l t which is an readily assessable quantity through the udf can be considered as a suitable choice of feedback signal for controlling the cylinder rotation accordingly an active closed loop viv control strategy based on the cylinder rotational oscillations is suggested in the form 10 ω t k p ω e t k p ω f l t k p ω f l d t f l t where ω t is the applied cylinder angular velocity k p ω 0 is the associated closed loop proportional control parameter f l d t 0 being the desired value of cylinder lift force therefore the control effort is given in the form 11 ω t k p ω f l t here it should be noted that the negative sign in eq 11 signifies the fact that the imposed cylinder rotational oscillations exactly opposes the time variations of the calculated lift force similarly in the second control configuration fig 2b the cylinder transverse displacement y t which is an easily computable quantity through the udf in every time step during the unsteady calculation process can be considered as a good choice of feedback signal for manipulating the cylinder transverse oscillations accordingly an active closed loop viv control strategy based on the cylinder transverse oscillations is offered in the form 12 f a t k p f e t k p f y t k p f y d t y t where f a t is the applied transverse control force k p f 0 is the closed loop proportional control parameter y d t 0 being the desired value of cylinder transverse displacement therefore the control effort in this case is written in the simple form 13 f a t k p f y t now the present fluid structure interaction fsi control problem can be implemented through the advanced process simulator matlab simulink program environment to mitigate the cylinder transverse oscillations the controller is allocated the master role by calling the fluent software in each time step the generic scheme for online coupling and co simulation of fluent with matlab simulink in the first control configuration fig 2a is summarized as follows i solve the continuity and momentum equations using fluent ii calculate the resultant cross flow fluid force f l t iii controller in matlab computes the required control effort ω t k p ω f l t iv control effort is saved in a data file and then accessed by the udf v udf imposes the control effort through the define cg motion macro vi algorithm continues until the transverse cylinder displacement is nearly terminated similarly to suppress the cylinder transverse oscillations in the second control configuration fig 2b one considers the control scheme i solve the continuity and momentum equations using fluent ii calculate the resultant in line cross flow fluid forces f l t f d t iii cylinder displacement y t computed and saved by udf into an input data file iv controller in matlab computes the required control force f a t k p f y t v control force is saved into a data file and then read by the udf vi equations of motion 6 are re solved based on the new resultant force vii algorithm goes on until transverse cylinder displacement is nearly terminated lastly the key steps and interfacing schematically depicted in the block diagram of fig 2 may more explicitly be described as follows the general procedure involves running the fluent cfd package integrated with an online control loop in a real time collaborative simulation framework using udf code in fluent together with matlab where the actuation force or moment for each time step is generated by the controller based on the output of the previous simulation step results more specifically the hydrodynamic lift force f l t or cylinder transverse displacement y t in the pre processing stage is generated in form of an input data file using cfd simulations in fluent guided by the flow physics subsequently the cfd generated data of the plant is implemented into the transient simulation loop of active viv control system with a zero input reference value f l d t y d t 0 at this stage the instantaneous values of lift force or cylinder transverse displacement as well as the associated real time error signals are calculated at each time step the error values are then multiplied by the associated proportional control gain in order to calculate the imposed input rotational oscillation ω t see fig 2a or actuator force f a t see fig 2b subsequently the calculated transverse force or rotational oscillation is implemented into the cfd model the new error signal is then evaluated based on the new output signal that is fed back into the controller this closed loop process is continued with the selected time step until the zero steady state value is approximately reached and the cylinder viv control is achieved 4 numerical procedure 4 1 boundary conditions and computational method in this subsection we shall briefly outline the computational procedure for viv analysis of the elastically suspended cylinder in every time step of the interaction course the continuity and momentum eqs 1 and 4 are to be solved by exploiting the finite volume method based cfd solver fluent 6 3 26 to compute the cylinder displacements eq 6 the user define function udf is hooked to the fluent solver the cylinder is supposed to be positioned in a rectangular computational domain with the upstream and downstream boundaries being fixed at the distance l u 10 d l d 25 5 d from the center of the cylindrical body while the top and bottom boundaries are h 20 d apart as depicted in fig 1 the fluid physical properties ρ m 0 n are set as constants in each simulation and the flow is presumed to be unsteady laminar in all simulations the pertinent boundary conditions for the above explained flow configuration are summarized as follows uniform inlet velocity condition u x u and u y 0 zero outlet diffusion flux patnana et al 2009 i e the default outflow boundary condition option in fluent u x t u u x x 0 and u y t u u y y 0 no slip boundary condition on the cylinder surface u x 0 and u y 0 no slip boundary condition at the top and bottom boundaries of the computational domain u x 0 and u y 0 the incompressible flow was solved using the two dimensional unsteady laminar segregated solver on the collocated grid arrangement the second order upwind schemes and the standard discretization are respectively utilized to discretize the momentum and pressure terms while the pressure velocity coupling was achieved by the fractional step algorithm the gauss siedel point by point iterative method in conjunction with the algebraic multi grid amg method solver is employed by fluent to solve the system of algebraic equations this way the number of iterations and therefore the cpu time required to obtain a converged solution can greatly be reduce especially when the model contains a large number of control volumes patnana et al 2009 also the non newtonian power law viscosity models are utilized furthermore in order to start the simulations the reynolds number is initially set equal to 60 and once the equilibrium response is reached a new simulation is carried out by adopting the end results of the last computational step as the initial conditions for the reynolds number the simulations are steered for long enough to ensure reaching the equilibrium response i e at least 10 oscillation periods the equations of motion for the oscillating cylinder eq 6 can be treated using an explicit time integration algorithm described in cg motion macro available in fluent a user defined function udf is introduced into fluent environment to define the motion of the center of gravity of the cylinder based on the forces acting on it see eq 6 the cross flow and in line cylinder velocities that are returned to fluent can be computed at the t n 1 time step from placzek et al 2009 14 x n 1 x n δ t x n 1 y n 1 y n δ t y n 1 where the acceleration terms are accessed from the equations of motion 6 also the cylinder position the surface flow velocity and the mesh configuration are updated at each time step as the cylinder moves at each iteration step of the solution procedure fluent s moving deforming mesh mdm function remeshes the grid cells this process normally causes growth of skewed cells which in turn causes slow convergence and inaccurate solutions to treat this problem a moving mesh scheme is applied by generating a central square region with highest quality structured cells about the cylinder as depicted in fig 1b the computational grid in the central square block is treated as quad cells of map type by gambit this square region is defined to move wholly as a rigid body with the oscillating cylindrical body while the external cells adjacent to the square domain are distorted and updated using the remeshing and smoothing techniques of the dynamic mesh configuration 4 2 grid and time step independence and validations the accuracy and reliability of the numerical results is greatly influenced by the selection of numerical parameters specifically grid sizes and the time step an optimal grid should be sufficiently fine to properly capture the flow field without being unreasonably resources intensive therefore based on the detailed study performed in our previous investigation hasheminejad et al 2014 the domain and grids used in the current unsteady flow calculations seem to be adequate to resolve the viv phenomena with tolerable levels of accuracy within the range of conditions of interest also in the numerical simulations of the unsteady flow over the cylinder picking the right time step also plays an important role in finding the time accurate solution of the momentum equation accordingly the time step independence study is carried out in the case of unsteady flow of power law fluids over a stationary cylinder for a selected reynolds number re 140 and three values of the power law index parameters n 0 4 1 1 8 the effect of time step on the time averaged drag coefficient c d and the strouhal number st are presented in table 1 the calculations are started with a time step of δ t 0 05 and it is progressively decreased up to δ t 0 02 in view of the negligible variations observed in table 1 the time step δ t 0 03 is believed to be appropriate thus all results reported herein will be based on this time step lastly in order to demonstrate the overall accuracy of adopted numerical methodology several comparisons are made with the results available in the literature as the first verification the unsteady flow of a power law fluid past a stationary circular cylinder is considered for re 100 and selected power law index parameters n 0 4 0 6 1 0 1 4 1 8 the calculated results for the time averaged drag coefficient c d the rms value of lift coefficient c l r m s and the strouhal number st as listed in table 2 demonstrate excellent agreements with the results in patnana et al 2009 next we considered the unsteady flow of a power law fluid past a rotating stationary circular cylinder for re 100 and selected range of power law index parameters 0 4 n 1 8 and rotation rates α a rot d 2 u 0 0 5 again very good agreements are obtained with the results available in the literature for the calculated time averaged drag and lift coefficients as presented in fig 3 a subsequently we considered two dimensional newtonian fluid flow n 1 over a 2dof freely vibrating elastic circular cylinder in the flow range of 60 re 150 for ξ 0 and m 10 a very good consistency is observed for y max d c lmax st with the data presented in prasanth and mittal 2008 which were obtained based on a stabilized space time finite element technique as demonstrated in fig 3b as a further verification we used our general code to deliberate on two dimensional newtonian fluid flow n 1 over a freely suspended circular cylinder in the reduced velocity range of 3 u 10 for three different flow settings re 150 m 2 ξ 0 re 100 m 10 ξ 0 and re 200 m 10 ξ 0 01 good confirmations are achieved for y max d with the data presented in bao et al 2012 chern et al 2014 leontini et al 2006 as seen in fig 3c lastly we considered the newtonian fluid flow n 1 over a rotationally oscillating circular cylinder at re 150 for selected rotational oscillation amplitudes α 0 5 2 and range of rotational frequency ratios 0 5 f rot f stat 5 where f stat is the vortex shedding frequency for flow past a stationary cylinder at the same reynolds number excellent agreements are obtained for c l rms c d with the numerical results presented in the literature thiria et al 2006 du and dalton 2013 as demonstrated in fig 3d 5 numerical results the power law index parameter is an indication of the diligence of the shear rate dependence of fluid viscosity chhabra and richardson 2011 accordingly the power law indices considered in this paper are anticipated to qualitatively show the role of fluid behavior on flow characteristics and the computed results will be deliberated depending on shear thinning n 1 and shear thickening n 1 fluid behavior realizing the numerous parameters involved here we focus our attention to a particular model the flow is supposed to be unsteady and laminar in all simulations while the fluid physical properties are set as constants in order to obtain the structural natural frequency of f n 0 0166 hz for selected values of power law index parameters n 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 and reynolds numbers 60 re 145 the dimensionless mass of the cylinder is set as constant m 10 while as mentioned earlier the linear stiffness in both in line cross flow directions are assumed to be equal also in order to promote high amplitude cylinder oscillations the structural damping is supposed to be zero c 0 furthermore the initial cylinder displacements and velocities in both directions at the starting reynolds number re 60 are all assumed to be zero once the equilibrium response is reached the subsequent simulations are performed by adopting the end results of the pervious computational step as the initial conditions for the new reynolds number fig 4 illustrates the changes in the maximum nondimensional transverse in line cylinder displacement amplitudes y max d x max d the maximum lift coefficient c l max the time averaged value of the drag coefficient c d strouhal number st and the frequency ratio f r f v f n with the reynolds number 60 re 145 for selected values of power law index parameters n 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 the key observations are as follows in the first desynchronization ds i region 60 re 70 86 the cylinder inline cross flow oscillation amplitudes are typically low which can be associated to the higher added mass effects for such low reynolds numbers vikestad et al 2000 in particular the largest smallest width of first desynchronization ds i region is observed for the shear thickening shear thinning fluids primarily due to the higher lower effective viscosity effects in the vicinity of cylinder patnana et al 2009 also the largest dampening of cylinder cross flow vibration and maximum lift coefficient amplitudes y max d c l max in ds i are observed for the highly shear thickening fluids n 1 8 while the largest attenuation of cylinder maximum in line vibration amplitudes and time averaged drag coefficient amplitudes x max d c d are noted for the highly shear thinning fluids n 0 4 the latter observation may directly be associated to the higher levels of overall fluid forcing pushing effects along the in line direction at lower reynolds numbers for the highly shear thinning fluids while the former observation may be linked to the drastic decrease in the vortex shedding frequency f v and consequently the cylinder cross flow displacements in case of the highly shear thickening fluids in the lock in region 70 86 re 125 135 where the frequency ratio f r 1 nearly regardless of power law index parameter the consecutive vortex shedding past the elastic cylinder are well synchronized the cylinder displacement amplitudes considerably increase and the fluid type power index parameter seems to have a relatively small effect on the maximum cylinder cross flow vibration amplitudes y max d 0 6 also see singh and mittal 2005 the most intriguing observation is perhaps the noticeable advance of the lock in region into the lower reynolds number range besides its remarkable expansion as the value of power law index parameter is decreased from the highly viscous shear thickening to the highly shear thinning n 1 8 0 4 this observation i e the notable decrease in the width of the synchronization range with increasing the power law index parameter can be of practical value as an effective passive method of cylinder viv control also in the second desynchronization ds ii region 125 135 re the transverse cylinder vibration amplitudes suddenly drop to their relatively low levels which can be linked to the drastic increase in the vortex shedding frequency f v where the system inertia prevents its immediate response to this high value of excitation frequency nearly regardless of power law index value lastly in contrast with the ds i region the largest smallest dampening of the cylinder cross flow vibration amplitudes y max d in ds ii are observed for the highly shear thinning shear thickening fluid which may directly be associated to the increase decrease in the effective viscosity of such fluid in the higher reynolds number range note the definition of re ρ d n u 2 n m 0 this apparent increase decrease in the effective viscosity of the highly shear thinning shear thickening fluid has an overall dampening effect on the transverse vibrations of the elastic cylinder fig 5 a c shows the time histories of the transverse and in line displacement responses of the freely oscillating cylinder as well as those of the lift and drag coefficients c l y d c d x d for selected values of power law index parameters n 0 6 1 2 1 8 at five selected reynolds numbers namely at a reynolds number just before lock in in ds i three reynolds numbers within the lock in region and the last reynolds number just after lock out in ds ii the main observations are as follows first one can note the in phase oscillations of the c l y d pair in the ds i region while there is a 180 phase difference in the ds ii regime almost regardless of the power law index parameter furthermore the time response curves associated with the fourth reynolds number near the end of the lock in region in most cases display a 180 phase difference on the other hand one can observe the 180 out of phase oscillations of the c d x d pair in all three regions nearly irrespective of the power law index parameter also some of the c l y d time response plots essentially display a modulation or beating phenomenon in a narrow range of reynolds numbers at the onset of the lock in jump e g see the case n 1 2 re 84 in fig 5b note that the beating behavior can also be observed by taking smaller steps in reynolds number for other power law parameters this phenomenon may be linked to the recurrent altercation between the vortex shedding patterns associated with the ds i branch or the 2s mode of vortex shedding and those of the lock in where the vortices in the wake coalesce leading to the c 2s mode of vortex shedding in other words in such narrow range of reynolds numbers the vortices are shed at the strouhal frequency while the cylinder is oscillating at another frequency so that there are two frequencies present in the system outside the lock in region the cylinder no longer respond near its natural frequency the response amplitudes significantly decrease and the beating behavior entirely vanishes lastly fig 6 displays the normalized fast fourier transforms ffts of the time histories of the lift coefficients c l presented in fig 5 for selected values of power law index parameters n 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 and reynolds numbers within the lock in region it is clear that increasing the power law index parameter leads to a perceptible reduction in the calculated vortex shedding frequency e g from f v 0 01625 for n 0 4 at re 75 to f v 0 01589 for n 1 8 at re 100 especially at higher reynolds numbers also see the last subplot in fig 4 this apparent reduction of the vortex shedding frequency can be directly associated to the low viscosity zone envelope developed by the shear thinning fluid of growing viscosity around the oscillating cylinder as against the increased effective fluid viscosity near the cylinder for the highly shear rate dependent shear thickening fluid furthermore for a given power law index parameter increasing the reynolds number leads to a notable increase in the calculated vortex shedding frequency e g from f v 0 01625 at re 75 to f v 0 02483 at re 120 for n 0 4 and from f v 0 01589 at re 100 to f v 0 01683 at re 130 for n 1 8 fig 7 display the displacement orbital trajectories x d y d of the freely oscillating cylinder for selected values of power law index parameters n 0 4 0 8 1 2 1 8 at selected reynolds numbers just before the lock in in ds i within the lock in region and just after lock out in ds ii comments similar to previous remarks can readily be made the most important distinctions are as follows the general figure eight type orbital trajectories indicate periodic oscillations in most cases except for those situations at the onset of transition jump into the lock in region where the beating phenomenon was previously observed as marked in the respective subplots near the end of the ds i region as the reynolds number increases and we enter the lock in region the phase portraits rotate about 180 into a rightward horseshoe form and the cylinder inline oscillations markedly increase principally along the positive x direction with a further increase in the reynolds number near the end of the lock in region transition into the ds ii region becomes imminent as marked in the respective subplots lastly as the power law index parameter of the flowing fluid increases the above noted fig 8 trajectory becomes more symmetric upright with respect to the inline cylinder oscillations in both ds i and ds ii regions while in the lock in region the depth of the horseshoe form further extends i e the cylinder inline displacements amplify along the positive x direction which may directly be linked to the increase in the effective fluid viscosity now before deliberating on the controller performance a brief description of a prospective experimental setup for the proposed single input single output siso viv control

suitable strain gauges test measurement load 2021 or force sensors force sensors measuring 2021 can be applied to the cylinder for real time aerodynamic force measurements an upstream pitot tube connected to a sensitive pressure transducer may be used to measure the oncoming free stream flow velocity with slightest effects on the flow around the cylinder similarly a hot wire anemometer laser optical measurement 2021 can be used to measure the streamwise fluctuating velocity of the flow at a point in the near wake and monitor analyze the control performance the vortex shedding frequency can be determined from the peak frequency in the spectrum of the velocity signal detected by the hot wire anemometer alternatively a particle image velocimetry piv system particle image velocimetr

selected values of reynolds numbers and power law index parameters i e for re 75 at n 0 4 re 84 at n 1 0 and re 105 at n 1 8 at the beginning of the respective lock in regions i e where the maximum transverse cylinder viv amplitudes occur see the first subplot in fig 4 also shown as the last subplot in each figure are the calculated consumed actuator power for both control configurations illustrated in fig 2a and b in the first control configuration moment actuator p control the consumed actuator power is calculated using p a m t ω t 1 2 ρ u 2 s c m t ω t where c m t is the moment coefficient calculated by fluent and s π d 2 4 is the cylinder cross sectional area in the second control configuration force actuator p and pid control the consumed actuator power is simply computed using p a f a t y t the numerical values of the selected manually tuned controller parameters are listed in table 3 see eqs 8 and 9 remarks similar to the previous comments can readily be made the most important distinctions are as follows the remarkable success of the moment controller in effective mitigation of cylinder transverse oscillations is clear in the figures for all three power law index parameters furthermore the moment controller is observed to be capable of expeditious cylinder viv control with minimum expenditure of actuator power particularly for the newtonian cross flow n 1 0 this is realized through a desynchronization type of action by active modification of coupling between cylinder free oscillations and vortex shedding i e by forcing the cylinder out of the lock in condition through proper selection of ω t eventually leading to an insignificant transverse cylinder displacement with minimum power consumption the other two controllers perform in a somewhat similar manner with a much higher actuator energy consumption in comparison with the moment controller this fact can better be seen in table 4 where the time averaged consumed actuator power p a rms is calculated for all three actuators operating in the highly shear thinning newtonian and highly shear thickening fluids n 0 4 1 1 8 the relatively low values of required p a rms for mitigating cylinder viv by all three actuators in the shear thickening fluid may be linked to the notable increase in the effective viscosity of 2d shear thickening flow close to the surface of the cylinder patnana et al 2009 chandra and chhabra 2011 which in effect can passively assist the control action in a preventive manner fig 9 a b c compare the uncontrolled and controlled instantaneous vorticity fields for the fully developed unsteady flow in the synchronization region at selected dimensionless time instants see table 5 as also marked by a i in the first subplots of fig 8 after the start of the controller action for selected values of reynolds numbers and power law index parameters i e for re 75 at n 0 4 re 84 at n 1 0 and re 105 at n 1 8 the key observations are as follows in the uncontrolled situations the vortex shedding patterns first column subplots can be characterized by the typical c 2s type vortex shedding mode for re 75 at n 0 4 and by the classical von kármán vortex street of 2s type mode of moderately weaker strengths for re 84 at n 1 0 and re 105 at n 1 8 furthermore the previously observed drastic decrease in the vortex shedding frequency f v in case of the highly shear thickening fluid also see last subplot in fig 4 can more graphically be observed in the associated vortex shedding patterns also the boundary layer thickness the attached wake size strength and the length thickness of the associated shear stretching layer noticeably increase besides the previously noted decrease in the vortex shedding frequency with increasing the power law index parameter in the controlled situations application of the force actuator leads to a perceptible decrease in the vortex shedding frequency along with negligible effect on the vortex size nearly regardless of the power law index parameter however increasing the power law index effective fluid viscosity in this control configuration leads to an increase in the length of the shear layer also the key effect of applying the moment actuator in substantial weakening of the vortex strengths is clear in the figures in particular the control action of the moment actuator for the shear thinning fluid seems to be primarily achieved through altering the coalesced c 2s type vortex shedding mode to the 2s type mode of moderately weaker strengths along with the reduction in the associated shear layer length and vortex size strength for the newtonian fluid on the other hand the moment actuator seems to be effective through simultaneous decrease of the vortex shedding frequency as well as the vortex size strength lastly the success of control action in case of the highly shear thickening fluid despite the negligible effect of the moment controller on vortex shedding frequency and size strength may at least partly be associated to the increased effective fluid viscosity in other words the cylinder viv may be thought to be controlled in a hybrid active passive manner in this control configuration 6 summary and conclusions the 2 dof vortex induced vibration viv response of an elastically mounted circular cylinder in the lock in regime of laminar non newtonian cross flow is attenuated by using two distinct active feedback control strategies the coupled fluid structure interaction is simulated by applying fluent s moving mesh technology coupled with user defined function udf programming the viv suppression action is realized through an on line numerical co simulation platform that integrates the plant model constructed in the cfd solver with the control model implemented in matlab simulink the numerical simulations compare the important effects of force and moment based controllers on the key cylinder response parameters i e cross flow and inline cylinder displacements drag and lift coefficients and strouhal number as well as on the vortex shedding patterns for a wide range of power law index parameters 0 4 n 1 8 the main findings of the work are summed up as follows in the first desynchronization ds i region the cylinder inline cross flow oscillation amplitudes are typically low due to the higher added mass effects at such low reynolds numbers in particular the largest smallest width of ds i region is observed for the shear thickening shear thinning fluids due to the higher lower effective viscosity effects in the vicinity of cylinder also the largest reductions in the cylinder cross flow vibrations and maximum lift coefficient amplitudes are noted for the highly shear thickening fluid at the onset of the lock in jump some of the time response plots display a modulation or beating phenomenon in a narrow range of reynolds numbers i e two frequencies coexist in the system the strouhal vortex shedding frequency and the cylinder natural frequency this phenomenon is linked to the recurrent interchanges between the dominant ds i vortex patterns 2s vortex shedding mode and the vortices in the lock in region c 2s vortex shedding mode at the beginning of the lock in region the vortex shedding patterns are characterized by the typical coalesced c 2s type vortex shedding mode for re 75 at n 0 4 and by the classical von kármán vortex street of 2s type mode of moderately weaker strengths for re 84 at n 1 0 and re 105 at n 1 8 also the boundary layer thickness the attached wake size strength and the length thickness of the associated shear stretching layer vortex shedding frequency noticeably increase decrease with increasing the power law index parameter within the lock in region the consecutive vortex shedding past the elastic cylinder are well synchronized the cylinder displacement amplitudes considerably increase and the power law index parameter has a relatively small effect on the maximum cylinder cross flow vibration amplitudes more importantly as the value of power law index parameter is increased from the highly shear thinning to the highly viscous shear thickening n 0 4 1 8 there is a noticeable shift of the lock in region into the higher reynolds number range besides its marked contraction such notable decrease in the width of the synchronization region may be considered as a practical passive means of cylinder viv control xiong et al 2019 in the second desynchronization ds ii region the transverse cylinder vibration amplitudes suddenly drop to their relatively low levels which is linked to the drastic increase in the vortex shedding frequency where the system inertia prevents its immediate response to this high level of excitation frequency nearly regardless of power law index value also in contrast with the ds i region the largest smallest dampening of the cylinder cross flow vibration amplitudes in ds ii are observed for the highly shear thinning shear thickening fluid which is associated to the increase decrease in the effective viscosity of such fluid in the higher reynolds number range also increasing the power law index parameter leads to a perceptible reduction in the calculated vortex shedding frequency especially at higher reynolds numbers which is directly related to the low viscosity zone envelope developed by the shear thinning fluid of growing viscosity around the oscillating cylinder as against the increased effective fluid viscosity near the cylinder for the highly shear rate dependent shear thickening fluid in the controlled configurations application of the force based controller leads to a definite decrease in the vortex shedding frequency despite the negligible effect on the vortex size along with a much higher actuator energy consumption in comparison with the moment controller also the remarkable success of the moment based controller in effective and rapid mitigation of cylinder viv and weakening of the vortex strengths through a desynchronization type of action based on the imposed intelligent rotary oscillations with minimum actuator power consumption has been demonstrated for all power law index parameters in particular the moment based control action for the shear thinning fluid seems to be primarily achieved through altering the coalesced c 2s type vortex shedding mode to the classical von kármán 2s type mode of moderately weaker strengths along with an apparent reduction in the associated shear layer length and vortex size strength for the newtonian fluid on the other hand the moment actuator seems to be effective through simultaneous decrease of the vortex shedding frequency and the vortex size strength lastly the relatively low values of required power levels for mitigating cylinder viv in the shear thickening fluid by both force and moment actuators is connected to the considerable increase in the effective fluid viscosity close to the surface of the cylinder which can in effect support the control action in a passive manner

the length thickness of the associated shear stretching layer vortex shedding frequency are found to noticeably increase decrease with increasing the power law index parameter as the value of power law index is largely increased there is a notable shift of the synchronization lock in region into the higher reynolds number range besides its marked contraction which can passively complement the

transmission cables suspension bridges electronic components and hot wire anemometry hasheminejad et al 2014 2018 rashidi et al 2016 hong and shah 2018 liu et al 2020 this fundamental problem has been comprehensively studied within the fluid dynamics community since the early works of strouhal 1878 and von karman 1912 it could involve various complications such as vortex induced vibration viv flow induced noise fin amplified lift and drag forces reduced structural fatigue life and even disastrous structural collapse therefore suppression of vortex shedding and structural viv through modification of wake vortex dynamics is of great interest owing to its potential environmental and economic aftermaths however many materials of biological and industrial importance exhibit complex power law type non newtonian rheological behavior under proper conditions such materials include high molecular weight substances resins gums polymer melts solutions paints and blends multiphase

fluid semen saliva sharma et al 2016 lu et al 2017 anandharamakrishnan and ishwarya 2019 kannojiya et al 2020 tao et al 2020 numerous authors have investigated the external flows of structured fluids over variously shaped fixed or rotating cylinders since the experimental work of shah et al 1962 for example patnana et al 2009 used a finite volume method fvm based solver to numerically investigate the 2d unsteady cross flow flow of incompressible power law fluids past an unconfined stationary circular cylinder panda and chhabra 2010 numerically solved the continuity and momentum equations to investigate the steady flow of shear thinning power law fluids over a rotating cylinder fallah et al 2012 used lattice boltzmann method with multiple relaxation time mrt collision model to numerically study the unsteady 2d flow field around a rotating circular cylinder at a fixed reynolds number of 100 nidhi and paul 2016 used the ansys fluent commercial code to perform numerical simulations of

unsteady flow of a non newtonian carreau fluid over an unconfined stationary circular cylinder thakur et al 2016 numerically studied two dimensional steady laminar flow of incompressible bingham plastic fluids past a rotating circular cylinder pantokratoras 2017 also employed ansys fluent to numerically investigate the flow of a non newtonian power law fluid directed normally to an unconfined horizontal rotating circular cylinder housiadas and tanner 2018 analytically studied the effect of steady viscoelastic shear flow on an infinitely long and freely rotating circular cylinder based on a

vortex shedding regime bailoor et al 2019 offered detailed numerical results including time averaged force coefficients and vortex shedding characteristics for 2d unsteady shear thinning carreau fluid flow past an unconfined circular cylinder xiong et al 2019 used finite volume numerical simulations based on the nonlinear fene p model to investigate the viscoelastic polymeric fluid flow effects on passive viv control of an elastically mounted circular cylinder over a wide range of reynolds numbers thakur et al 2019 investigated the momentum and forced convection heat transfer characteristics of an asymmetrically confined isothermal rotating cylinder immersed in a power law fluid just recently khan et al 2020 used openfoam to carry out a detailed numerical study on the flow and heat transfer phenomena from a rotating cylinder submerged in a streaming viscoelastic fene p fluid there are three main methodologies for suppression of vortex shedding and modification of wake destructive behavior behind bluff bodies and elastic obstacles namely passive control active non feedback open loop control and active closed loop control obtaining significant reductions of structural viv over a broad range of operating conditions by using the traditional passive control techniques without increasing the mean drag force is a very difficult and challenging task these methods which do not require any external input energy include but are not limited to application of surface roughness elements surface local perturbation protrusions porous permeable wavy walls splitter spoiler plates trailing edge tabs streamlined fairings stabilizers perforated shrouds helical strakes guiding vanes synthetic jets surface blowing suction near wake acoustic excitation surface heaters electromagnetic forcing rotary oscillations control rods cylinders and tuned structural dampers hasheminejad et al 2014 rashidi et al 2016 hong and shah 2018 liu et al 2020 zdravkovich 1981 alternatively application of active feedback control techniques can be far more effective in postponing flow separation and suppressing vortex generation owing to their valuable capability in adjusting to diverse and unforeseen structural and environmental operating conditions such techniques normally make use of sensor signals to activate externally driven actuators with an appropriate control algorithm in a holistic framework numerous investigators have recommended a number of active control methodologies to cope with wake vortices e g see refs hasheminejad et al 2014 rashidi et al 2016 hasheminejad et al 2018 for recent reviews for example du and sun 2015 utilized the immersed boundary method to present an active control method based on forcing rotary oscillations for suppressing the viv response of an elastically mounted cylinder at moderate reynolds number in the lock in region dai et al 2015 investigated the efficiency of using a time delay feedback control to

undergoing 1dof viv in the reynolds number range of 1500 10000 mondal and chatterjee 2019 compared the performance of acceleration feedback control with that of the simple passive vibration absorber in mitigating cylinder vortex induced vibrations rabiee and esmaeili 2020 used the fuzzy pid control strategy for active flow induced vibration suppression of two elastically mounted tandem arranged identical circular cylinders at a low reynolds number hebrero et al 2020 proposed the use of plasma actuators in order to control the vortex induced vibration phenomena originated by airflow around an elastically mounted rigid circular cylinder mallik and santra 2020 investigated the capability of a sampled data time delay proportional integral derivative pid controller to mitigate the large amplitude cylinder oscillations viv in the lock in region the above brief review clearly suggests that although there is a voluminous body of literature exploiting a wide range of passive and active methodologies to suppress viv response of flexible bluff bodies and structures submerged in newtonian fluids intelligent control of one or two degrees of freedom viv of an elastically suspended cylinder in laminar cross flow of power law fluids has not yet been rigorously investigated therefore the main thrust of current work is to utilize the two dimensional unsteady incompressible power law flow model in real time collaboration with the traditional closed loop proportional force and moment based controllers to remove this significant break in the literature in this regard the main novelties of the work can more specifically be described in two folds i detailed numerical investigation of effects of power law rheology on coupled 2 dof vortex induced vibrations global flow parameters and vortex shedding patterns of an elastically mounted cylinder set in the lock in regime of non newtonian power law cross flow ii comparison of effectiveness of two distinct active closed loop control configurations i e the force and moment based controllers in a real time collaborative numerical simulation framework for viv suppression of the elastic cylinder for a wide range of power law index parameters the presented results can principally assist in understanding the shear thinning and shear thickening effects on the classic cylinder viv problem as the first step towards analyzing the more complex problems rabiee and esmaeili 2020 peng et al 2020 mishra et al 103196 it is of great practical interest for hydro elastic engineers dealing with high amplitude coupled 2dof

et al 2019 he 2020 dey et al 2020a 2020b lastly the presented relatively extensive set of simulation data can supplement the upcoming experimental studies besides providing valuable insights on design development and operational assessment of novel active viv control procedures and devices hasheminejad et al 2014 2018 rashidi et al 2016 mallik and santra 2020 gedikli et al 2019 konstantinidis 2019 azadiyazdi 2020 2 basic governing equations consider the 2d unsteady flow of an incompressible power law fluid over an elastically mounted two degrees of freedom circular cylinder of diameter d with a uniform stream velocity u as depicted in fig 1a thus the flow phenomenon can be described by the continuity and momentum equations in the form patnana et al 2009 bird 2002 1 u x x u y y 0 2a u x t u x u x x u y u x y p x 1 re τ x x x τ y x y 2b u y t u x u y x u y u y y p y 1 re τ y x x τ y y y where p is the pressure re ρ d n u 2 n m 0 is the reynolds number and ρ m 0 n denote fluid density power law consistency index and power law index parameter respectively also the associated rheological equation of state is written as 3 τ i j 2 η ε i j i j x y where ε i j 1 2 u i j u j i is the rate of deformation tensor η m 0 i 2 2 n 1 2 denotes the fluid scalar viscosity function and i 2 i j ε i j ε j i ε x x 2 ε y y 2 2 ε x y 2 is the second invariant of the rate of deformation bird 2002 note that n 1 corresponds to the newtonian fluid behavior n 1 denotes shear thinning behavior and n 1 is linked to shear thickening behavior patnana et al 2009 after direct substitution of eq 3 into eq 2 one obtains the conservative form of the momentum equations 4a u x t u x u x x u y u x y p x η re 2 u x x 2 2 u x y 2 2 re ε x x η x ε y x η y 4b u y t u x u y x u y u y y p y η re 2 u y x 2 2 u y y 2 2 re ε x y η x ε y y η y also the total drag coefficient c d can be split as the sum of the pressure and friction components in the form c d 2 f d ρ u 2 d c dp c df in which f d is the drag force per unit length acting on cylindrical surface similarly the lift coefficient can be written in the form c l 2 f l ρ u 2 d c lp c lf in which f l is the lift force per unit length acting on cylindrical surface furthermore the frictional and pressure parts of the lift and drag coefficients can be determined from patnana et al 2009 5 c lf 2 f lf ρ u 2 d 2 n 1 re s τ y x n x τ y y n y d s c lp 2 f lp ρ

and f df f lf and f dp f lp refer to the frictional and pressure components of the drag and lift forces respectively patnana et al 2009 fig 1b illustrates the details of the relatively large computational domain adopted in the present study the elastically mounted unconfined cylinder of total mass m experiences unsteady fluid forces under the in line free stream flow which leads to the rigid body motion in both cross flow and in line directions thus the elastic cylinder can be modeled as a simple mass spring damper oscillating system with identical stiffness and damping parameters in both directions i e k x k y k and c x c y c and with the standard governing equations of motion in the form hasheminejad et al 2014 6 x f d c x k x m y f l c y k y m where y y y refer to the cylinder transverse crosswise acceleration velocity and displacement while x x x denote the same quantities in the x direction also by adopting the following non dimensionalization parameters for the in line cross flow displacements y y d x x d time t t u d mass ratio m 4 m π ρ d 2 reduced velocity u u f n d and damping ratio ξ c 2 m k the cylinder equations of motion in the non dimensional form can beneficially be expressed in the form 7 d 2 x d t 2 4 π ξ u d x d t 2 π u 2 x 2 c d π m d 2 y d t 2 4 π ξ u d y d t 2 π u 2 y 2 c l π m where f n 2 π 1 k m is the natural structural frequency here it is supposed that the natural structural frequency of the mass damper spring system does not depend on the flow speed and the damping coefficient ξ is set to equal to zero in order to attain a large response amplitude also to explore the effect of the reynolds number at a fixed structural natural frequency f n the dependence of the reduced velocity on the reynolds number for a cylinder of circular cross section is set as u u f n d 16 6 re prasanth and mittal 2008 lastly the dimensionless frequency of the vortex shedding or the strouhal number is defined as st f v d u in which f v is the frequency of the vortex shedding 3 controller design and configurations the proportional integral derivative pid controllers are recognized as the best controllers used in industrial control processes mainly owing to their simple structure and robust performance in a wide range of operating conditions accordingly the transfer function of a pid controller in its standard form is given as 8 g c s k p k i s k d s k p 1 t i s 1 t d s where k p k i and k d refer to the proportional integral and derivative gains respectively and with the associated time constants defined as t i k p k i and t d k d k p also the discrete time equivalent of the pid controller has the transfer function zhao et al 1993 9 u k k p e k k i t s i 1 n e i k d t s δ e k where u k is the control signal e k is the error between the reference and process output t s is the controller sampling period and δ e k e k e k 1 evidently the parameters of the pid controller k p k i k d can readily be utilized to produce various response forms for a given process in this paper we shall use two distinct active closed loop control methods to effectively suppress the vortex induced vibrations viv of the elastic cylinder by utilization of a proper feedback signal simple diagrams of the flow configuration and applied control algorithms are shown in fig 2 a and b the first control method fig 2a is based on application of an oscillating angular velocity of the general form ω t a rot sin 2 π f rot t where a rot f rot refer to amplitude and rotational oscillation frequency of the angular velocity respectively in the second control method fig 2b the cylinder oscillations are attenuated by direct application of the transverse control force f a t the output responses in the closed loop control systems are continuously measured by proper displacement and force sensors which transform the measurement signals into electric signals that are eventually fed back to the controller as the controller continually has information about system performance it can make the appropriate adjustments to keep the output in desired condition in the first control configuration fig 2a the cylinder lift force f l t which is an readily assessable quantity through the udf can be considered as a suitable choice of feedback signal for controlling the cylinder rotation accordingly an active closed loop viv control strategy based on the cylinder rotational oscillations is suggested in the form 10 ω t k p ω e t k p ω f l t k p ω f l d t f l t where ω t is the applied cylinder angular velocity k p ω 0 is the associated closed loop proportional control parameter f l d t 0 being the desired value of cylinder lift force therefore the control effort is given in the form 11 ω t k p ω f l t here it should be noted that the negative sign in eq 11 signifies the fact that the imposed cylinder rotational oscillations exactly opposes the time variations of the calculated lift force similarly in the second control configuration fig 2b the cylinder transverse displacement y t which is an easily computable quantity through the udf in every time step during the unsteady calculation process can be considered as a good choice of feedback signal for manipulating the cylinder transverse oscillations accordingly an active closed loop viv control strategy based on the cylinder transverse oscillations is offered in the form 12 f a t k p f e t k p f y t k p f y d t y t where f a t is the applied transverse control force k p f 0 is the closed loop proportional control parameter y d t 0 being the desired value of cylinder transverse displacement therefore the control effort in this case is written in the simple form 13 f a t k p f y t now the present fluid structure interaction fsi control problem can be implemented through the advanced process simulator matlab simulink program environment to mitigate the cylinder transverse oscillations the controller is allocated the master role by calling the fluent software in each time step the generic scheme for online coupling and co simulation of fluent with matlab simulink in the first control configuration fig 2a is summarized as follows i solve the continuity and momentum equations using fluent ii calculate the resultant cross flow fluid force f l t iii controller in matlab computes the required control effort ω t k p ω f l t iv control effort is saved in a data file and then accessed by the udf v udf imposes the control effort through the define cg motion macro vi algorithm continues until the transverse cylinder displacement is nearly terminated similarly to suppress the cylinder transverse oscillations in the second control configuration fig 2b one considers the control scheme i solve the continuity and momentum equations using fluent ii calculate the resultant in line cross flow fluid forces f l t f d t iii cylinder displacement y t computed and saved by udf into an input data file iv controller in matlab computes the required control force f a t k p f y t v control force is saved into a data file and then read by the udf vi equations of motion 6 are re solved based on the new resultant force vii algorithm goes on until transverse cylinder displacement is nearly terminated lastly the key steps and interfacing schematically depicted in the block diagram of fig 2 may more explicitly be described as follows the general procedure involves running the fluent cfd package integrated with an online control loop in a real time collaborative simulation framework using udf code in fluent together with matlab where the actuation force or moment for each time step is generated by the controller based on the output of the previous simulation step results more specifically the hydrodynamic lift force f l t or cylinder transverse displacement y t in the pre processing stage is generated in form of an input data file using cfd simulations in fluent guided by the flow physics subsequently the cfd generated data of the plant is implemented into the transient simulation loop of active viv control system with a zero input reference value f l d t y d t 0 at this stage the instantaneous values of lift force or cylinder transverse displacement as well as the associated real time error signals are calculated at each time step the error values are then multiplied by the associated proportional control gain in order to calculate the imposed input rotational oscillation ω t see fig 2a or actuator force f a t see fig 2b subsequently the calculated transverse force or rotational oscillation is implemented into the cfd model the new error signal is then evaluated based on the new output signal that is fed back into the controller this closed loop process is continued with the selected time step until the zero steady state value is approximately reached and the cylinder viv control is achieved 4 numerical procedure 4 1 boundary conditions and computational method in this subsection we shall briefly outline the computational procedure for viv analysis of the elastically suspended cylinder in every time step of the interaction course the continuity and momentum eqs 1 and 4 are to be solved by exploiting the finite volume method based cfd solver fluent 6 3 26 to compute the cylinder displacements eq 6 the user define function udf is hooked to the fluent solver the cylinder is supposed to be positioned in a rectangular computational domain with the upstream and downstream boundaries being fixed at the distance l u 10 d l d 25 5 d from the center of the cylindrical body while the top and bottom boundaries are h 20 d apart as depicted in fig 1 the fluid physical properties ρ m 0 n are set as constants in each simulation and the flow is presumed to be unsteady laminar in all simulations the pertinent boundary conditions for the above explained flow configuration are summarized as follows uniform inlet velocity condition u x u and u y 0 zero outlet diffusion flux patnana et al 2009 i e the default outflow boundary condition option in fluent u x t u u x x 0 and u y t u u y y 0 no slip boundary condition on the cylinder surface u x 0 and u y 0 no slip boundary condition at the top and bottom boundaries of the computational domain u x 0 and u y 0 the incompressible flow was solved using the two dimensional unsteady laminar segregated solver on the collocated grid arrangement the second order upwind schemes and the standard discretization are respectively utilized to discretize the momentum and pressure terms while the pressure velocity coupling was achieved by the fractional step algorithm the gauss siedel point by point iterative method in conjunction with the algebraic multi grid amg method solver is employed by fluent to solve the system of algebraic equations this way the number of iterations and therefore the cpu time required to obtain a converged solution can greatly be reduce especially when the model contains a large number of control volumes patnana et al 2009 also the non newtonian power law viscosity models are utilized furthermore in order to start the simulations the reynolds number is initially set equal to 60 and once the equilibrium response is reached a new simulation is carried out by adopting the end results of the last computational step as the initial conditions for the reynolds number the simulations are steered for long enough to ensure reaching the equilibrium response i e at least 10 oscillation periods the equations of motion for the oscillating cylinder eq 6 can be treated using an explicit time integration algorithm described in cg motion macro available in fluent a user defined function udf is introduced into fluent environment to define the motion of the center of gravity of the cylinder based on the forces acting on it see eq 6 the cross flow and in line cylinder velocities that are returned to fluent can be computed at the t n 1 time step from placzek et al 2009 14 x n 1 x n δ t x n 1 y n 1 y n δ t y n 1 where the acceleration terms are accessed from the equations of motion 6 also the cylinder position the surface flow velocity and the mesh configuration are updated at each time step as the cylinder moves at each iteration step of the solution procedure fluent s moving deforming mesh mdm function remeshes the grid cells this process normally causes growth of skewed cells which in turn causes slow convergence and inaccurate solutions to treat this problem a moving mesh scheme is applied by generating a central square region with highest quality structured cells about the cylinder as depicted in fig 1b the computational grid in the central square block is treated as quad cells of map type by gambit this square region is defined to move wholly as a rigid body with the oscillating cylindrical body while the external cells adjacent to the square domain are distorted and updated using the remeshing and smoothing techniques of the dynamic mesh configuration 4 2 grid and time step independence and validations the accuracy and reliability of the numerical results is greatly influenced by the selection of numerical parameters specifically grid sizes and the time step an optimal grid should be sufficiently fine to properly capture the flow field without being unreasonably resources intensive therefore based on the detailed study performed in our previous investigation hasheminejad et al 2014 the domain and grids used in the current unsteady flow calculations seem to be adequate to resolve the viv phenomena with tolerable levels of accuracy within the range of conditions of interest also in the numerical simulations of the unsteady flow over the cylinder picking the right time step also plays an important role in finding the time accurate solution of the momentum equation accordingly the time step independence study is carried out in the case of unsteady flow of power law fluids over a stationary cylinder for a selected reynolds number re 140 and three values of the power law index parameters n 0 4 1 1 8 the effect of time step on the time averaged drag coefficient c d and the strouhal number st are presented in table 1 the calculations are started with a time step of δ t 0 05 and it is progressively decreased up to δ t 0 02 in view of the negligible variations observed in table 1 the time step δ t 0 03 is believed to be appropriate thus all results reported herein will be based on this time step lastly in order to demonstrate the overall accuracy of adopted numerical methodology several comparisons are made with the results available in the literature as the first verification the unsteady flow of a power law fluid past a stationary circular cylinder is considered for re 100 and selected power law index parameters n 0 4 0 6 1 0 1 4 1 8 the calculated results for the time averaged drag coefficient c d the rms value of lift coefficient c l r m s and the strouhal number st as listed in table 2 demonstrate excellent agreements with the results in patnana et al 2009 next we considered the unsteady flow of a power law fluid past a rotating stationary circular cylinder for re 100 and selected range of power law index parameters 0 4 n 1 8 and rotation rates α a rot d 2 u 0 0 5 again very good agreements are obtained with the results available in the literature for the calculated time averaged drag and lift coefficients as presented in fig 3 a subsequently we considered two dimensional newtonian fluid flow n 1 over a 2dof freely vibrating elastic circular cylinder in the flow range of 60 re 150 for ξ 0 and m 10 a very good consistency is observed for y max d c lmax st with the data presented in prasanth and mittal 2008 which were obtained based on a stabilized space time finite element technique as demonstrated in fig 3b as a further verification we used our general code to deliberate on two dimensional newtonian fluid flow n 1 over a freely suspended circular cylinder in the reduced velocity range of 3 u 10 for three different flow settings re 150 m 2 ξ 0 re 100 m 10 ξ 0 and re 200 m 10 ξ 0 01 good confirmations are achieved for y max d with the data presented in bao et al 2012 chern et al 2014 leontini et al 2006 as seen in fig 3c lastly we considered the newtonian fluid flow n 1 over a rotationally oscillating circular cylinder at re 150 for selected rotational oscillation amplitudes α 0 5 2 and range of rotational frequency ratios 0 5 f rot f stat 5 where f stat is the vortex shedding frequency for flow past a stationary cylinder at the same reynolds number excellent agreements are obtained for c l rms c d with the numerical results presented in the literature thiria et al 2006 du and dalton 2013 as demonstrated in fig 3d 5 numerical results the power law index parameter is an indication of the diligence of the shear rate dependence of fluid viscosity chhabra and richardson 2011 accordingly the power law indices considered in this paper are anticipated to qualitatively show the role of fluid behavior on flow characteristics and the computed results will be deliberated depending on shear thinning n 1 and shear thickening n 1 fluid behavior realizing the numerous parameters involved here we focus our attention to a particular model the flow is supposed to be unsteady and laminar in all simulations while the fluid physical properties are set as constants in order to obtain the structural natural frequency of f n 0 0166 hz for selected values of power law index parameters n 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 and reynolds numbers 60 re 145 the dimensionless mass of the cylinder is set as constant m 10 while as mentioned earlier the linear stiffness in both in line cross flow directions are assumed to be equal also in order to promote high amplitude cylinder oscillations the structural damping is supposed to be zero c 0 furthermore the initial cylinder displacements and velocities in both directions at the starting reynolds number re 60 are all assumed to be zero once the equilibrium response is reached the subsequent simulations are performed by adopting the end results of the pervious computational step as the initial conditions for the new reynolds number fig 4 illustrates the changes in the maximum nondimensional transverse in line cylinder displacement amplitudes y max d x max d the maximum lift coefficient c l max the time averaged value of the drag coefficient c d strouhal number st and the frequency ratio f r f v f n with the reynolds number 60 re 145 for selected values of power law index parameters n 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 the key observations are as follows in the first desynchronization ds i region 60 re 70 86 the cylinder inline cross flow oscillation amplitudes are typically low which can be associated to the higher added mass effects for such low reynolds numbers vikestad et al 2000 in particular the largest smallest width of first desynchronization ds i region is observed for the shear thickening shear thinning fluids primarily due to the higher lower effective viscosity effects in the vicinity of cylinder patnana et al 2009 also the largest dampening of cylinder cross flow vibration and maximum lift coefficient amplitudes y max d c l max in ds i are observed for the highly shear thickening fluids n 1 8 while the largest attenuation of cylinder maximum in line vibration amplitudes and time averaged drag coefficient amplitudes x max d c d are noted for the highly shear thinning fluids n 0 4 the latter observation may directly be associated to the higher levels of overall fluid forcing pushing effects along the in line direction at lower reynolds numbers for the highly shear thinning fluids while the former observation may be linked to the drastic decrease in the vortex shedding frequency f v and consequently the cylinder cross flow displacements in case of the highly shear thickening fluids in the lock in region 70 86 re 125 135 where the frequency ratio f r 1 nearly regardless of power law index parameter the consecutive vortex shedding past the elastic cylinder are well synchronized the cylinder displacement amplitudes considerably increase and the fluid type power index parameter seems to have a relatively small effect on the maximum cylinder cross flow vibration amplitudes y max d 0 6 also see singh and mittal 2005 the most intriguing observation is perhaps the noticeable advance of the lock in region into the lower reynolds number range besides its remarkable expansion as the value of power law index parameter is decreased from the highly viscous shear thickening to the highly shear thinning n 1 8 0 4 this observation i e the notable decrease in the width of the synchronization range with increasing the power law index parameter can be of practical value as an effective passive method of cylinder viv control also in the second desynchronization ds ii region 125 135 re the transverse cylinder vibration amplitudes suddenly drop to their relatively low levels which can be linked to the drastic increase in the vortex shedding frequency f v where the system inertia prevents its immediate response to this high value of excitation frequency nearly regardless of power law index value lastly in contrast with the ds i region the largest smallest dampening of the cylinder cross flow vibration amplitudes y max d in ds ii are observed for the highly shear thinning shear thickening fluid which may directly be associated to the increase decrease in the effective viscosity of such fluid in the higher reynolds number range note the definition of re ρ d n u 2 n m 0 this apparent increase decrease in the effective viscosity of the highly shear thinning shear thickening fluid has an overall dampening effect on the transverse vibrations of the elastic cylinder fig 5 a c shows the time histories of the transverse and in line displacement responses of the freely oscillating cylinder as well as those of the lift and drag coefficients c l y d c d x d for selected values of power law index parameters n 0 6 1 2 1 8 at five selected reynolds numbers namely at a reynolds number just before lock in in ds i three reynolds numbers within the lock in region and the last reynolds number just after lock out in ds ii the main observations are as follows first one can note the in phase oscillations of the c l y d pair in the ds i region while there is a 180 phase difference in the ds ii regime almost regardless of the power law index parameter furthermore the time response curves associated with the fourth reynolds number near the end of the lock in region in most cases display a 180 phase difference on the other hand one can observe the 180 out of phase oscillations of the c d x d pair in all three regions nearly irrespective of the power law index parameter also some of the c l y d time response plots essentially display a modulation or beating phenomenon in a narrow range of reynolds numbers at the onset of the lock in jump e g see the case n 1 2 re 84 in fig 5b note that the beating behavior can also be observed by taking smaller steps in reynolds number for other power law parameters this phenomenon may be linked to the recurrent altercation between the vortex shedding patterns associated with the ds i branch or the 2s mode of vortex shedding and those of the lock in where the vortices in the wake coalesce leading to the c 2s mode of vortex shedding in other words in such narrow range of reynolds numbers the vortices are shed at the strouhal frequency while the cylinder is oscillating at another frequency so that there are two frequencies present in the system outside the lock in region the cylinder no longer respond near its natural frequency the response amplitudes significantly decrease and the beating behavior entirely vanishes lastly fig 6 displays the normalized fast fourier transforms ffts of the time histories of the lift coefficients c l presented in fig 5 for selected values of power law index parameters n 0 4 0 6 0 8 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 and reynolds numbers within the lock in region it is clear that increasing the power law index parameter leads to a perceptible reduction in the calculated vortex shedding frequency e g from f v 0 01625 for n 0 4 at re 75 to f v 0 01589 for n 1 8 at re 100 especially at higher reynolds numbers also see the last subplot in fig 4 this apparent reduction of the vortex shedding frequency can be directly associated to the low viscosity zone envelope developed by the shear thinning fluid of growing viscosity around the oscillating cylinder as against the increased effective fluid viscosity near the cylinder for the highly shear rate dependent shear thickening fluid furthermore for a given power law index parameter increasing the reynolds number leads to a notable increase in the calculated vortex shedding frequency e g from f v 0 01625 at re 75 to f v 0 02483 at re 120 for n 0 4 and from f v 0 01589 at re 100 to f v 0 01683 at re 130 for n 1 8 fig 7 display the displacement orbital trajectories x d y d of the freely oscillating cylinder for selected values of power law index parameters n 0 4 0 8 1 2 1 8 at selected reynolds numbers just before the lock in in ds i within the lock in region and just after lock out in ds ii comments similar to previous remarks can readily be made the most important distinctions are as follows the general figure eight type orbital trajectories indicate periodic oscillations in most cases except for those situations at the onset of transition jump into the lock in region where the beating phenomenon was previously observed as marked in the respective subplots near the end of the ds i region as the reynolds number increases and we enter the lock in region the phase portraits rotate about 180 into a rightward horseshoe form and the cylinder inline oscillations markedly increase principally along the positive x direction with a further increase in the reynolds number near the end of the lock in region transition into the ds ii region becomes imminent as marked in the respective subplots lastly as the power law index parameter of the flowing fluid increases the above noted fig 8 trajectory becomes more symmetric upright with respect to the inline cylinder oscillations in both ds i and ds ii regions while in the lock in region the depth of the horseshoe form further extends i e the cylinder inline displacements amplify along the positive x direction which may directly be linked to the increase in the effective fluid viscosity now before deliberating on the controller performance a brief description of a prospective experimental setup for the proposed single input single output siso viv control

selected values of reynolds numbers and power law index parameters i e for re 75 at n 0 4 re 84 at n 1 0 and re 105 at n 1 8 at the beginning of the respective lock in regions i e where the maximum transverse cylinder viv amplitudes occur see the first subplot in fig 4 also shown as the last subplot in each figure are the calculated consumed actuator power for both control configurations illustrated in fig 2a and b in the first control configuration moment actuator p control the consumed actuator power is calculated using p a m t ω t 1 2 ρ u 2 s c m t ω t where c m t is the moment coefficient calculated by fluent and s π d 2 4 is the cylinder cross sectional area in the second control configuration force actuator p and pid control the consumed actuator power is simply computed using p a f a t y t the numerical values of the selected manually tuned controller parameters are listed in table 3 see eqs 8 and 9 remarks similar to the previous comments can readily be made the most important distinctions are as follows the remarkable success of the moment controller in effective mitigation of cylinder transverse oscillations is clear in the figures for all three power law index parameters furthermore the moment controller is observed to be capable of expeditious cylinder viv control with minimum expenditure of actuator power particularly for the newtonian cross flow n 1 0 this is realized through a desynchronization type of action by active modification of coupling between cylinder free oscillations and vortex shedding i e by forcing the cylinder out of the lock in condition through proper selection of ω t eventually leading to an insignificant transverse cylinder displacement with minimum power consumption the other two controllers perform in a somewhat similar manner with a much higher actuator energy consumption in comparison with the moment controller this fact can better be seen in table 4 where the time averaged consumed actuator power p a rms is calculated for all three actuators operating in the highly shear thinning newtonian and highly shear thickening fluids n 0 4 1 1 8 the relatively low values of required p a rms for mitigating cylinder viv by all three actuators in the shear thickening fluid may be linked to the notable increase in the effective viscosity of 2d shear thickening flow close to the surface of the cylinder patnana et al 2009 chandra and chhabra 2011 which in effect can passively assist the control action in a preventive manner fig 9 a b c compare the uncontrolled and controlled instantaneous vorticity fields for the fully developed unsteady flow in the synchronization region at selected dimensionless time instants see table 5 as also marked by a i in the first subplots of fig 8 after the start of the controller action for selected values of reynolds numbers and power law index parameters i e for re 75 at n 0 4 re 84 at n 1 0 and re 105 at n 1 8 the key observations are as follows in the uncontrolled situations the vortex shedding patterns first column subplots can be characterized by the typical c 2s type vortex shedding mode for re 75 at n 0 4 and by the classical von kármán vortex street of 2s type mode of moderately weaker strengths for re 84 at n 1 0 and re 105 at n 1 8 furthermore the previously observed drastic decrease in the vortex shedding frequency f v in case of the highly shear thickening fluid also see last subplot in fig 4 can more graphically be observed in the associated vortex shedding patterns also the boundary layer thickness the attached wake size strength and the length thickness of the associated shear stretching layer noticeably increase besides the previously noted decrease in the vortex shedding frequency with increasing the power law index parameter in the controlled situations application of the force actuator leads to a perceptible decrease in the vortex shedding frequency along with negligible effect on the vortex size nearly regardless of the power law index parameter however increasing the power law index effective fluid viscosity in this control configuration leads to an increase in the length of the shear layer also the key effect of applying the moment actuator in substantial weakening of the vortex strengths is clear in the figures in particular the control action of the moment actuator for the shear thinning fluid seems to be primarily achieved through altering the coalesced c 2s type vortex shedding mode to the 2s type mode of moderately weaker strengths along with the reduction in the associated shear layer length and vortex size strength for the newtonian fluid on the other hand the moment actuator seems to be effective through simultaneous decrease of the vortex shedding frequency as well as the vortex size strength lastly the success of control action in case of the highly shear thickening fluid despite the negligible effect of the moment controller on vortex shedding frequency and size strength may at least partly be associated to the increased effective fluid viscosity in other words the cylinder viv may be thought to be controlled in a hybrid active passive manner in this control configuration 6 summary and conclusions the 2 dof vortex induced vibration viv response of an elastically mounted circular cylinder in the lock in regime of laminar non newtonian cross flow is attenuated by using two distinct active feedback control strategies the coupled fluid structure interaction is simulated by applying fluent s moving mesh technology coupled with user defined function udf programming the viv suppression action is realized through an on line numerical co simulation platform that integrates the plant model constructed in the cfd solver with the control model implemented in matlab simulink the numerical simulations compare the important effects of force and moment based controllers on the key cylinder response parameters i e cross flow and inline cylinder displacements drag and lift coefficients and strouhal number as well as on the vortex shedding patterns for a wide range of power law index parameters 0 4 n 1 8 the main findings of the work are summed up as follows in the first desynchronization ds i region the cylinder inline cross flow oscillation amplitudes are typically low due to the higher added mass effects at such low reynolds numbers in particular the largest smallest width of ds i region is observed for the shear thickening shear thinning fluids due to the higher lower effective viscosity effects in the vicinity of cylinder also the largest reductions in the cylinder cross flow vibrations and maximum lift coefficient amplitudes are noted for the highly shear thickening fluid at the onset of the lock in jump some of the time response plots display a modulation or beating phenomenon in a narrow range of reynolds numbers i e two frequencies coexist in the system the strouhal vortex shedding frequency and the cylinder natural frequency this phenomenon is linked to the recurrent interchanges between the dominant ds i vortex patterns 2s vortex shedding mode and the vortices in the lock in region c 2s vortex shedding mode at the beginning of the lock in region the vortex shedding patterns are characterized by the typical coalesced c 2s type vortex shedding mode for re 75 at n 0 4 and by the classical von kármán vortex street of 2s type mode of moderately weaker strengths for re 84 at n 1 0 and re 105 at n 1 8 also the boundary layer thickness the attached wake size strength and the length thickness of the associated shear stretching layer vortex shedding frequency noticeably increase decrease with increasing the power law index parameter within the lock in region the consecutive vortex shedding past the elastic cylinder are well synchronized the cylinder displacement amplitudes considerably increase and the power law index parameter has a relatively small effect on the maximum cylinder cross flow vibration amplitudes more importantly as the value of power law index parameter is increased from the highly shear thinning to the highly viscous shear thickening n 0 4 1 8 there is a noticeable shift of the lock in region into the higher reynolds number range besides its marked contraction such notable decrease in the width of the synchronization region may be considered as a practical passive means of cylinder viv control xiong et al 2019 in the second desynchronization ds ii region the transverse cylinder vibration amplitudes suddenly drop to their relatively low levels which is linked to the drastic increase in the vortex shedding frequency where the system inertia prevents its immediate response to this high level of excitation frequency nearly regardless of power law index value also in contrast with the ds i region the largest smallest dampening of the cylinder cross flow vibration amplitudes in ds ii are observed for the highly shear thinning shear thickening fluid which is associated to the increase decrease in the effective viscosity of such fluid in the higher reynolds number range also increasing the power law index parameter leads to a perceptible reduction in the calculated vortex shedding frequency especially at higher reynolds numbers which is directly related to the low viscosity zone envelope developed by the shear thinning fluid of growing viscosity around the oscillating cylinder as against the increased effective fluid viscosity near the cylinder for the highly shear rate dependent shear thickening fluid in the controlled configurations application of the force based controller leads to a definite decrease in the vortex shedding frequency despite the negligible effect on the vortex size along with a much higher actuator energy consumption in comparison with the moment controller also the remarkable success of the moment based controller in effective and rapid mitigation of cylinder viv and weakening of the vortex strengths through a desynchronization type of action based on the imposed intelligent rotary oscillations with minimum actuator power consumption has been demonstrated for all power law index parameters in particular the moment based control action for the shear thinning fluid seems to be primarily achieved through altering the coalesced c 2s type vortex shedding mode to the classical von kármán 2s type mode of moderately weaker strengths along with an apparent reduction in the associated shear layer length and vortex size strength for the newtonian fluid on the other hand the moment actuator seems to be effective through simultaneous decrease of the vortex shedding frequency and the vortex size strength lastly the relatively low values of required power levels for mitigating cylinder viv in the shear thickening fluid by both force and moment actuators is connected to the considerable increase in the effective fluid viscosity close to the surface of the cylinder which can in effect support the control action in a passive manner
