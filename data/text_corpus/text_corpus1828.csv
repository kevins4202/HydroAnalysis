9140,reduced irrigation and high soil salinity are widely recognized to decrease tomato yield but they can improve fruit quality and water use efficiency wue when imposed appropriately however the response of plant to their interaction is still unclear and the quantitative relationship of wue and fruit quality with salinity under different water regimes is also lacking this study investigated the responses of tomatoes in terms of yield fruit quality and wue based on yield wuey biomass wueb and leaf iwue to twelve treatments consisting of combinations of three water regimes relative to the field capacity fc w0 w1 and w2 refer to 95 fc 75 fc and 60 fc respectively and four soil salinity levels 0 g 2 g 4 g and 6 g salt mixtures added to 1000 g air dried soil respectively results showed that wuey and wueb had a negative correlation with salinity under different water regimes salinity resulted in a greater reduction in yield and biomass than water consumption compared to the control treatment therefore lower water consumption of plants under w2 treatment alleviated the decrease of wuey induced by salinity to a certain extent from the leaf scale iwue was positively and linearly related with salinity indicating that stomatal regulation was more prone to reduced stomatal conductance than the net photosynthetic rate under w0 and w1 whilst it showed a quadratic relationship under w2 the results supported that a highly salinity induced iwue was dependent on water supply in addition although salinity had a negative correlation with fruit fresh mass fm dry matter content and water content wc under w0 and w1 fruit titratable acidity ta and total soluble solids tss were proportional to salinity regardless of water regimes the results also showed that w1 increased the sensitivity of ta and tss to salinity but w2 resulted in weak sensitivity of fm and wc to salinity thus we deduced that mildly reduced irrigation was an appropriate strategy to regulate iwue and fruit quality under high salinity conditions this study provides a water regime management basis for comprehensive changes in yield wue and fruit quality of tomatoes grown in saline soils abbreviations fc

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction many environmental stresses such as drought high salinity flooding and extreme temperatures adversely affect plant growth development and reproduction suzuki et al 2014 cohen et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 although numerous studies have focused on the responses of plants to individual environmental stress plants often face combinations of different environmental stresses in both natural and agricultural systems mittler 2006 zhang and sonnewald 2017 zandalinas et al 2021 abdalla et al 2022 soil drought and secondary salinization frequently co occur in northwest china where saline groundwater is heavily used for irrigated agriculture causing an extremely high rate of salt accumulation on the soil surface cramer et al 2011 qiu et al 2021 wu et al 2022 simultaneously these regions have a well developed solar greenhouse industry due to rich light and heat resources chen et al 2013 qiu et al 2013 the tomato solanum lycopersicum is one of the most widely produced vegetables in a greenhouse in northwest china chen et al 2013 qiu et al 2013 a better understanding of the response of plant growth water use and fruit quality under combined stresses is contributing to providing water management strategies for vegetable crop production in these saline regions the response of the plant to combined reduced irrigation and salinity is more complex than individual stress glenn et al 2012 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 although individual stress may have little effect on plant growth and survival the combination of multiple stresses can be detrimental to plants suzuki et al 2014 zandalinas et al 2021 generally combined reduced irrigation and salinity has greater synergistic negative effects on plants than individual stress manuchehri and salehi 2014 ors et al 2021 for instance the recovery ability of leaf water status and photosynthesis under combined stresses is greatly reduced after the stress is relieved pérez pérez et al 2007 plant growth decreases excessively under combined stresses due to the dehydration of leaf tissue and the high accumulation of cl and na in leaves álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 sahin et al 2018 conversely several studies reported that the drought tolerance of plants was improved when plants were exposed to combined stresses which may involve a protective effect of salinity on biomass production glenn et al 2012 in terms of increased water and carbon balance and enhanced osmotic adjustment martínez et al 2003 2005 sucre and suarez 2011 munns et al 2020 these conflicting results indicate that the different effects of combined stresses may be dependent on plant genotype species and or timing and intensity of individual stress suzuki et al 2014 it is therefore necessary to investigate the response of plants to combined reduced irrigation and salinity which allows breeders to select plants tolerant to the combined stresses suzuki et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 reduced irrigation lowers soil water potential and salinity decreases soil osmotic potential due to the massive accumulation of ions resulting in limited water availability for plants munns 2002 munns and tester 2008 abdalla et al 2022 the water transport capacity of the plant was decreased due to the increase of xylem hydraulic resistance of root stem and leaves under combined stresses stiller 2009 abdalla et al 2022 stomatal regulation is a crucial strategy for plant water use under combined reduced irrigation and salinity a study reported that the stomatal conductance g s was regulated by abscisic acid aba under well watered condition and salt stress but coordinated by aba and leaf water potential under combined stresses in tomatoes xue et al 2021 furthermore reduced g s results in reduced transpiration but carbohydrate synthesis may also be maintained or reduced under combined stresses which may cause an increase in water use efficiency based on the leaf iwue xue et al 2021 liao et al 2022 in addition many studies have reported that reduced irrigation can improve water use efficiency based on yield wuey and biomass wueb by maintaining yield or biomass with less water consumption du et al 2015 gupta et al 2020 kang et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 found that wueb of alfalfa was linearly decreased with increased soil salt content due to a greater decrease in the dry matter than water consumption ors and suarez 2017 suggested wuey of spinach was first increased and then decreased with increased salinity indicating that applying moderately saline water not only increased yield but also saved water however there are few studies focused on the quantitative relationship of wuey wueb and iwue of tomato plants with salinity under different water regimes the formation of tomato fruit quality is involved with water and carbon accumulation together guichard et al 2001 fruit water content accounts for more than 90 of the fruit fresh mass and is crucial for tomato size and fruit quality ho et al 1987 and is determined by the flux of xylem and phloem and fruit transpiration guichard et al 2001 although reduced irrigation may disrupt the normal growth of tomatoes it can promote the preferentially supply of water to vital reproductive organs through readjusting the hydraulic distribution kang et al 2021 harrison day et al 2022 however fruit dry matter content e g carbohydrates organic acids lipids and minerals is transported only via phloem flux hou et al 2020 many studies have demonstrated that xylem transport is sensitive to changes in plant water status whereas phloem transport is relatively insensitive van ieperen et al 2003 guichard et al 2005 hou et al 2020 thus it is susceptible to causing an improvement in fruit quality in terms of sugar and acid concentration under stress conditions due to the decreased water accumulation hou et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 although there are many studies focusing on the physiological response of tomato fruit quality under reduced irrigation or salinity stress plaut et al 2004 ripoll et al 2016 diouf et al 2018 and the quantitative response of fruit quality with water deficit or salinity patanè and cosentino 2010 chen et al 2013 it is still unclear regarding the relationship between fruit quality and salinity under different water regimes wu et al 2022 although reduced irrigation was recognized as a water saving practice the beneficial effects on water use efficiency and fruit quality under salinity had rarely been examined and quantified in this study tomato plants were subjected to different combinations of the three water regimes w0 w1 and w2 during reproductive growth and mature stages and the four soil salinity levels s0 s2 s4 and s6 during the whole growth period we hypothesized that the sensitivity of wue based on yield biomass and leaf and fruit quality parameters to soil salinity is dependent on different water regimes therefore the objectives of this study were i to investigate the interactive effect of reduced irrigation and salinity on yield fruit quality and wue based on yield biomass and leaf and ii to quantify the relationship between wue fruit quality parameters and soil salinity under different water regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was conducted in a solar greenhouse at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university in wuwei city gansu province china e 102 50 n 37 52 altitude 1581 m from march to july in 2020 this region is characterized by a continental temperate arid climate the average annual precipitation is 164 mm and the evaporation is 2000 mm we used an indeterminate tomato variety solanum lycopersicum l cv tribe fenxi 2 which was pink tomato series and for fresh market in this study tomato seeds were cultivated in a nursery seedlings with 3 4 leaves were transported to and grown in approximately 17 litters l plastic pots with a height of 25 cm a diameter of 36 cm at the top and a diameter of 23 5 cm at the bottom resulting in a surface area depth of approximately 10 the pots were filled with soil that was carefully processed and with different salinity levels see below the sandy loamy soil of the tillage layer was collected from the shiyanghe experimental station and then this original soil was air dried and sieved through an 8 mm mesh to remove the large particles and facilitate homogeneity the mean field capacity fc cm 3 cm 3 and dry bulk density of the soil were 0 28 cm3 cm 3 and 1 47 g cm 3 respectively about 0 2 kg of vermiculite was added on the soil surface to reduce soil evaporation and stratification base fertilizer was added according to local fertilization management practices balanced water soluble fertilizer nitrogen phosphorus potassium 20 20 20 was applied to all plants three times during the fruit expansion period flowers on the first three trusses were artificially pollinated using p chlorophenoxy acetic acid solution chen et al 2013 whereas the other trusses were pruned fruit samples for yield and fruit quality were only taken from the pollinated trusses in order to simulate the saline soil of northwest china a salt mixture consisting of nacl mgso4 and caso4 2 2 1 mass mass mass was prepared four salinity levels were imposed by adding 0 g 2 g 4 g and 6 g salt mixture per 1000

watered 30 days after transplanting thereafter the plants were subjected to the three watering regimes based on fc including full irrigation w0 mildly reduced irrigation w1 and severely reduced irrigation w2 w0 treatment was irrigated to 95 fc and w2 and w3 treatments were irrigated to 75 fc and 60 fc during reproductive growth and mature stages according to the water consumption of the previous 1 3 days liu et al 2019 the amount of irrigation is determined by weighing the pots groundwater with an electrical conductivity of saturated extract of 0 62 ds m 1 is used for irrigation

compare linear fit parameters and datasets in the originpro 2022 3 results 3 1 the response of tomato yield biomass wuey and wueb to different combinations of water regime and soil salinity the main effects of water salinity and their interaction on the yield and wuey were significant table 1 compared to s0 the yield was not significantly affected by s2 whilst it was significantly reduced by 60 and 77 by s4 and s6 under w0 resulting in a great decline of 44 and 63 in wuey table 1 an increase in salinity significantly decreased yield by 45 79 under w1 while only severe salinity s6 significantly decreased wuey by 66 table 1 under w2 an increase in salinity significantly decreased yield and wuey by 60 71 and 54 56 compared to w0 the yield was not significantly affected by w1 under the four salinity levels however under w2 yield was significantly reduced by 52 76 and 61 by s0 s2 and s4 table 1 wuey was not significantly affected by w1 or w2 under the four salinity levels except that it was significantly reduced by 64 under w2s2 table 1 the main effects of water and salinity on the dry biomass of stems leaves and fruits and wueb were significant whilst the interactive effect was significant only on fruit biomass fig 3 salinity significantly reduced the above ground biomass and the inhibitory effect was more and more pronounced with increasing salinity under the three water regimes fig 3 compared to s0 wueb was not significantly influenced by s2 under w0 and w1 while it was reduced by 35 and 49 by s4 and s6 under w0 and it was reduced by 46 only by s6 under w1 fig 3d wueb was significantly decreased by 34 41 by salinity under w2 but such decline did not increase with increasing salinity fig 3d above ground biomass was significantly reduced by w2 under s2 and s4 fig 3 wueb was not significantly influenced by w1 or w2 under the four salinity levels except for a significant decline of 49 by w2s2 compared to w0s2 fig 3d 3 2 the response of leaf gas exchange parameters and iwue to different combinations of water regime and soil salinity the main effects of water salinity and their interaction on p n t r g s and iwue were significant fig 4 when plants were subjected to w0 p n t r and g s were not significantly affected under s2 and s4 whilst under s6 they were significantly decreased by 36 54 and 63 respectively resulting in an increase of 75 in iwue under w0s6 due to the greater decline in g s than in p n compared to w0s0 fig 4 when plants were subjected to w1 p n t r and g s decreased by respectively 21 24 and 30 under s2 and decreased by 39 50 and 56 under s4 and decreased by 45 58 and 69 under s6 fig 4a c similarly iwue was increased by 73 under w1s6 compared to w1s0 fig 4d when plants were subjected to w2 p n was decreased by 16 under s2 compared to s0 with a greater decline of 56 and 73 under s4 and s6 fig 4a however gs decreased from s0 to s2 and s4 and then stabilized under s6 fig 4c resulting in a significant decline of 36 in iwue under w2s6 compared to w2s0 fig 4d when plants were subjected to s0 and s2 p n was significantly reduced by 33 and 41 by w2 compared to w0 fig 4a which was lower than the reduction of g s by 53 and 61 fig 4c resulting in a significant increase in iwue of 42 and 51 fig 4d similarly when plants were subjected to s4 iwue was significantly increased by 32 only under w1 compared to w0 fig 4d however when plants were subjected to s6 iwue was not significantly influenced by w1 while a greater reduction of 48 in w2 occurred due to a larger decline of 72 in p n than 48 in gs fig 4 p n decreased linearly with the decrease of g s across all four salinity levels under the three water regimes fig 5a the slope of the regression line between g s and p n represents iwue the results of ancova showed that the regression slope between p n and g s equally to iwue was not significantly influenced between w0 and w1 p 0 05 but significantly increased between w0 and w2 p 0 001 indicating that only severely reduced irrigation increased iwue fig 5a iwue gradually increased linearly with the decrease of g s across four salinity levels under w0 r2 0 95 p 0 001 and w1 r2 0 92 p 0 001 fig 5b the regression slope between g s and iwue was not significantly changed between w0 and w1 p 0 05 indicating that there was a good coordination between iwue to g s under w0 and w1 fig 5b however it was worth noting that there was a quadratic relationship between g s and iwue under w2 r2 0 78 p 0 001 indicating that iwue was first increased then decreased with the decreased g s fig 5b 3 3 the relationship between wue and soil salinity under different water regimes wuey and wueb were negatively correlated with ece regardless of the three water regimes fig 6a b both the regression slope and intercept of wuey and ece were not significantly changed between w0 and w1 p 0 05 fig 6 a whilst the regression slope was significantly decreased between w0 and w2 p 0 01 fig 6a indicating that under w2 the sensitivity of wuey to salinity was decreased similarly the sensitivity of wueb to salinity was not changed under w1 or w2 due to the unchanged regression slope of wueb and ece between w0 and w1 or w2 p 0 05 fig 6b however water supply influenced the relationship between iwue and ece iwue increased linearly with increasing ece under w0 r2 0 67 p 0 001 and w1 r2 0 90 p 0 001 while iwue was first increased then decreased with increasing ece under w2 r2 0 58 p 0 019 fig 6c 3 4 the response of tomato fruit quality parameters to different combinations of water regime and soil salinity significant main effects of water and salinity were found on fruit fresh mass fm transversal diameter td mm longitudinal diameter ld dry matter content dmc water content wc and the proportion of fruit water content to fresh mass wc and significant interaction effects were only found on fm and wc according to two way anova fig 7a c e g there were no significant main effects of water salinity and interaction on fi and fn fig 7 d h specifically when salinity increased fm was significantly decreased by 24 60 under w0 by 47 61 under w1 and by 38 64 under w2 respectively fig 7a these decreases were mainly caused by the decrease of wc which was reduced by increased salinity by 25 62 in w0 by 47 60 in w1 and by 40 66 in w2 fig 7f at a given salinity fm was significantly decreased by w1 and w2 which was mainly induced by the decreased wc not dmc except for w1s2 under w1 however which was mainly attributed to the decreased both of wc and dmc under w2 although w1 and w2 reduced fruit fm regardless of salinity levels the reduction of fruit fm was significantly alleviated by salinity when plants were exposed to w2 fig 7a fi was significantly increased by w2 compared to w0 when plants were subjected to s0 which was related to the reduced fruit td and unchanged ld fig 7b d fn was only significantly increased by w2s0 compared to w0s0 fig 7h significant main effects of water salinity and interaction of water and salinity were found on tssc ta sar tss and ψf according to two way anova fig 8 significant effects of salinity and interaction were observed on asa and a significant interactive effect was observed on lyc fig 8 specifically under s0 s2 and s4 tssc was significantly increased by 35 58 and 20 76 by w1 and w2 compared to w0 whereas under s6 tssc was not significantly influenced by w1 and w2 fig 8 a under s0 and s6 ta was not significantly influenced by w1 and w2 under s2 ta was increased by 32 and 66 by w1 and w2 compared to w0 under s4 ta was only increased by 81 by w2 fig 8b under s0 and s2 sar an important quality trait of fruit flavor was only significantly increased by 73 and 18 by w1 compared to w0 while it was not significantly influenced by reduced irrigation under s4 and s6 fig 8c under s0 asa was increased by 18 by w1 but decreased 26 by w2 under s2 and s4 asa was not changed by reduced irrigation except for an increase of 36 under w2s4 compared to w0s4 it was worth noting that asa was significantly reduced by 27 and 22 by w1 and w2 compared to w0 under s6 fig 8d lyc was only reduced by 44 under w2s6 compared to w0s6 fig 8e under s0 and s2 tss was not significantly influenced by reduced irrigation except for an increase of 17 under w2s2 compared to w0s2 however under s4 and s6 tss was significantly increased by 26 and 22 by w1 and 44 and 21 by w2 compared to w0 fig 8f under s0 and s2 ψf was not significantly influenced by w1 and w2 except for a decrease of 26 under w2s2 compared to w0s2 however under s4 and s6 ψf was significantly decreased by 21 and 23 by w1 and 42 and 22 by w2 compared to w0 fig 8g 3 5 the relationship between tomato fruit quality and soil salinity at different water regimes an analysis of the relationship between tomato fruit quality and soil salinity under three water regimes exhibited a better negative correlation of ece with fm dmc and wc under w0 r2 0 99 p 0 007 r2 0 93 p 0 033 r2 0 99 p 0 006 and w2 r2 0 93 p 0 037 r2 0 94 p 0 031 r2 0 92 p 0 037 fig 9 the regression slope of ece with fm and wc between w0 and w2 was significantly reduced p 0 05 indicating that the sensitivity of fm and wc to salinity was significantly decreased under w2 fig 9a c wc was negatively correlated with ece under the three water regimes and ancova revealed that there was no significant difference in the regression slope p 0 05 fig 9d tssc was positively correlated with ece in w0 r2 0 84 p 0 001 and w2 r2 0 68 p 0 001 fig 10a ece was a positive correlation with ta r2 0 53 p 0 008 in w0 r2 0 63 p 0 002

0 001 in w2 under the three water regimes fig 10b d there was a significant difference in the regression slope of ta tss and ψf with ece only between w0 and w1 p 0 05 fig 10b d indicating an increased sensitivity of ta tss and ψf to salinity under w1 3 6 principal component analysis pca of yield wue and fruit quality a pca was performed on the values for yield water use efficiency and fruit quality parameters the results showed that the first two dimensions pc1 and pc2 accounted for 73 8 of the total variance in different combinations of reduced irrigation and salinity fig 11 pc1 explained 61 8 of the total variation among the indicators and had a positive association with traits of yield wuey wueb and fruit quality of fm ld td dmc wc and wc and negative association with traits of iwue tss

8 27 and 7 40 table s1 the treatments of w0s0 w0s2 and w1s0 were separated from those with high scoring in the pc1 fig 11 table s2 which were related to the greater yield and water use efficiency based on plant while the treatments of w2s4 w2s6 w1s6 and w2s2 were separated from those with a negative high score in the pc1 which were related with the higher fruit flavor quality and water use efficiency based on the leaf fig 11 table s2 similarly the treatments of w1s0 and w2s4 were separated from those with high scoring in the pc2 which were related to greater fruit nutritional quality i e asa and lyc the correlation analysis ca was used to further explore the relationship between ece and yield water use efficiency and fruit quality fig s1 ece was negatively correlated with yield wuey wueb and fruit quality traits of fm ld dmc wc wc and ψf whereas positively correlated with ta and tss fig s1 4 discussion 4 1 the sensitivity of wuey to soil salinity decreased with decreasing water supply we found that both the decreased water supply and the increased salinity reduced the total yield and the biomass of a single tomato plant which was in line with previous findings on tomatoes ors et al 2021 wu et al 2022 as well as other plants khan et al 2015 ors and suarez 2017 khataar et al 2018 hu et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 not surprisingly although the plant water consumption is reduced due to salinity the concomitant greater reduction in yield and biomass results in a linear decrease of wuey and wueb with increasing salinity under three water regimes which is consistent with previous studies in the plant zhang et al 2016 qiu et al 2021 wu et al 2022 however previous studies reported that wuey was first increased and then decreased with increasing salinity in other plants which was possibly due to the high salinity tolerance of plants as observed in spinach ors and suarez 2017 and pepper semiz et al 2014 meanwhile it reminds us one should consider that the water consumption of plants grown in saline soils will be reduced when formulating a reasonable irrigation scheduling to avoid excessive water application and leakage schiattone et al 2017 the interactive effect of multiple stresses may be more detrimental than individual stress although little effect on plant growth and survival when plants are subjected to individual stress zandalinas et al 2021 in this study we found that reduced irrigation and salinity had a synergetic adverse effect on tomato wuey this was verified that the sensitivity of wuey to salinity was decreased under w2 indicating that severely reduced irrigation alleviated the negative impact of salinity on wuey although some previous studies have focused on the interactive effects of reduced irrigation and salinity on plants the results are inconsistent hu et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 wu et al 2022 a study reasoned that the interactive effect was mainly dependent on the range of stress applied and the plant s tolerance to drought and salinity qiu et al 2021 this largely supported the results of the interactive effect of reduced irrigation and salinity on wuey observed in this study due to the relatively wide levels of water and salinity and a moderately salinity tolerant tomato of course it is also related with the significant interaction on yield iwue and partial physiology and quality parameters in this study 4 2 the sensitivity of iwue to soil salinity was dependent on water supply in this study we added vermiculite on the soil surface to reduce soil evaporation and irrigated plants according to the water consumption thus the irrigation amount is approximately equal to plant water use under the same water treatment the amount of irrigation for plants with salt stress is lower than that of plants without salt stress indicating that the saline soil maintains higher water content and the water consumption of plants with salt stress is reduced due to the inhibition of growth we found a high correlation between g s and irrigation amount fig s2 indicating that stomatal regulation is a critical mechanism for water consumption under combined stresses leaf transpiration depends on g s and vpd in this study vpd was the same for all treatments so the differences in water consumption due to transpiration were mainly controlled by g s however the driving factors of stomatal regulation are complex under stress conditions the stress exposed plant may accumulate osmotic regulators and generate chemical growth regulators that induce stomatal closure du et al 2015 gupta et al 2020 a better understanding of the mechanism of stomatal regulation will help clarify the water consumption mechanism of plants under stress conditions and then formulate a reasonable irrigation regime although stomata closure reduces plant water consumption via decreased transpiration the change of carbon assimilation is complex under water deficit and high salinity conditions the inhibition of p n by reduced irrigation and high salinity was collectively attributed to osmotic stress while the salinity specific effect was ion toxicity due to excess salt accumulation munns 2002 chaves et al 2009 2011 p n is always adjusted by g s when plants are exposed to osmotic stress then inducing the change of iwue the response of iwue to reduced irrigation and salinity varies with the intensity and duration of stress zhang et al 2018 xue et al 2021 in this study iwue was not significantly affected by mildly reduced irrigation and salinity which could be attributed to the synergistic changes of g s and p n meanwhile under w0 and w1 iwue of tomatoes grown in severe salinity w0s6 and w1s6 was significantly increased due to the decrease in g s which exceeded the decrease in p n this shows that salinity can improve iwue when adequate water supply or mild water reduction is ensured which is also supported by the finding in this study that iwue was positively linearly related with ece under w0 and w1 a decrease in g s is often accompanied by a decrease in hydraulic conductance of leaves and roots under stress conditions reducing excessive water loss and thus avoiding hydraulic failure caused by increasing xylem tension blackman et al 2009 meinzer et al 2009 henry et al 2019 abdalla et al 2022 meanwhile the decreased water transport capacity also reduces the transport of toxic ions zelm et al 2020 however leaves may experience a loss of cell turgor with increasing severe stress rodríguez et al 2005 sucre and suarez 2011 we found a quadratic relationship between iwue and ece under w2 the main reason was that the regulation of g s tended to be conservative with the increase of reduced irrigation and salinity and the decrease of g s was less than the decrease of p n therefore the regulation of g s on iwue of tomatoes grown in a saline environment was limited by the water supply when there was severely reduced irrigation g s only promoted the increase of iwue of plants grown in a mild salinity environment 4 3 the sensitivity of fruit quality to soil salinity was altered when water supply was limited in this study reduced irrigation and soil salinity reduced the fruit fresh mass the reasons for such reduction were possibly induced by primarily decreased water import and slightly decreased dry matter accumulation as suggested by mitchell et al 1991a b similarly ehret and ho 1986 observed that tomato fruit water accumulation is only less at high salinity while dry matter accumulation is not less which was explained by an increase in the phloem sap concentration and a decrease of its flux ho et al 1987 in addition we did not find the continuous decrease in fruit water content with the increased intent of reduced irrigation at a given salinity although the salinity exacerbated the water stress of the plant induced by the reduced irrigation and further hindered the water uptake of roots munns 2002 plants may readjust the hydraulic distribution of the whole plant harrison day et al 2022 and prioritize the water supply to the fruit as a protective mechanism for reproduction under multiple severe stresses this mechanism is also of importance for herbaceous annual plants to receive greater hydraulic investment for successful seed production in changing climates harrison day et al 2022 hence it is interesting focusing on fruit water transport to understand fruit growth and quality formation under combined stresses as shown in the analysis of the relationship between fruit quality and salinity under different water regimes we only found that tssc ta and tss increased ψf decreased linearly with the increase of salinity these results are generally consistent with those reported previously under reduced irrigation regimes alone or combined water regimes and salinity ozbahce and tari 2010 chen et al 2013 zhou et al 2020 wu et al 2022 as an important indicator representing comprehensive fruit quality tss has mainly characterized the proportion of dissolved solids in the solution and is mainly composed of tssc and ta hou et al 2020 in addition to leaf osmotic adjustment fruit osmotic adjustment is crucial for fruit water balance and solute metabolism when plants are exposed to stress conditions in this study the decreased ψf with increased salinity indicates that fruit osmotic adjustment is gradually enhancing to allow continued growth under low water potential in the leaf and root hou et al 2020 the only significant regression slope of ψf with ece between w0 and w1 reveals that at a certain salinity level w1 increases fruit osmotic adjustment while w2 could not increase it possibly due to a limited osmotic adjustment capacity in this study it is worth noting that the sensitivity of tss and ta to soil salinity is significantly increased when the water supply is limited indicating that a significant transition has possibly occurred for the mechanism of the change in fruit quality which may be related with the intensity of stress and plant genotypes albert et al 2016 diouf et al 2018 however the sensitivity of fm and wc to salinity is decreased with limited water availability the loss of fresh mass of smaller fruits was less sensitive than larger fruits to the reduced water supply albert et al 2016 due to the lower osmotic potential and water potentials of smaller fruits which allowed smaller fruits to compete more effectively for water under a limited water supply hou et al 2020 another study demonstrated that smaller fruits were less sensitive to salinity than larger fruits caro et al 1991 these may support the findings in this study that when tomato fruit size is reduced due to reduced irrigation or high salinity applying additional stress may reduce fruit susceptibility therefore it is necessary to consider a reasonable water regime in the practice management of tomatoes grown in saline soil regions to ensure high quality tomato production 5 conclusion in this study the results explicitly demonstrate that the interactive effects of reduced irrigation and salinity on the yield and fruit biomass wuey and iwue as well as leaf gas exchange and fruit quality parameters are significant we found that both wuey and wueb decreased linearly with salinity regardless of water regimes due to the concomitant greater reduction in yield and biomass than water consumption however w2 alleviated the decrease of wuey to salinity iwue was increased linearly with increased salinity by stomatal regulation with a smaller decrease in p n than g s under w0 and w1 whereas it was first increased and then decreased with increased salinity under w2 indicating that a highly salinity induced iwue was dependent on water supply in addition although fruit fm dmc and wc were negatively correlated with salinity under w0 and w2 ta and tss were positively correlated with salinity under three water regimes the sensitivity of ta and tss to salinity was increased while the sensitivity of fm and wc to salinity was decreased under the limited water available our results highlight the importance of an appropriate water management strategy to integrate water use efficiency and fruit quality in the production of tomatoes in areas facing limited water supply and or increased soil salinization however the effects of water and salt stress on the physiological mechanisms of tomato plants and fruits are complex further studies could focus on analyzing fruit response to stress from the perspective of fruit water transport due to the high sensitivity of water accumulation

9140,reduced irrigation and high soil salinity are widely recognized to decrease tomato yield but they can improve fruit quality and water use efficiency wue when imposed appropriately however the response of plant to their interaction is still unclear and the quantitative relationship of wue and fruit quality with salinity under different water regimes is also lacking this study investigated the responses of tomatoes in terms of yield fruit quality and wue based on yield wuey biomass wueb and leaf iwue to twelve treatments consisting of combinations of three water regimes relative to the field capacity fc w0 w1 and w2 refer to 95 fc 75 fc and 60 fc respectively and four soil salinity levels 0 g 2 g 4 g and 6 g salt mixtures added to 1000 g air dried soil respectively results showed that wuey and wueb had a negative correlation with salinity under different water regimes salinity resulted in a greater reduction in yield and biomass than water consumption compared to the control treatment therefore lower water consumption of plants under w2 treatment alleviated the decrease of wuey induced by salinity to a certain extent from the leaf scale iwue was positively and linearly related with salinity indicating that stomatal regulation was more prone to reduced stomatal conductance than the net photosynthetic rate under w0 and w1 whilst it showed a quadratic relationship under w2 the results supported that a highly salinity induced iwue was dependent on water supply in addition although salinity had a negative correlation with fruit fresh mass fm dry matter content and water content wc under w0 and w1 fruit titratable acidity ta and total soluble solids tss were proportional to salinity regardless of water regimes the results also showed that w1 increased the sensitivity of ta and tss to salinity but w2 resulted in weak sensitivity of fm and wc to salinity thus we deduced that mildly reduced irrigation was an appropriate strategy to regulate iwue and fruit quality under high salinity conditions this study provides a water regime management basis for comprehensive changes in yield wue and fruit quality of tomatoes grown in saline soils abbreviations fc

data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction many environmental stresses such as drought high salinity flooding and extreme temperatures adversely affect plant growth development and reproduction suzuki et al 2014 cohen et al 2021 zhao et al 2020 although numerous studies have focused on the responses of plants to individual environmental stress plants often face combinations of different environmental stresses in both natural and agricultural systems mittler 2006 zhang and sonnewald 2017 zandalinas et al 2021 abdalla et al 2022 soil drought and secondary salinization frequently co occur in northwest china where saline groundwater is heavily used for irrigated agriculture causing an extremely high rate of salt accumulation on the soil surface cramer et al 2011 qiu et al 2021 wu et al 2022 simultaneously these regions have a well developed solar greenhouse industry due to rich light and heat resources chen et al 2013 qiu et al 2013 the tomato solanum lycopersicum is one of the most widely produced vegetables in a greenhouse in northwest china chen et al 2013 qiu et al 2013 a better understanding of the response of plant growth water use and fruit quality under combined stresses is contributing to providing water management strategies for vegetable crop production in these saline regions the response of the plant to combined reduced irrigation and salinity is more complex than individual stress glenn et al 2012 álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 although individual stress may have little effect on plant growth and survival the combination of multiple stresses can be detrimental to plants suzuki et al 2014 zandalinas et al 2021 generally combined reduced irrigation and salinity has greater synergistic negative effects on plants than individual stress manuchehri and salehi 2014 ors et al 2021 for instance the recovery ability of leaf water status and photosynthesis under combined stresses is greatly reduced after the stress is relieved pérez pérez et al 2007 plant growth decreases excessively under combined stresses due to the dehydration of leaf tissue and the high accumulation of cl and na in leaves álvarez and sánchez blanco 2015 sahin et al 2018 conversely several studies reported that the drought tolerance of plants was improved when plants were exposed to combined stresses which may involve a protective effect of salinity on biomass production glenn et al 2012 in terms of increased water and carbon balance and enhanced osmotic adjustment martínez et al 2003 2005 sucre and suarez 2011 munns et al 2020 these conflicting results indicate that the different effects of combined stresses may be dependent on plant genotype species and or timing and intensity of individual stress suzuki et al 2014 it is therefore necessary to investigate the response of plants to combined reduced irrigation and salinity which allows breeders to select plants tolerant to the combined stresses suzuki et al 2014 zhou et al 2017 reduced irrigation lowers soil water potential and salinity decreases soil osmotic potential due to the massive accumulation of ions resulting in limited water availability for plants munns 2002 munns and tester 2008 abdalla et al 2022 the water transport capacity of the plant was decreased due to the increase of xylem hydraulic resistance of root stem and leaves under combined stresses stiller 2009 abdalla et al 2022 stomatal regulation is a crucial strategy for plant water use under combined reduced irrigation and salinity a study reported that the stomatal conductance g s was regulated by abscisic acid aba under well watered condition and salt stress but coordinated by aba and leaf water potential under combined stresses in tomatoes xue et al 2021 furthermore reduced g s results in reduced transpiration but carbohydrate synthesis may also be maintained or reduced under combined stresses which may cause an increase in water use efficiency based on the leaf iwue xue et al 2021 liao et al 2022 in addition many studies have reported that reduced irrigation can improve water use efficiency based on yield wuey and biomass wueb by maintaining yield or biomass with less water consumption du et al 2015 gupta et al 2020 kang et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 found that wueb of alfalfa was linearly decreased with increased soil salt content due to a greater decrease in the dry matter than water consumption ors and suarez 2017 suggested wuey of spinach was first increased and then decreased with increased salinity indicating that applying moderately saline water not only increased yield but also saved water however there are few studies focused on the quantitative relationship of wuey wueb and iwue of tomato plants with salinity under different water regimes the formation of tomato fruit quality is involved with water and carbon accumulation together guichard et al 2001 fruit water content accounts for more than 90 of the fruit fresh mass and is crucial for tomato size and fruit quality ho et al 1987 and is determined by the flux of xylem and phloem and fruit transpiration guichard et al 2001 although reduced irrigation may disrupt the normal growth of tomatoes it can promote the preferentially supply of water to vital reproductive organs through readjusting the hydraulic distribution kang et al 2021 harrison day et al 2022 however fruit dry matter content e g carbohydrates organic acids lipids and minerals is transported only via phloem flux hou et al 2020 many studies have demonstrated that xylem transport is sensitive to changes in plant water status whereas phloem transport is relatively insensitive van ieperen et al 2003 guichard et al 2005 hou et al 2020 thus it is susceptible to causing an improvement in fruit quality in terms of sugar and acid concentration under stress conditions due to the decreased water accumulation hou et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 although there are many studies focusing on the physiological response of tomato fruit quality under reduced irrigation or salinity stress plaut et al 2004 ripoll et al 2016 diouf et al 2018 and the quantitative response of fruit quality with water deficit or salinity patanè and cosentino 2010 chen et al 2013 it is still unclear regarding the relationship between fruit quality and salinity under different water regimes wu et al 2022 although reduced irrigation was recognized as a water saving practice the beneficial effects on water use efficiency and fruit quality under salinity had rarely been examined and quantified in this study tomato plants were subjected to different combinations of the three water regimes w0 w1 and w2 during reproductive growth and mature stages and the four soil salinity levels s0 s2 s4 and s6 during the whole growth period we hypothesized that the sensitivity of wue based on yield biomass and leaf and fruit quality parameters to soil salinity is dependent on different water regimes therefore the objectives of this study were i to investigate the interactive effect of reduced irrigation and salinity on yield fruit quality and wue based on yield biomass and leaf and ii to quantify the relationship between wue fruit quality parameters and soil salinity under different water regimes 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental design the experiment was conducted in a solar greenhouse at the shiyanghe experimental station of china agricultural university in wuwei city gansu province china e 102 50 n 37 52 altitude 1581 m from march to july in 2020 this region is characterized by a continental temperate arid climate the average annual precipitation is 164 mm and the evaporation is 2000 mm we used an indeterminate tomato variety solanum lycopersicum l cv tribe fenxi 2 which was pink tomato series and for fresh market in this study tomato seeds were cultivated in a nursery seedlings with 3 4 leaves were transported to and grown in approximately 17 litters l plastic pots with a height of 25 cm a diameter of 36 cm at the top and a diameter of 23 5 cm at the bottom resulting in a surface area depth of approximately 10 the pots were filled with soil that was carefully processed and with different salinity levels see below the sandy loamy soil of the tillage layer was collected from the shiyanghe experimental station and then this original soil was air dried and sieved through an 8 mm mesh to remove the large particles and facilitate homogeneity the mean field capacity fc cm 3 cm 3 and dry bulk density of the soil were 0 28 cm3 cm 3 and 1 47 g cm 3 respectively about 0 2 kg of vermiculite was added on the soil surface to reduce soil evaporation and stratification base fertilizer was added according to local fertilization management practices balanced water soluble fertilizer nitrogen phosphorus potassium 20 20 20 was applied to all plants three times during the fruit expansion period flowers on the first three trusses were artificially pollinated using p chlorophenoxy acetic acid solution chen et al 2013 whereas the other trusses were pruned fruit samples for yield and fruit quality were only taken from the pollinated trusses in order to simulate the saline soil of northwest china a salt mixture consisting of nacl mgso4 and caso4 2 2 1 mass mass mass was prepared four salinity levels were imposed by adding 0 g 2 g 4 g and 6 g salt mixture per 1000

watered 30 days after transplanting thereafter the plants were subjected to the three watering regimes based on fc including full irrigation w0 mildly reduced irrigation w1 and severely reduced irrigation w2 w0 treatment was irrigated to 95 fc and w2 and w3 treatments were irrigated to 75 fc and 60 fc during reproductive growth and mature stages according to the water consumption of the previous 1 3 days liu et al 2019 the amount of irrigation is determined by weighing the pots groundwater with an electrical conductivity of saturated extract of 0 62 ds m 1 is used for irrigation through a drip system according to the local management practice the site of the experimental station and a schematic diagram of the experiment in the solar greenhouse were shown in fig 1 a randomized

compare linear fit parameters and datasets in the originpro 2022 3 results 3 1 the response of tomato yield biomass wuey and wueb to different combinations of water regime and soil salinity the main effects of water salinity and their interaction on the yield and wuey were significant table 1 compared to s0 the yield was not significantly affected by s2 whilst it was significantly reduced by 60 and 77 by s4 and s6 under w0 resulting in a great decline of 44 and 63 in wuey table 1 an increase in salinity significantly decreased yield by 45 79 under w1 while only severe salinity s6 significantly decreased wuey by 66 table 1 under w2 an increase in salinity significantly decreased yield and wuey by 60 71 and 54 56 compared to w0 the yield was not significantly affected by w1 under the four salinity levels however under w2 yield was significantly reduced by 52 76 and 61 by s0 s2 and s4 table 1 wuey was not significantly affected by w1 or w2 under the four salinity levels except that it was significantly reduced by 64 under w2s2 table 1 the main effects of water and salinity on the dry biomass of stems leaves and fruits and wueb were significant whilst the interactive effect was significant only on fruit biomass fig 3 salinity significantly reduced the above ground biomass and the inhibitory effect was more and more pronounced with increasing salinity under the three water regimes fig 3 compared to s0 wueb was not significantly influenced by s2 under w0 and w1 while it was reduced by 35 and 49 by s4 and s6 under w0 and it was reduced by 46 only by s6 under w1 fig 3d wueb was significantly decreased by 34 41 by salinity under w2 but such decline did not increase with increasing salinity fig 3d above ground biomass was significantly reduced by w2 under s2 and s4 fig 3 wueb was not significantly influenced by w1 or w2 under the four salinity levels except for a significant decline of 49 by w2s2 compared to w0s2 fig 3d 3 2 the response of leaf gas exchange parameters and iwue to different combinations of water regime and soil salinity the main effects of water salinity and their interaction on p n t r g s and iwue were significant fig 4 when plants were subjected to w0 p n t r and g s were not significantly affected under s2 and s4 whilst under s6 they were significantly decreased by 36 54 and 63 respectively resulting in an increase of 75 in iwue under w0s6 due to the greater decline in g s than in p n compared to w0s0 fig 4 when plants were subjected to w1 p n t r and g s decreased by respectively 21 24 and 30 under s2 and decreased by 39 50 and 56 under s4 and decreased by 45 58 and 69 under s6 fig 4a c similarly iwue was increased by 73 under w1s6 compared to w1s0 fig 4d when plants were subjected to w2 p n was decreased by 16 under s2 compared to s0 with a greater decline of 56 and 73 under s4 and s6 fig 4a however gs decreased from s0 to s2 and s4 and then stabilized under s6 fig 4c resulting in a significant decline of 36 in iwue under w2s6 compared to w2s0 fig 4d when plants were subjected to s0 and s2 p n was significantly reduced by 33 and 41 by w2 compared to w0 fig 4a which was lower than the reduction of g s by 53 and 61 fig 4c resulting in a significant increase in iwue of 42 and 51 fig 4d similarly when plants were subjected to s4 iwue was significantly increased by 32 only under w1 compared to w0 fig 4d however when plants were subjected to s6 iwue was not significantly influenced by w1 while a greater reduction of 48 in w2 occurred due to a larger decline of 72 in p n than 48 in gs fig 4 p n decreased linearly with the decrease of g s across all four salinity levels under the three water regimes fig 5a the slope of the regression line between g s and p n represents iwue the results of ancova showed that the regression slope between p n and g s equally to iwue was not significantly influenced between w0 and w1 p 0 05 but significantly increased between w0 and w2 p 0 001 indicating that only severely reduced irrigation increased iwue fig 5a iwue gradually increased linearly with the decrease of g s across four salinity levels under w0 r2 0 95 p 0 001 and w1 r2 0 92 p 0 001 fig 5b the regression slope between g s and iwue was not significantly changed between w0 and w1 p 0 05 indicating that there was a good coordination between iwue to g s under w0 and w1 fig 5b however it was worth noting that there was a quadratic relationship between g s and iwue under w2 r2 0 78 p 0 001 indicating that iwue was first increased then decreased with the decreased g s fig 5b 3 3 the relationship between wue and soil salinity under different water regimes wuey and wueb were negatively correlated with ece regardless of the three water regimes fig 6a b both the regression slope and intercept of wuey and ece were not significantly changed between w0 and w1 p 0 05 fig 6 a whilst the regression slope was significantly decreased between w0 and w2 p 0 01 fig 6a indicating that under w2 the sensitivity of wuey to salinity was decreased similarly the sensitivity of wueb to salinity was not changed under w1 or w2 due to the unchanged regression slope of wueb and ece between w0 and w1 or w2 p 0 05 fig 6b however water supply influenced the relationship between iwue and ece iwue increased linearly with increasing ece under w0 r2 0 67 p 0 001 and w1 r2 0 90 p 0 001 while iwue was first increased then decreased with increasing ece under w2 r2 0 58 p 0 019 fig 6c 3 4 the response of tomato fruit quality parameters to different combinations of water regime and soil salinity significant main effects of water and salinity were found on fruit fresh mass fm transversal diameter td mm longitudinal diameter ld dry matter content dmc water content wc and the proportion of fruit water content to fresh mass wc and significant interaction effects were only found on fm and wc according to two way anova fig 7a c e g there were no significant main effects of water salinity and interaction on fi and fn fig 7 d h specifically when salinity increased fm was significantly decreased by 24 60 under w0 by 47 61 under w1 and by 38 64 under w2 respectively fig 7a these decreases were mainly caused by the decrease of wc which was reduced by increased salinity by 25 62 in w0 by 47 60 in w1 and by 40 66 in w2 fig 7f at a given salinity fm was significantly decreased by w1 and w2 which was mainly induced by the decreased wc not dmc except for w1s2 under w1 however which was mainly attributed to the decreased both of wc and dmc under w2 although w1 and w2 reduced fruit fm regardless of salinity levels the reduction of fruit fm was significantly alleviated by salinity when plants were exposed to w2 fig 7a fi was significantly increased by w2 compared to w0 when plants were subjected to s0 which was related to the reduced fruit td and unchanged ld fig 7b d fn was only significantly increased by w2s0 compared to w0s0 fig 7h significant main effects of water

significant interactive effect was observed on lyc fig 8 specifically under s0 s2 and s4 tssc was significantly increased by 35 58 and 20 76 by w1 and w2 compared to w0 whereas under s6 tssc was not significantly influenced by w1 and w2 fig 8 a under s0 and s6 ta was not significantly influenced by w1 and w2 under s2 ta was increased by 32 and 66 by w1 and w2 compared to w0 under s4 ta was only increased by 81 by w2 fig 8b under s0 and s2 sar an important quality trait of fruit flavor was only significantly increased by 73 and 18 by w1 compared to w0 while it was not significantly influenced

under s0 and s2 tss was not significantly influenced by reduced irrigation except for an increase of 17 under w2s2 compared to w0s2 however under s4 and s6 tss was significantly increased by 26 and 22 by w1 and 44 and 21 by w2 compared to w0 fig 8f under s0 and s2 ψf was not significantly influenced by w1 and w2 except for a decrease of 26 under w2s2 compared to w0s2 however under s4 and s6 ψf was significantly decreased by 21 and 23 by w1 and 42 and 22 by w2 compared to w0 fig 8g 3 5 the relationship between tomato fruit quality and soil salinity at different water regimes an analysis of the

sensitivity of ta tss and ψf to salinity under w1 3 6 principal component analysis pca of yield wue and fruit quality a pca was performed on the values for yield water use efficiency and fruit quality parameters the results showed that the first two dimensions pc1 and pc2 accounted for 73 8 of the total variance in different combinations of reduced irrigation and salinity fig 11 pc1 explained 61 8

based on plant while the treatments of w2s4 w2s6 w1s6 and w2s2 were separated from those with a negative high score in the pc1 which were related with the higher fruit flavor quality and water use efficiency based on the leaf fig 11 table s2 similarly the treatments of w1s0 and w2s4 were separated from those with high scoring in the pc2 which were related to greater fruit nutritional quality i e asa and lyc the correlation analysis ca was used to further explore the relationship between ece and yield water use efficiency and fruit quality fig s1 ece was negatively correlated with yield wuey wueb and fruit quality traits of fm ld dmc wc wc and ψf whereas positively correlated with ta and tss fig s1 4 discussion 4 1 the sensitivity of wuey to soil salinity decreased with decreasing water supply we found that both the decreased water supply and the increased salinity reduced the total yield and the biomass of a single tomato plant which was in line with previous findings on tomatoes ors et al 2021 wu et al 2022 as well as other plants khan et al 2015 ors and suarez 2017 khataar et al 2018 hu et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 not surprisingly although the plant water consumption is reduced due to salinity the concomitant greater reduction in yield and biomass results in a linear decrease of wuey and wueb with increasing salinity under three water regimes which is consistent with previous studies in the plant zhang et al 2016 qiu et al 2021 wu et al 2022 however previous studies reported that wuey was first increased and then decreased with increasing salinity in other plants which was possibly due to the high salinity tolerance of plants as observed in spinach ors and suarez 2017 and pepper semiz et al 2014 meanwhile it reminds us one should consider that the water consumption of plants grown in saline soils will be reduced when formulating a reasonable irrigation scheduling to avoid excessive water application and leakage schiattone et al 2017 the interactive effect of multiple stresses may be more detrimental than individual stress although little effect on plant growth and survival when plants are subjected to individual stress zandalinas et al 2021 in this study we found that reduced irrigation and salinity had a synergetic adverse effect on tomato wuey this was verified that the sensitivity of wuey to salinity was decreased under w2 indicating that severely reduced irrigation alleviated the negative impact of salinity on wuey although some previous studies have focused on the interactive effects of reduced irrigation and salinity on plants the results are inconsistent hu et al 2021 qiu et al 2021 wu et al 2022 a study reasoned that the interactive effect was mainly dependent on the range of stress applied and the plant s tolerance to drought and salinity qiu et al 2021 this largely supported the results of the interactive effect of reduced irrigation and salinity on wuey observed in this study due to the relatively wide levels of water and salinity and a moderately salinity tolerant tomato of course it is also related with the significant interaction on yield iwue and partial physiology and quality parameters in this study 4 2 the sensitivity of iwue to soil salinity was dependent on water supply in this study we added vermiculite on the soil surface to reduce soil evaporation and irrigated plants according to the water consumption thus the irrigation amount is approximately equal to plant water use under the same water treatment the amount of irrigation for plants with salt stress is lower than that of plants without salt stress indicating that the saline soil maintains higher water content and the water consumption of plants with salt stress is reduced due to the inhibition of growth we found a high correlation between g s and irrigation amount fig s2 indicating that stomatal regulation is a critical mechanism for water consumption under combined stresses leaf transpiration depends on g s and vpd in this study vpd was the same for all treatments so the differences in water consumption due to transpiration were mainly controlled by g s however the driving factors of stomatal regulation are complex under stress conditions the stress exposed plant may accumulate osmotic regulators and generate chemical growth regulators that induce stomatal closure du et al 2015 gupta et al 2020 a better understanding of the mechanism of stomatal regulation will help clarify the water consumption mechanism of plants under stress conditions and then formulate a reasonable irrigation regime although stomata closure reduces plant water consumption via decreased transpiration the change of carbon assimilation is complex under water deficit and high salinity conditions the inhibition of p n by reduced irrigation and high salinity was collectively attributed to osmotic stress while the salinity specific effect was ion toxicity due to excess salt accumulation munns 2002 chaves et al 2009 2011 p n is always adjusted by g s when plants are exposed to osmotic stress then inducing the change of iwue the response of iwue to reduced irrigation and salinity varies with the intensity and duration of stress zhang et al 2018 xue et al 2021 in this study iwue was not significantly affected by mildly reduced irrigation and salinity which could be attributed to the synergistic changes of g s and p n meanwhile under w0 and w1 iwue of tomatoes grown in severe salinity w0s6 and w1s6 was significantly increased due to the decrease in g s which exceeded the decrease in p n this shows that salinity can improve iwue when adequate water supply or mild water reduction is ensured which is also supported by the finding in this study that iwue was positively linearly related with ece under w0 and w1 a decrease in g s is often accompanied by a decrease in hydraulic conductance of leaves and roots under stress conditions reducing excessive water loss and thus avoiding hydraulic failure caused by increasing xylem tension blackman et al 2009 meinzer et al 2009 henry et al 2019 abdalla et al 2022 meanwhile the decreased water transport capacity also reduces the transport of toxic ions zelm et al 2020 however leaves may experience a loss of cell turgor with increasing severe stress rodríguez et al 2005 sucre and suarez 2011 we found a quadratic relationship between iwue and ece under w2 the main reason was that the regulation of g s tended to be conservative with the increase of reduced irrigation and salinity and the decrease of g s was less than the decrease of p n therefore the regulation of g s on iwue of tomatoes grown in a saline environment was limited by the water supply when there was severely reduced irrigation g s only promoted the increase of iwue of plants grown in a mild salinity environment 4 3 the sensitivity of fruit quality to soil salinity was altered when water supply was limited in this study reduced irrigation and soil salinity reduced the fruit fresh mass the reasons for such reduction were possibly induced by primarily decreased water import and slightly decreased dry matter accumulation as suggested by mitchell et al 1991a b similarly ehret and ho 1986 observed that tomato fruit water accumulation is only less at high salinity while dry matter accumulation is not less which was explained by an increase in the phloem sap concentration and a decrease of its flux ho et al 1987 in addition we did not find the continuous decrease in fruit water content with the increased intent of reduced irrigation at a given salinity although the salinity exacerbated the water stress of the plant induced by the reduced irrigation and further hindered the water uptake of roots munns 2002 plants may readjust the hydraulic distribution of the whole plant harrison day et al 2022 and prioritize the water supply to the fruit as a protective mechanism for reproduction under multiple severe stresses this mechanism is also of importance for herbaceous annual plants to receive greater hydraulic investment for successful seed production in changing climates harrison day et al 2022 hence it is interesting focusing on fruit water transport to understand fruit growth and quality formation under combined stresses as shown in the analysis of the relationship between fruit quality and salinity under different water regimes we only found that tssc ta and tss increased ψf decreased linearly with the increase of salinity these results are generally consistent with those reported previously under reduced irrigation regimes alone or combined water regimes and salinity ozbahce and tari 2010 chen et al 2013 zhou et al 2020 wu et al 2022 as an important indicator representing comprehensive fruit quality tss has mainly characterized the proportion of dissolved solids in the solution and is mainly composed of tssc and ta hou et al 2020 in addition to leaf osmotic adjustment fruit osmotic adjustment is crucial for fruit water balance and solute metabolism when plants are exposed to stress conditions in this study the decreased ψf with increased salinity indicates that fruit osmotic adjustment is gradually enhancing to allow continued growth under low water potential in the leaf and root hou et al 2020 the only significant regression slope of ψf with ece between w0 and w1 reveals that at a certain salinity level w1 increases fruit osmotic adjustment while w2 could not increase it possibly due to a limited osmotic adjustment capacity in this study it is worth noting that the sensitivity of tss and ta to soil salinity is significantly increased when the water supply is limited indicating that a significant transition has possibly occurred for the mechanism of the change in fruit quality which may be related with the intensity of stress and plant genotypes albert et al 2016 diouf et al 2018 however the sensitivity of fm and wc to salinity is decreased with limited water availability the loss of fresh mass of smaller fruits was less sensitive than larger fruits to the reduced water supply albert et al 2016 due to the lower osmotic potential and water potentials of smaller fruits which allowed smaller fruits to compete more effectively for water under a limited water supply hou et al 2020 another study demonstrated that smaller fruits were less sensitive to salinity than larger fruits caro et al 1991 these may support the findings in this study that when tomato fruit size is reduced due to reduced irrigation or high salinity applying additional stress may reduce fruit susceptibility therefore it is necessary to consider a reasonable water regime in the practice management of tomatoes grown in saline soil regions to ensure high quality tomato production 5 conclusion in this study the results explicitly demonstrate that the interactive effects of reduced irrigation and salinity on the yield and fruit biomass wuey and iwue as well as leaf gas exchange and fruit quality parameters are significant we found that both wuey and wueb decreased linearly with salinity regardless of water regimes due to the concomitant greater reduction in yield and biomass than water consumption however w2 alleviated the decrease of wuey to salinity iwue was increased linearly with increased salinity by stomatal regulation with a smaller decrease in p n than g s under w0 and w1 whereas it was first increased and then decreased with increased salinity under w2 indicating that a highly salinity induced iwue was dependent on water supply in addition although fruit fm dmc and wc were negatively correlated with salinity under w0 and w2 ta and tss were positively correlated with salinity under three water regimes the sensitivity of ta and tss to salinity was increased while the sensitivity of fm and wc to salinity was decreased under the limited water available our results highlight the importance of an appropriate water management strategy to integrate water use efficiency and fruit quality in the production of tomatoes in areas facing limited water supply and or increased soil salinization however the effects of water and salt stress on the physiological mechanisms of tomato plants and fruits are complex further studies could focus on analyzing fruit response to stress from the perspective of fruit water transport due to the high sensitivity of water accumulation

9141,concerns about sustainability climate change and increasing inter sectoral competition for water and land are pressing societies to set a new course in economic development agriculture water distribution and the environment although changes in societal priorities are an important driver of agricultural water management reform the extent of reform is constrained by social and biophysical limits existing frameworks offer limited insight how reforms in agricultural water management accommodate shifted societal priorities and how these reforms might unfold across policy domains farming practices and land and water resources in this paper we define the concept of reorientation as a shift in broader societal priorities that drives reform of agricultural water management we discuss 21 reorientation examples around the world the examples reveal much diversity in the starting point of a reorientation the degree to which a reorientation has unfolded the role of governments and the scales involved in a reorientation we end the paper with a call for analytical frameworks and empirical studies to generate insights how societies reform their agricultural water management towards ambitious sustainable production and consumption modes keywords new societal priorities reform in agricultural water management social and biophysical limits reorientation concept transition literature review data availability supplementary file contains data belonging to manuscript 1 introduction agricultural water management encompasses all activities related to the storage distribution consumption and drainage of water for crop production fisheries and livestock due to all these activities a range of agricultural water management systems exist these use different water resources rainwater surface water groundwater and soil water in the rootzone of varying qualities molden 2007 agriculture has a tremendous influence on water worldwide it accounts for 72 of all water withdrawals and contributes an estimated 56 of total polluted effluent fao 2021 in the past agricultural water management was often adjusted to accommodate growth priorities e g more food for growing populations which resulted in increases in agricultural production and water use molden 2007 bjornlund and bjornlund 2019 nowadays many societies are pressed to set a new course for agricultural water management reflecting new broader societal priorities and environmental conditions expanding urban centres have brought increased competition for water which has to be redistributed between urban industrial agricultural and environmental uses venot et al 2008 climate change too is influencing water availability and agricultural options iglesias and garotte 2015 to stimulate economic growth in this context agricultural priorities may be shifted from staple cereals to other commodities for export markets which usually requires changes in agricultural water management marul et al 2018 or in response to environmental degradation new environmental priorities may be set to improve the quantity and quality of groundwater and surface water affecting farmers land and water management practices richter et al 2017 cassman and grassini 2020 demand for more equitable and just water use may also require changes in water distribution zwarteveen and boelens 2014 all in all shifting societal priorities have a bearing on water use and thus become an important driver of agricultural water management reform due to the pivotal role of agriculture in water use and water quality long term decision making and strategic planning by governments are important vehicles for agricultural water management reform banihabib et al 2017 seijger et al 2019 these may emerge either in the wake of disasters e g the protective irrigation schemes built in pakistan after droughts to allow more efficient use of very limited water or they may arise in a planned anticipatory manner to steer away from unprofitable and environmental harmful practices e g india s attempts to change the flow of the ganges from polluted and sluggish to clean and continuous why is it relevant to investigate whether reforms in agricultural water management accommodate new societal priorities effectively altering agricultural water management is far from easy as there are limits to how much and how fast agricultural water management can change some limits have a social origin for instance political struggles and contestations to new water strategies and farming practices at multiple levels affect reform in agricultural water management zwarteveen et al 2017 other limits have a biophysical origin in closing and closed river basins renewable water resources are fully consumed for part or all of the year meaning there is no extra water to meet additional demands molle et al 2010 crop transpiration is the largest agricultural water consumer yet its efficiency is largely fixed by crop determined photosynthetic pathways meaning that it cannot be easily reduced steduto et al 2007 in addition it may take many years before changes in agricultural water management are observable in slowly changing biophysical processes of groundwater recharge soil and water quality ward et al 2019 not only is altering agricultural water management for new societal priorities challenging so too is the study of this phenomenon as we will argue existing analytical frameworks provide insufficient insight into the degree that agricultural water management reform unfolds across policy domains farming endeavors and water systems the aim of this paper therefore is to introduce the novel concept of reorientation and examine reorientation examples in different parts of the world to provide a better understanding of the extent agricultural water management is altered to accommodate new societal priorities 2 frameworks for evaluation of reorientation of societal priorities various research fields offer relevant frameworks to study a reorientation of societal priorities and reform in agricultural water management what follows is a selective 1 1 included were analytical frameworks or theories to explain change in the domains of agriculture water and environment in general situated in the realm of policy planning or management overview of frameworks from the environmental social and agricultural sciences the field of environmental governance for example offers analytical frameworks that centre on scales actors and management of natural resources participation and regulation bridge and perreault 2009 akhmouch and correia 2016 although strategy and strategic planning are concepts only recently addressed van assche et al 2020 in ecology and society a systems understanding prevails for the study of the complex nature of socio ecological systems with key concepts being regime shifts thresholds tipping points and feedback loops preiser et al 2018 subsystems analysed in this field are resource systems resource units governance systems and users ostrom 2009 whereas ostrom s framework is useful for analysing outcomes of the socio ecological system it largely refrains from adopting a strategic planning perspective for a notable exception see wilkinson 2012 in the field of sustainability transitions the focus is on fundamental changes in the technology and institutions for provision of water food energy and transport frameworks emphasize innovations and multilevel interactions between niche players and incumbents markard et al 2012 though without considering strategies in any central manner the field of strategic spatial planning offers frameworks with a focus on key features of a strategic plan strategies and implementation pathways albrechts 2015 bafarasat 2015 largely absent however is a holistic perspective from strategic plan to implementation and impacts on natural resources or on the transition from one set of priorities to another whereas strategic planning has been criticized for a lack of substance and remaining too far removed from on the ground realities wilkinson 2012 water and agricultural sociologists focus on hydro agricultural environments the political economy field offers frameworks for the study of agrarian change with emphasis on activities and outcomes for the different classes bernstein 2010 in the political sociology of water resources management water policy reforms are central mollinga 2008 with strategic planning often interpreted as a bureaucratic exercise in drawing up ambitious master plans and trying to get them implemented molle et al 2009 benedikter 2013 frameworks in the field of agronomy outline on field practices that farmers can apply in relation to different degrees of resource circulation as part of local global production chains therond et al 2017 or they cover incentives for adoption of a more sustainable production mode piñeiro et al 2020 yet the shift from one strategy to another is bypassed or remains a socio historical reconstruction of broadly applicable phases bjornlund and bjornlund 2019 in river basin planning and integrated water management frameworks are positioned within one often implicit set of priorities with integration serving a particular purpose such as water resource use or water quality hofwegen and jaspers 1999 loucks and beek 2017 these frameworks furthermore neglect underlying questions of how societies might reorient from one set of priorities to another and subsequent influences on land and water resources in agricultural water management a range of options may be considered from rainfed to fully irrigated agriculture frameworks in this domain focus on embedment of agricultural water management in a social political technological and resource context serving a particular goal molden 2007 or on indicators for efficient productive and equitable water use cao et al 2020 though these frameworks centre on linkages between a strategy and natural resources land water connections to strategic plans and the shift from one strategy to another remain absent this overview reveals four limitations that we intend to address with the introduction of the reorientation concept first strategic planning has received little explicit attention the implicit or explicit long term strategy for agriculture and water e g efficient water use or sustainable natural resource management is taken at face value instead of being interpreted as a set of long term priorities subject to reform to accommodate shifting societal demands second socio historical studies have addressed long term changes in agriculture and society on a timescale of centuries with little attention for steered shifts in societal priorities and agricultural water management in a particular region over a period of 20 40 years third while natural resources have been linked to management and governance in socio ecological systems there is scant study of linkages between strategic plans and natural resources also while the concept of transformational change concerns fundamental societal adjustments it has primarily been studied in conjunction with changes in abstract norms and values mcalpine et al 2015 rather than changes in long term strategies fourth agronomical and agricultural studies have centred on specifics of optimal farming and water systems often assuming one particular strategy for example more sustainable agriculture hence we regard reorientation as a unique middle range phenomenon positioned in between society wide agrarian change and strategy specific optimization table 1 3 what is a reorientation a reorientation is defined as a shift in broader societal priorities that drives reform of agricultural water management the process involves contestation appraisal and intervention steps at multiple levels resulting in changes in agricultural water management to accommodate the newly dominant priorities every organization and even individual may have their own particular interests with respect to water and agriculture mollinga et al 2007 a shift in broader societal priorities however implies a change in the main prevailing directions with respect to for example economic development agricultural expansion or intensification agricultural trade distribution of water between sectors environmental conservation or a combination of these the prevailing directions are often expressed by public sector organizations e g ministries for agriculture and water central and environmental planning agencies and governments such a shift in societal priorities will have strong influence on agricultural water management in situations of inter sectoral water competition where agriculture is the largest water user or when agricultural effluents strongly impact water quality of surface water and groundwater bodies fao 2021 societies can be considered at particular scales adger et al 2005 for a reorientation two scales are most important the national scale where priorities are set for food self sufficiency economic growth and environmental conservation and the local regional scale a particular region watershed or aquifer area where agricultural water management is reformed to accommodate a shift in societal priorities at both scales the changes brought about by a reorientation are transformational plans policies and practices are initiated that serve the new societal aims e g water resources development or environmental conservation reflecting changes in the values and beliefs of the actors in the system mcalpine et al 2015 moreover the changes associated with a reorientation are qualitatively distinct for example involving new crops land uses or water management systems and they have broad spatial coverage mapfumo et al 2017 this conceptualization of shifting societal priorities and changes in agricultural water management presumes an interplay between societal priorities and agricultural water management a reorientation can start locally for instance with an informal adaptation to changing markets or to a new climate reality which then influences larger scale policies and plans lee et al 2014 or a reorientation may be centrally steered starting with the formulation of plans and policies to influence farmers and other water users seijger et al 2019 in this paper we take shifting societal priorities as the starting point and reckon that priorities change for different reasons and due to new insights among different actors this is not to say there is a straight line between broader shifts in societal priorities and reforms in agricultural water management differing values knowledge and interests on how best to manage land and water will unleash debate critique and deviations from any new course proposed for agricultural water management at the national regional and local levels hidalgo bastidas et al 2018 abadia et al 2019 a reorientation as defined above cannot be studied when there is no clear shift in broader societal priorities which impacts agricultural water management two examples illustrate this a clear shift in societal priorities cannot be distinguished in countries where societal priorities continuously change e g due to rapidly changing political agendas similarly a shift in broader societal priorities cannot be discerned when societal priorities are continuously conflicting and overlapping because policies and plans will mimic the conflicting and overlapping priorities what sort of reorientations are already taking place fig 1 showcases 21 reorientations around the world these illustrative examples provide a starting point for exploration of the diversity and dynamics of reorientations of agricultural water management the supplemental information discusses each of the examples in turn including regional particularities four key aspects deserve particular note i the starting point of the reorientation ii the degree to which the reorientation has unfolded iii what happened in the reorientation process and iv the different scales and entry points first most of the examples emphasize how broader societal priorities can serve as a starting point for changes in agricultural water management these priorities range from agricultural expansion for food self sufficiency in niger merrey and sally 2004 and sudan fao 2020 to economic growth through expansion of high value crops in colombia marul et al 2018 and canada corkal et al 2011 and international trade for the export of wheat in russia griewald 2018 and soy in argentina lema et al 2018 environmental conservation is another priority as observed in attempts to reduce agricultural water pollution in germany kirschke et al 2019 and in the european union european commission 2020 and in efforts to reduce agricultural water use in the united states stokstad 2020 and to reduce both water use and pollution in india sen 2020 and the netherlands ritzema 2015 some of the reorientations have a clear focus on agricultural water management for example the move to reduce water abstraction for agricultural purposes in china zheng et al 2010 spain exposito et al 2017 and mexico hoogesteger et al 2017 however the starting point for a reorientation often lies elsewhere with changes in the agricultural water management system expected to follow some reorientations reflect a diminishing importance of agriculture for instance due to declining socio economic conditions in australia o connor et al 2005 and the collapse of state led farming and irrigation structures in bulgaria bachev 2010 furthermore the reorientations reveal shifts in cropping choices which may require changes in water supply and drainage for example to accommodate high value and diverse crops in vietnam vo et al 2019 or to produce a government preferred crop such as wheat in sudan fao 2020 or to shift from cotton and corn to olive and citrus trees in spain exposito et al 2017 second the examples reveal different degrees to which reorientation unfolds apart from some apparently successful examples where agricultural water use was effectively reduced for instance by drastically curtailing irrigated wheat production in saudi arabia grindle et al 2015 and implementing strict controls to reduce irrigated area and water use in spain berbel et al 2019 most examples in fig 1 suggest that agricultural water management is more easily altered to accommodate agricultural growth priorities such as land rehabilitation and expansion examples in this regard are the expansion of wheat in sudan rehabilitation of abandoned lands in angola and expansion of cereals and soy in tanzania similarly intensification and export aims canada russia argentina colombia vietnam seem more easily accommodated than priorities related to environmental conservation in places where agriculture is highly intensified netherlands germany united states european union india china mexico the examples suggest several cross cutting explanations although novel farming practices like no tillage or diversified farming have been investigated and proposed profound difficulties have emerged in scaling up for all sorts of reasons e g capacity costs and benefits farm size whereas governments have been successful in enacting novel policies to curb water use and limit agricultural land expansion implementation has been hampered by strong agricultural lobbies and limited government capacities in many cases farmers appear to lack feasible and economically attractive options for changing their planting and watering practices to accommodate the societal priority of environmental conservation third the examples offer greater clarity on what happens during a reorientation the from to logic in the vignettes in fig 1 point to the locus of the shift in societal priorities for instance in regard to agriculture the economy environmental conservation or a combination of these in describing and analysing the transitions from old to new priorities their outcomes at the farm level and in land and water resources are exposed as water and agriculture are intrinsically linked both deserve explicit attention when examining the degree to which agricultural water management has been altered and whether agricultural water management has successfully accommodated the shift in societal priorities among the examples we also find different approaches of the public sector in several examples governments play a strong steering and assertive role in spain government priorities incentivised the modernization of irrigation through investments reduction of water rights and a ban on expansion berbel et al 2019 in china government set out to reduce groundwater abstraction by regulating water rights initiating pilots to reduce thirsty crops like winter wheat and enacting bans on new wells while expanding surface water availability zheng et al 2010 jia 2011 in brazil government set out to replace agricultural expansion and deforestation with sustainable rainfed intensification of agriculture via incentive policies aimed at farmers such as certification for compliance with environmental standards licensing of farmlands control and provision of loans for pasture productivity garret et al 2018 in argentina government plans and policies supported expansion of soy and maize for export for example export bans were lifted forest clearing was allowed agricultural extension services were reinforced no tillage was promoted to improve water infiltration and infrastructure investments were made peiretti and dumanski 2014 lema et al 2018 in other examples government has remained more passive the united states enacted legislation to stabilize groundwater levels which is easier than increasing groundwater levels up to 2040 though efforts to reduce groundwater use are mostly voluntary hanak et al 2017 stokstad 2020 in bulgaria the socialist government resigned in 1989 but commercial farming property rights and markets did not take off as evidenced by the increase in supplementary farming from 14 pre 1989 53 in the 2000s bachev 2010 meurs and bogushev 2008 lastly the examples reveal the importance of the multiple scales and entry points involved in a reorientation sudan for example announced its ambition to become africa s breadbasket african development bank 2020 at the local regional level in canada s saskatchewan province irrigators agricultural producers and provincial government advocated the expansion of irrigable land corkal et al 2011 also at a local regional level in colombia regional government and elite landholders decided to devote lands in the caucau river valley to agricultural intensification velez torres 2012 4 interdisciplinary empirical research on reorientations at present there is a widely shared sense of urgency for change in agricultural water management around the globe as demonstrated by the european green deal the amazon soy moratorium and the sustainable development goals the need to produce and consume food more sustainably is abundantly clear in regions where there is increasing inter sectoral competition for water or where agriculture strongly impacts water quality agricultural water management is key to accommodate shifts in societal priorities with a bearing on economic development agriculture water distribution and the environment yet there are clear social and biophysical limitations to the extent that agricultural water management can be altered thus making it worthwhile to study to what extent agricultural water management is changed to effectively accommodate new priorities for water agriculture and the environment due to the earlier described limitations in existing frameworks of not addressing steered shifts in societal priorities and agricultural water management further framework based research on reorientations is recommended a reorientation could be studied through an interdisciplinary framework which regards similar to others molden 2007 ostrom 2009 agricultural water management as manifest in an interlinked constellation of plans policies farming practices and land and water resources change in societal priorities and agricultural water management could then be studied by comparing a status quo in agricultural water management before societal priorities started to shift with an actual situation 5 15 years after societal priorities started to shift as a reorientation unfolds assessments may change and therefore it is recommended to repeat analyses two to five years later to determine what major changes occurred in farming practices and whether land and water recourses indeed changed to accommodate shifting societal priorities as the 21 reorientation examples reveal reform of agricultural water management to accommodate shifting societal priorities is an important middle range phenomenon that occurs in many societies around the world for an empirical study of a reorientation it is recommended to select within a country a subsystem or area in which the influence of a shift in societal priorities on agricultural water management can be investigated the connection between a shift in societal priorities and a change in agricultural water management may be long term and indirect as many variables influence farming practices and land and water systems hence fast and slow changes should be accounted for at multiple levels including the response time of natural resources ward et al 2019 hasselquist et al 2020 social and biophysical limits for change in agricultural water management and the diminishment of influence from strategic plan and policy to the level of the farm field and water system we recommend in depth empirical studies to shed light on the intricacies of reorientation processes and to categorise reorientations according to types of societal shifts e g agricultural expansion or environmental conservation limits of change in agricultural water management e g biophysical social technical and directivity of change e g from policy to field level or informal change from farmer to farmer in addition working hypotheses could be tested pertaining to the 21 reorientation examples listed in this paper for instance research might examine whether reorientations towards environmental conservation goals are indeed more challenging than those towards agricultural expansion also it would be valuable to investigate whether farmers do lack attractive options to modify their land and watering practices to accommodate the societal priority of environmental conservation declaration

9141,concerns about sustainability climate change and increasing inter sectoral competition for water and land are pressing societies to set a new course in economic development agriculture water distribution and the environment although changes in societal priorities are an important driver of agricultural water management reform the extent of reform is constrained by social and biophysical limits existing frameworks offer limited insight how reforms in agricultural water management accommodate shifted societal priorities and how these reforms might unfold across policy domains farming practices and land and water resources in this paper we define the concept of reorientation as a shift in broader societal priorities that drives reform of agricultural water management we discuss 21 reorientation examples around the world the examples reveal much diversity in the starting point of a reorientation the degree to which a reorientation has unfolded the role of governments and the scales involved in a reorientation we end the paper with a call for analytical frameworks and empirical studies to generate insights how societies reform their agricultural water management towards ambitious sustainable production and consumption modes keywords new societal priorities reform in agricultural water management social and biophysical limits reorientation concept transition literature review data availability supplementary file contains data belonging to manuscript 1 introduction agricultural water management encompasses all activities related to the storage distribution consumption and drainage of water for crop production fisheries and livestock due to all these activities a range of agricultural water management systems exist these use different water resources rainwater surface water groundwater and soil water in the rootzone of varying qualities molden 2007 agriculture has a tremendous influence on water worldwide it accounts for 72 of all water withdrawals and contributes an estimated 56 of total polluted effluent fao 2021 in the past agricultural water management was often adjusted to accommodate growth priorities e g more food for growing populations which resulted in increases in agricultural production and water use molden 2007 bjornlund and bjornlund 2019 nowadays many societies are pressed to set a new course for agricultural water management reflecting new broader societal priorities and environmental conditions expanding urban centres have brought increased competition for water which has to be redistributed between urban industrial agricultural and environmental uses venot et al 2008 climate change too is influencing water availability and agricultural options iglesias and garotte 2015 to stimulate economic growth in this context agricultural priorities may be shifted from staple cereals to other commodities for export markets which usually requires changes in agricultural water management marul et al 2018 or in response to environmental degradation new environmental priorities may be set to improve the quantity and quality of groundwater and surface water affecting farmers land and water management practices richter et al 2017 cassman and grassini 2020 demand for more equitable and just water use may also require changes in water distribution zwarteveen and boelens 2014 all in all shifting societal priorities have a bearing on water use and thus become an important driver of agricultural water management reform due to the pivotal role of agriculture in water use and water quality long term decision making and strategic planning by governments are important vehicles for agricultural water management reform banihabib et al 2017 seijger et al 2019 these may emerge either in the wake of disasters e g the protective irrigation schemes built in pakistan after droughts to allow more efficient use of very limited water or they may arise in a planned anticipatory manner to steer away from unprofitable and environmental harmful practices e g india s attempts to change the flow of the ganges from polluted and sluggish to clean and continuous why is it relevant to investigate whether reforms in agricultural water management accommodate new societal priorities effectively altering agricultural water management is far from easy as there are limits to how much and how fast agricultural water management can change some limits have a social origin for instance political struggles and contestations to new water strategies and farming practices at multiple levels affect reform in agricultural water management zwarteveen et al 2017 other limits have a biophysical origin in closing and closed river basins renewable water resources are fully consumed for part or all of the year meaning there is no extra water to meet additional demands molle et al 2010 crop transpiration is the largest agricultural water consumer yet its efficiency is largely fixed by crop determined photosynthetic pathways meaning that it cannot be easily reduced steduto et al 2007 in addition it may take many years before changes in agricultural water management are observable in slowly changing biophysical processes of groundwater recharge soil and water quality ward et al 2019 not only is altering agricultural water management for new societal priorities challenging so too is the study of this phenomenon as we will argue existing analytical frameworks provide insufficient insight into the degree that agricultural water management reform unfolds across policy domains farming endeavors and water systems the aim of this paper therefore is to introduce the novel concept of reorientation and examine reorientation examples in different parts of the world to provide a better understanding of the extent agricultural water management is altered to accommodate new societal priorities 2 frameworks for evaluation of reorientation of societal priorities various research fields offer relevant frameworks to study a reorientation of societal priorities and reform in agricultural water management what follows is a selective 1 1 included were analytical frameworks or theories to explain change in the domains of agriculture water and environment in general situated in the realm of policy planning or management overview of frameworks from the environmental social and agricultural sciences the field of environmental governance for example offers analytical frameworks that centre on scales actors and management of natural resources participation and regulation bridge and perreault 2009 akhmouch and correia 2016 although strategy and strategic planning are concepts only recently addressed van assche et al 2020 in ecology and society a systems understanding prevails for the study of the complex nature of socio ecological systems with key concepts being regime shifts thresholds tipping points and feedback loops preiser et al 2018 subsystems analysed in this field are resource systems resource units governance systems and users ostrom 2009 whereas ostrom s framework is useful for analysing outcomes of the socio ecological system it largely refrains from adopting a strategic planning perspective for a notable exception see wilkinson 2012 in the field of sustainability transitions the focus is on fundamental changes in the technology and institutions for provision of water food energy and transport frameworks emphasize innovations and multilevel interactions between niche players and incumbents markard et al 2012 though without considering strategies in any central manner the field of strategic spatial planning offers frameworks with a focus on key features of a strategic plan strategies and implementation pathways albrechts 2015 bafarasat 2015 largely absent however is a holistic perspective from strategic plan to implementation and impacts on natural resources or on the transition from one set of priorities to another whereas strategic planning has been criticized for a lack of substance and remaining too far removed from on the ground realities wilkinson 2012 water and agricultural sociologists focus on hydro agricultural environments the political economy field offers frameworks for the study of agrarian change with emphasis on activities and outcomes for the different classes bernstein 2010 in the political sociology of water resources management water policy reforms are central mollinga 2008 with strategic planning often interpreted as a bureaucratic exercise in drawing up ambitious master plans and trying to get them implemented molle et al 2009 benedikter 2013 frameworks in the field of agronomy outline on field practices that farmers can apply in relation to different degrees of resource circulation as part of local global production chains therond et al 2017 or they cover incentives for adoption of a more sustainable production mode piñeiro et al 2020 yet the shift from one strategy to another is bypassed or remains a socio historical reconstruction of broadly applicable phases bjornlund and bjornlund 2019 in river basin planning and integrated water management frameworks are positioned within one often implicit set of priorities with integration serving a particular purpose such as water resource use or water quality hofwegen and jaspers 1999 loucks and beek 2017 these frameworks furthermore neglect underlying questions of how societies might reorient from one set of priorities to another and subsequent influences on land and water resources in agricultural water management a range of options may be considered from rainfed to fully irrigated agriculture frameworks in this domain focus on embedment of agricultural water management in a social political technological and resource context serving a particular goal molden 2007 or on indicators for efficient productive and equitable water use cao et al 2020 though these frameworks centre on linkages between a strategy and natural resources land water connections to strategic plans and the shift from one strategy to another remain absent this overview reveals four limitations that we intend to address with the introduction of the reorientation concept first strategic planning has received little explicit attention the implicit or explicit long term strategy for agriculture and water e g efficient water use or sustainable natural resource management is taken at face value instead of being interpreted as a set of long term priorities subject to reform to accommodate shifting societal demands second socio historical studies have addressed long term changes in agriculture and society on a timescale of centuries with little attention for steered shifts in societal priorities and agricultural water management in a particular region over a period of 20 40 years third while natural resources have been linked to management and governance in socio ecological systems there is scant study of linkages between strategic plans and natural resources also while the concept of transformational change concerns fundamental societal adjustments it has primarily been studied in conjunction with changes in abstract norms and values mcalpine et al 2015 rather than changes in long term strategies fourth agronomical and agricultural studies have centred on specifics of optimal farming and water systems often assuming one particular strategy for example more sustainable agriculture hence we regard reorientation as a unique middle range phenomenon positioned in between society wide agrarian change and strategy specific optimization table 1 3 what is a reorientation a reorientation is defined as a shift in broader societal priorities that drives reform of agricultural water management the process involves contestation appraisal and intervention steps at multiple levels resulting in changes in agricultural water management to accommodate the newly dominant priorities every organization and even individual may have their own particular interests with respect to water and agriculture mollinga et al 2007 a shift in broader societal priorities however implies a change in the main prevailing directions with respect to for example economic development agricultural expansion or intensification agricultural trade distribution of water between sectors environmental conservation or a combination of these the prevailing directions are often expressed by public sector organizations e g ministries for agriculture and water central and environmental planning agencies and governments such a shift in societal priorities will have strong influence on agricultural water management in situations of inter sectoral water competition where agriculture is the largest water user or when agricultural effluents strongly impact water quality of surface water and groundwater bodies fao 2021 societies can be considered at particular scales adger et al 2005 for a reorientation two scales are most important the national scale where priorities are set for food self sufficiency economic growth and environmental conservation and the local regional scale a particular region watershed or aquifer area where agricultural water management is reformed to accommodate a shift in societal priorities at both scales the changes brought about by a reorientation are transformational plans policies and practices are initiated that serve the new societal aims e g water resources development or environmental conservation reflecting changes in the values and beliefs of the actors in the system mcalpine et al 2015 moreover the changes associated with a reorientation are qualitatively distinct for example involving new crops land uses or water management systems and they have broad spatial coverage mapfumo et al 2017 this conceptualization of shifting societal priorities and changes in agricultural water management presumes an interplay between societal priorities and agricultural water management a reorientation can start locally for instance with an informal adaptation to changing markets or to a new climate reality which then influences larger scale policies and plans lee et al 2014 or a reorientation may be centrally steered starting with the formulation of plans and policies to influence farmers and other water users seijger et al 2019 in this paper we take shifting societal priorities as the starting point and reckon that priorities change for different reasons and due to new insights among different actors this is not to say there is a straight line between broader shifts in societal priorities and reforms in agricultural water management differing values knowledge and interests on how best to manage land and water will unleash debate critique and deviations from any new course proposed for agricultural water management at the national regional and local levels hidalgo bastidas et al 2018 abadia et al 2019 a reorientation as defined above cannot be studied when there is no clear shift in broader societal priorities which impacts agricultural water management two examples illustrate this a clear shift in societal priorities cannot be distinguished in countries where societal priorities continuously change e g due to rapidly changing political agendas similarly a shift in broader societal priorities cannot be discerned when societal priorities are continuously conflicting and overlapping because policies and plans will mimic the conflicting and overlapping priorities what sort of reorientations are already taking place fig 1 showcases 21 reorientations around the world these illustrative examples provide a starting point for exploration of the diversity and dynamics of reorientations of agricultural water management the supplemental information discusses each of the examples in turn including regional particularities four key aspects deserve particular note i the starting point of the reorientation ii the degree to which the reorientation has unfolded iii what happened in the reorientation process and iv the different scales and entry points first most of the examples emphasize how broader societal priorities can serve as a starting point for changes in agricultural water management these priorities range from agricultural expansion for food self sufficiency in niger merrey and sally 2004 and sudan fao 2020 to economic growth through expansion of high value crops in colombia marul et al 2018 and canada corkal et al 2011 and international trade for the export of wheat in russia griewald 2018 and soy in argentina lema et al 2018 environmental conservation is another priority as observed in attempts to reduce agricultural water pollution in germany kirschke et al 2019 and in the european union european commission 2020 and in efforts to reduce agricultural water use in the united states stokstad 2020 and to reduce both water use and pollution in india sen 2020 and the netherlands ritzema 2015 some of the reorientations have a clear focus on agricultural water management for example the move to reduce water abstraction for agricultural purposes in china zheng et al 2010 spain exposito et al 2017 and mexico hoogesteger et al 2017 however the starting point for a reorientation often lies elsewhere with changes in the agricultural water management system expected to follow some reorientations reflect a diminishing importance of agriculture for instance due to declining socio economic conditions in australia o connor et al 2005 and the collapse of state led farming and irrigation structures in bulgaria bachev 2010 furthermore the reorientations reveal shifts in cropping choices which may require changes in water supply and drainage for example to accommodate high value and diverse crops in vietnam vo et al 2019 or to produce a government preferred crop such as wheat in sudan fao 2020 or to shift from cotton and corn to olive and citrus trees in spain exposito et al 2017 second the examples reveal different degrees to which reorientation unfolds apart from some apparently successful examples where agricultural water use was effectively reduced for instance by drastically curtailing irrigated wheat production in saudi arabia grindle et al 2015 and implementing strict controls to reduce irrigated area and water use in spain berbel et al 2019 most examples in fig 1 suggest that agricultural water management is more easily altered to accommodate agricultural growth priorities such as land rehabilitation and expansion examples in this regard are the expansion of wheat in sudan rehabilitation of abandoned lands in angola and expansion of cereals and soy in tanzania similarly intensification and export aims canada russia argentina colombia vietnam seem more easily accommodated than priorities related to environmental conservation in places where agriculture is highly intensified netherlands germany united states european union india china mexico the examples suggest several cross cutting explanations although novel farming practices like no tillage or diversified farming have been investigated and proposed profound difficulties have emerged in scaling up for all sorts of reasons e g capacity costs and benefits farm size whereas governments have been successful in enacting novel policies to curb water use and limit agricultural land expansion implementation has been hampered by strong agricultural lobbies and limited government capacities in many cases farmers appear to lack feasible and economically attractive options for changing their planting and watering practices to accommodate the societal priority of environmental conservation third the examples offer greater clarity on what happens during a reorientation the from to logic in the vignettes in fig 1 point to the locus of the shift in societal priorities for instance in regard to agriculture the economy environmental conservation or a combination of these in describing and analysing the transitions from old to new priorities their outcomes at the farm level and in land and water resources are exposed as water and agriculture are intrinsically linked both deserve explicit attention when examining the degree to which agricultural water management has been altered and whether agricultural water management has successfully accommodated the shift in societal priorities among the examples we also find different approaches of the public sector in several examples governments play a strong steering and assertive role in spain government priorities incentivised the modernization of irrigation through investments reduction of water rights and a ban on expansion berbel et al 2019 in china government set out to reduce groundwater abstraction by regulating water rights initiating pilots to reduce thirsty crops like winter wheat and enacting bans on new wells while expanding surface water availability zheng et al 2010 jia 2011 in brazil government set out to replace agricultural expansion and deforestation with sustainable rainfed intensification of agriculture via incentive policies aimed at farmers such as certification for compliance with environmental standards licensing of farmlands control and provision of loans for pasture productivity

in supplementary farming from 14 pre 1989 53 in the 2000s bachev 2010 meurs and bogushev 2008 lastly the examples reveal the importance of the multiple scales and entry points involved in a reorientation sudan for example announced its ambition to become africa s breadbasket african development bank 2020 at the local regional level in canada s saskatchewan province irrigators agricultural producers and provincial government advocated the expansion of irrigable land corkal et al 2011 also at a local regional level in colombia regional government and elite landholders decided to devote lands in the caucau river valley to agricultural intensification velez torres 2012 4 interdisciplinary empirical research on reorientations at present there is a widely shared sense

9142,to readily addressed three key issues including fuzzy parametric information multiple objectives and fractional ratios in planning problems this study presents a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach for building the linkage between agricultural water food environment nexus and crop area planning this approach is developed by incorporating fuzzy credibility constrained programming into multi objective linear fractional programming within the optimization model to demonstrate its applicability the approach is then applied to the hetao irrigation district in the northwest china to unite the multiple objective problems in agricultural irrigation with crop area planning three ratio optimization problems associated with agricultural economic and environmental objectives are concurrently considered including maximum economic benefit per unit of irrigation water maximum crop yield per unit of irrigated area and minimal grey water footprint per unit of crop production therefore this study has the following advantages 1 fuzzy parameters existing in the objective and violated constraints can be effectively tackled 2 the multiple ratio optimization problems can be efficiently solved through a linearization procedure in a straightforward manner thereby reflecting desired system efficiency and reducing computational difficulties 3 the mathematical and practical interactions of agricultural water food environment nexus can be investigated based on intermediate variables i e irrigated area irrigation water crop yield economic benefits and greywater footprint 4 optimal solutions can be flexibly generated to facilitate crop area planning through given aspiration levels of objective goals and credibility levels of constraints the results indicate that optimal objective values have slight changes with the form of each objective e g maximization or minimization the results are useful for facilitating insightful interpretation of inter relationships among sustainable agricultural production efficient irrigation water use and favorable agro ecological conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords agricultural water food environment nexus multi objective ratio optimization problems credibility interrelationships crop area planning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agricultural irrigation water in arid areas accounts for more than 85 of the total water consumption and water resources have become a key factor limiting agricultural production and environmental health in irrigation areas kang et al 2017 optimal agricultural water management has a direct association with crop growth and food output and determines physical transformation processes of irrigation water which further affects the environmental health of the irrigation area jacobs et al 2016 if these interactions among multiple subsystems e g agricultural water food environment nexus in agricultural water management are ignored such negative phenomena as low water use efficiency and serious nutrient losses will occur while enhancing agricultural outputs in response to above concerns cai et al 2003 developed an integrated hydrologic agronomic economic model to address basin water management and irrigation induced salinity problems gordon et al 2010 provided the tradeoffs between food production and ecosystem services arisen from agriculture induced changes to manage agricultural water forni et al 2016 proposed integrated economic optimization model and climate driven hydrological models for optimal water allocation in the california s central valley capitanescu et al 2017 established a multi stage optimization model for farm management considering environmental and crop rotation constraints li et al 2018 applied a framework based on the multi region computable general equilibrium theory to analyze the social economic water cycling and the water land nexus singh 2019 used the mathematical models to manage irrigation induced salinization and drainage problems in irrigated areas however these studies have been undertaken in the case of relatively independent constraints without considering feedback of agricultural water food environment nexus in addition planning models are usually in pursuit of maximum economic social and environmental benefits or system efficiency i e output per unit of resource input if the system efficiency is the desired objective the form of its objective function will likely be a linear fractional equation this objective represents the ratio between profit and cost or consumed resource and it can be expressed as the benefits per unit of water used in the case of irrigated agriculture which can reflect system efficiency for example charnes et al 1978 proposed a new definition of system efficiency to evaluate activities in public programs gómez et al 2006 attempted to solve a forest planning problem through a linear fractional goal programing model besides studies based on the integration of inexact mathematical techniques and linear fractional programming have strengthened its applicability in addressing ratio objective problems and uncertainties e g interval fuzzy and random parameters variables in study system for instance zhu and huang 2011 developed a linear fractional programming approach in a random environment for waste management ren et al 2013 used a stochastic linear fractional programming model for optimization of industrial structure li et al 2016 developed an interval based irrigation water allocation model incorporating linear fractional programming zhang and guo 2018 investigated optimal irrigation water allocation based on a fuzzy linear fractional programming nevertheless it is noteworthy that the above studies focused on the single ratio objective through optimizing a single metric via linear fractional programming in practice multi objective linear fractional programming molfp problems are needed to be solved when facing multiple conflicting economic and environmental ratio objectives furthermore several studies had contributed to the solution process of molfp ammar 1998 defined and analyzed some notions regarding fuzzy parametric non smooth molfp problem chakraborty and gupta 2002 used fuzzy set theoretic approach to deal with molfp problems pal et al 2003 solved fuzzy molfp problems using a goal programming procedure iskander 2004 presented a possibility programming approach which is used to convert molfp into its deterministic crisp multi objective linear programming güzel and sivri 2005 provided a solution procedure via taylor series solution for solving molfp issues lotfi et al 2010 applied a geometrical interpretation and linear programming approach to test solution efficiency nayak and ojha 2019 derived the acceptable ranges of objective values for molfp problems with fuzzy parameters in both objectives and constraints yang et al 2020 proposed a solving algorithm for multi objective linear fractional programming with the superiority and inferiority measures borza and rambely 2021 treated the molfp problems through integrations of techniques including the membership functions of the objectives suitable non linear variable transformations and max min methods however these studies still cannot provide a relatively efficient solution processes and they are usually illustrated by numerical examples rather than real world case studies moreover the molfp is incapable of handling fuzzy parametric data and the violated fuzzy constraint that it is hold at quantified credibility level λ therefore fuzzy sets theory including possibility necessity and credibility was proposed to effectively deal with fuzzy uncertainties which is a mathematical counterpart of probability theory among these methods credibility theory is advanced from possibility and necessity theory because it s a more reasonable fuzzy inequality indicator due to its self duality liu and liu 2002 proposed credibility measure and thus fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp was derived to address these fuzzy violated constraints at predetermined credibility level in fact fccp method can deal with fuzzy parameters in single sided double sided of the constraints and credibility objectives because of convenient computational procedure rong and lahdelma 2008 lau et al 2010 pishvaee et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 2021 lu et al 2016 nevertheless few studies have incorporated fccp into molfp problems in practical applications especially in crop area planning problems therefore this study attempts to develop a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach for linking agricultural water food environment nexus with crop area planning in practice crop area planning is essential for agricultural water management because it can decide how much water should be allocated to different crops in the pursuit of desired goals karrou and oweis 2012 dai and li 2013 it s then applied to the hetao irrigation district in the northwest china for uniting the multiple objective problems in agricultural irrigation with crop area planning three ratio based problems regarding agriculture water and environment subsystems are considered including maximum economic water productivity i e economic benefit per unit of irrigation water maximum land productivity i e crop yield per unit of irrigated area and minimum environmental pollution degree i e grey water footprint per unit of crop production these objectives are interlinked through decision variables and mathematical interaction among these subsystems thereby investigating the interrelationship of agricultural water food environment nexus in crop area planning through introducing techniques of molfp and fccp this approach enables to deal with fuzzy parameters coefficients in the constraints and generate ratio based management strategies at varying credibility levels moreover a linearization procedure is employed to solve the multiple ratio objectives in a straightforward manner leading to high computational efficiency from the agricultural system planner perspective it can concurrently maximize agricultural output and irrigation water productivity while minimize negative environmental response therefore the optimized results are expected to provide decision support for efficient agricultural production and irrigation water use and effective mitigation of agricultural non point source pollution 2 methodology development the model framework is depicted in fig 1 each of these components is discussed according to fig 1 in the following section 2 1 multi objective linear fractional programming a general framework of multi objective linear fractional programming is formulated by incorporating linear fractional programming into multi objective linear programming it s presented as follows 1a optimize z k x c k x α k d k x β k k 1 2 k 1b s u b j e c t t o x s x r n a x b x 0 b r m where c k d k r n α k β k are constants and s φ generally d k x β k is assumed to be greater than 0 x s to solve the multi objective linear fractional programing fuzzy goal programming method and its linearized form of membership goals are adopted in the following steps 2 1 1 problem formulation in the solution process some aspiration levels are pre given to each ratio objective which are defined as fuzzy goals if we introduce the aspiration levels g k into the k th ratio objective z k x then the fuzzy goals can be presented 1c z k x g k f o r m a x i m i z i n g z k x 1d z k x g k f o r minimizing z k x where and represent the fuzziness of the aspiration levels and they can be interpreted as essentially more than and essentially less than based on zimmermann 1978 therefore the fuzzy linear fractional goal programming is written find x 1e t o s a t i s f y z k x g k k 1 2 k 1 1f z k x g k k k 1 1 k 1g s u b j e c t t o a x b x 0 here the fuzzy goals are stated by their membership functions pal et al 2003 for example the membership function μ k for the eq 1e is defined as 1h μ k 1 if z k x g k z k x l k g k l k if l k z k x g k 0 if z k x l k where l k is the lower tolerance limit for the k th fuzzy goal similarly the membership function μ k for the eq 1f is defined as 1i μ k 1 if z k x g k u k z k x u k g k ifg k z k x u k 0 if z k x u k where u k is the upper tolerance limit for the k th fuzzy goal 2 1 2 goal programming to tackle the above problems fuzzy goal programming is introduced because the achievement of the objective goals to each aspired level to the maximum possible is represented by the possible achievement of each membership value to the highest extent in a fuzzy decision environment in theory the highest degree of membership function is 1 hence according to the defined membership functions of eqs 1h and 1i their flexible membership goals with the aspired level 1 is presented 1j z k x l k g k l k d k d k 1 1k u k z k x u k g k d k d k 1 where d k 0 and d k 0 denote the under and over deviational variables from the aspired levels mathematically these two variables are introduced in the achievement function for minimizing them and that depend on the type of the objective functions to be optimized in this study only the under deviational variable d k is needed to be minimized to reach the aspired level of each fuzzy goal because the over deviation from fuzzy goals indicates the membership values are fully achieved due to the inherent nonlinearity in the eqs 1j and 1k a linearization form is derived to reduce computational difficulties in the solving procedure 2 1 3 linearization of membership goals the k th membership goal in eq 1j is written 1l p k z k x p k l k d k d k 1 where 1m p k 1 g k l k taking the expression of z k x from eq 1a into eq 1k the above goal is presented 1n p k c k x α k d k d k x β k d k d k x β k p k d k x β k where 1o p k 1 p k l k or 1p c k x d k d k x β k d k d k x β k g k where 1q c k p k c k p k d k g k p k β k p k α k similarly goal expressions for the membership goal in eq 1k can be derived to further simplify the eq 1p let d k d k d k x β k and d k d k d k x β k the linear form of the eq 1p can be presented as 1r c k x d k d k g k with d k d k 0 and d k d k 0 because d k d k 0 and d k x β k 0 therefore to minimize the under deviational variable d k means to minimize the d k d k x β k in fuzzy decision which is a fractional term and nonlinear one it should be mentioned that d k 0 indicate that a membership goal is fully achieved and d k 1 means that its achievement is 0 the following expressions are presented when d k 1 is involved into the solution process 1s d k d k x β k 1 i e 1t d k d k x β k as above discussed constraints associated with d k don t present in the model formulation 2 1 4 linear goal programming taking above solution procedures into consideration the fuzzy goal programming model can be formulated 1u f i n d x 1v t o m i n i m i z e f k 1 k w k d k 1w a n d s a t i s f y c k x d k d k g k 1x s u b j e c t t o a x b x 0 1y a n d d k d k x β k k 1 2 k 1z x 0 1aa d k d k 0 k 1 2 k where f is the fuzzy achievement function summing up the weighted under deviational variables d k w k is weighted coefficients w k 0 and k 1 2 k are the relative importance of achieving the aspirated level of each fuzzy goal based on this formulation w k is calculated as 1ab w k 1 g k l k for the defined μ k in eq 1h 1 u k g k for the defined μ k in eq 1i therefore multi objective linear fractional programming problems can be solved based on minimum fuzzy goal programming approach 2 2 fuzzy credibility constrained programming when the uncertain parameters cannot be characterized by probability distributions but be presented as fuzzy sets fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp is used to handle fuzzy parameters coefficients existing in objective and constraints in the optimization model and generate a series of flexible solutions under pre determined credibility levels based on the definition of credibility it can reflect the satisfaction degree of study system corresponding to each credibility level thereby leading to constraint violation risk thus it can support in depth analysis among optimal solutions satisfaction degree and system violation risk a general fccp method is presented 2a max f j 1 n c j x j 2b s t c r j 1 n a i j x j b i α i i 1 2 i 2c x j 0 j 1 2 j where x x 1 x 2 x n is a vector of non fuzzy decision variables c j denote coefficients in the objective function a i j and b i are fuzzy coefficients variables in constraints i and j are numbers of constraints and variables inequality 2b shows that the credibility of constraints i e fuzzy events j 1 n a i j x j b i should be not less than predefined α i fuzzy uncertainty may exist in the single or double sided constraints taking fuzzy credibility constraint c r ε ξ as an example where ε ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 and ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 its fuzzy membership function μ can be formulated as 2d c r ε ξ 1 if ε 3 ξ 1 ε 3 2 ε 2 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 2 ε 3 ε 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 if ε 2 ξ 2 ε 3 ξ 1 ξ 3 ε 1 2 ξ 3 ξ 2 ε 2 ε 1 if ε 2 ξ 2 ε 1 ξ 3 0 if ε 1 ξ 3 2e s i m i l a r l y c r ε ξ 1 if ε ξ 1 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 ε 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 if ξ 1 ε ξ 2 ξ 3 ε 2 ξ 3 ξ 2 if ξ 2 ε ξ 3 0 if ε ξ 3 2f c r ε ξ 0 if ξ ε 1 ξ ε 1 2 ε 2 ε 1 if ε 1 ξ ε 2 ξ ε 3 2 ε 2 2 ε 3 ε 2 if ε 2 ξ ε 3 1 if ξ ε 3 it may be noted that meaningful and effective decision should be make when credibility is greater than 0 5 therefore when α i 0 5 eqs 2d 2e and 2f can be transformed into their deterministic crisps 2g c r ε ξ α ε 3 2 ε 2 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 2 ε 3 ε 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 α 2h c r ε ξ α 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 ε 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 α 2i c r ε ξ α ξ ε 3 2 ε 2 2 ε 3 ε 2 α thus fccp method can be readily solved though eqs 2g 2h and 2i moreover credibility level is a predefined semantic level for the satisfaction degree of constraints in the decision environment to reflect the decision makers preference its practical implication is to make decisions under different constraint violation risks by accommodating the degree of constraint satisfaction a higher credibility level corresponds to a higher feasibility and a lower system failure risk which will naturally lead to less decision domain nevertheless it cannot deal with multiple ratio objective problems to integrate fccp method into molfp framework is an effective method to address above concerns 2 3 fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming in response to above concerns a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach is developed the general form of model is presented as follows 3a optimize z k x c k x α k d k x β k k 1 2 k 3b s t c r j 1 n a i j x j b i α i i 1 2 i 3c x j 0 j 1 2 j where c k d k r n α k β k are constants and k is the number of ratio objective x j is non fuzzy decision variables a i j and b i are fuzzy coefficients variables in constraints i and j are numbers of constraints and variables 2 4 solution process the detailed solution processes can be summarized to generate optimal solutions step 1 formulate fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach step 2 introduce the aspiration levels g k into the kth ratio objective z k x to present the fuzzy goal see eqs 1c and 1d step 3 define the membership functions μ k of fuzzy goals based on their tolerance limits l k see eqs 1h and 1i step 4 formulate fuzzy goal programming to achieve their highest membership values i e d k and d k see eqs 1j and 1k step 5 rewrite the kth membership goals through linearized expressions see eq 1r step 6 given a certain level of credibility of constraint and convert fuzzy constraints into deterministic crisps see eqs 2g 2h and 2i step 7 solve the above fuzzy goal programming based on classical linear programming under a certain level credibility step 8 repeat steps 2 7 under different aspiration levels of ratio objectives and credibility levels of constraints and generate the final solutions 3 application 3 1 overview of the study region the hetao irrigation district hid is located in the western part of inner mongolia autonomous region 40 19 41 18 n 109 26 112 06 e see fig 2 it is 50 km wide from north to south and about 250 km long from east to west with an average altitude of 1050 m the hid is one of the three major irrigation districts in china with a total area of 1 19 106 ha and a planned irrigation area of 0 73 106 ha there are five irrigation subareas within the hid namely ulaanbaatar ub jiefangzha jfz yongji yj yichang yc and ulaat ut the tree shaped irrigation canal system in the irrigation area is divided into 7 levels namely general trunk canal trunk canal sub trunk canal branch canal lateral canal agricultural canal and furrow canal the irrigation induced drainage water passes through various levels of sub trunk ditches and truck ditches then sinks into the general trunk ditch of the hid and finally ends up with the ulansu sea as the drainage carrying area the whole irrigation area has 1 general trunk canal 13 trunk canals 48 sub trunk canals and 86 000 subordinate canal systems the drainage system has 1 general drainage trunk ditch 12 trunk ditches 59 sub trunk ditches and 17 000 subordinate ditches the average annual precipitation is 140 mm and precipitation from june to september accounts for 70 of the total volume its average annual evaporation is 2000 mm e20 pan and evaporation from may to august contributes over 50 of the total annual volume thus this is a region where there is no agriculture without irrigation it has a relatively short frost free period 130 150 days and usually only one crop can be sown during crop growth period the region has long sunshine hours with over 3 000 h of sunshine throughout the year making it one of the most resourceful areas for light energy in china spring wheat maize and sunflower are mainly planted in this area from late march to late september approximately 90 of the available water is used for irrigation and this percentage is significantly higher than the overall national average i e 64 due to drought and low precipitation these crops are generally irrigated 5 8 times with water from the yellow river i e the only source of irrigation depending on precipitation fertilizers applied in this area are mainly phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers and the amount of fertilizer application is increasing annually water and fertilizer are the two limiting factors for agricultural development but long term irrational irrigation patterns and unscientific practices of fertilizer application have caused the water resources waste and the worsening ecological environment 3 2 problem statement currently the average annual amount of water diverted from the yellow river to study area is about 4 8 109 m3 which is 7 lower than the average water volume in the 1990 s i e 5 2 109 m3 moreover the future water diversion to the hid should be less than 4 0 109 m3 as required by government planning therefore it is essential to enhance water productivity and alleviate water conflicts by promoting high water efficient agriculture however it may also induce the risk of soil salinity accumulation to some extent in practice annual average salt concentration of the irrigation water from the yellow river is 0 5 g l as flood irrigation with excessive water is the main irrigation method in addition to the high evaporation and shallow groundwater depth large amounts of salts are accumulated and eventually stored in the soil of the hid leading to soil salinization problems also large irrigation quota has led to serious loss of nutrients from farmlands i e nitrogen and phosphorus and thus aggravated irrigation induced non point source pollution such problems are caused by the more pursuit of agricultural output in agricultural water management there is a need to identify the interaction processes of agricultural water food environment nexus and to quantitatively characterize the response relationship between them the challenge faced by agricultural water management in irrigation areas is how to collaboratively balance agricultural production water use efficiency and environmental health therefore except for considering the economic benefits of grain output multiple objectives problems such as improving irrigation water efficiency controlling soil salination and reducing agricultural non point source pollution are urgent issues to be addressed in irrigated agriculture as an indispensable part of agricultural water management crop area planning is the basis for making annual water use plans for irrigation districts it determines optimal solutions of irrigation water i e irrigated area for different crops and finally achieves specific objectives within the constraints of meeting resource and environmental capacity furthermore many input parameters are inaccessible or are unavailable with sufficient data such as detailed amount of irrigation diversions and daily market prices water use percentages inexact mathematical methods are the effective way to deal with uncertain information existing in objective function and constraints also the multi objective linear programming fails to consider ratio optimization problems and the existence of realistic uncertainties therefore techniques of inexact mathematical methods and linear fractional programming should be incorporated into the modeling framework of multi objective linear programming to solve crop area planning problems considering agricultural water food environment nexus thereby providing more realistic and flexible solutions for crop area planning under uncertainty 3 3 model formulation through involving agricultural water food environment nexus into the modeling framework a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach is developed for crop area planning under uncertainty three conflicting ratio objectives are formulated through linking agricultural water food environment nexus into crop area planning its formulation is presented below 3 3 1 objective function 4a max f 1 b c 1 c 2 c 3 i 1 5 j 1 3 a i j 1 μ i i q t i j μ i i q s i j 4b max f 2 i 1 5 j 1 3 a

irrigation water use indicating that economic water productivity is to be measured yuan m3 f 2 is maximum crop yield per unit of irrigated area which can reflect land productivity and provide more availability of food security kg ha f 3 is minimal grey water footprint per unit of crop production i e the amount of water needed to dilute new pollutants from crop production to the environmental critical concentration during the crop growth period m3 kg this is an environment related ratio objective that to minimize the environmental pollution degree in the agricultural production process it should be noted that the third objective is the form of minimization which can be solved by converting its reciprocal into the maximized form by doing so it s the same form as the first two objective as a prerequisite for further solving the above three ratio objectives are interlinked by intermediate variables such as irrigation area irrigation water use crop yield and pollutants in study system b is the total economic returns from agricultural production yuan c 1 is the total cost of irrigation water use yuan c 2 is the total cost of agricultural production except water use yuan and c 3 is water saving equipment investment costs because water saving measures are adopted in a portion of irrigation area yuan a i j is decision variable representing irrigated area for crop j in zone i ha i

and crop yield kg ha per unit of area under traditional irrigation pattern i q s i j and y s i j are irrigation quota m3 ha and crop yield kg ha per unit of area under water saving irrigation pattern μ i is proportion of water saving irrigation area in zone i which is introduced to reveal the state of development of water saving agriculture p w i is price of water use in zone i yuan m3 p c i j c p i j and c s i j are price of crop yuan kg cost of agricultural production yuan kg and investment cost of water saving equipment yuan ha for crop j in zone i respectively max g w f n p g w f p m is to calculate the maximum grey water footprint the amount of water required to dilute the added pollutants is determined by the pollutant that requires the greatest amount of dilution which is quantitatively equal to the dilution of that pollutant in this study grey water footprint arisen from agricultural non point pollution g w f n p and irrigation induced salinity g w f p m are considered there are three types of agricultural non point pollutants including nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer and pesticides while salinity factor mainly includes regionally accumulated salts therefore grey water footprint of the mth agricultural non point pollutant is calculated as 4h g w f n p m p u l m a c max m c n a t m q p m c max m c n a t m where g w f n p m is the grey water footprint of mth agricultural non point pollutant m3 p u l m is agricultural land loss per unit of area of the mth agricultural non point pollutant kg m3 a is irrigated area m2 c max m and c n a t m are the maximum allowable concentration and background concentration of the mth agricultural non point pollutant kg m3 q p m is the total non point pollutant loss kg where q p m λ m q t m λ m is the rate of pollutant loss and q t is the total fertilizer applications of the mth agricultural non point pollutant kg therefore grey water footprint of agricultural non point pollutant is 4i g w f n p max g w f n p 1 g w f n p 2 g w f n p 3 where g w f n p 1 g w f n p 2 and g w f n p 3 are grey water foot print of nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer and pesticides respectively m3 besides the amount of water required to dilute regional salt accumulation is 4j g w f p m m c max c n a t where c max and c n a t are the maximum allowable concentration and background concentration of the accumulate salt kg m3 m is salt newly added to the region during the year kg since the grey water footprint calculations for g w f n p and g w f p m are done for different components the total grey water footprint g w f is determined as the maximum value of g w f n p and g w f p m for the same period that is 4k g w f max g w f n p g w f p m max max g w f n p 1 g w f n p 2 g w f n p 3 g w f p m 3

quota and cost of agricultural production investment cost of water saving equipment nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer applied for each crop and agricultural zone are generally collected from administrative planning report and statistical yearbooks price of crop and water use is obtained depending on actual market situation leaching rates of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer are collected according to field experimental data from du et al 2011 maximum threshold values of total nitrogen and phosphorus are obtained from cao et al 2014 water availabilities are presented as triangular fuzzy numbers the data used to determine the available water was collected from the general administration of hetao irrigation district triangular fuzzy number is presented as a a 1 a 2 a 3 where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are the least possible value main value and the largest possible value a 1 and a 3 are generally calculated though interval estimation with 95 confidence level based on t distribution because the variance of collected data is unknown a 2 is usually determined by the mean value of sample therefore water availability can be obtained based on the total amount of diverted water from 1990 to 2018 q s 3985 4150 4315 106 m3 4 results analysis in this study three sets of parameters are crucial for solving the model and generating decision alternatives fuzzy aspiration levels and tolerance limits for three ratio fuzzy goals as well as predefined credibility levels for constraints fuzzy aspiration level and tolerance limit are given based on the desired decision making goals which will depend on the allowable tolerance value of violated aspirated level of each fuzzy objective here the fuzzy aspiration levels of the three objectives are set as 5 yuan m3 10 000 kg ha 30 kg m3 and the tolerance limits of the three objectives be 2 yuan m3 4000 kg ha 10 kg m3 in general credibility levels from β 1 0 to β 0 has a clear definition and decision making guidelines individually based on fuzzy linguistic scale proposed by jiménez et al 2007 detailedly β 1 0 denotes completely acceptable solution β 0 9 corresponds to practically acceptable solution β 0 8 is associated with almost acceptable solution and β 0 7 is very acceptable solution to examine the variations of optimal results under varying credibility levels three scenarios for the constraints are introduced that is credibility level of α k β k and ξ k in the constraints of eqs 4l 4p and 4q are all designed as 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 respectively therefore based on the model inputs optimal solutions can be generated to support crop area planning 4 1 optimal solutions of crop area planning under three scenarios fig 3 presents optimal solutions of crop area planning under three scenarios overall under each scenario the irrigated area for crops would be kept almost the same especially for spring wheat and sunflower they would not change much among scenarios for example when α k β k and ξ k are given as from 0 7 to 0 9 the irrigated area for spring wheat in each agricultural zone is 2000 ha 8053 ha 11 228 ha 9507 ha and 6012 ha and the irrigated area for sunflower is 27 830 ha 24 752 ha 40 485 ha 77 853 ha and 56 129 ha respectively the results of spring wheat are taken as the minimum values in the constraints this is mainly due to its lower economic benefits and larger irrigation demands such results achieve the maximum economic water productivity as required by the model structure whereas only the irrigated area for sunflower in yj is taken the least bound of constraint additionally for maize under each scenario the results are most the same in agricultural zone ub jfz and yc ut on the contrary the irrigated area in agricultural zone yj has a decline trend with the variation of credibility levels from 0 7 to 0 9 through introducing credibility theory the model makes it possible to offer flexible solutions with quantified credibility level of constraint satisfaction generally optimal solutions of crop area can provide linkage among three objectives regarding irrigation water use crop yield and irrigation induced grey water footprint thus these solutions can attribute to the following objective function values 4 2 optimal values of three ratio objectives under three scenarios fig 4 compares optimal values of three ratio objectives from scenario 0 7 0 9 three conflicting ratio objectives are interlinked and solved though the proposed model simultaneously and the results can reflect system efficiency from the perspective of agriculture water and environment subsystems as defined each objective arises in real world situations because it frequently happens that decision makers or stakeholders are faced with the problems of pursuing better ratios e g economic water productivity land productivity between several parameters for economic water productivity optimal objective values have slight changes from 2 833 yuan m3 to 2 831 yuan m3 among scenarios for land productivity it is decreased from 6168 kg ha to 6089 kg ha as the credibility level rises contrarily the negative environmental effects i e grey water footprint of crop production would be slightly increased from 0 086 m3 kg to 0 088 m3 kg at an increased credibility level in other words the difference among three objectives can be explained by their objective forms of maximization or minimization in general these trends provide the tradeoff among objective values credibility level and constraint violation risk it is obvious that a lower credibility level would lead to a higher system efficiency associated with a higher system failure risk even through it has the mostly relaxed decision domain by comparing the results of the three ratio objectives it is found that the analysis of systemic interaction of agricultural water food environment nexus is realized by the intermediate variable crop area which can ultimately make crop planting plans therefore this study enables to provide solutions concerning improving economic water productivity land productivity and reducing negative environmental effects i e minimum grey water footprint per unit of crop production under different credibility levels and system reliability conditions 5 discussion this study attempts to propose a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach to link agricultural water food environment nexus into crop area planning within the modeling framework economic water productivity and land productivity allow for the establishment of linkages between subsystems of agriculture and water grey water footprint bridges subsystems of water and environment and the third objective i e grey water footprint per unit of crop production represents the relationship between subsystems of agriculture and environment to further analyze the significance and practicality of the study the theoretical and practical perspectives are discussed hereafter 5 1 effectiveness of aspiration levels to avoid a larger computational burden aspiration levels of decision makers are assigned before solving the multi objective linear fractional programming problems a linearization procedure is introduced to efficiently solve the above problems to avoid computational burden which can greatly increase the effectiveness of aspiration level after representing these imprecise aspiration levels the original model can be converted into linear fuzzy programming problem and then satisfactory solutions can be obtained thus the fundamental concept of the aspiration level is to introduce goal programming method to reach the highest respective membership values of these fuzzy goals for their ratio objectives given the results analysis based on the scenario 1 i e aspiration levels of the three objectives be 5 yuan m3 10 000 kg ha 30 kg m3 here the aspiration levels of these fractional objectives are set as 3 yuan m3 10 000 kg ha 30 kg m3 while the tolerance limits are reset as 2 yuan m3 5000 kg ha 10 kg m3 for comparison scenario 2 the constraints and other input parameters are kept the same for both scenarios optimal solutions indicate that results between two sets of aspiration levels remain same for example when credibility level is 0 8 optimal values of three ratio objectives are 2 832 yuan m3 6129 0 kg ha and 0 087 m3 kg accordingly the membership values of scenario 2 are achieved are μ 1 0 832 μ 2 0 426 and μ 3 0 075 based on eq 1h however the membership values of the scenario 1 are μ 1 0 277 μ 2 0 345 and μ 3 0 075 respectively it is obvious that the aspiration levels of scenario 2 are much closer to optimal ratio objectives it should be noted that these three objective goals are overly satisfied because their optimal values are lower than the assigned aspiration levels its mathematical meaning is that the over deviation values of the membership goals are happened and the practical meaning is that the desired ratio objective function values are overestimated by decision makers thus careful selection of aspiration levels is necessary in actual decision making 5 2 comparison of varying grain crop cultivation percentage this study considers the grain crop cultivation percentage constraints with global climate change crop disease outbreaks and trade disputes have severely impacted global food security it is significant that to coordinate food crop area to achieve multi objective effects in the food crisis this section will discuss the variations of multi objective results under different grain crop proportions taking the above mentioned scenario 2 under the credibility level 0 8 as an example the percentage of grain crop cultivation is assigned as 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 0 7 0 8 which implies that a higher weighting of spring wheat and maize planted area to the total area fig 5 shows optimal objective function values under varying grain crop percentages to compare their effects on the results overall the crop yield per unit of area has an obviously increased trend as the percentage increases namely it would be 5540 7 kg ha 6129 0 kg ha 6316 3 kg ha and 7022 7 kg ha 7262 1 kg ha 7671 2 kg ha when the percentage of grain crop cultivation is changed from 0 3 to 0 8 this can be explained by the crop yield of spring wheat and maize is much higher than sunflower thereby resulting in an overall increase in crop production however both the economic water productivity and grey water footprint of crop production are slightly reduced with a larger percentage of grain crop cultivation this trend is related to the attributes of the food crops i e high yields large irrigation quotas and low food prices when more area of grain crop is available the crop yield is much greater and the study area uses more water for irrigation leading to a reduction in both objectives the above analysis can also be supported by the solutions of crop area planning see fig 6 as the percentage increases from 0 3 to 0 8 the irrigated sunflower in each agricultural zone is reduced and the total irrigated area of sunflower in the study area is 268 119 2 ha p 0 3 227 049 9 ha p 0 4 202 132 8 ha p 0 5 157 212 4 ha p 0 6 115 022 5 ha p 0 7 and 75 045 3 ha p 0 8 respectively therefore by analyzing the results of the changing grain crops percentages it is possible to accommodate the situation of market and policy fluctuations and examines its impact on multiple objectives based on agricultural water food environment nexus 5 3 reliability of the study compared with previous studies on grey water footprint in the hid cao et al 2014 the total grey water footprint is 457 0 106 m3 587 2 106 m3 and 240 3 106 m3 182 5 106 m3 from 2005 to 2008 respectively accordingly the grey water footprint of grain production is 0 129 m3 kg 0 159 m3 kg and 0 062 m3 kg 0 043 m3 kg in this study the grey water footprint of crop production is approximately 0 088 m3 kg indicating that the study can be close to the actual situation and that the multi objective results obtained are informative the calculated value of the grey water footprint shows that the water used for salt discharge in the hid is much larger than the water used for surface source pollution and the main source of salt is the minerals contained in the diverted river water therefore the following measures should be taken to reduce grey water footprint including adopting water saving measures improve the use efficiency of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and enhancing grain yields by adjusting the cultivation pattern the above analysis shows that this study can provide reliable results through linking the agricultural water food environment nexus into crop area planning 6 conclusions this study presents a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach through integration of fuzzy credibility constrained programming and multi objective linear fractional programming within a modeling framework the developed method is capable of addressing fuzzy information existing in the objective and violated constraints based on fuzzy techniques for demonstration of practicality a case study in the hetao irrigation district in northwest china is presented for uniting the multiple objective problems in agricultural irrigation with crop area planning three competing ratio objectives in terms of maximum economic benefit per unit of irrigation water maximum crop yield per unit of irrigated area and minimal grey water footprint per unit of crop production are interconnected from the perspective of agricultural water food environment nexus an equivalent linearization process via linear fuzzy goal programming is introduced to efficiently solve the developed model therefore through given aspiration levels of objective goals and different credibility levels of constraints optimal solutions corresponding to system efficiency are flexibly obtained with less computational difficulties the results of crop area planning indicate that spring wheat is kept as the minimum values and the results of maize are most the same in agricultural zone under each scenario optimal objective values have slight changes associated with their objective forms of maximization or minimization although this study attempts to link agricultural water food environment nexus into crop area planning through the modeling framework it can also be applicable to other management problems when the multiple fractional objectives are to be addressed under uncertainties nevertheless it should be noted that these input parameters are static rather than dynamic which will lead to the results that cannot reflect dynamic interactions of agricultural water food environment nexus consequently integrating physical processes of water movement and solute transport into optimization modeling framework is desired for further improving crop area planning declaration of competing interest the

9142,to readily addressed three key issues including fuzzy parametric information multiple objectives and fractional ratios in planning problems this study presents a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach for building the linkage between agricultural water food environment nexus and crop area planning this approach is developed by incorporating fuzzy credibility constrained programming into multi objective linear fractional programming within the optimization model to demonstrate its applicability the approach is then applied to the hetao irrigation district in the northwest china to unite the multiple objective problems in agricultural irrigation with crop area planning three ratio optimization problems associated with agricultural economic and environmental objectives are concurrently considered including maximum economic benefit per unit of irrigation water maximum crop yield per unit of irrigated area and minimal grey water footprint per unit of crop production therefore this study has the following advantages 1 fuzzy parameters existing in the objective and violated constraints can be effectively tackled 2 the multiple ratio optimization problems can be efficiently solved through a linearization procedure in a straightforward manner thereby reflecting desired system efficiency and reducing computational difficulties 3 the mathematical and practical interactions of agricultural water food environment nexus can be investigated based on intermediate variables i e irrigated area irrigation water crop yield economic benefits and greywater footprint 4 optimal solutions can be flexibly generated to facilitate crop area planning through given aspiration levels of objective goals and credibility levels of constraints

interpretation of inter relationships among sustainable agricultural production efficient irrigation water use and favorable agro ecological conditions graphical abstract ga1 keywords agricultural water food environment nexus multi objective ratio optimization problems credibility interrelationships crop area planning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction agricultural irrigation water in arid areas accounts for more than 85 of the total water consumption and water resources have become a key factor limiting agricultural production and environmental health in irrigation areas kang et al 2017 optimal agricultural water management has a direct association with crop growth and food output and determines physical transformation processes of irrigation water which further affects the environmental health of the irrigation area jacobs et al 2016 if these interactions among multiple subsystems e g agricultural water food environment nexus in agricultural water management are ignored such negative phenomena as low water use efficiency and serious nutrient losses will occur while enhancing agricultural outputs in response to above concerns cai et al 2003 developed an integrated hydrologic agronomic economic model to address basin water management and irrigation induced salinity problems gordon et al 2010 provided the tradeoffs between food production and ecosystem services arisen from agriculture induced changes to manage agricultural water forni et al 2016 proposed integrated economic optimization model and climate driven hydrological models for optimal water allocation in the california s central valley capitanescu et al 2017 established a multi stage optimization model for farm management considering environmental and crop rotation constraints li et al 2018 applied a framework based on the multi region computable general equilibrium theory to analyze the social economic water cycling and the water land nexus singh 2019 used the mathematical models to manage irrigation induced salinization and drainage problems in irrigated areas however these studies have been undertaken in the case of relatively independent constraints without considering feedback of agricultural water food environment nexus in addition planning models are usually in pursuit of maximum economic social and environmental benefits or system efficiency i e output per unit of resource input if the system efficiency is the desired objective the form of its objective function will likely be a linear fractional equation this objective represents the ratio between profit and cost or consumed resource and it can be expressed as the benefits per unit of water used in the case of irrigated agriculture which can reflect system efficiency for example charnes et al 1978 proposed a new definition of system efficiency to evaluate activities in public programs gómez et al 2006 attempted to solve a forest planning problem through a linear fractional goal programing model besides studies based on the integration of inexact mathematical techniques and linear fractional programming have strengthened its applicability in addressing ratio objective problems and uncertainties e g interval fuzzy and random parameters variables in study system for instance zhu and huang 2011 developed a linear fractional programming approach in a random environment for waste management ren et al 2013 used a stochastic linear fractional programming model for optimization of industrial structure li et al 2016 developed an interval based irrigation water allocation model incorporating linear fractional programming zhang and guo 2018 investigated optimal irrigation water allocation based on a fuzzy linear fractional programming nevertheless it is noteworthy that the above studies focused on the single ratio objective through optimizing a single metric via linear fractional programming in practice multi objective linear fractional programming molfp problems are needed to be solved when facing multiple conflicting economic and environmental ratio objectives furthermore several studies had contributed to the solution process of molfp ammar 1998 defined and analyzed some notions regarding fuzzy parametric non smooth molfp problem chakraborty and gupta 2002 used fuzzy set theoretic approach to deal with molfp problems pal et al 2003 solved fuzzy molfp problems using a goal programming procedure iskander 2004 presented a possibility programming approach which is used to convert molfp into its deterministic crisp multi objective linear programming güzel and sivri 2005 provided a solution procedure via taylor series solution for solving molfp issues lotfi et al 2010 applied a geometrical interpretation and linear programming approach to test solution efficiency nayak and ojha 2019 derived the acceptable ranges of objective values for molfp problems with fuzzy parameters in both objectives and constraints yang et al 2020 proposed a solving algorithm for multi objective linear fractional programming with the superiority and inferiority measures borza and rambely 2021 treated the molfp problems through integrations of techniques including the membership functions of the objectives suitable non linear variable transformations and max min methods however these studies still cannot provide a relatively efficient solution processes and they are usually illustrated by numerical examples rather than real world case studies moreover the molfp is incapable of handling fuzzy parametric data and the violated fuzzy constraint that it is hold at quantified credibility level λ therefore fuzzy sets theory including possibility necessity and credibility was proposed to effectively deal with fuzzy uncertainties which is a mathematical counterpart of probability theory among these methods credibility theory is advanced from possibility and necessity theory because it s a more reasonable fuzzy inequality indicator due to its self duality liu and liu 2002 proposed credibility measure and thus fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp was derived to address these fuzzy violated constraints at predetermined credibility level in fact fccp method can deal with fuzzy parameters in single sided double sided of the constraints and credibility objectives because of convenient computational procedure rong and lahdelma 2008 lau et al 2010 pishvaee et al 2012 zhang et al 2015 2021 lu et al 2016 nevertheless few studies have incorporated fccp into molfp problems in practical applications especially in crop area planning problems therefore this study attempts to develop a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach for linking agricultural water food environment nexus with crop area planning in practice crop area planning is essential for agricultural water management because it can decide how much water should be allocated to different crops in the pursuit of desired goals karrou and oweis 2012 dai and li 2013 it s then applied to the hetao irrigation district in the northwest china for uniting the multiple objective problems in agricultural irrigation with crop area planning three ratio based problems regarding agriculture water and environment subsystems are considered including maximum economic water productivity i e economic benefit per unit of irrigation water maximum land productivity i e crop yield per unit of irrigated area and minimum environmental pollution degree i e grey water footprint per unit of crop production these objectives are interlinked through decision variables and mathematical interaction among these subsystems thereby investigating the interrelationship of agricultural water food environment nexus in crop area planning through introducing techniques of molfp and fccp this approach enables to deal with fuzzy parameters coefficients in the constraints and generate ratio based management strategies at varying credibility levels moreover a linearization procedure is employed to solve the multiple ratio objectives in a straightforward manner leading to high computational efficiency from the agricultural system planner perspective it can concurrently maximize agricultural output and irrigation water productivity while minimize negative environmental response therefore the optimized results are expected to provide decision support for efficient agricultural production and irrigation water use and effective mitigation of agricultural non point source pollution 2 methodology development the model framework is depicted in fig 1 each of these components is discussed according to fig 1 in the following section 2 1 multi objective linear fractional programming a general framework of multi objective linear fractional programming is formulated by incorporating linear fractional programming into multi objective linear programming it s presented as follows 1a optimize z k x c k x α k d k x β k k 1 2 k 1b s u b j e c t t o x s x r n a x b x 0 b r m where c k d k r n α k β k are constants and s φ generally d k x β k is assumed to be greater than 0 x s to solve the multi objective linear fractional programing fuzzy goal programming method and its linearized form of membership goals are adopted in the following steps 2 1 1 problem formulation in the solution process some aspiration levels are pre given to each ratio objective which are defined as fuzzy goals if we introduce the aspiration levels g k into the k th ratio objective z k x then the fuzzy goals can be presented 1c z k x g k f o r m a x i m i z i n g z k x 1d z k x g k f o r minimizing z k x where and represent the fuzziness of the aspiration levels and they can be interpreted as essentially more than and essentially less than based on zimmermann 1978 therefore the fuzzy linear fractional goal programming is written find x 1e t o s a t i s f y z k x g k k 1 2 k 1 1f z k x g k k k 1 1 k 1g s u b j e c t t o a x b x 0 here the fuzzy goals are stated by their membership functions pal et al 2003 for example the membership function μ k for the eq 1e is defined as 1h μ k 1 if z k x g k z k x l k g k l k if l k z k x g k 0 if z k x l k where l k is the lower tolerance limit for the k th fuzzy goal similarly the membership function μ k for the eq 1f is defined as 1i μ k 1 if z k x g k u k z k x u k g k ifg k z k x u k 0 if z k x u k where u k is the upper tolerance limit for the k th fuzzy goal 2 1 2 goal programming to tackle the above problems fuzzy goal programming is introduced because the achievement of the objective goals to each aspired level to the maximum possible is represented by the possible achievement of each membership value to the highest extent in a fuzzy decision environment in theory the highest degree of membership function is 1 hence according to the defined membership functions of eqs 1h and 1i their flexible membership goals with the aspired level 1 is presented 1j z k x l k g k l k d k d k 1 1k u k z k x u k g k d k d k 1 where d k 0 and d k 0 denote the under and over deviational variables from the aspired levels mathematically these two variables are introduced in the achievement function for minimizing them and that depend on the type of the objective functions to be optimized in this study only the under deviational variable d k is needed to be minimized to reach the aspired level of each fuzzy goal because the over deviation from fuzzy goals indicates the membership values are fully achieved due to the inherent nonlinearity in the eqs 1j and 1k a linearization form is derived to reduce computational difficulties in the solving procedure 2 1 3 linearization of membership goals the k th membership goal in eq 1j is written 1l p k z k x p k l k d k d k 1 where 1m p k 1 g k l k taking the expression of z k x from eq 1a into eq 1k the above goal is presented 1n p k c k x α k d k d k x β k d k d k x β k p k d k x β k where 1o p k 1 p k l k or 1p c k x d k d k x β k d k d k x β k g k where 1q c k p k c k p k d k g k p k β k p k α k similarly goal expressions for the membership goal in eq 1k can be derived to further simplify the eq 1p let d k d k d k x β k and d k d k d k x β k the linear form of the eq 1p can be presented as 1r c k x d k d k g k with d k d k 0 and d k d k 0 because d k d k 0 and d k x β k 0 therefore to minimize the under deviational variable d k means to minimize the d k d k x β k in fuzzy decision which is a fractional term and nonlinear one it should be mentioned that d k 0 indicate that a membership goal is fully achieved and d k 1 means that its achievement is 0 the following expressions are presented when d k 1 is involved into the solution process 1s d k d k x β k 1 i e 1t d k d k x β k as above discussed constraints associated with d k don t present in the model formulation 2 1 4 linear goal programming taking above solution procedures into consideration the fuzzy goal programming model can be formulated 1u f i n d x 1v t o m i n i m i z e f k 1 k w k d k 1w a n d s a t i s f y c k x d k d k g k 1x s u b j e c t t o a x b x 0 1y a n d d k d k x β k k 1 2 k 1z x 0 1aa d k d k 0 k 1 2 k where f is the fuzzy achievement function summing up the weighted under deviational variables d k w k is weighted coefficients w k 0 and k 1 2 k are the relative importance of achieving the aspirated level of each fuzzy goal based on this formulation w k is calculated as 1ab w k 1 g k l k for the defined μ k in eq 1h 1 u k g k for the defined μ k in eq 1i therefore multi objective linear fractional programming problems can be solved based on minimum fuzzy goal programming approach 2 2 fuzzy credibility constrained programming when the uncertain parameters cannot be characterized by probability distributions but be presented as fuzzy sets fuzzy credibility constrained programming fccp is used to handle fuzzy parameters coefficients existing in objective and constraints in the optimization model and generate a series of flexible solutions under pre determined credibility levels based on the definition of credibility it can reflect the satisfaction degree of study system corresponding to each credibility level thereby leading to constraint violation risk thus it can support in depth analysis among optimal solutions satisfaction degree and system violation risk a general fccp method is presented 2a max f j 1 n c j x j 2b s t c r j 1 n a i j x j b i α i i 1 2 i 2c x j 0 j 1 2 j where x x 1 x 2 x n is a vector of non fuzzy decision variables c j denote coefficients in the objective function a i j and b i are fuzzy coefficients variables in constraints i and j are numbers of constraints and variables inequality 2b shows that the credibility of constraints i e fuzzy events j 1 n a i j x j b i should be not less than predefined α i fuzzy uncertainty may exist in the single or double sided constraints taking fuzzy credibility constraint c r ε ξ as an example where ε ε 1 ε 2 ε 3 and ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ 3 its fuzzy membership function μ can be formulated as 2d c r ε ξ 1 if ε 3 ξ 1 ε 3 2 ε 2 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 2 ε 3 ε 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 if ε 2 ξ 2 ε 3 ξ 1 ξ 3 ε 1 2 ξ 3 ξ 2 ε 2 ε 1 if ε 2 ξ 2 ε 1 ξ 3 0 if ε 1 ξ 3 2e s i m i l a r l y c r ε ξ 1 if ε ξ 1 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 ε 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 if ξ 1 ε ξ 2 ξ 3 ε 2 ξ 3 ξ 2 if ξ 2 ε ξ 3 0 if ε ξ 3 2f c r ε ξ 0 if ξ ε 1 ξ ε 1 2 ε 2 ε 1 if ε 1 ξ ε 2 ξ ε 3 2 ε 2 2 ε 3 ε 2 if ε 2 ξ ε 3 1 if ξ ε 3 it may be noted that meaningful and effective decision should be make when credibility is greater than 0 5 therefore when α i 0 5 eqs 2d 2e and 2f can be transformed into their deterministic crisps 2g c r ε ξ α ε 3 2 ε 2 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 2 ε 3 ε 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 α 2h c r ε ξ α 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 ε 2 ξ 2 ξ 1 α 2i c r ε ξ α ξ ε 3 2 ε 2 2 ε 3 ε 2 α thus fccp method can be readily solved though eqs 2g 2h and 2i moreover credibility level is a predefined semantic level for the satisfaction degree of constraints in the decision environment to reflect the decision makers preference its practical implication is to make decisions under different constraint violation risks by accommodating the degree of constraint satisfaction a higher credibility level corresponds to a higher feasibility and a lower system failure risk which will naturally lead to less decision domain nevertheless it cannot deal with multiple ratio objective problems to integrate fccp method into molfp framework is an effective method to address above concerns 2 3 fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming in response to above concerns a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach is developed the general form of model is presented as follows 3a optimize z k x c k x α k d k x β k k 1 2 k 3b s t c r j 1 n a i j x j b i α i i 1 2 i 3c x j 0 j 1 2 j where c k d k r n α k β k are constants and k is the number of ratio objective x j is non fuzzy decision variables a i j and b i are fuzzy coefficients variables in constraints i and j are numbers of constraints and variables 2 4 solution process the detailed solution processes can be summarized to generate optimal solutions step 1 formulate fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach step 2 introduce the aspiration levels g k into the kth ratio objective z k x to present the fuzzy goal see eqs 1c and 1d step 3 define the membership functions μ k of fuzzy goals based on their tolerance limits l k see eqs 1h and 1i step 4 formulate fuzzy goal programming to achieve their highest membership values i e d k and d k see eqs 1j and 1k step 5 rewrite the kth membership goals through linearized expressions see eq 1r step 6 given a certain level of credibility of constraint and convert fuzzy constraints into deterministic crisps see eqs 2g 2h and 2i step 7 solve the above fuzzy goal programming based on classical linear programming under a certain level credibility step 8 repeat steps 2 7 under different aspiration levels of ratio objectives and credibility levels of constraints and generate the final solutions 3 application 3 1 overview of the study region the hetao irrigation district hid is located in the western part of inner mongolia autonomous region 40 19 41 18 n 109 26 112 06 e see fig 2 it is 50 km wide from north to south and about 250 km long from east to west with an average altitude of 1050 m the hid is one of the three major irrigation districts in china with a total area of 1 19 106 ha and a planned irrigation area of 0 73 106 ha there are five irrigation subareas within the hid namely ulaanbaatar ub jiefangzha jfz yongji yj yichang yc and ulaat ut the tree shaped irrigation canal system in the irrigation area is divided into 7 levels namely general trunk canal trunk canal sub trunk canal branch canal lateral canal agricultural canal and furrow canal the irrigation induced drainage water passes through various levels of sub trunk ditches and truck ditches then sinks into the general trunk ditch of the hid and finally ends up with the ulansu sea as the drainage carrying area the whole irrigation area has 1 general trunk canal 13 trunk canals 48 sub trunk canals and 86 000 subordinate canal systems the drainage system has 1 general drainage trunk ditch 12 trunk ditches 59 sub trunk ditches and 17 000 subordinate ditches the average annual precipitation is 140 mm and precipitation from june to september accounts for 70 of the total volume its average annual evaporation is 2000 mm e20 pan and evaporation from may to august contributes over 50 of the total annual volume thus this is a region where there is no agriculture without irrigation it has a relatively short frost free period 130 150 days and usually only one crop can be sown during crop growth period the region has long sunshine hours with over 3 000 h of sunshine throughout the year making it one of the most resourceful areas for light energy in china spring wheat maize and sunflower are mainly planted in this area from late march to late september approximately 90 of the available water is used for irrigation and this percentage is significantly higher than the overall national average i e 64 due to drought and low precipitation these crops are generally irrigated 5 8 times with water from the yellow river i e the only source of irrigation depending on precipitation fertilizers applied in this area are mainly phosphorus and nitrogen fertilizers and the amount of fertilizer application is increasing annually water and fertilizer are the two limiting factors for agricultural development but long term irrational irrigation patterns and unscientific practices of fertilizer application have caused the water resources waste and the worsening ecological environment 3 2 problem statement currently the average annual amount of water diverted from the yellow river to study area is about 4 8 109 m3 which is 7 lower than the average water volume in the 1990 s i e 5 2 109 m3 moreover the future water diversion to the hid should be less than 4 0 109 m3 as required by government planning therefore it is essential to enhance water productivity and alleviate water conflicts by promoting high water efficient agriculture however it may also induce the risk of soil salinity accumulation to some extent in practice annual average salt concentration of the irrigation water from the yellow river is 0 5 g l as flood irrigation with excessive water is the main irrigation method in addition to the high evaporation and shallow groundwater depth large amounts of salts are accumulated and eventually stored in the soil of the hid leading to soil salinization problems also large irrigation quota has led to serious loss of nutrients from farmlands i e nitrogen and phosphorus and thus aggravated irrigation induced non point source pollution such problems are caused by the more pursuit of agricultural output in agricultural water management there is a need to identify the interaction processes of agricultural water food environment nexus and to quantitatively characterize the response relationship between them the challenge faced by agricultural water management in irrigation areas is how to collaboratively balance agricultural production water use efficiency and environmental health therefore except for considering the economic benefits of grain output multiple objectives problems such as improving irrigation water efficiency controlling soil salination and reducing agricultural non point source pollution are urgent issues to be addressed in irrigated agriculture as an indispensable part of agricultural water management crop area planning is the basis for making annual water use plans for irrigation districts it determines optimal solutions of irrigation water i e irrigated area for different crops and finally achieves specific objectives within the constraints of meeting resource and environmental capacity furthermore many input parameters are inaccessible or are unavailable with sufficient data such as detailed amount of irrigation diversions and daily market prices water use percentages inexact mathematical methods are the effective way to deal with uncertain information existing in objective function and constraints also the multi objective linear programming fails to consider ratio optimization problems and the existence of realistic uncertainties therefore techniques of inexact mathematical methods and linear fractional programming should be incorporated into the modeling framework of multi objective linear programming to solve crop area planning problems considering agricultural water food environment nexus thereby providing more realistic and flexible solutions for crop area planning under uncertainty 3 3 model formulation through involving agricultural water food environment nexus into the modeling framework a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach is developed for crop area planning under uncertainty three conflicting ratio objectives are formulated through linking agricultural water food environment nexus into crop area planning its formulation is presented below 3 3 1 objective function 4a max f 1 b c 1 c 2 c 3 i 1 5 j 1 3 a i j 1 μ i i q t i j μ i i q s i j 4b max f 2 i 1 5 j 1 3 a

irrigation water use indicating that economic water productivity is to be measured yuan m3 f 2 is maximum crop yield per unit of irrigated area which can reflect land productivity and provide more availability of food security kg ha f 3 is minimal grey water footprint per unit of crop production i e the amount of water needed to dilute new pollutants from crop production to the environmental critical concentration during the crop growth period m3 kg this is an environment related ratio objective that to minimize the environmental pollution degree in the agricultural production process it should be noted that the third objective is the form of minimization which can be solved by converting its reciprocal into the maximized form by doing so it s the same form as the first two objective as a prerequisite for further solving the above three ratio objectives are interlinked by intermediate variables such as irrigation area irrigation water use crop yield and pollutants in study system b is the total economic returns from agricultural production yuan c 1 is the total cost of irrigation water use yuan c 2 is the total cost of agricultural production except water use yuan and c 3 is water saving equipment investment costs because water saving measures are adopted in a portion of irrigation area yuan a i j is decision variable representing irrigated area for crop j in zone i ha i

and crop yield kg ha per unit of area under traditional irrigation pattern i q s i j and y s i j are irrigation quota m3 ha and crop yield kg ha per unit of area under water saving irrigation pattern μ i is proportion of water saving irrigation area in zone i which is introduced to reveal the state of development of water saving agriculture p w i is price of water use in zone i yuan m3 p c i j c p i j and c s i j are price of crop yuan kg cost of agricultural production yuan kg and investment cost of water saving equipment yuan ha for crop j in zone i respectively max g w f n p g w f p m is to calculate the maximum grey water footprint the amount of water required to dilute the added pollutants is determined by the pollutant that requires the greatest amount of dilution which is quantitatively equal to the dilution of that pollutant in this study grey water footprint arisen from agricultural non point pollution g w f n p and irrigation induced salinity g w f p m are considered there are three types of agricultural non point pollutants including nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer and pesticides while salinity factor mainly includes regionally accumulated salts therefore grey water footprint of the mth agricultural non point pollutant is calculated as 4h g w f n p m p u l m a c max m c n a t m q p m c max m c n a t m where g w f n p m is the grey water footprint of mth agricultural non point pollutant m3 p u l m is agricultural land loss per unit of area of the mth agricultural non point pollutant kg m3 a is irrigated area m2 c max m and c n a t m are the maximum allowable concentration and background concentration of the mth agricultural non point pollutant kg m3 q p m is the total non point pollutant loss kg where q p m λ m q t m λ m is the rate of pollutant loss and q t is the total fertilizer applications of the mth agricultural non point pollutant kg therefore grey water footprint of agricultural non point pollutant is 4i g w f n p max g w f n p 1 g w f n p 2 g w f n p 3 where g w f n p 1 g w f n p 2 and g w f n p 3 are grey water foot print of nitrogen fertilizer phosphate fertilizer and pesticides respectively m3 besides the amount of water required to dilute regional salt accumulation is 4j g w f p m m c max c n a t where c max and c n a t are the maximum allowable concentration and background concentration of the accumulate salt kg m3 m is salt newly added to the region during the year kg since the grey water footprint calculations for g w f n p and g w f p m are done for different components the total grey water footprint g w f is determined as the maximum value of g w f n p and g w f p m for the same period that is 4k g w f max g w f n p g w f p m max max g w f n p 1 g w f n p 2 g w f n p 3 g w f p m 3

according to field experimental data from du et al 2011 maximum threshold values of total nitrogen and phosphorus are obtained from cao et al 2014 water availabilities are presented as triangular fuzzy numbers the data used to determine the available water was collected from the general administration of hetao irrigation district triangular fuzzy number is presented as a a 1 a 2 a 3 where a 1 a 2 and a 3 are the least possible value main value and the largest possible value a 1 and a 3 are generally calculated though interval estimation with 95 confidence level based on t distribution because the variance of collected data is unknown a 2 is usually determined by the mean value of sample therefore water availability can be obtained based on the total amount of diverted water from 1990 to 2018 q s 3985 4150 4315 106 m3 4 results analysis in this study three sets of parameters are crucial for solving the model and generating decision alternatives fuzzy aspiration levels and tolerance limits for three ratio fuzzy goals as well as predefined credibility levels for constraints fuzzy aspiration level and tolerance limit are given based on the desired decision making goals which will depend on the allowable tolerance value of violated aspirated level of each fuzzy objective here the fuzzy aspiration levels of the three objectives are set as 5 yuan m3 10 000 kg ha 30 kg m3 and the tolerance limits of the three objectives be 2 yuan m3 4000 kg ha 10 kg m3 in general credibility levels from β 1 0 to β 0 has a clear definition and decision making guidelines individually based on fuzzy linguistic scale proposed by jiménez et al 2007 detailedly β 1 0 denotes completely acceptable solution β 0 9 corresponds to practically acceptable solution β 0 8 is associated with almost acceptable solution and β 0 7 is very acceptable solution to examine the variations of optimal results under varying credibility levels three scenarios for the constraints are introduced that is credibility level of α k β k and ξ k in the constraints of eqs 4l 4p and 4q are all designed as 0 7 0 8 and 0 9 respectively therefore based on the model inputs optimal solutions can be generated to support crop area planning 4 1 optimal solutions of crop area planning under three scenarios fig 3 presents optimal solutions of crop area planning under three scenarios overall under each scenario the irrigated area for crops would be kept almost the same especially for spring wheat and sunflower they would not change much among scenarios for example when α k β k and ξ k are given as from 0 7 to 0 9 the irrigated area for spring wheat in each agricultural zone is 2000 ha 8053 ha 11 228 ha 9507 ha and 6012 ha and the irrigated area for sunflower is 27 830 ha 24 752 ha 40 485 ha 77 853 ha and 56 129 ha respectively the results of spring wheat are taken as the minimum values in the constraints this is mainly due to its lower economic benefits and larger irrigation demands such results achieve the maximum economic water productivity as required by the model structure whereas only the irrigated area for sunflower in yj is taken the least bound of constraint additionally for maize under each scenario the results are most the same in agricultural zone ub jfz and yc ut on the contrary the irrigated area in agricultural zone yj has a decline trend with the variation of credibility levels from 0 7 to 0 9 through introducing credibility theory the model makes it possible to offer flexible solutions with quantified credibility level of constraint satisfaction generally optimal solutions of crop area can provide linkage among three objectives regarding irrigation water use crop yield and irrigation induced grey water footprint thus these solutions can attribute to the following objective function values 4 2 optimal values of three ratio objectives under three scenarios fig 4 compares optimal values of three ratio objectives from scenario 0 7 0 9 three conflicting ratio objectives are interlinked and solved though the proposed model simultaneously and the results can reflect system efficiency from the perspective of agriculture water and environment subsystems as defined each objective arises in real world situations because it frequently happens that decision makers or stakeholders are faced with the problems of pursuing better ratios e g economic water productivity land productivity between several parameters for economic water productivity optimal objective values have slight changes from 2 833 yuan m3 to 2 831 yuan m3 among scenarios for land productivity it is decreased from 6168 kg ha to 6089 kg ha as the credibility level rises contrarily the negative environmental effects i e grey water footprint of crop production would be slightly increased from 0 086 m3 kg to 0 088 m3 kg at an increased credibility level in other words the difference among three objectives can be explained by their objective forms of maximization or minimization in general these trends provide the tradeoff among objective values credibility level and constraint violation risk it is obvious that a lower credibility level would lead to a higher system efficiency associated with a higher system failure risk even through it has the mostly relaxed decision domain by comparing the results of the three ratio objectives it is found that the analysis of systemic interaction of agricultural water food environment nexus is realized by the intermediate variable crop area which can ultimately make crop planting plans therefore this study enables to provide solutions concerning improving economic water productivity land productivity and reducing negative environmental effects i e minimum grey water footprint per unit of crop production under different credibility levels and system reliability conditions 5 discussion this study attempts to propose a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach to link agricultural water food environment nexus into crop area planning within the modeling framework economic water productivity and land productivity allow for the establishment of linkages between subsystems of agriculture and water grey water footprint bridges subsystems of water and environment and the third objective i e grey water footprint per unit of crop production represents the relationship between subsystems of agriculture and environment to further analyze the significance and practicality of the study the theoretical and practical perspectives are discussed hereafter 5 1 effectiveness of aspiration levels to avoid a larger computational burden aspiration levels of decision makers are assigned before solving the multi objective linear fractional programming problems a linearization procedure is introduced to efficiently solve the above problems to avoid computational burden which can greatly increase the effectiveness of aspiration level after representing these imprecise aspiration levels the original model can be converted into linear fuzzy programming problem and then satisfactory solutions can be obtained thus the fundamental concept of the aspiration level is to introduce goal programming method to reach the highest respective membership values of these fuzzy goals for their ratio objectives given the results analysis based on the scenario 1 i e aspiration levels of the three objectives be 5 yuan m3 10 000 kg ha 30 kg m3 here the aspiration levels of these fractional objectives are set as 3 yuan m3 10 000 kg ha 30 kg m3 while the tolerance limits are reset as 2 yuan m3 5000 kg ha 10 kg m3 for comparison scenario 2 the constraints and other input parameters are kept the same for both scenarios optimal solutions indicate that results between two sets of aspiration levels remain same for example when credibility level is 0 8 optimal values of three ratio objectives are 2 832 yuan m3 6129 0 kg ha and 0 087 m3 kg accordingly the membership values of scenario 2 are achieved are μ 1 0 832 μ 2 0 426 and μ 3 0 075 based on eq 1h however the membership values of the scenario 1 are μ 1 0 277 μ 2 0 345 and μ 3 0 075 respectively it is obvious that the aspiration levels of scenario 2 are much closer to optimal ratio objectives it should be noted that these three objective goals are overly satisfied because their optimal values are lower than the assigned aspiration levels its mathematical meaning is that the over deviation values of the membership goals are happened and the practical meaning is that the desired ratio objective function values are overestimated by decision makers thus careful selection of aspiration levels is necessary in actual decision making 5 2 comparison of varying grain crop cultivation percentage this study considers the grain crop cultivation percentage constraints with global climate change crop disease outbreaks and trade disputes have severely impacted global food security it is significant that to coordinate food crop area to achieve multi objective effects in the food crisis this section will discuss the variations of multi objective results under different grain crop proportions taking the above mentioned scenario 2 under the credibility level 0 8 as an example the percentage of grain crop cultivation is assigned as 0 3 0 4 0 5 and 0 6 0 7 0 8 which implies that a higher weighting of spring wheat and maize planted area to the total area fig 5 shows optimal objective function values under varying grain crop percentages to compare their effects on the results overall the crop yield per unit of area has an obviously increased trend as the percentage increases namely it would be 5540 7 kg ha 6129 0 kg ha 6316 3 kg ha and 7022 7 kg ha 7262 1 kg ha 7671 2 kg ha when the percentage of grain crop cultivation is changed from 0 3 to 0 8 this can be explained by the crop yield of spring wheat and maize is much higher than sunflower thereby resulting in an overall increase in crop production however both the economic water productivity and grey water footprint of crop production are slightly reduced with a larger percentage of grain crop cultivation this trend is related to the attributes of the food crops i e high yields large irrigation quotas and low food prices when more area of grain crop is available the crop yield is much greater and the study area uses more water for irrigation leading to a reduction in both objectives the above analysis can also be supported by the solutions of crop area planning see fig 6 as the percentage increases from 0 3 to 0 8 the irrigated sunflower in each agricultural zone is reduced and the total irrigated area of sunflower in the study area is 268 119 2 ha p 0 3 227 049 9 ha p 0 4 202 132 8 ha p 0 5 157 212 4 ha p 0 6 115 022 5 ha p 0 7 and 75 045 3 ha p 0 8 respectively therefore by analyzing the results of the changing grain crops percentages it is possible to accommodate the situation of market and policy fluctuations and examines its impact on multiple objectives based on agricultural water food environment nexus 5 3 reliability of the study compared with previous studies on grey water footprint in the hid cao et al 2014 the total grey water footprint is 457 0 106 m3 587 2 106 m3 and 240 3 106 m3 182 5 106 m3 from 2005 to 2008 respectively accordingly the grey water footprint of grain production is 0 129 m3 kg 0 159 m3 kg and 0 062 m3 kg 0 043 m3 kg in this study the grey water footprint of crop production is approximately 0 088 m3 kg indicating that the study can be close to the actual situation and that the multi objective results obtained are informative the calculated value of the grey water footprint shows that the water used for salt discharge in the hid is much larger than the water used for surface source pollution and the main source of salt is the minerals contained in the diverted river water therefore the following measures should be taken to reduce grey water footprint including adopting water saving measures improve the use efficiency of chemical fertilizers and pesticides and enhancing grain yields by adjusting the cultivation pattern the above analysis shows that this study can provide reliable results through linking the agricultural water food environment nexus into crop area planning 6 conclusions this study presents a fuzzy credibility based multi objective linear fractional programming approach through integration of fuzzy credibility constrained programming and multi objective linear fractional programming within a modeling framework the developed method is capable of addressing fuzzy information existing in the objective and violated constraints based on fuzzy techniques for demonstration of practicality a case study in the hetao irrigation district in northwest china is presented for uniting the multiple objective problems in agricultural irrigation with crop area planning three competing ratio objectives in terms of maximum economic benefit per unit of irrigation water maximum crop yield per unit of irrigated area and minimal grey water footprint per unit of crop production are interconnected from the perspective of agricultural water food environment nexus an equivalent linearization process via linear fuzzy goal programming is introduced to efficiently solve the developed model therefore through given aspiration levels of objective goals and different credibility levels of constraints optimal solutions corresponding to system efficiency are flexibly obtained with less computational difficulties the results of crop area planning indicate that spring wheat is kept as the minimum values and the results of maize are most the same in agricultural zone under each scenario optimal objective values have slight changes associated with their objective forms of maximization or minimization although this study attempts to link agricultural water food environment nexus into crop area planning through the modeling framework it can also be applicable to other management problems when the multiple fractional objectives are to be addressed under uncertainties nevertheless it should be noted that these input parameters are static rather than dynamic which will lead to the results that cannot reflect dynamic interactions of agricultural water food environment nexus consequently integrating physical processes of water movement and solute transport into optimization modeling framework is desired for further improving crop area planning declaration of competing interest the

9143,sprinkler irrigation has been widely used for winter wheat crops in the north china plain ncp to maintain high crop yield and enhance water use efficiency because water resources are scarce determining the accurate crop evapotranspiration etc and crop coefficient k c of winter wheat is critical for optimizing sprinkler irrigation management in this study an eddy covariance system was deployed in a sprinkler irrigation field to measure the energy balance components net radiation rn soil heat flux g sensible heat h latent heat le and calculate etc and k c the wheat growth parameters and yield were also investigated the results showed that the energy balance closure rate the rate of daily le h to rn g was 0 89 indicating a sufficient energy balance closure seasonal total le flux accounted for 67 of the total available energy rn g the seasonal etc values were 434 and 396 mm during the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 growing seasons respectively which are comparable to those 400 470 mm under surface irrigation the mean daily etc was 0 87 0 46 3 24 4 81 and 3 94 mm day 1 in the early growth overwintering rapid growth middle and late growth stages respectively the corresponding k c values were 0 77 0 47 1 09 1 14 and 0 70 the k c values were close to those reported in the fao 56 paper the k c is positively related to the leaf area index lai and their relationship was fitted as k c 0 87 0 14 ln lai r 2 0 96 for an lai range of 1 7 where ln is a natural logarithm function the measured wheat grain yield was 9100 and 9857 kg ha 1 and the water productivity wp was 2 07 and 2 49 kg m 3 in the two seasons respectively both factors are approximately 30 higher than those 7200 kg ha 1 1 68 kg m 3 reported by other studies considering the high wheat yield and comparable crop etc sprinkler irrigation is recommended for application on the ncp the seasonal etc of 400 430 mm and the obtained k c values in this study can be used to make sprinkler irrigation scheduling for winter wheat on the ncp keywords winter wheat yield crop evapotranspiration water use efficiency energy balance sprinkler irrigation scheduling data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the north china plain ncp known as china s granary produces approximately 60 of the national wheat and 30 maize qiu et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 winter wheat is a high water consumption crop and grows in minor rainfall seasons generally from october to june therefore irrigation is crucial to compensate for the water deficit between annual wheat evapotranspiration 400 500 mm and rainfall 150 mm which ultimately enhances wheat production liu et al 2013 long term groundwater over pumping for irrigation causes water level decline at approximately 1 m per year and consequently results in land subsidence risk zhang et al 2021 approximately 99 of irrigation water is lost in agricultural lands through crop evapotranspiration rana and katerji 2000 therefore accurate estimation of field evapotranspiration etc could help farmers optimize irrigation scheduling and finally improve irrigation water use efficiency and crop production especially in the water scarce region of ncp in recent decades many water saving irrigation technologies have been studied and used such as drip irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation and sprinkler irrigation liu et al 2001 fang et al 2018 kharrou et al 2011 wang et al 2015 as a highly efficient and automatic irrigation technology the sprinkler irrigation method has been adopted worldwide and in china yan et al 2020 based on the data in the international commission on irrigation and drainage icid sprinkler irrigated fields account for on average 47 1 of the total irrigation area in developed countries for example the usa canada and france 10 5 in emerging developing countries for example china india and iran and 8 4 in the least developed countries dataset international commission on irrigation and drainage 2021 by the end of 2020 the total area of sprinkler irrigation in china was 4 6 mha accounting for 6 3 of the entire chinese irrigation area in the ncp the sprinkler irrigated area is 0 74 mha in 2020 and accounted for 16 of the total sprinkler irrigated area in china increasing the sprinkler irrigated areas promoted the irrigation water use efficiency to 0 565 ministry of water resources p r c 2020 2020 compared with drip and surface irrigation the evaporation of water droplets in sprinkler irrigation differs in terms of canopy water interception energy balance and microclimate of sprinkler crops liu et al 2002b most studies reported that in sprinkler irrigated farmlands the air temperature decreased and the relative humidity increased leading to a lower vapor pressure deficit cavero et al 2009 jiang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 in this case martínez cob et al 2008 using a weighing lysimeter to measure the transpiration of plants under sprinkler irrigation conditions found that crop etc decreased with sprinkler irrigation compared with the rainfed treatment similarly urrego pereira et al 2013 found that the transpiration rate at the leaf scale measured by a photosynthesis instrument decreased by 0 22 0 28 mm h 1 during the sprinkler irrigation period compared to the nonirrigated condition which was a consequence of the decrease in air temperature and vapor pressure deficit in addition liu et al 2003 investigated the potential evaporation using a 20 cm pan placed at the winter wheat canopy top in both sprinkler and surface irrigation conditions and reported that the water evaporation from winter wheat regreening to harvest i e from the beginning of march beginning to the middle of june in the sprinkler irrigated field was 17 6 mm lower than that in the surface irrigation field additionally they reported that the evaporation decreased trend in the dry season was much stronger than that in the wet season in addition some studies showed that compared to surface irrigation sprinkler irrigation could increase water productivity ratio of yield to crop etc by 18 57 improve irrigation water productivity the ratio of yield to irrigation water by 21 81 and significantly increase crop yield gong et al 2001 li et al 2019 liu et al 2013 however it is still argued that droplet and canopy interception evaporation could reduce water use efficiency and increase crop evapotranspiration etc uddin and murphy 2020 therefore determining wheat etc is vital for optimizing sprinkler irrigation scheduling improving water use efficiency saving water resources in the ncp and enhancing sustainable agricultural development the crop coefficient k c the ratio of crop evapotranspiration without water or any other limitation etc to reference crop evapotranspiration eto has been widely used to estimate crop water requirements and manage irrigation schedules howell et al 2006 the crop coefficient depends on the crop type growth stage growth conditions and irrigation method yarami et al 2011 in ncp the k c for winter wheat has been studied and ranged from 0 74 to 1 04 under surface irrigation conditions liu and luo 2010 yang et al 2022 zhang et al 2004b in sprinkler irrigation the seasonal mean k c for winter wheat was 0 74 su et al 2005 and it was 0 63 0 75 under drip irrigation gao et al 2014 clearly winter wheat k c varies with the irrigation method and wheat species therefore it is important to determine the seasonal curve of k c for winter wheat under sprinkler irrigation this could help estimate wheat etc and optimize sprinkler irrigation scheduling based on the wheat water requirement eventually it could improve the water use efficiency and enhance winter wheat yield considering optimizing sprinkler irrigation scheduling to cope with water scarcity in the ncp the main objectives of this study are to 1 determine the daily crop etc under sprinkler irrigation over the entire wheat season 2 analyze the energy balance and its variation under sprinkler irrigation and 3 evaluate the seasonal change in crop coefficient k c in sprinkler irrigated wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experimental field was located at dacaozhuang seed breeding station ningjin county hebei province china longitude 114 56 latitude 37 30 altitude 26 m the station area is approximately 15 ha and is surrounded by agricultural fields the wheat and maize rotation cultivation system is the main cropping pattern at the station and in the study region all wheat at the station and approximately 1500 ha fields around the station are irrigated using a sprinkler irrigation system the climate zone is a warm temperate semiarid monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 12 8 c the annual average precipitation is 449 mm which is approximately 60 during the summer and the frost free period is approximately 200 d the annual average sunshine duration is 2538 h and the wind speed is 2 3 2 7 m s 1 the prevailing wind direction is south in the winter wheat season and southwest wind in the summer maize season at the experimental station the field water hold capacity ranged from 0 36 to 0 38 cm3 cm 3 and the soil texture data are shown in table 1 in the two experimental seasons 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the winter wheat varieties were yingbo 700 and yuanmai 32 respectively both varieties are widely planted in the study region the winter wheat was sown on 22 october in 2019 and 21 october in 2020 with a row spacing of 20 cm and a sowing rate of 443 kg ha 1 the cultivation practices including fertilization pest control plant disease and weed control were similar to those in the region the fertilization rates in the two wheat seasons were 200 kg ha 1 n 90 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 60 kg ha 1 k2o the base nitrogen application was 40 kg ha 1 and all phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied as base fertilizers and were spread by machine following fertilization the soil was plowed leveled and prepared for seed sowing a topdressing nitrogen amount of 160 kg ha 1 was applied to the field using a fertigation system deployed in the head of the sprinkler system three times at the regreening jointing and grain filling stages with 53 kg ha 1 each time the topdressing n fertilizer was urea due to its high solubility 2 2 irrigation management the winter wheat was first irrigated soon after sowing aiming to provide sufficient water content for seed germination the second irrigation called winter irrigation was given before the winter to provide enough soil water to support wheat seedlings over the long and dry winter after wheat regreening in march the sprinkler irrigation scheduling performed based on the pan method proposed by liu et al 2011 with this sprinkler irrigation schedule wheat will grow under non water stress conditions liu et al 2011 the sprinkler irrigation amount each time was based on the water evaporation of a 20 cm pan model adm7 tianjin china located approximately 5 cm above the crop canopy liu et al 2011 the irrigation amount i in mm was estimated using the equation i epan p 0 65 where epan and p both in mm are the pan evaporation and precipitation accumulated after the previous irrigation respectively liu et al 2011 the irrigation events and the corresponding amounts in the two experimental seasons are shown in table 2 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 energy and water vapor fluxes the eddy covariance ec system measured the water vapor and sensible heat fluxes the ec system was deployed at the center of a 200 m long south north direction and 60 m wide field east west direction in which wheat was sprinkler irrigated based on the irrigation scheduling management by liu et al 2011 around this measurement field wheat fields of approximately 1500 ha were also sprinklers irrigated 2 4 times with 60 100 mm water depth per irrigation the dominant wind during the wheat growth period came from the south the ec system was installed on a height adjustable tripod sensors were positioned 1 5 m above the soil surface and approximately 0 7 m above the canopy top at the middle growth stage by considering the wheat height of approximately 0 8 m therefore the ec system was approximately 1 m above the canopy zero plane displacement height 0 5 m which yield a fetch ratio of 1 100 by considering the 100 m fetch the flux footprint distribution data show 90 of the accumulated latent heat flux coming from 45 to 100 m length away from the ec system at the upwind direction suppl fig 1 this shows the 100 m available fetch for the south wind was sufficient for reliable flux measurements in the experimental field in addition the large sprinkler irrigated area of 1500 ha surrounding the experimental field provided enough fetch for ec system measurement the ec system consisted of a 3d ultrasonic anemometer model csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa for measuring three dimensional wind speed and sonic temperature and an open path infrared gas h2o and co2 analyzer model li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa for measuring h2o and co2 concentrations the ec sensors were sampled at 10 hz a data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa was used for data acquisition and storage 2 3 2 field microclimate the field microclimate was measured at 2 m height at the same site as the ec system an air temperature and humidity probe model hmp45c vaisala inc woburn ma usa was used to measure air temperature and relative humidity the net radiation rn was measured by a net radiometer model nr lite kipp zonen delft netherlands the wind speed was measured with a 3 cup anemometer model ec 9s jinzhou sunshine meteorological instrument corporation jinzhou china three soil heat flux plates model hfp01 huskeflux thermal sensors the netherlands were installed at depths of 5 5 and 10 cm to measure the soil heat flux at the soil surface a rain gauge model tr525 texas electronics texas usa deployed at 1 m height was used to measure rainfall all these sensors were connected to another data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa for data acquisition and storage the sampling intervals were 10 s and 30 minutes averages were stored and used in data processing 2 3 3 soil water content the soil water content was determined using the gravimetric method in the two seasons soil samples were collected from a depth of 0 200 cm depth at 20 cm intervals at the beginning and end of each season and every two weeks from winter wheat regreening to harvest the measured mass soil water content was converted to volumetric soil water content vwc cm3 cm 3 by considering the soil bulk density in each layer table 1 2 3 4 plant parameters and yield leaf area and plant density were measured every two weeks during the growing season from april to june plant numbers in three 1 m long rows were manually counted and mean values were calculated then the plant density was calculated by considering a row spacing of 20 cm leaf area was measured by a portable leaf area meter li 3000c li cor inc usa the leaf area index lai was determined using the mean leaf area per plant and the plant density yu et al 2009 at harvest time fifteen 1 m2 plots from south to north were chosen and all plants in each sample plot were harvested then the grains in each sample plot were threshed with a special threshing machine the water content of the wheat grains in each plot was determined and finally converted to final grain yield with a water content of 13 2 4 data analysis eddy covariance raw data were processed by eddypro software version 4 0 li cor inc lincoln ne usa to obtain the average latent heat and sensible heat fluxes at 30 min time intervals half hourly latent heat fluxes were summed on a daily timescale to obtain daily et in mm day 1 the original data observed using the ec method were corrected by eddypro software following the recommendations in the handbook eddy covariance method burba 2013 in this study the half hourly turbulent fluxes and meteorological data were carefully checked and spurious data points caused by instrument malfunction sensor maintenance or bad weather were removed the calculations of sensible heat h and latent heat le fluxes were based on the following equations 1 h p a c p w t 2 le l v w q where p a is the air density c p is the specific heat of air at constant pressure l v is the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 and w t and w q are the covariances between fluctuations of vertical wind speed w and temperature t and vertical wind speed and vapor density q respectively averaged over a 30 min interval the evaluation of the energy balance closure ebc in the sprinkler irrigation field is important for data quality control ideally the field available energy net radiation minus soil heat flux should be equal to the consumed energy sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes 3 le h r n g where le represents the daily of latent heat flux mj m 2 day 1 h represents the daily of sensible heat flux mj m 2 day 1 rn represents the daily of net radiation mj m 2 day 1 and g represents the daily of soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 which was estimated to be the mean value of the two soil

measured latent heat flux mj m 2 day 1 λ is the latent heat of water vaporization 2 45 kj g 1 and ρ w is the water density 1 g cm 3 the daily reference crop evapotranspiration eto was calculated from

climatic situation the seasonal averages of rn ta u2 and vpd in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 were 5 94 and 6 54 mj m 2 day 1 8 48 and 8 54 c 1 03 and 1 61 m s 1 and 0 61 and 0 64 kpa respectively the values of rn ta and vpd first decreased from october and reached their lowest values in winter from late february they increased gradually reaching their highest values in early june the mean rn ta and vpd at the harvest period from early june to harvest day were 16 1 17 1 mj m 2 day 1 28 3 and 30 6 c and 3 0 and 3 1 kpa respectively fig 1 the maximum wind speed in the two growing seasons was measured in winter and the mean values in the overwinter period were 3 10 and 3 20 m s 1 respectively fig 1 the total rainfall in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat seasons was 104 and 129 mm respectively fig 2 the total amounts of rainfall and irrigation in the two crop seasons was 389 mm and 340 mm respectively fig 2 daily eto showed a unimodal change during the wheat growth period first decreasing from october reaching the minimum in winter and then increasing gradually from february reaching the maximum in june fig 3 the total eto in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat seasons was 466 and 510 mm respectively fig 3 the corresponding daily average eto was 2 11 and 2 30 mm day 1 this shows marginal variations in daily eto in the two wheat growth seasons the volumetric soil water content vwc at different growth stages in the two winter wheat seasons is shown in fig 4 in both seasons the vwc of 0 100 cm generally varied from sowing 0 36 cm3 cm 3 to harvest 0 28 cm3 cm 3 mainly due to the wheat development irrigation and precipitation however it should be noted that the vwc in both seasons was higher than 60 of the field capacity 0 22 cm3 cm 3 which is considered a threshold for water stress this shows that the wheat was growing under sufficient water conditions in the two experimental seasons in addition the variability in vwc in the 0 100 cm soil layer indicated that wheat mainly absorbed water in this soil layer the relatively stable vwc in the 120 180 cm soil layer indicates marginal downward water flux through the lower 100 cm depth and little deep leakage from the upper 100 cm soil layer 3 2 energy balance closure daily data of the sum of sensible and latent heat flux h le are plotted in fig 5 against the available energy flux rn g in both seasons the slopes of linear regressions between h le and rn g were 0 89 by forcing the regression line through 0 the corresponding determination coefficients were 0 99 and 0 98 in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons respectively the ebc values regression slope of 0 89 found in this study indicate satisfactory self consistency of energy balance component measurements which supports the reliability of the measured le and the corresponding crop etc 3 3 seasonal variations in energy partition the seasonal variation in the four energy balance components rn h le and g is shown in fig 6 generally the variation in le follows the trend of rn both were the lowest in winter and then increased toward spring with wheat growth at the end of the growth season rn reached the highest value while le decreased due to the aging of leaves both the h and g values were smaller than the rn and le values during most of the growth period however the seasonal trend of h is different from that of g from sowing in october to regreening in late february the h values were positive and higher than g which was negative on most days of this period however from regreening to harvest g increased and was slightly higher than zero indicating heat flux into the soil at the same period h decreased and was negative on most days at the end of the growth season h increased and showed positive values especially at the end of the 2020 2021 season in the early growth stage the ratios of h rn and le rn were 0 24 and 0 60 in the 2019 2020 season respectively and correspondingly 0 26 and 0 64 in the 2020 2021 season table 3 indicating that latent heat flux was the main energy consumer at this stage during winter solar radiation is low and the plant canopy is small this resulted in smaller rn and le and the share of h in rn increased to 0 33 and 0 52 in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons respectively table 3 the negative g in the early and winter periods indicates that the soil releases heat to the atmosphere which is associated with soil temperature decline as shown in fig 7 after regreening plants grow faster and the proportion of le in rn increased along with the rapid growth period elongation flowering and early milking stages table 3 and reached the maximum of 0 89 0 93 in the middle growth stage i e from booting to grain fill plant growth was associated with a decrease in the daily h and the mean h rn was on average between 0 04 and 0 07 at the late growth stage i e from the late milking stage to harvest the leaves began to senesce which resulted in increasing h rn and decreasing le rn table 3 the positive g in the middle and late growth stages indicates energy flowing into the soil which consequently increased the soil temperature fig 7 3 4 winter wheat etc and crop coefficient the daily etc of the winter wheat was determined from the daily le using eq 4 and its seasonal curves in the two seasons are shown in fig 8 the wheat etc showed a two peak seasonal curve a small peak 0 87 mm day 1 in the early stage before winter and a high peak 4 81 mm day 1 in the middle stage from late april to may during the rapid growth stages the mean daily etc values over the two seasons were 3 30 and 3 18 mm day 1 respectively the total etc was 434 mm and 396 mm in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 wheat seasons respectively the daily k c of winter wheat fig 9 also shows a two peak seasonal trend the first peak appeared in november before winter with a mean value of 0 77 the second peak appeared in the middle stage and lasted for approximately 50 days from the middle of april to the end of may with a mean value of 1 14 after may k c decreased linearly with time and quickly reached a negligible value at harvest in the early growth stage overwinter stage rapid growth stage middle growth stage and late growth stage the mean wheat k c was 0 77 0 47 1 09 1 14 and 0 70 respectively table 4 the seasonal k c sowing to maturity was 0 89 and 0 78 in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 wheat seasons respectively 3 5 crop yield and water productivity the crop yield and wp of winter wheat in the two seasons are shown in table 5 the grain yield was 9100 and 9857 kg ha 1 in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons respectively and the corresponding wp was 2 07 and 2 49 kg m 3 the mean annual yield and wp over the two seasons were 9429 kg ha 1 and 2 28 kg m 3 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 energy partition understanding the seasonal variation in energy partitioning is of great significance for clarifying the weather and crop factors that regulate energy fluxes at different wheat growth stages burba and verma 2005 during the initial growth stage from sowing to recovery due to the weak solar radiation in this stage rn gradually decreased and retained the lowest value 3 50 mj m 2 day 1 over the whole growth period fig 6 the le increased first and then decreased in the initial stage fig 6 the higher etc before winter compared to that in the overwintering stage was mainly due to the high soil water content and higher evaporative demand fig 3 although the leaf area was small kang et al 2003 in the overwintering stage le reached the lowest value 1 50 mj m 2 day 1 because it had the smallest leaf area this is consistent with zhang et al 2016c who suggested that the latent heat flux during nongrowing periods is lower than that during the growing periods the sensible heat flux in this season was relatively high and was on average 1 00 mj m 2 day 1 during the rapid and middle growth stages of wheat latent heat flux gradually increased and became the largest consumer of net radiation this is mainly associated with an increase in lai which greatly increased transpiration kar and kumar 2010 zhou et al 2012 when the soil water was sufficient fig 4 at this stage the average le rn reached 0 85 in the two wheat growing seasons table 3 which is comparable to 0 83 in an irrigated wheatmaize cropland in the north china plain lei and yang 2010 in the late growth stage the wheat leaves aged and gradually became yellow which resulted in reduced transpiration consequently le was reduced while h was increased fig 6 eshonkulov et al 2019 and wang et al 2008 also found that the sensible heat flux and soil heat flux increased significantly due to the decrease in transpiration of mature wheat over the whole growth season the latent heat flux accounted for 74 of the total available energy rn g indicating that evapotranspiration is the main energy balance component which is consistent with the results of other studies rajan et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 4 2 crop etc and yield accurate estimation of crop etc in each growth stage is the basis for making proper sprinkler irrigation scheduling and improving water productivity zhang et al 2013 during the period from sowing to overwintering the measured daily etc reached the first peak with a mean value of 0 87 mm day 1 fig 8 similarly etc values from 0 50 to 1 07 mm day 1 in the initial growth stage of winter wheat on the ncp have been reported yu et al 2009 liu and luo 2010 liu et al 2002a wang et al 2003 the small differences in etc in the same area among studies may be due to differences in climate management patterns and soil moisture during the studies during the winter the wheat crops stopped growing and etc was the lowest 0 46 mm day 1 after overwintering the wheat crop began to grow due to high evaporation demand and continuous development of the crop canopy crop evapotranspiration increased liu and luo 2010 in the rapid growth period the daily average etc increased to 3 24 mm day 1 due to higher temperature intense radiation and the increase in winter wheat leaf area from the elongating to grain fill stage the wheat crop grew rapidly lai increased from 4 41 to 5 05 and etc increased from 3 24 mm day 1 in the rapid growth stage to approximately 4 81 mm day 1 in the middle growth stage which was the second etc peak with the leaves aging in late may etc decreased quickly from the peak value to approximately 3 94 mm day 1 at harvest the mean etc in the rapid middle and later stages over the two seasons are 3 24 4 81 and 3 94 mm day 1 respectively liu et al 2002a investigated winter wheat etc using a lysimeter under surface irrigation and found that the mean crop etc in the overwinter rapid middle and later stages was 0 47 2 4 4 6 and 3 5 mm day 1 respectively these values are close to those measured in this study the total crop etc measured in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 wheat seasons was 434 and 396 mm respectively table 5 crop etc values for winter wheat published in the literature are summarized in table 6 the data showed that most studies were performed with surface irrigation one with sprinkler irrigation and two with drip irrigation the seasonal crop etc varied between 386 and 497 mm with a mean value of 434 mm this etc is close to the mean annual value measured in this study 415 mm wang et al 2007 measured the wheat transpiration by using a weighing lysimeter and reported that wheat crop transpiration was reduced by 1 70 4 10 mm and 0 50 2 80 mm for maize during the period from the start of the sprinkler irrigation event to 1 3 h after the sprinkler irrigation stop this was presumably because of the increased air relative humidity and decreased canopy temperature similarly yao et al 2005 reported that leaf transpiration was decreased in sprinkler irrigation zhao et al 2012 modeled canopy transpiration and soil evaporation by considering microclimate change under sprinkler irrigation and found that the total transpiration amount decreased by 1 01 mm and soil evaporation decreased by 0 25 mm during one sprinkler irrigation period compared to that under no irrigation conditions however it should be noted that the droplet evaporation during sprinkler irrigation is approximately 1 of that during irrigation which is not considered in the modeled evapotranspiration uddin and murphy 2020 therefore it can be concluded that the etc decline caused by microclimate change under sprinkler irrigation could be partially compensated for by the increased water evaporation from the wet canopy and soil surface which finally resulted in similar crop etc under sprinkler irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation and surface irrigation as under nonsprinkler irrigation conditions this shows that the irrigation method surface irrigation sprinkler irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation has a slight effect on wheat etc when the amount of soil water is sufficient in addition the study years in the literature table 6 ranged from 1999 to 2022 and the reported etc for different varieties of winter wheat varied slightly these results indicate that the winter wheat etc has shown no notable changes in the past decades on the ncp our experiment indicates that the average wheat yield over the two growing seasons was 9428 kg ha 1 table 5 this yield is close to the high yield of 9268 kg ha 1 in 2018 reported by xu et al 2018 however it is 34 1 higher than the mean yield obtained under surface irrigation conditions table 6 high yield under sprinkler irrigation has been reported by liu et al 2013 they suggested that the high sprinkler irrigation frequency and low irrigation depth per event could allow suitable soil water conditions for crop growth in this study the water content in the main root zone of the 0 100 cm soil layer was higher than the threshold of 60 field capacity fig 4 indicating a good water status for wheat growth which finally resulted in high yield in addition the small irrigation depth per event made the water distributed in the main root zone which reduced both water seepage and soil nutrient leaching and finally improved water productivity fig 4 in addition in this study the mean wp of wheat was 2 28 kg m 3 over the two growing seasons table 5 this result is greater than the reported values for winter wheat 1 12 2 02 kg m 3 in the ncp liu et al 2013 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the main reasons are the higher grain yield in sprinkler irrigation and the comparable crop etc in sprinkler irrigation and surface irrigation qiu et al 2008 zhang et al 2016b this shows that sprinkler irrigation could improve irrigation water use efficiency zhang et al 2005 4 3 seasonal trend of k c the crop coefficient k c along with eto is widely used to estimate crop water requirements under well water management ding et al 2021 for the winter wheat on the ncp k c has two peaks over the whole growth period liu et al 2002a as confirmed in this study fig 9 the first peak is small and appears in the early growth stage before winter the second peak is larger and appears in the middle growth stage in the wheat heading and grain filling stages in this study the mean k c at the first and second peaks was 0 77 and 1 14 respectively k c in the winter was the lowest with a mean value of 0 47 over the two seasons in the late growth season it decreased quickly from 1 14 to approximately 0 70 we reviewed the k c values for winter wheat reported in previous studies table 7 which were performed on the ncp based on the previous studies the mean k c values in the early overwintering rapid middle and late stages are 0 77 0 47 1 09 1 14 and 0 70 table 7 respectively these values are close to the k c values found in this study table 4 this shows no notable differences in k c between sprinkler irrigation and surface irrigation reported in the literature however under subsurface drip irrigation the k c values are approximately 10 lower than those under surface and sprinkler irrigation this could be mainly due to the decrease in soil surface evaporation in subsurface drip irrigation najafi and tabatabaei 2007 because soil evaporation generally accounts for 20 30 of the total crop etc kang et al 2003 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 our results are also close to the k c values in the fao 56 paper in which k c values for winter wheat at initial middle and late growth stages are 0 40 0 70 1 15 and 0 25 0 40 allen et al 1998 respectively the slightly higher k c values 0 55 0 84 at the late growth stage in this study could be due to the higher soil water content and early harvest time winter wheat was harvested manually on 9 june 2020 and 11 june 2021 for machine harvest all leaves are dried and the corresponding k c would be lower than those for manual harvest therefore the k c values in the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 can be used to calculate the wheat water requirement and irrigation amount in sprinkler irrigation as well as surface irrigation conditions on the ncp k c integrates the crop characteristics that differ from the reference crop defined in the fao 56 paper among all crop characteristics lai is found to be closely related to k c because lai directly shows the crop transpiration area and available net radiation per unit area of canopy kato and kamichika 2006 fig 10 shows the relation between k c and lai when the data of the two experimental seasons are integrated the nonlinear curve fitted to the data points is k c 0 87 0 14 ln lai where k c and lai are the crop coefficient and leaf area index respectively this fitting is significant p 0 01 and has a determination coefficient of 0 96 based on the data and curve in figure 10 k c increased rapidly from 0 40 to 1 00 when lai increased from 1 50 to 3 00 after which k c remained stayed high and varied slightly between 1 00 and 1 20 and averaged 1 15 similarly kang et al 2003 reported that k c increased from 0 70 to 1 10 for lai from 0 50 to 3 00 and then k c fluctuated within 1 0 1 4 for lai of 3 7 in a winter wheat field in northwest china liu and kang 2007 investigated the relationship between the crop pan coefficient k c pan and the ratio of winter wheat etc to pan evaporation in a sprinkler irrigation field on the ncp and found that k c pan linearly increased from 0 20 to 1 00 when the relative lai lai maximum lai increased from 0 20 to 0 60 then k c pan fluctuated within 1 0 1 4 and averaged 1 2 when the relative lai was higher than 0 60 or lai was between 3 60 and 6 00 additionally li et al 2016 showed that for drip irrigated winter wheat when lai is 3 the k c increases slowly under high evapotranspiration conditions with high vpd and air temperature k c is suggested to be adjusted using climatic variables because crops may regulate their canopy conductance by closing stomata to reduce water loss allen et al 1998 marin et al 2019 investigated the relationship between k c and evapotranspiration demand using eto for seven crops in brazil and reported that k c for all the seven crops decreased with the increasing eto especially for eto above 4 mm day 1 they explained that this k c eto relationship was due to the increase in internal plant resistance to vapor diffusion from the leaves to the atmosphere marin et al 2016 2019 we also investigated the relationship between k c and eto when lai ranged from 3 to 5 during the heading and middle grain filling stages in this period lai is not the main limiting factor for etc fig 10 we found that k c varied slightly when eto was smaller than 5 50 mm day 1 after which k c showed a negative trend with eto although the slope was small this finding is close to the results by marin et al 2019 who also reported a smaller declining trend of k c to eto for wheat sugarcane and soybean compared to corn coffee and citrus high evaporative demand is generally associated with high vapor pressure demand we plotted the etc eto and vpd data on sunny days from the heading to middle grain filling stages in the two seasons in fig 11 both crop etc and eto increased with increasing vpd and k c declined with the increasing vpd this means that crops will decrease the canopy conductance gc by partially closing stoma under high vpd conditions and finally reduce transpiration rate the negative relationship between gc and vpd and reducing transpiration rate under high evaporative conditions has been widely reported for crops and forests grossiord et al 2020 liu et al 2015 marin et al 2016 medina et al 2019 pasqualotto et al 2021 although the k c values obtained in this study under sprinkler irrigation can be used to estimate wheat crop water use they should be regulated when evaporative demand is much higher for example eto is higher than 5 50 mm day 1 in this situation crop etc may be controlled by both stoma behavior and climatic conditions 5 conclusion crop evapotranspiration etc during the growth period of winter wheat under sprinkler irrigation was measured using an eddy covariance system and the crop coefficient k c was analyzed the main conclusions drawn in this study include the following 1 energy balance analysis shows that the average daily rn h le and g over the two seasons were 8 81 0 81 6 53 and 0 30 mj m 2 day 1 respectively and crop etc consumed approximately 67 of the net radiation based on the daily data the ratio of le h to rn g is 0 89 indicating a good energy balance closure 2 winter wheat etc showed two clear peaks in the seasonal curve with a small peak 0 87 mm day 1 before winter and a high peak 4 80 mm day 1 in the middle stage from late april to the end of may the seasonal total etc for winter wheat in the north china plan was on average 415 mm under sprinkler irrigation this value is close to 437 mm under surface irrigation reported in the literature indicating comparable crop etc between sprinkler and surface irrigation conditions when soil water was sufficient for wheat growth 3 the mean k c in the early sowing to winter overwinter winter to recovery rapid recovery to elongation middle elongation to grain filling and late growth stages late grain fill to mature were 0 77 0 47 1 09 1 14 and 0 70 respectively the seasonal mean k c was 0 83 the k c values in the middle stage are consistent with those in the fao 56 paper the relationship between k c and lai for winter wheat was fitted using the logarithmic function k c 0 87 0 14 ln lai 4 the average grain yield was 9428 kg ha 1 and water productivity was estimated to be 2 28 kg m 3 under the sprinkler irrigation conditions both are higher than those under surface irrigation in most literature reports on the ncp the high yield and water productivity could be due to the

9143,sprinkler irrigation has been widely used for winter wheat crops in the north china plain ncp to maintain high crop yield and enhance water use efficiency because water resources are scarce determining the accurate crop evapotranspiration etc and crop coefficient k c of winter wheat is critical for optimizing sprinkler irrigation management in this study an eddy covariance system was deployed in a sprinkler irrigation field to measure the energy balance components net radiation rn soil heat flux g sensible heat h latent heat le and calculate etc and k c the wheat growth parameters and yield were also investigated the results showed that the energy balance closure rate the rate of daily le h to rn g was 0 89 indicating a sufficient energy balance closure seasonal total le flux accounted for 67 of the total available energy rn g the seasonal etc values were 434 and 396 mm during the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 growing seasons respectively which are comparable to those 400 470 mm under surface irrigation the mean daily etc was 0 87 0 46 3 24 4 81 and 3 94 mm day 1 in the early growth overwintering rapid growth middle and late growth stages respectively the corresponding k c values were 0 77 0 47 1 09 1 14 and 0 70 the k c values were close to those reported in the fao 56 paper the k c is positively related to the leaf area index lai and their relationship was fitted as k c 0 87 0 14 ln lai r 2 0 96 for an lai range of 1 7 where ln is a natural logarithm function the measured wheat grain yield was 9100 and 9857 kg ha 1 and the water productivity wp was 2 07 and 2 49 kg m 3 in the two seasons respectively both factors are approximately 30 higher than those 7200 kg ha 1 1 68 kg m 3 reported by other studies considering the high wheat yield and comparable crop etc sprinkler irrigation is recommended for application on the ncp the seasonal etc of 400 430 mm and the obtained k c values in this study can be used to make sprinkler irrigation scheduling for winter wheat on the ncp keywords winter wheat yield crop evapotranspiration water use efficiency energy balance sprinkler irrigation scheduling data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction the north china plain ncp known as china s granary produces approximately 60 of the national wheat and 30 maize qiu et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 winter wheat is a high water consumption crop and grows in minor rainfall seasons generally from october to june therefore irrigation is crucial to compensate for the water deficit between annual wheat evapotranspiration 400 500 mm and rainfall 150 mm which ultimately enhances wheat production liu et al 2013 long term groundwater over pumping for irrigation causes water level decline at approximately 1 m per year and consequently results in land subsidence risk zhang et al 2021 approximately 99 of irrigation water is lost in agricultural lands through crop evapotranspiration rana and katerji 2000 therefore accurate estimation of field evapotranspiration etc could help farmers optimize irrigation scheduling and finally improve irrigation water use efficiency and crop production especially in the water scarce region of ncp in recent decades many water saving irrigation technologies have been studied and used such as drip irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation and sprinkler irrigation liu et al 2001 fang et al 2018 kharrou et al 2011 wang et al 2015 as a highly efficient and automatic irrigation technology the sprinkler irrigation method has been adopted worldwide and in china yan et al 2020 based on the data in the international commission on irrigation and drainage icid sprinkler irrigated fields account for on average 47 1 of the total irrigation area in developed countries for example the usa canada and france 10 5 in emerging developing countries for example china india and iran and 8 4 in the least developed countries dataset international commission on irrigation and drainage 2021 by the end of 2020 the total area of sprinkler irrigation in china was 4 6 mha accounting for 6 3 of the entire chinese irrigation area in the ncp the sprinkler irrigated area is 0 74 mha in 2020 and accounted for 16 of the total sprinkler irrigated area in china increasing the sprinkler irrigated areas promoted the irrigation water use efficiency to 0 565 ministry of water resources p r c 2020 2020 compared with drip and surface irrigation the evaporation of water droplets in sprinkler irrigation differs in terms of canopy water interception energy balance and microclimate of sprinkler crops liu et al 2002b most studies reported that in sprinkler irrigated farmlands the air temperature decreased and the relative humidity increased leading to a lower vapor pressure deficit cavero et al 2009 jiang et al 2020 liu et al 2021 in this case martínez cob et al 2008 using a weighing lysimeter to measure the transpiration of plants under sprinkler irrigation conditions found that crop etc decreased with sprinkler irrigation compared with the rainfed treatment similarly urrego pereira et al 2013 found that the transpiration rate at the leaf scale measured by a photosynthesis instrument decreased by 0 22 0 28 mm h 1 during the sprinkler irrigation period compared to the nonirrigated condition which was a consequence of the decrease in air temperature and vapor pressure deficit in addition liu et al 2003 investigated the potential evaporation using a 20 cm pan placed at the winter wheat canopy top in both sprinkler and surface irrigation conditions and reported that the water evaporation from winter wheat regreening to harvest i e from the beginning of march beginning to the middle of june in the sprinkler irrigated field was 17 6 mm lower than that in the surface irrigation field additionally they reported that the evaporation decreased trend in the dry season was much stronger than that in the wet season in addition some studies showed that compared to surface irrigation sprinkler irrigation could increase water productivity ratio of yield to crop etc by 18 57 improve irrigation water productivity the ratio of yield to irrigation water by 21 81 and significantly increase crop yield gong et al 2001 li et al 2019 liu et al 2013 however it is still argued that droplet and canopy interception evaporation could reduce water use efficiency and increase crop evapotranspiration etc uddin and murphy 2020 therefore determining wheat etc is vital for optimizing sprinkler irrigation scheduling improving water use efficiency saving water resources in the ncp and enhancing sustainable agricultural development the crop coefficient k c the ratio of crop evapotranspiration without water or any other limitation etc to reference crop evapotranspiration eto has been widely used to estimate crop water requirements and manage irrigation schedules howell et al 2006 the crop coefficient depends on the crop type growth stage growth conditions and irrigation method yarami et al 2011 in ncp the k c for winter wheat has been studied and ranged from 0 74 to 1 04 under surface irrigation conditions liu and luo 2010 yang et al 2022 zhang et al 2004b in sprinkler irrigation the seasonal mean k c for winter wheat was 0 74 su et al 2005 and it was 0 63 0 75 under drip irrigation gao et al 2014 clearly winter wheat k c varies with the irrigation method and wheat species therefore it is important to determine the seasonal curve of k c for winter wheat under sprinkler irrigation this could help estimate wheat etc and optimize sprinkler irrigation scheduling based on the wheat water requirement eventually it could improve the water use efficiency and enhance winter wheat yield considering optimizing sprinkler irrigation scheduling to cope with water scarcity in the ncp the main objectives of this study are to 1 determine the daily crop etc under sprinkler irrigation over the entire wheat season 2 analyze the energy balance and its variation under sprinkler irrigation and 3 evaluate the seasonal change in crop coefficient k c in sprinkler irrigated wheat 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the experimental field was located at dacaozhuang seed breeding station ningjin county hebei province china longitude 114 56 latitude 37 30 altitude 26 m the station area is approximately 15 ha and is surrounded by agricultural fields the wheat and maize rotation cultivation system is the main cropping pattern at the station and in the study region all wheat at the station and approximately 1500 ha fields around the station are irrigated using a sprinkler irrigation system the climate zone is a warm temperate semiarid monsoon climate the annual average temperature is 12 8 c the annual average precipitation is 449 mm which is approximately 60 during the summer and the frost free period is approximately 200 d the annual average sunshine duration is 2538 h and the wind speed is 2 3 2 7 m s 1 the prevailing wind direction is south in the winter wheat season and southwest wind in the summer maize season at the experimental station the field water hold capacity ranged from 0 36 to 0 38 cm3 cm 3 and the soil texture data are shown in table 1 in the two experimental seasons 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 the winter wheat varieties were yingbo 700 and yuanmai 32 respectively both varieties are widely planted in the study region the winter wheat was sown on 22 october in 2019 and 21 october in 2020 with a row spacing of 20 cm and a sowing rate of 443 kg ha 1 the cultivation practices including fertilization pest control plant disease and weed control were similar to those in the region the fertilization rates in the two wheat seasons were 200 kg ha 1 n 90 kg ha 1 p2o5 and 60 kg ha 1 k2o the base nitrogen application was 40 kg ha 1 and all phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were applied as base fertilizers and were spread by machine following fertilization the soil was plowed leveled and prepared for seed sowing a topdressing nitrogen amount of 160 kg ha 1 was applied to the field using a fertigation system deployed in the head of the sprinkler system three times at the regreening jointing and grain filling stages with 53 kg ha 1 each time the topdressing n fertilizer was urea due to its high solubility 2 2 irrigation management the winter wheat was first irrigated soon after sowing aiming to provide sufficient water content for seed germination the second irrigation called winter irrigation was given before the winter to provide enough soil water to support wheat seedlings over the long and dry winter after wheat regreening in march the sprinkler irrigation scheduling performed based on the pan method proposed by liu et al 2011 with this sprinkler irrigation schedule wheat will grow under non water stress conditions liu et al 2011 the sprinkler irrigation amount each time was based on the water evaporation of a 20 cm pan model adm7 tianjin china located approximately 5 cm above the crop canopy liu et al 2011 the irrigation amount i in mm was estimated using the equation i epan p 0 65 where epan and p both in mm are the pan evaporation and precipitation accumulated after the previous irrigation respectively liu et al 2011 the irrigation events and the corresponding amounts in the two experimental seasons are shown in table 2 2 3 measurements 2 3 1 energy and water vapor fluxes the eddy covariance ec system measured the water vapor and sensible heat fluxes the ec system was deployed at the center of a 200 m long south north direction and 60 m wide field east west direction in which wheat was sprinkler irrigated based on the irrigation scheduling management by liu et al 2011 around this measurement field wheat fields of approximately 1500 ha were also sprinklers irrigated 2 4 times with 60 100 mm water depth per irrigation the dominant wind during the wheat growth period came from the south the ec system was installed on a height adjustable tripod sensors were positioned 1 5 m above the soil surface and approximately 0 7 m above the canopy top at the middle growth stage by considering the wheat height of approximately 0 8 m therefore the ec system was approximately 1 m above the canopy zero plane displacement height 0 5 m which yield a fetch ratio of 1 100 by considering the 100 m fetch the flux footprint distribution data show 90 of the accumulated latent heat flux coming from 45 to 100 m length away from the ec system at the upwind direction suppl fig 1 this shows the 100 m available fetch for the south wind was sufficient for reliable flux measurements in the experimental field in addition the large sprinkler irrigated area of 1500 ha surrounding the experimental field provided enough fetch for ec system measurement the ec system consisted of a 3d ultrasonic anemometer model csat3 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa for measuring three dimensional wind speed and sonic temperature and an open path infrared gas h2o and co2 analyzer model li 7500 li cor inc lincoln ne usa for measuring h2o and co2 concentrations the ec sensors were sampled at 10 hz a data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa was used for data acquisition and storage 2 3 2 field microclimate the field microclimate was measured at 2 m height at the same site as the ec system an air temperature and humidity probe model hmp45c vaisala inc woburn ma usa was used to measure air temperature and relative humidity the net radiation rn was measured by a net radiometer model nr lite kipp zonen delft netherlands the wind speed was measured with a 3 cup anemometer model ec 9s jinzhou sunshine meteorological instrument corporation jinzhou china three soil heat flux plates model hfp01 huskeflux thermal sensors the netherlands were installed at depths of 5 5 and 10 cm to measure the soil heat flux at the soil surface a rain gauge model tr525 texas electronics texas usa deployed at 1 m height was used to measure rainfall all these sensors were connected to another data logger model cr1000 campbell scientific inc logan ut usa for data acquisition and storage the sampling intervals were 10 s and 30 minutes averages were stored and used in data processing 2 3 3 soil water content the soil water content was determined using the gravimetric method in the two seasons soil samples were collected from a depth of 0 200 cm depth at 20 cm intervals at the beginning and end of each season and every two weeks from winter wheat regreening to harvest the measured mass soil water content was converted to volumetric soil water content vwc cm3 cm 3 by considering the soil bulk density in each layer table 1 2 3 4 plant parameters and yield leaf area and plant density were measured every two weeks during the growing season from april to june plant numbers in three 1 m long rows were manually counted and mean values were calculated then the plant density was calculated by considering a row spacing of 20 cm leaf area was measured by a portable leaf area meter li 3000c li cor inc usa the leaf area index lai was determined using the mean leaf area per plant and the plant density yu et al 2009 at harvest time fifteen 1 m2 plots from south to north were chosen and all plants in each sample plot were harvested then the grains in each sample plot were threshed with a special threshing machine the water content of the wheat grains in each plot was determined and finally converted to final grain yield with a water content of 13 2 4 data analysis eddy covariance raw data were processed by eddypro software version 4 0 li cor inc lincoln ne usa to obtain the average latent heat and sensible heat fluxes at 30 min time intervals half hourly latent heat fluxes were summed on a daily timescale to obtain daily et in mm day 1 the original data observed using the ec method were corrected by eddypro software following the recommendations in the handbook eddy covariance method burba 2013 in this study the half hourly turbulent fluxes and meteorological data were carefully checked and spurious data points caused by instrument malfunction sensor maintenance or bad weather were removed the calculations of sensible heat h and latent heat le fluxes were based on the following equations 1 h p a c p w t 2 le l v w q where p a is the air density c p is the specific heat of air at constant pressure l v is the latent heat of vaporization 2 45 mj kg 1 and w t and w q are the covariances between fluctuations of vertical wind speed w and temperature t and vertical wind speed and vapor density q respectively averaged over a 30 min interval the evaluation of the energy balance closure ebc in the sprinkler irrigation field is important for data quality control ideally the field available energy net radiation minus soil heat flux should be equal to the consumed energy sum of latent and sensible heat fluxes 3 le h r n g where le represents the daily of latent heat flux mj m 2 day 1 h represents the daily of sensible heat flux mj m 2 day 1 rn represents the daily of net radiation mj m 2 day 1 and g represents the daily of soil heat flux mj m 2 day 1 which was estimated to be the mean value of the two soil heat fluxes measured at 0 05 cm depth the daily water vapor flux from the canopy generally called crop evapotranspiration etc mm day 1 was calculated as follows 4 et c le λ ρ w where le is the measured latent heat flux mj m 2 day 1 λ is the latent heat of water vaporization 2 45 kj g 1 and ρ w is the water density 1 g cm 3 the daily reference crop evapotranspiration eto was calculated from the fao56 penman monteith equation allen et al 1998 5 et o 0 408 r n g γ 900 t 273 u 2 e s e a γ 1 0 34 u 2 where rn is the net radiation at the reference crop surface mj m 2 day 1 g is the soil heat flux density mj m 2 day 1 t is the mean daily air temperature at 2 m height c u 2 is the wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 es is the saturation vapor pressure kpa ea is the actual vapor pressure kpa e s e a is the saturation vapor pressure deficit kpa is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c 1 and γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 the crop coefficient k c is defined as the ratio of crop etc to eto estimated as 6 k c et c et o where etc and eto are the daily crop evapotranspiration and reference crop evapotranspiration mm day 1 respectively water productivity wp kg m 3 was calculated by the following formula zhao et al 2020 7 wp 0 1 y et c where etc mm is the total daily crop evapotranspiration over winter wheat in a growth season and y is the corresponding seasonal grain yield kg ha 1 3 results 3 1 meteorological conditions and soil water content fig 1 a d shows the seasonal trends of daily total net radiation rn and daily averages of air temperature ta wind speed u2 and vapor pressure deficit vpd in the two wheat seasons generally there are no considerable differences in the four main microclimatic variables between the two seasons indicating a relatively consistent climatic situation the seasonal averages of rn ta u2 and vpd in 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 were 5 94 and 6 54 mj m 2 day 1 8 48 and 8 54 c 1 03 and 1 61 m s 1 and 0 61 and 0 64 kpa respectively the values of rn ta and vpd first decreased from october and reached their lowest values in winter from late february they increased gradually reaching their highest values in early june the mean rn ta and vpd at the harvest period from early june to harvest day were 16 1 17 1 mj m 2 day 1 28 3 and 30 6 c and 3 0 and 3 1 kpa respectively fig 1 the maximum wind speed in the two growing seasons was measured in winter and the mean values in the overwinter period were 3 10 and 3 20 m s 1 respectively fig 1 the total rainfall in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat seasons was 104 and 129 mm respectively fig 2 the total amounts of rainfall and irrigation in the two crop seasons was 389 mm and 340 mm respectively fig 2 daily eto showed a unimodal change during the wheat growth period first decreasing from october reaching the minimum in winter and then increasing gradually from february reaching the maximum in june fig 3 the total eto in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 winter wheat seasons was 466 and 510 mm respectively fig 3 the corresponding daily average eto was 2 11 and 2 30 mm day 1 this shows marginal variations in daily eto in the two wheat growth seasons the volumetric soil water content vwc at different growth stages in the two winter wheat seasons is shown in fig 4 in both seasons the vwc of 0 100 cm generally varied from sowing 0 36 cm3 cm 3 to harvest 0 28 cm3 cm 3 mainly due to the wheat development irrigation and precipitation however it should be noted that the vwc in both seasons was higher than 60 of the field capacity 0 22 cm3 cm 3 which is considered a threshold for water stress this shows that the wheat was growing under sufficient water conditions in the two experimental seasons in addition the variability in vwc in the 0 100 cm soil layer indicated that wheat mainly absorbed water in this soil layer the relatively stable vwc in the 120 180 cm soil layer indicates marginal downward water flux through the lower 100 cm depth and little deep leakage from the upper 100 cm soil layer 3 2 energy balance closure daily data of the sum of sensible and latent heat flux h le are plotted in fig 5 against the available energy flux rn g in both seasons the slopes of linear regressions between h le and rn g were 0 89 by forcing the regression line through 0 the corresponding determination coefficients were 0 99 and 0 98 in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons respectively the ebc values regression slope of 0 89 found in this study indicate satisfactory self consistency of energy balance component measurements which supports the reliability of the measured le and the corresponding crop etc 3 3 seasonal variations in energy partition the seasonal variation in the four energy balance components rn h le and g is shown in fig 6 generally the variation in le follows the trend of rn both were the lowest in winter and then increased toward spring with wheat growth at the end of the growth season rn reached the highest value while le decreased due to the aging of leaves both the h and g values were smaller than the rn and le values during most of the growth period however the seasonal trend of h is different from that of g from sowing in october to regreening in late february the h values were positive and higher than g which was negative on most days of this period however from regreening to harvest g increased and was slightly higher than zero indicating heat flux into the soil at the same period h decreased and was negative on most days at the end of the growth season h increased and showed positive values especially at the end of the 2020 2021 season in the early growth stage the ratios of h rn and le rn were 0 24 and 0 60 in the 2019 2020 season respectively and correspondingly 0 26 and 0 64 in the 2020 2021 season table 3 indicating that latent heat flux was the main energy consumer at this stage during winter solar radiation is low and the plant canopy is small this resulted in smaller rn and le and the share of h in rn increased to 0 33 and 0 52 in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons respectively table 3 the negative g in the early and winter periods indicates that the soil releases heat to the atmosphere which is associated with soil temperature decline as shown in fig 7 after regreening plants grow faster and the proportion of le in rn increased along with the rapid growth period elongation flowering and early milking stages table 3 and reached the maximum of 0 89 0 93 in the middle growth stage i e from booting to grain fill plant growth was associated with a decrease in the daily h and the mean h rn was on average between 0 04 and 0 07 at the late growth stage i e from the late milking stage to harvest the leaves began to senesce which resulted in increasing h rn and decreasing le rn table 3 the positive g in the middle and late growth stages indicates energy flowing into the soil which consequently increased the soil temperature fig 7 3 4 winter wheat etc and crop coefficient the daily etc of the winter wheat was determined from the daily le using eq 4 and its seasonal curves in the two seasons are shown in fig 8 the wheat etc showed a two peak seasonal curve a small peak 0 87 mm day 1 in the early stage before winter and a high peak 4 81 mm day 1 in the middle stage from late april to may during the rapid growth stages the mean daily etc values over the two seasons were 3 30 and 3 18 mm day 1 respectively the total etc was 434 mm and 396 mm in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 wheat seasons respectively the daily k c of winter wheat fig 9 also shows a two peak seasonal trend the first peak appeared in november before winter with a mean value of 0 77 the second peak appeared in the middle stage and lasted for approximately 50 days from the middle of april to the end of may with a mean value of 1 14 after may k c decreased linearly with time and quickly reached a negligible value at harvest in the early growth stage overwinter stage rapid growth stage middle growth stage and late growth stage the mean wheat k c was 0 77 0 47 1 09 1 14 and 0 70 respectively table 4 the seasonal k c sowing to maturity was 0 89 and 0 78 in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 wheat seasons respectively 3 5 crop yield and water productivity the crop yield and wp of winter wheat in the two seasons are shown in table 5 the grain yield was 9100 and 9857 kg ha 1 in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 seasons respectively and the corresponding wp was 2 07 and 2 49 kg m 3 the mean annual yield and wp over the two seasons were 9429 kg ha 1 and 2 28 kg m 3 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 energy partition understanding the seasonal variation in energy partitioning is of great significance for clarifying the weather and crop factors that regulate energy fluxes at different wheat growth stages burba and verma 2005 during the initial growth stage from sowing to recovery due to the weak solar radiation in this stage rn gradually decreased and retained the lowest value 3 50 mj m 2 day 1 over the whole growth period fig 6 the le increased first and then decreased in the initial stage fig 6 the higher etc before winter compared to that in the overwintering stage was mainly due to the high soil water content and higher evaporative demand fig 3 although the leaf area was small kang et al 2003 in the overwintering stage le reached the lowest value 1 50 mj m 2 day 1 because it had the smallest leaf area this is consistent with zhang et al 2016c who suggested that the latent heat flux during nongrowing periods is lower than that during the growing periods the sensible heat flux in this season was relatively high and was on average 1 00 mj m 2 day 1 during the rapid and middle growth stages of wheat latent heat flux gradually increased and became the largest consumer of net radiation this is mainly associated with an increase in lai which greatly increased transpiration kar and kumar 2010 zhou et al 2012 when the soil water was sufficient fig 4 at this stage the average le rn reached 0 85 in the two wheat growing seasons table 3 which is comparable to 0 83 in an irrigated wheatmaize cropland in the north china plain lei and yang 2010 in the late growth stage the wheat leaves aged and gradually became yellow which resulted in reduced transpiration consequently le was reduced while h was increased fig 6 eshonkulov et al 2019 and wang et al 2008 also found that the sensible heat flux and soil heat flux increased significantly due to the decrease in transpiration of mature wheat over the whole growth season the latent heat flux accounted for 74 of the total available energy rn g indicating that evapotranspiration is the main energy balance component which is consistent with the results of other studies rajan et al 2015 zhang et al 2015 4 2 crop etc and yield accurate estimation of crop etc in each growth stage is the basis for making proper sprinkler irrigation scheduling and improving water productivity zhang et al 2013 during the period from sowing to overwintering the measured daily etc reached the first peak with a mean value of 0 87 mm day 1 fig 8 similarly etc values from 0 50 to 1 07 mm day 1 in the initial growth stage of winter wheat on the ncp have been reported yu et al 2009 liu and luo 2010 liu et al 2002a wang et al 2003 the small differences in etc in the same area among studies may be due to differences in climate management patterns and soil moisture during the studies during the winter the wheat crops stopped growing and etc was the lowest 0 46 mm day 1 after overwintering the wheat crop began to grow due to high evaporation demand and continuous development of the crop canopy crop evapotranspiration increased liu and luo 2010 in the rapid growth period the daily average etc increased to 3 24 mm day 1 due to higher temperature intense radiation and the increase in winter wheat leaf area from the elongating to grain fill stage the wheat crop grew rapidly lai increased from 4 41 to 5 05 and etc increased from 3 24 mm day 1 in the rapid growth stage to approximately 4 81 mm day 1 in the middle growth stage which was the second etc peak with the leaves aging in late may etc decreased quickly from the peak value to approximately 3 94 mm day 1 at harvest the mean etc in the rapid middle and later stages over the two seasons are 3 24 4 81 and 3 94 mm day 1 respectively liu et al 2002a investigated winter wheat etc using a lysimeter under surface irrigation and found that the mean crop etc in the overwinter rapid middle and later stages was 0 47 2 4 4 6 and 3 5 mm day 1 respectively these values are close to those measured in this study the total crop etc measured in the 2019 2020 and 2020 2021 wheat seasons was 434 and 396 mm respectively table 5 crop etc values for winter wheat published in the literature are summarized in table 6 the data showed that most studies were performed with surface irrigation one with sprinkler irrigation and two with drip irrigation the seasonal crop etc varied between 386 and 497 mm with a mean value of 434 mm this etc is close to the mean annual value measured in this study 415 mm wang et al 2007 measured the wheat transpiration by using a weighing lysimeter and reported that wheat crop transpiration was reduced by 1 70 4 10 mm and 0 50 2 80 mm for maize during the period from the start of the sprinkler irrigation event to 1 3 h after the sprinkler irrigation stop this was presumably because of the increased air relative humidity and decreased canopy temperature similarly yao et al 2005 reported that leaf transpiration was decreased in sprinkler irrigation zhao et al 2012 modeled canopy transpiration and soil evaporation by considering microclimate change under sprinkler irrigation and found that the total transpiration amount decreased by 1 01 mm and soil evaporation decreased by 0 25 mm during one sprinkler irrigation period compared to that under no irrigation conditions however it should be noted that the droplet evaporation during sprinkler irrigation is approximately 1 of that during irrigation which is not considered in the modeled evapotranspiration uddin and murphy 2020 therefore it can be concluded that the etc decline caused by microclimate change under sprinkler irrigation could be partially compensated for by the increased water evaporation from the wet canopy and soil surface which finally resulted in similar crop etc under sprinkler irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation and surface irrigation as under nonsprinkler irrigation conditions this shows that the irrigation method surface irrigation sprinkler irrigation micro sprinkler irrigation and drip irrigation has a slight effect on wheat etc when the amount of soil water is sufficient in addition the study years in the literature table 6 ranged from 1999 to 2022 and the reported etc for different varieties of winter wheat varied slightly these results indicate that the winter wheat etc has shown no notable changes in the past decades on the ncp our experiment indicates that the average wheat yield over the two growing seasons was 9428 kg ha 1 table 5 this yield is close to the high yield of 9268 kg ha 1 in 2018 reported by xu et al 2018 however it is 34 1 higher than the mean yield obtained under surface irrigation conditions table 6 high yield under sprinkler irrigation has been reported by liu et al 2013 they suggested that the high sprinkler irrigation frequency and low irrigation depth per event could allow suitable soil water conditions for crop growth in this study the water content in the main root zone of the 0 100 cm soil layer was higher than the threshold of 60 field capacity fig 4 indicating a good water status for wheat growth which finally resulted in high yield in addition the small irrigation depth per event made the water distributed in the main root zone which reduced both water seepage and soil nutrient leaching and finally improved water productivity fig 4 in addition in this study the mean wp of wheat was 2 28 kg m 3 over the two growing seasons table 5 this result is greater than the reported values for winter wheat 1 12 2 02 kg m 3 in the ncp liu et al 2013 xu et al 2018 zhang et al 2016a the main reasons are the higher grain yield in sprinkler irrigation and the comparable crop etc in sprinkler irrigation and surface irrigation qiu et al 2008 zhang et al 2016b this shows that sprinkler irrigation could improve irrigation water use efficiency zhang et al 2005 4 3 seasonal trend of k c the crop coefficient k c along with eto is widely used to estimate crop water requirements under well water management ding et al 2021 for the winter wheat on the ncp k c has two peaks over the whole growth period liu et al 2002a as confirmed in this study fig 9 the first peak is small and appears in the early growth stage before winter the second peak is larger and appears in the middle growth stage in the wheat heading and grain filling stages in this study the mean k c at the first and second peaks was 0 77 and 1 14 respectively k c in the winter was the lowest with a mean value of 0 47 over the two seasons in the late growth season it decreased quickly from 1 14 to approximately 0 70 we reviewed the k c values for winter wheat reported in previous studies table 7 which were performed on the ncp based on the previous studies the mean k c values in the early overwintering rapid middle and late stages are 0 77 0 47 1 09 1 14 and 0 70 table 7 respectively these values are close to the k c values found in this study table 4 this shows no notable differences in k c between sprinkler irrigation and surface irrigation reported in the literature however under subsurface drip irrigation the k c values are approximately 10 lower than those under surface and sprinkler irrigation this could be mainly due to the decrease in soil surface evaporation in subsurface drip irrigation najafi and tabatabaei 2007 because soil evaporation generally accounts for 20 30 of the total crop etc kang et al 2003 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 our results are also close to the k c values in the fao 56 paper in which k c values for winter wheat at initial middle and late growth stages are 0 40 0 70 1 15 and 0 25 0 40 allen et al 1998 respectively the slightly higher k c values 0 55 0 84 at the late growth stage in this study could be due to the higher soil water content and early harvest time winter wheat was harvested manually on 9 june 2020 and 11 june 2021 for machine harvest all leaves are dried and the corresponding k c would be lower than those for manual harvest therefore the k c values in the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 can be used to calculate the wheat water requirement and irrigation amount in sprinkler irrigation as well as surface irrigation conditions on the ncp k c integrates the crop characteristics that differ from the reference crop defined in the fao 56 paper among all crop characteristics lai is found to be closely related to k c because lai directly shows the crop transpiration area and available net radiation per unit area of canopy kato and kamichika 2006 fig 10 shows the relation between k c and lai when the data of the two experimental seasons are integrated the nonlinear curve fitted to the data points is k c 0 87 0 14 ln lai where k c and lai are the crop coefficient and leaf area index respectively this fitting is significant p 0 01 and has a determination coefficient of 0 96 based on the data and curve in figure 10 k c increased rapidly from 0 40 to 1 00 when lai increased from 1 50 to 3 00 after which k c remained stayed high and varied slightly between 1 00 and 1 20 and averaged 1 15 similarly kang et al 2003 reported that k c increased from 0 70 to 1 10 for lai from 0 50 to 3 00 and then k c fluctuated within 1 0 1 4 for lai of 3 7 in a winter wheat field in northwest china liu and kang 2007 investigated the relationship between the crop pan coefficient k c pan and the ratio of winter wheat etc to pan evaporation in a sprinkler irrigation field on the ncp and found that k c pan linearly increased from 0 20 to 1 00 when the relative lai lai maximum lai increased from 0 20 to 0 60 then k c pan fluctuated within 1 0 1 4 and averaged 1 2 when the relative lai was higher than 0 60 or lai was between 3 60 and 6 00 additionally li et al 2016 showed that for drip irrigated winter wheat when lai is 3 the k c increases slowly under high evapotranspiration conditions with high vpd and air temperature k c is suggested to be adjusted using climatic variables because crops may regulate their canopy conductance by closing stomata to reduce water loss allen et al 1998 marin et al 2019 investigated the relationship between k c and evapotranspiration demand using eto for seven crops in brazil and reported that k c for all the seven crops decreased with the increasing eto especially for eto above 4 mm day 1 they explained that this k c eto relationship was due to the increase in internal plant resistance to vapor diffusion from the leaves to the atmosphere marin et al 2016 2019 we also investigated the relationship between k c and eto when lai ranged from 3 to 5 during the heading and middle grain filling stages in this period lai is not the main limiting factor for etc fig 10 we found that k c varied slightly when eto was smaller than 5 50 mm day 1 after which k c showed a negative trend with eto although the slope was small this finding is close to the results by marin et al 2019 who also reported a smaller declining trend of k c to eto for wheat sugarcane and soybean compared to corn coffee and citrus high evaporative demand is generally associated with high vapor pressure demand we plotted the etc eto and vpd data on sunny days from the heading to middle grain filling stages in the two seasons in fig 11 both crop etc and eto increased with increasing vpd and k c declined with the increasing vpd this means that crops will decrease the canopy conductance gc by partially closing stoma under high vpd conditions and finally reduce transpiration rate the negative relationship between gc and vpd and reducing transpiration rate under high evaporative conditions has been widely reported for crops and forests grossiord et al 2020 liu et al 2015 marin et al 2016 medina et al 2019 pasqualotto et al 2021 although the k c values obtained in this study under sprinkler irrigation can be used to estimate wheat crop water use they should be regulated when evaporative demand is much higher for example eto is higher than 5 50 mm day 1 in this situation crop etc may be controlled by both stoma behavior and climatic conditions 5 conclusion crop evapotranspiration etc during the growth period of winter wheat under sprinkler irrigation was measured using an eddy covariance system and the crop coefficient k c was analyzed the main conclusions drawn in this study include the following 1 energy balance analysis shows that the average daily rn h le and g over the two seasons were 8 81 0 81 6 53 and 0 30 mj m 2 day 1 respectively and crop etc consumed approximately 67 of the net radiation based on the daily data the ratio of le h to rn g is 0 89 indicating a good energy balance closure 2 winter wheat etc showed two clear peaks in the seasonal curve with a small peak 0 87 mm day 1 before winter and a high peak 4 80 mm day 1 in the middle stage from late april to the end of may the seasonal total etc for winter wheat in the north china plan was on average 415 mm under sprinkler irrigation this value is close to 437 mm under surface irrigation reported in the literature indicating comparable crop etc between sprinkler and surface irrigation conditions when soil water was sufficient for wheat growth 3 the mean k c in the early sowing to winter overwinter winter to recovery rapid recovery to elongation middle elongation to grain filling and late growth stages late grain fill to mature were 0 77 0 47 1 09 1 14 and 0 70 respectively the seasonal mean k c was 0 83 the k c values in the middle stage are consistent with those in the fao 56 paper the relationship between k c and lai for winter wheat was fitted using the logarithmic function k c 0 87 0 14 ln lai 4 the average grain yield was 9428 kg ha 1 and water productivity was estimated to be 2 28 kg m 3 under the sprinkler irrigation conditions both are higher than those under surface irrigation in most literature reports on the ncp the high yield and water productivity could be due to the high available soil water content in the main root zone under sprinkler irrigation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

confirmed that the gpr model outperformed all other models for predicting the yield r2 0 87 and dry matter r2 0 86 of winter wheat the prediction errors of the gpr model for maximum yield and dry matter of winter wheat were 5 8 and 1 1 respectively the yield and dry matter of winter wheat in the ncp could be predicted by the gpr model and polynomial functions and the optimal water and nitrogen application for maximum yield and dry matter could be obtained the results provide insight into site specific crop management keywords winter wheat yield forecast gaussian regression water nitrogen coupling function machine learning data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction the north china plain ncp is an important grain production base in china which occupies 55 of the whole country s wheat sown area and contributes 60 of the total wheat production duan et al 2019 dominating the winter wheat production in china consequently it is particularly important to make early and robust forecasts of yield and dry matter of winter wheat in the ncp calculation of water and nitrogen requirements based on crop yield targets helps devise site specific water and fertilizer management plans in the ncp where uniform agronomic practice management of winter wheat fields is implemented conventional farmland practices are managed with a unified application of irrigation water mineral fertilizers and pesticides gu et al 2016 ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of wheat fields in soil properties topography and vegetation in order to achieve a higher winter wheat yield the flood irrigation method zain et al 2021 and excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer more than 300 kg ha 1 tan et al 2017 have often been adopted by local farmers this not only caused the waste of water resources zhang et al 2017 and the depletion of groundwater table xu et al 2018 but also seriously reduced the water and nitrogen utilization efficiency si et al 2020 dar et al 2017 mon et al 2016 in addition excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation undoubtedly led to increased production costs and negative environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions du et al 2020a and water pollution caused by the leaching of nitrate nitrogen wang et al 2015 therefore the knowledge of potential wheat yield and the effects of water and fertilizer inputs on wheat production as well as the relationship of the yield to the soil topographic factors is vital to address these issues according to the yield and dry matter predictions of winter wheat optimized water and nitrogen inputs may improve profitability and environmental sustainability by promoting soil and wheat management strategies winter wheat yield depends on a variety of complex factors including climatic conditions soil quality genotype agronomic management practices and the control policy of grain holzman et al 2018 singh et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the interaction of these factors poses challenges for accurate prediction of wheat yield moreover dry matter is one of the indicators reflecting wheat productivity which is of significance for yield prediction and precision agriculture application walter et al 2018 in recent years some crop yield and dry matter prediction methods such as empirical and mathematical yield models shi et al 2013 lobell burke 2010 process oriented crop models jones et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 and remote sensing techniques schwalbert et al 2020 hara et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 have been gradually applied to forecast crop parameters however conventional empirical statistical models require extensive knowledge of climate crop and soil which makes them poor in spatial generalization similarly process oriented crop growth models are time consuming and expensive which makes them difficult to put into practical production applications furthermore some satellite based remote sensing datasets are incapable of providing sufficient spatial details of small scale farmland for optimization of agricultural management the improvement of new technologies and innovations including a comprehensive analysis of big data with high performance computing has provided a guarantee of reliable and accurate crop parameter prediction of these technologies machine learning ml has received extensive attention ml is the science of artificial intelligence where computer algorithms can be improved with data or experience studies have shown that ml performed satisfactorily in various areas due to its ability to deal with non linear and linear relations and abnormal data de ath fabricius 2000 shahhosseini et al 2020 some researchers have reported the performance of ml algorithms in crop yield and dry matter prediction kang et al 2020 ma et al 2019 johnson et al 2016 for instance han et al 2020 predicted wheat yield from weather soil properties and remote sensing parameters using eight ml algorithms the results suggested that support vector machine svm gaussian process regression gpr and random forest rf algorithms performed better in yield prediction reisi gahrouei et al 2020 employed two ml algorithms associated with three crop dry matter predictions based on multi temporal and multi spectral imagery they concluded that support vector regression svr provided a better approach than artificial neural network ann for dry matter prediction of three crops however previous studies on the ml prediction of crop yield have often required variables over the entire growth period meaning that final crop yield cannot be fully predicted until the end of the growing season which limits decision making this paper integrated datasets from long term field experiments and extracted thirteen indicators such as the total amount of water precipitation and irrigation fertilizer application soil physicochemical properties and planting density during the winter wheat growth period to construct an ml model for yield and dry matter prediction of winter wheat in the ncp the objectives of this research are to 1 compare the accuracy of five ml algorithms linear regression lr decision tree dt support vector machine svm ensemble learning el and gaussian process regression gpr for winter wheat yield and dry matter prediction in the ncp and determine the optimal algorithm 2 validate the yield and dry matter prediction results of the optimal algorithm and 3 develop a suitable polynomial function of winter wheat yield and dry matter in relation to water and nitrogen application for different regions in the ncp the proposed method makes it viable to predict the yield and dry matter of winter wheat before planting and to provide appropriate water and nitrogen management strategies to guide water and fertilizer inputs during the winter wheat growing season the results will be useful for both farmers and decision makers in formulating rational farmland management decisions and national grain policies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this paper we focus on the ncp a major winter wheat growing region in china fig 1 the region falls into a monsoon climate with hot rainy summers june to august and cold dry winters december to february rashid et al 2019 the winter wheat grown across the ncp is generally sown in october and harvested in june while a small amount of precipitation exists during the winter wheat season in this region the precipitation is inadequate for maintaining normal winter wheat growth hence pumping groundwater has been widely applied for supplementary irrigation by local farmers wang et al 2018 2 2 data collection in this study relevant data from 48 peer reviewed papers 41 and 7 published in english and chinese respectively carried out at 16 sites for the years 1999 2019 in the ncp were collected appendix a the training datasets for both winter wheat yield and dry matter prediction were 300 sets and the test datasets were all 75 sets we recorded the following datasets from the selected papers winter wheat yield annual grain yield in kilograms per hectare winter wheat dry matter aboveground dry matter of winter wheat at maturity stage in kilograms per hectare total amount of water precipitation and irrigation throughout winter wheat growing season in millimeters fertilization data the amount of fertilizer was uniformly converted to the content of pure nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in kilograms per hectare planting density in ten thousand plants per hectare physicochemical properties of the soil cultivated layer 0 20 cm seven soil features were considered in this paper including soil organic matter content in grams per kilogram soil available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium content in milligrams per kilogram soil total nitrogen total phosphorus content in grams per kilogram and soil ph value the following criteria were required for datasets collection to be included in this paper 1 the experimental sites were located in the ncp 2 the experiments had to be conducted in the field 3 different water or nitrogen application rates had to be included in the publications 4 the relevant data in the articles were extracted directly from tables or were obtained by contacting the authors when presented graphically if we failed to contact the authors getdata graph digitizer version 2 26 was used to digitize and extract the data in the chart and 5 data from common cultivation techniques and management practices were preferred these datasets comprised the kernel information for winter wheat yield prediction which was used as the input for ml algorithms these components were selected as the input variables because all of them affect crop yield rashid et al 2021 total amount of water precipitation and irrigation fertilization data planting density and soil properties were defined as independent variables the yield and dry matter were defined as response variables the prediction models for winter wheat yield and dry matter were constructed separately using machine learning toolbox regression learner in matlab the effectiveness of the optimal prediction model was assessed by comparing predicted and measured values of winter wheat yield and dry matter finally a function of water and nitrogen application in relation to yield and dry matter is proposed to guide the field management of winter wheat in the ncp 2 3 machine learning algorithms typically ml algorithms involve the process of learning from experience or examples training data to optimize a task when the learning results meet the mathematical and statistical performance metrics ml algorithms can be used to provide correct predictions for the new data test data using the rules learned during the training process liakos et al 2018 all the collected raw data and information was pre processed and organized into a suitable state before importing the training samples into the trained model the pre processing effort includes data cleaning data integration and data conversion benos et al 2021 the ml system pipeline is illustrated in fig 2 five widely used ml algorithms have been applied to forecast winter wheat yield and dry matter in this study 2 3 1 linear regression lr lr in machine learning is a form of supervising learning to determine quantitative interdependent relationships between two or more variables liakos et al 2018 learning can be done by assuming a linear relationship among variables hence the value of an output variable can be calculated according to the input variable lr is expressed as the following equation 1 y w 0 x 0 w 1 x 1 w 2 x 2 w n x n where y is the model output x 0 x n are model input variables x 0 1 and w 0 w n are the regression parameters to solve for the optimal parameter a loss function is constructed to measure the difference between the measured and predicted values 2 l 1 n i 1 n yi ˆ y i 2 where l is the loss function n is the total number of samples yi ˆ is the predicted value and y i is the measured value the training process of lr model is shown in fig 3 2 3 2 decision tree dt in machine learning dt is a prediction model which represents a mapping relationship between object attributes and object values du et al 2020b the gradient boosting dt is a supervised machine learning model which has the advantages of readability and fast classification the first mentioned of dt algorithms are id3 and c4 5 which were developed by quinlan 1986 1994 as well as classification and regression trees cart proposed by breiman et al 1984 the dt does not have a specific equation to wrap the datasets the construction of dt consists of three steps building nodes root nodes internal nodes and leaf nodes based on features minimizing sample splits and impurity elavarasan et al 2018 the lower the impurity the better the dt fits the training samples there are two indexes of impurity cross entropy and gini which are calculated as follows 3 entropy i p i log 2 p i 4 gini 1 i 0 n 1 p i 2 here p i denotes the proportion of samples in class i to the total number of samples 2 3 3 support vector machine svm svm is a class of generalized linear classifier that classifies data binary by a supervised learning method whose decision boundary is the maximum margin hyperplane for learning samples liakos et al 2018 svm can be used to perform machine learning tasks such as regression and classification where the kernel trick is used to map the input to a high dimensional feature space firstly and then insensitive loss is used for linear regression in the feature space to reduce the complexity of the model by minimizing the empirical risk cai et al 2019 han et al 2020 the ability to solve nonlinear classification problems with methods designed for linear classifiers is one of the advantages of svms ben hur and weston 2010 the function of the linear classifier is represented as 5 f x w t x b here w is the weight vector b is the bias the function of the nonlinear boundaries generated by the introduction of the kernel is 6 f x i 1 n k x x i b 2 3 4 ensemble learning el el methods utilize strategies to construct a committee of single classifiers or simpler base learners to improve the predictive accuracy of the given single or base predictors nti et al 2020 el methods have been rapidly evolved in statistics and machine learning largely due to el methods can highlight the strengths and watered down the weaknesses of the base classifiers two advanced el techniques i e boosted trees bst and bagged trees bgt were used in the paper the training process fig 4 of el is to train several individual learners for the training set data to accomplish the learning task through certain combination strategies which can result in a significantly superior strong learners than an individual learner sagi and rokach 2018 2 3 5 gaussian process regression gpr gpr is a non parametric model that uses gaussian process priors to perform regression analysis on data which belongs to supervised machine learning karbasi et al 2021 a gaussian process is a collection of random variables where a finite subset has a joint gaussian distribution han et al 2020 gpr is based on a kernel function which can reveal the correlations between prediction elements musil et al 2017 these kernels can be used for prediction or classification gpr is defined as the following formula zhou and ismaeel 2021 7 p y i f x i x i n y i h x i t β f x i σ 2 here f x i is a latent variable developed for each sample x i p y i f x i x i is the density of samples h x i is basis function β is the parameter vector σ 2 is the noise in the sample density 2 4 model evaluation and validation a widely used cross validation method was employed to evaluate the five ml algorithms in a 10 fold cross validation scheme we used the root mean squared error rmse the mean absolute error mae the mean squared error mse and coefficient of determination r2 to compare the accuracy of different models abbas et al 2020 elavarasan et al 2018 validation of the prediction results of the best model with datasets selected from outside the data pool the architecture of winter wheat yield and dry matter prediction is presented in fig 5 these performance metrics were calculated as follows 8 rmse i 1 n yi yi 2 n 9 mae 1 n i 1 n yi yi 10 mse i 1 n yi yi 2 n i 1 n yi yi 2 n 11 r 2 i 1 n yi y 2 i 1 n yi yi 2 i 1 n yi y 2 where n is the sample size yi is the measured value yi is the predicted value y is the mean value of yi 3 results 3 1 model accuracy comparisons of yield prediction the five algorithms mentioned above were trained to compare the performance of the various models a summary of training and test results of five algorithms for winter wheat yield prediction is reported in table 1 the highest r2 0 89 for training set 0 87 for test set and the lowest mse 0 21 for training set 0 66 for test set kg ha 2 mae 386 1 for training set 715 1 for test set kg ha and rmse 461 6 for training set 814 7 for test set kg ha were recorded by the gpr a relatively lower r2 was observed for svm followed by el and dt with lr presenting the lowest r2 the mse mae and rmse for training set were in the ranges of 0 21 0 95 kg ha 2 386 1 773 kg ha and 461 6 974 3 kg ha and 0 66 2 6 kg ha 2 715 1 1311 7 kg ha and 814 7 1627 8 kg ha for test set among the five algorithms respectively the lr showed the worst performance with the lowest r2 for both training 0 50 and test 0 36 results fig 6 further illustrates the measured and predicted yields of winter wheat the results of both training and test datasets are shown overall the gpr had the best performance among the five options with the least accurate performance for lr 3 2 model accuracy comparisons of dry matter prediction the training and test results of the five algorithms on dry matter of winter wheat are listed in table 2 similar to the results of winter wheat yield prediction the gpr outperformed all other algorithms with r2 of 0 90 and 0 86 for training and test sets respectively a relatively lower r2 was observed for svm followed by el and dt with lr presenting the least accurate performance the mse mae and rmse for training set were in the ranges of 1 0 8 4 kg ha 2 842 4 2222 1 kg ha and 1018 2 2903 5 kg ha and 4 0 20 5 kg ha 2 1648 8 3535 1 kg ha and 2002 7 4524 9 kg ha for test set among the five algorithms respectively for both training and test results the highest values for mse mae and rmse were recorded by the lr and the lowest values for mse mae and rmse were recorded by the gpr fig 7 presents the measured and predicted dry matters of winter wheat as a whole the gpr showed a higher performance than other four options in dry matter prediction 3 3 model validation of yield prediction the data of zhang et al 2018 were used to validate the optimal prediction model gpr of winter wheat yield the field experiment was carried out during the 2012 2013 winter wheat growing season in shangqiu henan province 115 34 e 34 35 n and 51 m altitude nine datasets including soil physicochemical properties and planting density were input into the gpr model to predict winter wheat yield with different water and nitrogen treatments and the comparison of measured and predicted winter wheat yields is summarized in table 3 the predicted yield was slightly higher than the measured value and the maximum measured and predicted yields of 6919 and 7313 3 kg ha were achieved when the total amount of water and nitrogen application was 373 mm and 225 kg ha respectively fig 8 shows the prediction results of winter wheat yield by the gpr model with different water and nitrogen treatments the maximum predicted yield of winter wheat was achieved when the total amount of water and nitrogen applied rate ranged from 350 to 450 mm and 200 300 kg ha respectively the total amount of water and nitrogen applied rates for the measured maximum yield were consistent with the ranges of water and nitrogen for the predicted maximum yield 3 4 relationship of water and nitrogen application with yield in order to facilitate the prediction of winter wheat yield and the application rates of water and nitrogen polynomial fitting was carried out to predict the winter wheat yield in the optimal range of water and nitrogen applications the function relationship of water and nitrogen application with winter wheat yield can be described as follows 12 y 5969 2 5 w 6 8 n 3 8 10 3 w 2 2 5 10 3 w n 1 6 10 2 n 2 where y is the predicted yield of winter wheat kg ha w is the total amount of water mm n is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer kg ha fig 9 shows the polynomial fitting result the goodness of the fit is shown as r2 and rmse with values of 0 99 and 0 92 respectively maximizing the polynomial y w 0 y n 0 indicates that the maximum predicted yield of 7322 6 kg ha was attained when the total amount of water and nitrogen application were 420 mm and 240 kg ha respectively the prediction errors of the gpr model for the optimal yield of winter wheat and the corresponding total amount of water and nitrogen application were 5 8 12 6 and 6 7 respectively 3 5 model validation of dry matter prediction the experimental data of lv et al 2020 were inputted into the gpr model to validate the accuracy of the model for winter wheat dry matter prediction the field experiment was carried out across two winter wheat growing seasons 2015 2017 in taian shandong province 116 47 e 35 57 n and 134 m altitude table 4 summarizes the comparison of measured and predicted winter wheat dry matter using the gpr model for validated treatments the predicted values of winter wheat dry matter were slightly higher than the measured values and the maximum measured dry matter of 16042 kg ha was achieved when the total amount of water and nitrogen application were 336 mm and 180 kg ha however the maximum predicted yield of 16213 kg ha was attained when the total amount of water and nitrogen application were 336 mm and 225 kg ha the predicted dry matter of winter wheat with different water and nitrogen treatments using the gpr model is given in fig 10 the maximum predicted dry matter of winter wheat was achieved when the total amount of water and nitrogen application ranged from 300 to 400 mm and 150 300 kg ha respectively which were consistent with the values of water and nitrogen for the measured maximum dry matter 3 6 relationship of water and nitrogen application with dry matter we performed polynomial fitting for the predicted dry matter of winter wheat in the ranges of total amount of water from 300 to 400 mm and nitrogen application rate from 150 to 300 kg ha the relationship of water and nitrogen application with winter wheat dry matter can be described by the following function 13 dm 9470 18 4 w 29 3 n 17 3 10 3 w 2 24 6 10 3 w n 43 6 10 3 n 2 where dm is the predicted dry matter of winter wheat kg ha w is the total amount of water mm n is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer kg ha the polynomial fitting result of predicted winter wheat dry matter is presented in fig 11 the r2 and rmse for the goodness of fit were 0 99 and 9 7 respectively maximizing the function dm w 0 dm n 0 shows that the total amount of water and nitrogen applied rate with the values of 358 mm and 230 kg ha respectively to achieve the maximum predicted winter wheat dry matter of 16226 kg ha the prediction errors for the highest dry matter of winter wheat and the corresponding total amount of water and nitrogen application based on the gpr model were 1 1 6 5 and 27 8 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 comparative analysis of ml algorithms in this paper the datasets of soil properties fertilizer precipitation and irrigation etc were collected based on previous studies which were used as inputs to drive the ml models making various algorithms show different performances in yield and dry matter prediction the inherent limitations and assumptions among datasets make the selection of an optimal algorithm a major challenge even though it may not represent true relationships between datasets abbas et al 2020 the model comparison results indicated that the gpr model exhibited the best overall performance in terms of r2 mse mae and rmse results tables 1 and 2 the gpr model resulted in the lowest prediction errors and presented more concentration around the 1 1 line whereas the other four models presented more scatter around the 1 1 line figs 6 and 7 the reason accounting for the better performance of the gpr due to better capability of solving non linear problems autonomously chlingaryan et al 2018 previous studies also demonstrated that most non linear algorithms are better than linear algorithms for agrarian frameworks because production attributes such as soil properties weather irrigation and fertilizer application have a non linear relationship with yield and dry matter cao et al 2020 youssef et al 2015 the svm model was second only to the gpr for yield and dry matter predictions attributed to its ability to learn data patterns precisely as well as exhibit reproducibility noble 2006 the el and dt had the next highest r2 value than svm the el compensates the errors of a single inducer by combining various inducers sagi and rokach 2018 the dt has the ability to handle irrelevant features while handling samples with missing attributes kingsford and salzberg 2008 as the yield and dry matter of crops depend on multiple and interacting factors less effective predicted outcomes are presented with correlation analysis abbas et al 2020 this is consistent with our conclusion that lr is the worst predictive algorithm second the prediction based on gpr is a process of probabilistic inference which can quantify the uncertainty of a prediction in a principled way castaldi et al 2016 furthermore the gpr enables consideration of sensor noise when regulating probabilistically fused information and providing confidence intervals for the estimations dalponte et al 2012 in a study of five ml models to estimate the yields of wheat and rice zhou and ismaeel 2021 recorded the outperformance of gpr over other models the findings of our study also reveal the superior performance of gpr in predicting the yield and dry matter of winter wheat our results indicate that the gpr overestimates the true values of winter wheat yield and dry matter tables 3 and 4 this overestimation can be explained for the following reasons first the smaller data points result in the difference between the predicted and measured values of yield and dry matter besides we did not consider temperature pests and diseases and the uncertainties associated with cultivation management which are significantly related to yield and dry matter maqsood et al 2020 therefore the predictive values inevitably deviated from the statistical values moreover some limitations exist when ml algorithms are driven naively by purely data the quality of the input datasets determines the accuracy of the model predictions data with outliers and biases erroneous data incomplete data and noisy data led to significantly inferior predictive accuracy chlingaryan et al 2018 despite the overestimation the optimal prediction values of yield and dry matter based on the gpr were close to the measurements which demonstrates that the overfitting and outlier problems can be appropriately overcome by gpr in conclusion the gpr model exhibited acceptable performance consequently it provides extraordinary forecasting potential and furthermore offers a powerful and flexible framework for agricultural data driven decision making 4 2 optimization of water and nitrogen application rates of winter wheat based on the gpr model one of the key goals pursued by agricultural production is to obtain maximum return at minimum input with a healthy ecosystem the prediction of yield and dry matter has important implications for crop management and decision making identifying and managing problems associated with crop yield constraints in advance can help improve production efficiency the purpose of the ml method widely applied in the agriculture field is to provide farmers with accurate information and help optimize economic benefits in a pursuit to make correct and reasonable decisions it is essential to understand the relationship between crop yield and the various factors that influence it holzman et al 2018 the prediction of winter wheat yield and dry matter have been considered together with water and nitrogen status in this paper because they are directly related to water and fertilizer management decisions in order to develop site specific water and fertilizer management plans it is particularly important to estimate the yield and dry matter of crops with water and nitrogen inputs in order to achieve the maximum grain yield of winter wheat intensive use of groundwater and fertilizer has seriously threatened the ecological balance of the ncp the precipitation throughout the winter wheat growing season over the past six decades in the region has ranged from 60 to 180 mm li et al 2005 zhang et al 2002 which does not meet the evapotranspiration demand of 450 mm for winter wheat growth liu et al 2002 conventional winter wheat field management practices in the ncp include supplemental irrigation of 180 300 mm kumar jha et al 2019 and nitrogen fertilizer in excess of 300 kg ha tan et al 2017 our predicted findings based on the gpr model indicate that the yield and dry matter of winter wheat increased with increasing water and nitrogen application rates until reached the optimal range of water and nitrogen applications after which wheat yield and dry matter no longer responded to water and nitrogen rates figs 8 and 10 the threshold effect of water and nitrogen rates on crop growth showed that excessive water and nitrogen applications did not result further increase in crop production previous studies showed that the increase of water and nitrogen application rates reduced the water and nitrogen use efficiency and the optimum yield and dry matter of winter wheat can be obtained with appropriate water and nitrogen supply kumar jha et al 2019 cui et al 2010 the predicted results suggest that the maximum yield and dry matter of winter wheat were 7322 6 and 16226 kg ha when the application rates of water and nitrogen were 420 mm 240 kg ha and 358 mm 230 kg ha respectively figs 9 and 11 the predicted optimal water and nitrogen application ranges were consistent with the application rates from the field trials the water and nitrogen coupling function proposed in this paper is an application of the ml prediction approach we could collect features such as soil properties and planting density in different regions of the ncp as independent variables for model input and develop an appropriate water and fertilizer coupling function for different regions which could be used to guide local winter wheat field management and decision making appropriate adjustment of irrigation and nitrogen management measures in agricultural practice can reduce the negative impact on the environment and improve the efficiency of water and nitrogen utilization yang et al 2020 ml techniques could fuse farmland and meteorological data including soil type precipitation initial water and nitrogen content farmland management practices yield targets and economic returns to provide instructive recommendations for fertilization and irrigation goldstein et al 2017 ml applications in agriculture offer the possibility of varying the amount of irrigation to achieve improved water use efficiency benos et al 2021 the amount of irrigation varies according to field variability agronomic factors and specific water requirements in different areas rather than using the same strategy throughout the area in the work of gutiérrez et al 2018 authors have assessed water status of vineyards using two ml techniques and on the go thermal imaging which has the potential to guide irrigation ml techniques also play an important role in addressing soil fertility imbalance due to over fertilization which contributes to better soil management in accordance with spatial heterogeneity for sustainable agricultural development morellos et al 2016 wheat yield and dry matter predictions are typically used to calculate water and nitrogen requirements and to design potential site specific management schemes for water and fertilizer 4 3 limitations and further work as with other data driven models ml inevitably suffers from certain limitations outliers and extremes in the training datasets may seriously affect the accuracy of the prediction results the black box within ml increases uncertainty in model performance because it does not include any of the processes of crop growth making it difficult to generate testable hypotheses that might provide biological insights cao et al 2021 the use of extensive features in model training did not always offer optimal prediction performance hence a more diverse range of models should be tested van klompenburg et al 2020 combining ml models with crop models that characterize the internal growth and development mechanisms of crops while considering meteorological indicators such as solar radiation and growing degree days gdd could be suggested as a proposal for future work better ml algorithms to predict crop growth could also be attempted 5 conclusion in this study we tested five ml models namely lr dt svm el and gpr for the prediction of winter wheat yield and dry matter using datasets from 1999 to 2019 across the ncp from the prediction results it is clear that the gpr model performed the best and the lr model could not perform satisfactorily for wheat yield and dry matter prediction among the five models which indicates the advantages of non linear algorithms compared with the measured values in the field the prediction errors of the maximum yield of winter wheat and the corresponding total amount of water and nitrogen application based on the gpr model were 5 8 12 6 and 6 7 respectively the prediction errors of the maximum dry matter and the corresponding water and nitrogen application were 1 1 6 5 and 27 8 respectively the maximum yield and dry matter of winter wheat and the optimal water and nitrogen application ranges predicted by the gpr model were generally consistent with the results of field trials the r2 goodness of fit of the water and nitrogen coupling functions constructed from the gpr model was 0 99 for both winter wheat yield and dry matter which could help guide farmland management such as irrigation volumes and nitrogen application rates these findings generated from this study could contribute to predicting regional crop productivity and providing agricultural decision recommendations for better crop and environment state prediction which could be helpful for scientific water and nitrogen management strategy formulation and global food security the generic model proposed in this paper exhibits potentially applied to agricultural systems around

the whole country s wheat sown area and contributes 60 of the total wheat production duan et al 2019 dominating the winter wheat production in china consequently it is particularly important to make early and robust forecasts of yield and dry matter of winter wheat in the ncp calculation of water and nitrogen requirements based on crop yield targets helps devise site specific water and fertilizer management plans in the ncp where uniform agronomic practice management of winter wheat fields is implemented conventional farmland practices are managed with a unified application of irrigation water mineral fertilizers and pesticides gu et al 2016 ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of wheat fields in soil properties topography and vegetation in order to achieve a higher winter wheat yield the flood irrigation method zain et al 2021 and excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer more than 300 kg ha 1 tan et al 2017 have often been adopted by local farmers this not only caused the waste of water resources zhang et al 2017 and the depletion of groundwater table xu et al 2018 but also seriously reduced the water and nitrogen utilization efficiency si et al 2020 dar et al 2017 mon et al 2016 in addition excessive application of nitrogen fertilizer and irrigation undoubtedly led to increased production costs and negative environmental impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions du et al 2020a and water pollution caused by the leaching of nitrate nitrogen wang et al 2015 therefore the knowledge of potential wheat yield and the effects of water and fertilizer inputs on wheat production as well as the relationship of the yield to the soil topographic factors is vital to address these issues according to the yield and dry matter predictions of winter wheat optimized water and nitrogen inputs may improve profitability and environmental sustainability by promoting soil and wheat management strategies winter wheat yield depends on a variety of complex factors including climatic conditions soil quality genotype agronomic management practices and the control policy of grain holzman et al 2018 singh et al 2016 wang et al 2020 the interaction of these factors poses challenges for accurate prediction of wheat yield moreover dry matter is one of the indicators reflecting wheat productivity which is of significance for yield prediction and precision agriculture application walter et al 2018 in recent years some crop yield and dry matter prediction methods such as empirical and mathematical yield models shi et al 2013 lobell burke 2010 process oriented crop models jones et al 2003 holzworth et al 2014 and remote sensing techniques schwalbert et al 2020 hara et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 have been gradually applied to forecast crop parameters however conventional empirical statistical models require extensive knowledge of climate crop and soil which makes them poor in spatial generalization similarly process oriented crop growth models are time consuming and expensive which makes them difficult to put into practical production applications furthermore some satellite based remote sensing datasets are incapable of providing sufficient spatial details of small scale farmland for optimization of agricultural management the improvement of new technologies and innovations including a comprehensive analysis of big data with high performance computing has provided a guarantee of reliable and accurate crop parameter prediction of these technologies machine learning ml has received extensive attention ml is the science of artificial intelligence where computer algorithms can be improved with data or experience studies have shown that ml performed satisfactorily in various areas due to its ability to deal with non linear and linear relations and abnormal data de ath fabricius 2000 shahhosseini et al 2020 some researchers have reported the performance of ml algorithms in crop yield and dry matter prediction kang et al 2020 ma et al 2019 johnson et al 2016 for instance han et al 2020 predicted wheat yield from weather soil properties and remote sensing parameters using eight ml algorithms the results suggested that support vector machine svm gaussian process regression gpr and random forest rf algorithms performed better in yield prediction reisi gahrouei et al 2020 employed two ml algorithms associated with three crop dry matter predictions based on multi temporal and multi spectral imagery they concluded that support vector regression svr provided a better approach than artificial neural network ann for dry matter prediction of three crops however previous studies on the ml prediction of crop yield have often required variables over the entire growth period meaning that final crop yield cannot be fully predicted until the end of the growing season which limits decision making this paper integrated datasets from long term field experiments and extracted thirteen indicators such as the total amount of water precipitation and irrigation fertilizer application soil physicochemical properties and planting density during the winter wheat growth period to construct an ml model for yield and dry matter prediction of winter wheat in the ncp the objectives of this research are to 1 compare the accuracy of five ml algorithms linear regression lr decision tree dt support vector machine svm ensemble learning el and gaussian process regression gpr for winter wheat yield and dry matter prediction in the ncp and determine the optimal algorithm 2 validate the yield and dry matter prediction results of the optimal algorithm and 3 develop a suitable polynomial function of winter wheat yield and dry matter in relation to water and nitrogen application for different regions in the ncp the proposed method makes it viable to predict the yield and dry matter of winter wheat before planting and to provide appropriate water and nitrogen management strategies to guide water and fertilizer inputs during the winter wheat growing season the results will be useful for both farmers and decision makers in formulating rational farmland management decisions and national grain policies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area in this paper we focus on the ncp a major winter wheat growing region in china fig 1 the region falls into a monsoon climate with hot rainy summers june to august and cold dry winters december to february rashid et al 2019 the winter wheat grown across the ncp is generally sown in october and harvested in june while a small amount of precipitation exists during the winter wheat season in this region the precipitation is inadequate for maintaining normal winter wheat growth hence pumping groundwater has been widely applied for supplementary irrigation by local farmers wang et al 2018 2 2 data collection in this study relevant data from 48 peer reviewed papers 41 and 7 published in english and chinese respectively carried out at 16 sites for the years 1999 2019 in the ncp were collected appendix a the training datasets for both winter wheat yield and dry matter prediction were 300 sets and the test datasets were all 75 sets we recorded the following datasets from the selected papers winter wheat yield annual grain yield in kilograms per hectare winter wheat dry matter aboveground dry matter of winter wheat at maturity stage in kilograms per hectare total amount of water precipitation and irrigation throughout winter wheat growing season in millimeters fertilization data the amount of fertilizer was uniformly converted to the content of pure nitrogen phosphorus and potassium in kilograms per hectare planting density in ten thousand plants per hectare physicochemical properties of the soil cultivated layer 0 20 cm seven soil features were considered in this paper including soil organic matter content in grams per kilogram soil available nitrogen available phosphorus and available potassium content in milligrams per kilogram soil total nitrogen total phosphorus content in grams per kilogram and soil ph value the following criteria were required for datasets collection to be included in this paper 1 the experimental sites were located in the ncp 2 the experiments had to be conducted in the field 3 different water or nitrogen application rates had to be included in the publications 4 the relevant data in the articles were extracted directly from tables or were obtained by contacting the authors when presented graphically if we failed to contact the authors getdata graph digitizer version 2 26 was used to digitize and extract the data in the chart and 5 data from common cultivation techniques and management practices were preferred these datasets comprised the kernel information for winter wheat yield prediction which was used as the input for ml algorithms these components were selected as the input variables because all of them affect crop yield rashid et al 2021 total amount of water precipitation and irrigation fertilization data planting density and soil properties were defined as independent variables the yield and dry matter were defined as response variables the prediction models for winter wheat yield and dry matter were constructed separately using machine learning toolbox regression learner in matlab the effectiveness of the optimal prediction model was assessed by comparing predicted and measured values of winter wheat yield and dry matter finally a function of water and nitrogen application in relation to yield and dry matter is proposed to guide the field management of winter wheat in the ncp 2 3 machine learning algorithms typically ml algorithms involve the process of learning from experience or examples training data to optimize a task when the learning results meet the mathematical and statistical performance metrics ml algorithms can be used to provide correct predictions for the new data test data using the rules learned during the training process liakos et al 2018 all the collected raw data and information was pre processed and organized into a suitable state before importing the training samples into the trained model the pre processing effort includes data cleaning data integration and data conversion benos et al 2021 the ml system pipeline is illustrated in fig 2 five widely used ml algorithms have been applied to forecast winter wheat yield and dry matter in this study 2 3 1 linear regression lr lr in machine learning is a form of supervising learning to determine quantitative interdependent relationships between two or more variables liakos et al 2018 learning can be done by assuming a linear relationship among variables hence the value of an output variable can be calculated according to the input variable lr is expressed as the following equation 1 y w 0 x 0 w 1 x 1 w 2 x 2 w n x n where y is the model output x 0 x n are model input variables x 0 1 and w 0 w n are the regression parameters to solve for the optimal parameter a loss function is constructed to measure the difference between the measured and predicted values 2 l 1 n i 1 n yi ˆ y i 2 where l is the loss function n is the total number of samples yi ˆ is the predicted value and y i is the measured value the training process of lr model is shown in fig 3 2 3 2 decision tree dt in machine learning dt is a prediction model which represents a mapping relationship between object attributes and object values du et al 2020b the gradient boosting dt is a supervised machine learning model which has the advantages of readability and fast classification the first mentioned of dt algorithms are id3 and c4 5 which were developed by quinlan 1986 1994 as well as classification and regression trees cart proposed by breiman et al 1984 the dt does not have a specific equation to wrap the datasets the construction of dt consists of three steps building nodes root nodes internal nodes and leaf nodes based on features minimizing sample splits and impurity elavarasan et al 2018 the lower the impurity the better the dt fits the training samples there are two indexes of impurity cross entropy and gini which are calculated as follows 3 entropy i p i log 2 p i 4 gini 1 i 0 n 1 p i 2 here p i denotes the proportion of samples in class i to the total number of samples 2 3 3 support vector machine svm svm is a class of generalized linear classifier that classifies data binary by a supervised learning method whose decision boundary is the maximum margin hyperplane for learning samples liakos et al 2018 svm can be used to perform machine learning tasks such as regression and classification where the kernel trick is used to map the input to a high dimensional feature space firstly and then insensitive loss is used for linear regression in the feature space to reduce the complexity of the model by minimizing the empirical risk cai et al 2019 han et al 2020 the ability to solve nonlinear classification problems with methods designed for linear classifiers is one of the advantages of svms ben hur and weston 2010 the function of the linear classifier is represented as 5 f x w t x b here w is the weight vector b is the bias the function of the nonlinear boundaries generated by the introduction of the kernel is 6 f x i 1 n k x x i b 2 3 4 ensemble learning el el methods utilize strategies to construct a committee of single classifiers or simpler base learners to improve the predictive accuracy of the given single or base predictors nti et al 2020 el methods have been rapidly evolved in statistics and machine learning largely due to el methods can highlight the strengths and watered down the weaknesses of the base classifiers two advanced el techniques i e boosted trees bst and bagged trees bgt were used in the paper the training process fig 4 of el is to train several individual learners for the training set data to accomplish the learning task through certain combination strategies which can result in a significantly superior strong learners than an individual learner sagi and rokach 2018 2 3 5 gaussian process regression gpr gpr is a non parametric model that uses gaussian process priors to perform regression analysis on data which belongs to supervised machine learning karbasi et al 2021 a gaussian process is a collection of random variables where a finite subset has a joint gaussian distribution han et al 2020 gpr is based on a kernel function which can reveal the correlations between prediction elements musil et al 2017 these kernels can be used for prediction or classification gpr is defined as the following formula zhou and ismaeel 2021 7 p y i f x i x i n y i h x i t β f x i σ 2 here f x i is a latent variable developed for each sample x i p y i f x i x i is the density of samples h x i is basis function β is the parameter vector σ 2 is the noise in the sample density 2 4 model evaluation and validation a widely used cross validation method was employed to evaluate the five ml algorithms in a 10 fold cross validation scheme we used the root mean squared error rmse the mean absolute error mae the mean squared error mse and coefficient of determination r2 to compare the accuracy of different models abbas et al 2020 elavarasan et al 2018 validation of the prediction results of the best model with datasets selected from outside the data pool the architecture of winter wheat yield and dry matter prediction is presented in fig 5 these performance metrics were calculated as follows 8 rmse i 1 n yi yi 2 n 9 mae 1 n i 1 n yi yi 10 mse i 1 n yi yi 2 n i 1 n yi yi 2 n 11 r 2 i 1 n yi y 2 i 1 n yi yi 2 i 1 n yi y 2 where n is the sample size yi is the measured value yi is the predicted value y is the mean value of yi 3 results 3 1 model accuracy comparisons of yield prediction the five algorithms mentioned above were trained to compare the performance of the various models a summary of training and test results of five algorithms for winter wheat yield prediction is reported in table 1 the highest r2 0 89 for training set 0 87 for test set and the lowest mse 0 21 for training set 0 66 for test set kg ha 2 mae 386 1 for training set 715 1 for test set kg ha and rmse 461 6 for training set 814 7 for test set kg ha were recorded by the gpr a relatively lower r2 was observed for svm followed by el and dt with lr presenting the lowest r2 the mse mae and rmse for training set were in the ranges of 0 21 0 95 kg ha 2 386 1 773 kg ha and 461 6 974 3 kg ha and 0 66 2 6 kg ha 2 715 1 1311 7 kg ha and 814 7 1627 8 kg ha for test set among the five algorithms respectively the lr showed the worst performance with the lowest r2 for both training 0 50 and test 0 36 results fig 6 further illustrates the measured and predicted yields of winter wheat the results of both training and test datasets are shown overall the gpr had the best performance among the five options with the least accurate performance for lr 3 2 model accuracy comparisons of dry matter prediction the training and test results of the five algorithms on dry matter of winter wheat are listed in table 2 similar to the results of winter wheat yield prediction the gpr outperformed all other algorithms with r2 of 0 90 and 0 86 for training and test sets respectively a relatively lower r2 was observed for svm followed by el and dt with lr presenting the least accurate performance the mse mae and rmse for training set were in the ranges of 1 0 8 4 kg ha 2 842 4 2222 1 kg ha and 1018 2 2903 5 kg ha and 4 0 20 5 kg ha 2 1648 8 3535 1 kg ha and 2002 7 4524 9 kg ha for test set among the five algorithms respectively for both training and test results the highest values for mse mae and rmse were recorded by the lr and the lowest values for mse mae and rmse were recorded by the gpr fig 7 presents the measured and predicted dry matters of winter wheat as a whole the gpr showed a higher performance than other four options in dry matter prediction 3 3 model validation of yield prediction the data of zhang et al 2018 were used to validate the optimal prediction model gpr of winter wheat yield the field experiment was carried out during the 2012 2013 winter wheat growing season in shangqiu henan province 115 34 e 34 35 n and 51 m altitude nine datasets including soil physicochemical properties and planting density were input into the gpr model to predict winter wheat yield with different water and nitrogen treatments and the comparison of measured and predicted winter wheat yields is summarized in table 3 the predicted yield was slightly higher than the measured value and the maximum measured and predicted yields of 6919 and 7313 3 kg ha were achieved when the total amount of water and nitrogen application was 373 mm and 225 kg ha respectively fig 8 shows the prediction results of winter wheat yield by the gpr model with different water and nitrogen treatments the maximum predicted yield of winter wheat was achieved when the total amount of water and nitrogen applied rate ranged from 350 to 450 mm and 200 300 kg ha respectively the total amount of water and nitrogen applied rates for the measured maximum yield were consistent with the ranges of water and nitrogen for the predicted maximum yield 3 4 relationship of water and nitrogen application with yield in order to facilitate the prediction of winter wheat yield and the application rates of water and nitrogen polynomial fitting was carried out to predict the winter wheat yield in the optimal range of water and nitrogen applications the function relationship of water and nitrogen application with winter wheat yield can be described as follows 12 y 5969 2 5 w 6 8 n 3 8 10 3 w 2 2 5 10 3 w n 1 6 10 2 n 2 where y is the predicted yield of winter wheat kg ha w is the total amount of water mm n is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer kg ha fig 9 shows the polynomial fitting result the goodness of the fit is shown as r2 and rmse with values of 0 99 and 0 92 respectively maximizing the polynomial y w 0 y n 0 indicates that the maximum predicted yield of 7322 6 kg ha was attained when the total amount of water and nitrogen application were 420 mm and 240 kg ha respectively the prediction errors of the gpr model for the optimal yield of winter wheat and the corresponding total amount of water and nitrogen application were 5 8 12 6 and 6 7 respectively 3 5 model validation of dry matter prediction the experimental data of lv et al 2020 were inputted into the gpr model to validate the accuracy of the model for winter wheat dry matter prediction the field experiment was carried out across two winter wheat growing seasons 2015 2017 in taian shandong province 116 47 e 35 57 n and 134 m altitude table 4 summarizes the comparison of measured and predicted winter wheat dry matter using the gpr model for validated treatments the predicted values of winter wheat dry matter were slightly higher than the measured values and the maximum measured dry matter of 16042 kg ha was achieved when the total amount of water and nitrogen application were 336 mm and 180 kg ha however the maximum predicted yield of 16213 kg ha was attained when the total amount of water and nitrogen application were 336 mm and 225 kg ha the predicted dry matter of winter wheat with different water and nitrogen treatments using the gpr model is given in fig 10 the maximum predicted dry matter of winter wheat was achieved when the total amount of water and nitrogen application ranged from 300 to 400 mm and 150 300 kg ha respectively which were consistent with the values of water and nitrogen for the measured maximum dry matter 3 6 relationship of water and nitrogen application with dry matter we performed polynomial fitting for the predicted dry matter of winter wheat in the ranges of total amount of water from 300 to 400 mm and nitrogen application rate from 150 to 300 kg ha the relationship of water and nitrogen application with winter wheat dry matter can be described by the following function 13 dm 9470 18 4 w 29 3 n 17 3 10 3 w 2 24 6 10 3 w n 43 6 10 3 n 2 where dm is the predicted dry matter of winter wheat kg ha w is the total amount of water mm n is the amount of nitrogen fertilizer kg ha the polynomial fitting result of predicted winter wheat dry matter is presented in fig 11 the r2 and rmse for the goodness of fit were 0 99 and 9 7 respectively maximizing the function dm w 0 dm n 0 shows that the total amount of water and nitrogen applied rate with the values of 358 mm and 230 kg ha respectively to achieve the maximum predicted winter wheat dry matter of 16226 kg ha the prediction errors for the highest dry matter of winter wheat and the corresponding total amount of water and nitrogen application based on the gpr model were 1 1 6 5 and 27 8 respectively 4 discussion 4 1 comparative analysis of ml algorithms in this paper the datasets of soil properties fertilizer precipitation and irrigation etc were collected based on previous studies which were used as inputs to drive the ml models making various algorithms show different performances in yield and dry matter prediction the inherent limitations and assumptions among datasets make the selection of an optimal algorithm a major challenge even though it may not represent true relationships between datasets abbas et al 2020 the model comparison results indicated that the gpr model exhibited the best overall performance in terms of r2 mse mae and rmse results tables 1 and 2 the gpr model resulted in the lowest prediction errors and presented more concentration around the 1 1 line whereas the other four models presented more scatter around the 1 1 line figs 6 and 7 the reason accounting for the better performance of the gpr due to better capability of solving non linear problems autonomously chlingaryan et al 2018 previous studies also demonstrated that most non linear algorithms are better than linear algorithms for agrarian frameworks because production attributes such as soil properties weather irrigation and fertilizer application have a non linear relationship with yield and dry matter cao et al 2020 youssef et al 2015 the svm model was second only to the gpr for yield and dry matter predictions attributed to its ability to learn data patterns precisely as well as exhibit reproducibility noble 2006 the el and dt had the next highest r2 value than svm the el compensates the errors of a single inducer by combining various inducers sagi and rokach 2018 the dt has the ability to handle irrelevant features while handling samples with missing attributes kingsford and salzberg 2008 as the yield and dry matter of crops depend on multiple and interacting factors less effective predicted outcomes are presented with correlation analysis abbas et al 2020 this is consistent with our conclusion that lr is the worst predictive algorithm second the prediction based on gpr is a process of probabilistic inference which can quantify the uncertainty of a prediction in a principled way castaldi et al 2016 furthermore the gpr enables consideration of sensor noise when regulating probabilistically fused information and providing confidence intervals for the estimations dalponte et al 2012 in a study of five ml models to estimate the yields of wheat and rice zhou and ismaeel 2021 recorded the outperformance of gpr over other models the findings of our study also reveal the superior performance of gpr in predicting the yield and dry matter of winter wheat our results indicate that the gpr overestimates the true values of winter wheat yield and dry matter tables 3 and 4 this overestimation can be explained for the following reasons first the smaller data points result in the difference between the predicted and measured values of yield and dry matter besides we did not consider temperature pests and diseases and the uncertainties associated with cultivation management which are significantly related to yield and dry matter maqsood et al 2020 therefore the predictive values inevitably deviated from the statistical values moreover some limitations exist when ml algorithms are driven naively by purely data the quality of the input datasets determines the accuracy of the model predictions data with outliers and biases erroneous data incomplete data and noisy data led to significantly inferior predictive accuracy chlingaryan et al 2018 despite the overestimation the optimal prediction values of yield and dry matter based on the gpr were close to the measurements which demonstrates that the overfitting and outlier problems can be appropriately overcome by gpr in conclusion the gpr model exhibited acceptable performance consequently it provides extraordinary forecasting potential and furthermore offers a powerful and flexible framework for agricultural data driven decision making 4 2 optimization of water and nitrogen application rates of winter wheat based on the gpr model one of the key goals pursued by agricultural production is to obtain maximum return at minimum input with a healthy ecosystem the prediction of yield and dry matter has important implications for crop management and decision making identifying and managing problems associated with crop yield constraints in advance can help improve production efficiency the purpose of the ml method widely applied in the agriculture field is to provide farmers with accurate information and help optimize economic benefits in a pursuit to make correct and reasonable decisions it is essential to understand the relationship between crop yield and the various factors that influence it holzman et al 2018 the prediction of winter wheat yield and dry matter have been considered together with water and nitrogen status in this paper because they are directly related to water and fertilizer management decisions in order to develop site specific water and fertilizer management plans it is particularly important to estimate the yield and dry matter of crops with water and nitrogen inputs in order to achieve the maximum grain yield of winter wheat intensive use of groundwater and fertilizer has seriously threatened the ecological balance of the ncp the precipitation throughout the winter wheat growing season over the past six decades in the region has ranged from 60 to 180 mm li et al 2005 zhang et al 2002 which does not meet the evapotranspiration demand of 450 mm for winter wheat growth liu et al 2002 conventional winter wheat field management practices in the ncp include supplemental irrigation of 180 300 mm kumar jha et al 2019 and nitrogen fertilizer in excess of 300 kg ha tan et al 2017 our predicted findings based on the gpr model indicate that the yield and dry matter of winter wheat increased with increasing water and nitrogen application rates until reached the optimal range of water and nitrogen applications after which wheat yield and dry matter no longer responded to water and nitrogen rates figs 8 and 10 the threshold effect of water and nitrogen rates on crop growth showed that excessive water and nitrogen applications did not result further increase in crop production previous studies showed that the increase of water and nitrogen application rates reduced the water and nitrogen use efficiency and the optimum yield and dry matter of winter wheat can be obtained with appropriate water and nitrogen supply kumar jha et al 2019 cui et al 2010 the predicted results suggest that the maximum yield and dry matter of winter wheat were 7322 6 and 16226 kg ha when the application rates of water and nitrogen were 420 mm 240 kg ha and 358 mm 230 kg ha respectively figs 9 and 11 the predicted optimal water and nitrogen application ranges were consistent with the application rates from the field trials the water and nitrogen coupling function proposed in this paper is an application of the ml prediction approach we could collect features such as soil properties and planting density in different regions of the ncp as independent variables for model input and develop an appropriate water and fertilizer coupling function for different regions which could be used to guide local winter wheat field management and decision making appropriate adjustment of irrigation and nitrogen management measures in agricultural practice can reduce the negative impact on the environment and improve the efficiency of water and nitrogen utilization yang et al 2020 ml techniques could fuse farmland and meteorological data including soil type precipitation initial water and nitrogen content farmland management practices yield targets and economic returns to provide instructive recommendations for fertilization and irrigation goldstein et al 2017 ml applications in agriculture offer the possibility of varying the amount of irrigation to achieve improved water use efficiency benos et al 2021 the amount of irrigation varies according to field variability agronomic factors and specific water requirements in different areas rather than using the same strategy throughout the area in the work of gutiérrez et al 2018 authors have assessed water status of vineyards using two ml techniques and on the go thermal imaging which has the potential to guide irrigation ml techniques also play an important role in addressing soil fertility imbalance due to over fertilization which contributes to better soil management in accordance with spatial heterogeneity for sustainable agricultural development morellos et al 2016 wheat yield and dry matter predictions are typically used to calculate water and nitrogen requirements and to design potential site specific management schemes for water and fertilizer 4 3 limitations and further work as with other data driven models ml inevitably suffers from certain limitations outliers and extremes in the training datasets may seriously affect the accuracy of the prediction results the black box within ml increases uncertainty in model performance because it does not include any of the processes of crop growth making it difficult to generate testable hypotheses that might provide biological insights cao et al 2021 the use of extensive features in model training did not always offer optimal prediction performance hence a more diverse range of models should be tested van klompenburg et al 2020 combining ml models with crop models that characterize the internal growth and development mechanisms of crops while considering meteorological indicators such as solar radiation and growing degree days gdd could be suggested as a proposal for future work better ml algorithms to predict crop growth could also be attempted 5 conclusion in this study we tested five ml models namely lr dt svm el and gpr for the prediction of winter wheat yield and dry matter using datasets from 1999 to 2019 across the ncp from the prediction results it is clear that the gpr model performed the best and the lr model could not perform satisfactorily for wheat yield and dry matter prediction among the five models which indicates the advantages of non linear algorithms compared with the measured values in the field the prediction errors of the maximum yield of winter wheat and the corresponding total amount of water and nitrogen application based on the gpr model were 5 8 12 6 and 6 7 respectively the prediction errors of the maximum dry matter and the corresponding water and nitrogen application were 1 1 6 5 and 27 8 respectively the maximum yield and dry matter of winter wheat and the optimal water and nitrogen application ranges predicted by the gpr model were generally consistent with the results of field trials the r2 goodness of fit of the water and nitrogen coupling functions constructed from the gpr model was 0 99 for both winter wheat yield and dry matter which could help guide farmland management such as irrigation volumes and nitrogen application rates these findings generated from this study could contribute to predicting regional crop productivity and providing agricultural decision recommendations for better crop and environment state prediction which could be helpful for scientific water and nitrogen management strategy formulation and global food security the generic model proposed in this paper exhibits potentially applied to agricultural systems around the world with similar availability of data declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have
