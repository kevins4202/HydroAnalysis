21430,some attempts have been made to predict the adverse effects of released toxic gas on individuals however the classification of the hazardous area considering the dynamic changes and focusing on the whole facility remains a challenging issue this paper presents a novel approach to classify the hazardous areas on offshore facilities in toxic gas leakage and dispersion accident by introducing the grid based concept each location and its corresponding evacuation trajectory to a fixed destination are considered in this approach instead of just considering the accumulation characteristics of released toxic gas the adverse effects are predicted with a combination of the dynamic factors including the emergency evacuation and the temporal spatial variation of toxic gas profile the proposed approach is applied to a hypothetical h2s leakage and dispersion accident on an offshore platform a time varying leakage profile is adopted considering the interference of the process protection measures an emergency evacuation time model is established with the guideline from international maritime organization imo the results suggest that the proposed approach can improve the accuracy of hazardous areas identification and provide support for optimizing emergency plans against toxic gas leakage and dispersion accident on offshore facilities keywords toxic gas hazardous areas identification a grid based concept offshore facilities dynamic 1 introduction accidental release of toxic gases has always been a severe hazard since the toxic gas poses a grave threat to human life according to the statistical data during the 2000s there are more than 3100 incidents involving hazardous chemicals among which the toxic gas release has the highest probability to result in serious consequences such as the appalling h2s leakage and dispersion accident in kaixian county china on december 23 2003 243 people lost their lives also a liquid ammonia leakage accident that occurred in shanghai china on august 31 2013 led to 15 deaths and 25 injuries about 90 people were affected in the chlorine leakage accident that occurred in iraq on march 16 2019 additionally the bhopal gas tragedy one of the worst ever disaster in the chemical industry caused incalculable losses the adverse impact of bhopal gas tragedy may still exist even after all these years abbasi and abbasi 2005 2007 khan and abbasi 1999a 1999b all these mentioned accidents occurred in the onshore process industry it is not difficult to imagine that once a toxic gas leakage happens on offshore facilities a catastrophic disaster ma and zhang 2011 dadashzadeh et al 2014 may be triggered due to the limited space and low accessibility of emergency resources yang et al 2018 for example the kab 121 platform in the gulf of mexico was involved in an accidental h2s containing natural gas leakage in 2007 which caused 21 deaths on the platform yang et al 2019 therefore accurate prediction and effective mitigation of the adverse effects for toxic gas leakage and dispersion accident are of great importance up to now extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the consequences of dangerous gas leakage and dispersion accident bagheri et al 2016 ma and zhang 2011 liu et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 yang et al 2017 yu et al 2008 alrukaibi et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 vasilopoulos et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 calculated the individual risk based on the developed complete toxic gas leakage accident scenario set parmar and shukla 2018 used aloha to predict the dispersion distance of chlorine dioxide and evaluate the accident consequences by incorporating population density anjana et al 2018 assessed the extent of hazard areas with accidental ammonia leakage in general all these attempts follow the method summarized by pietersen 1990 including 1 developing accident scenarios 2 modeling on gas dispersion behavior 3 obtaining dangerous gas profiles 4 evaluating the hazardous areas and adverse effects on the people according to dangerous gas profiles although the general method is instructive it is inadequate for ignoring some dynamic factors since the general method is conducted based on the released dangerous gas profiles only the areas with a high concentration of dangerous gas are of interest however not only the dangerous gas profiles but also emergency evacuation zhang and chen 2010 li et al 2016 is a key determinant to classify hazardous areas it makes no sense that the workers stay at a fixed position given that there are toxic gas leakage and dispersion accidents especially when the accidents occurred at offshore facilities emergency evacuation is almost imperative for fear of the following disastrous accidents e g explosion or fire accident bp 2010 ramsay et al 1994 kalantarnia et al 2010 and the activation of the toxic gas detecting alarm system would enforce the workers evacuating to the lifeboat area ctcssoi 2005 it is unreasonable to assume that the sufferers remain static and identifying the hazardous area based solely on the h2s profile is of low accuracy instead the temporal spatial variation of both the h2s profile and the individuals position should be considered in the research conducted by zhang and chen 2010 james 2015 zhu et al 2013 human behavior was considered zhang and chen 2010 demonstrated that emergency evacuation is extremely important for mitigating the consequences of toxic gas leakage accident zhu et al 2013 conducted evacuation trajectory optimization in toxic gas leakage accident by considering human behavior however the starting point was designated thereby only the specific locations rather than all potential locations were of concern it should be noted that all these attempts adopted a constant leakage rate by which a steady toxic gas profile can be reached after a period of leakage actually the leakage rate is usually time varying with the interference of process protection measures accordingly the accumulation characteristics of released toxic gas are also changing both along with both time and space all of the above researches ignored the temporal spatial variation for the accumulation characteristics of released toxic gas actually any position including the position with a low concentration of dangerous gas can become dangerous the workers located at the areas with a low concentration of dangerous gas may be injured since they may pass through areas with a high concentration of dangerous gas along their trajectories to the lifeboat area in some areas far from the source of leakage it takes a long time for the concentration of dangerous gas to reaches a high value so the workers located in these areas at the initial stage may suffer high concentration a gas with limited time therefore serious consequences may not be triggered thus the current researches based on the designated starting point is incomplete even the human behavior is considered therefore dynamic systematic research towards the whole offshore facilities remains to be further explored the objective of the current study is to present a systematic approach for identifying the hazardous areas on the offshore facilities in the toxic gas leakage and dispersion accident a grid based concept pula et al 2005 2006 2007 dadashzadeh et al 2013 zohdirad et al 2016 huang et al 2017 huang and ma 2018 is introduced which contributes to focusing on the whole offshore facility an improved dose response model is adopted to evaluate the adverse effects of individuals the innovations of the research are that the whole offshore facility is of interest and the hazardous areas are identified based on the varied initial position and their corresponding evacuation trajectories the dynamic factors including the emergency evacuation the time varying leakage rate and the temporal spatial variation of the toxic gas profile are taken into account the approach is presented by a hypothetical h2s leakage and dispersion accident on an offshore platform while the leakage rate in the hypothetical accident is time dependent considering the interference of the emergency shutdown systems esd and blowdown system the dispersion simulation for the hypothetical accident is performed by the cfd based code flame acceleration simulator flacs which has been validated through experiments with different scales savvides et al 2001 middha et al 2009 hansen et al 2010 bleyer et al 2012 and widely utilized in the process industry qiao and zhang 2010 gupta and chan 2016 shi et al 2018 the authors concentrated on proposing a systematic approach to identify the hazardous areas for toxic gas leakage accidents on offshore facilities therefore the potential fire and explosion accidents are not considered in the current study it should be mentioned that the purpose of the present study is to develop a systematic approach to estimate the accident consequences it is not the focus to discuss the spatial temporal variation of the released gas nor for evacuation modeling musharraf et al 2020 musharraf et al 2019 musharraf et al 2016 musharraf et al 2013 norazahar et al 2017 2018 on the contrary the authors want to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach the structure of the rest paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the major procedures of the proposed approach section 3 focuses on the application of the proposed approach section 4 devotes to the results and discussion and the conclusions of this paper are summarized in section 5 2 methodology fig 1 presents the major steps of the proposed methodology for hazardous areas identification in toxic gas leakage and dispersion accident on offshore facilities the detailed description is presented as follows 2 1 accident scenario definition the accident of toxic gas leakage and dispersion involves many factors which mainly include the leakage conditions and the meteorological conditions the leakage conditions include leakage rate leakage position and leakage direction etc the meteorological conditions include wind speed wind direction atmospheric stability and ambient temperature etc all these factors should be determined before the accident modeling is conducted it should be mentioned that the esd system and blowdown system will start in succession for process equipment once there is accidental leakage thereby a time varying leakage rate arises 2 1 1 leakage rate calculation the time varying leakage rate is adopted considering the interference of the esd system and the blowdown system both the esd system and the blowdown system can cause the leakage rate to decrease by depressurization spouge 1999 the leakage rate remains constant before the esd system responses and the initial leakage rate q 0 can be calculated by 1 q 0 c d a l p 0 m k r t 2 k 1 k 1 k 1 where c d is the leakage coefficient a l is the area of the leakage hole m2 p 0 is the initial system pressure n m2 r is the universal gas constant which takes 8 314 j mol k t is the gas temperature k m is the molecular weight of the gas k is the ratio of specific heats the leakage rate will decrease after the esd system activates since isolation is carried out the corresponding leakage rate q 1 is 2 q 1 q 0 exp q 0 m 0 t t e where m 0 is the initial mass of gas kg t e is the time of esd system activates s subsequently the blowdown system activates which induces the gas venting to the flare or a new vessel through the blowdown valve the total leakage rate q t through the leakage hole and blowdown valve when the blowdown system activates is given by 3 q t c d a l a b p 0 exp q 0 m 0 t b t e m k r t 2 k 1 k 1 k 1 where a b is the area of the blowdown valve m2 t b is the time of blowdown system activates s the leakage rate at the leakage hole q 2 is 4 q 2 q t a l a l a b the pressure continues to drop after the blowdown system activates the transient leakage rate can be calculated by 5 q 2 q t a l a l a b exp q t m b t t b 6 m b m 0 t e t b q 1 d t where m b is the remaining gas mass when the blowdown system activates kg the time varying leakage rate can be determined if the released gas parameters leakage source parameters and response time sequence of the esd system and blowdown system are available 2 2 cfd modeling the cfd code flacs which has been widely validated and verified through numerous experiments savvides et al 2001 middha et al 2009 hansen et al 2010 bleyer et al 2012 is utilized to perform the dispersion simulation computer aided scenario design casd which is the pre processor of flacs is adopted to perform geometry modeling generally basic primitives including boxes and cylinders are recommended to construct the geometric model for their advantage in computational efficiency gexcon 2015 plan drawing can be placed inside the casd to assist with adjusting the size and location of the primitive the 3 d grid model is developed in casd according to the guideline given by the flacs manual gexcon 2015 and grid sensitivity analysis the necessity and procedures for grid sensitivity analysis have been introduced in yang et al 2019 repetitions will not be performed the numerical calculation will run after setting corresponding scenario parameters the basic governing equations involved in gas dispersion are continuity equation momentum equation energy equation density equation and component mass conservation equation the standard k ε turbulent model is modified and used to close the equations the concrete forms of the governing equations have been presented in yang et al 2020 the space distribution of toxic gas is expected in this step the toxic gas profile at every moment is concerned since the toxic gas profile will be time dependent with a fully transient leakage rate 2 3 emergency evacuation the toxic gas detecting alarm system on the offshore facilities will activate once the concentration of toxic gas reaches a specified value then the workers on offshore facilities will move into the designated emergency assembly area i e the lifeboat area undoubtedly the emergency evacuation attaches great importance to the consequences of toxic gas release and dispersion accident emergency evacuation involves two core elements i e emergency evacuation time sequence and emergency evacuation trajectory the emergency evacuation time sequence should be determined according to the accident scenario e g it varies from offshore accident evacuation to onshore accident evacuation the grid based concept is introduced to identify the emergency evacuation trajectories the grid based concept contributes to considering the target areas systematically and thoroughly a 2 d uniform grid network is recommended to cover all potential locations for the individual further the evacuation trajectories are determined according to varied origin locations regarding different cell grids and the fixed destination regarding the lifeboat area it should be mentioned that the 2 d uniform grid network is distinguished from the grid model adopted in dispersion simulation the grid model adopted in dispersion simulation serves to cfd calculation while the 2 d uniform grid network mainly serves to identify the emergency evacuation trajectories 2 4 hazardous area identification after obtaining evacuation trajectories and toxic gas concentration profiles the adverse effects of the individuals are calculated based on the improved dose response and probit model assael and kakosimos 2010 the dose response and probit model is an effective method to predict the adverse effects of the individual exposed to toxic gas the dose refers to a toxic gas concentration administered over a period of time which is illustrated in eq 7 7 d t 0 t 1 c x 0 y 0 z 0 n d t where d represents inhalation dose of the toxic gas for the individual c represents the concentration of the toxic gas ppm or mg m3 t 0 and t 1 represent the starting time and ending time of being exposed to the toxic gas min x 0 y 0 z 0 represents the original coordinate of the individual n is a constant which has been tabulated based on experimental data and taken as 1 43 when it comes to h2s ccps 1999 the traditional method for inhalation dose of toxic gas eq 7 assumed that the sufferers staying at the original position during the process of toxic gas leakage and dispersion rather than conducting emergency evacuation no matter what the concentration of the toxic gas is accordingly the method for calculating the inhalation dose of toxic gas is modified by considering the emergency evacuation and the temporal spatial variation of the toxic gas profile during the emergency evacuation which is another kernel of this study the modified method for calculating the inhalation dose of toxic gas can be expressed as eq 8 the inhalation dose is calculated along each evacuation route and the concentration of toxic gas is extracted in real time and position 8 d l 0 1 v c x i y i z i n d t d l where x i y i z i represents the varied position on the evacuation trajectory l v represents the moving speed of the sufferer m s after the inhalation dose is calculated the standard probit model has been adopted to transform the inhalation dose to the probability of fatality for its superiority on the goodness of fit in the probit model the inhalation dose d is related to the probit variable y by eq 9 further the probability of fatality p can be calculated according to eq 10 9 y a b ln d 10 p 1 2 π y 5 e x 2 2 d x where a and b are constants which are taken as 31 42 and 3 008 respectively when it comes to h2s ccps 1999 through the above aforementioned a 2 d matrix for adverse effect results can be obtained then the contour plot for hazardous areas can be constructed contour plotting is a user friendly representation among various representation manners pula et al 2006 3 case study in this section the proposed approach is presented by a hypothetical accident the structure of this part is organized as below section 3 1 gives a brief introduction to the hypothetical accident scenario section 3 2 focuses on cfd modeling section 3 3 devotes to the emergency evacuation and section 3 4 presents hazardous area distribution 3 1 accident scenario the hypothetical accident involves an accidental h2s containing natural gas leakage and dispersion on an offshore platform in this study the lower deck is deliberately adopted to perform hazardous area identification the workers are supposed to locate at any position of the lower deck at the beginning of the accident fig 2 presents the layout of the lower deck of the offshore platform in which the equipment has been omitted the horizontal position of the leakage source point s has been provided in fig 2 and the leakage source is at the height of 6 m above the lower deck the leakage hole is a sharp circular hole with a diameter of 4 cm the leakage direction is vertical downward the initial pressure of the leakage gas is 0 1 mpa and the temperature is 300 k thus no phase change in this accident the initial mass of the gas in the failed device is 1340 kg the released gas composition is summarized in table 1 a time dependent leakage condition takes place in this accident with the influence of the esd system and the blowdown system api 1997 the esd system is assumed to complete isolation within 90s detection costs 60s while the response time of esd system costs 30s then the blow down valve 0 01 m2 is activated within 50s after determining the toxic gas parameters leakage source parameters and equipment operation parameters the initial leakage rate and the transient leakage rates can be calculated based on eqs 1 6 fig 3 illustrates the transient leakage rate profile in addition the wind direction blowing in the accommodation module is adopted according to the actual observation data in this area the average wind speed at the height of 10 m above the sea is 3 m s the temperature and initial ambient pressure are assumed to be 20 c and 100000pa respectively there is no ignition thus subsequent accidents such as fire explosion and other events that may be induced are not considered 3 2 cfd simulation the geometric model of the offshore platform is built based on the spatial layout and construction data fig 4 the overall size of the platform is 30 60 40 m the platform consists of a process module and an accommodation module there are the main deck the middle deck and the lower deck in the process module the lifeboat area is located at the east end of the platform which can be seen in fig 4 the grid model by 160 m 150 m 90 m in x y and z directions is established according to the flacs manual gexcon 2015 and grid sensitivity analysis 1 m is adopted as the normal grid size for the core area the stretched factor from the core domain to the boundary of the simulation dimension is 1 2 besides the grid around the leak position is refined to improve the precision and stability of dispersion simulation the smooth algorithm is applied to coarsen the refined grid to normal grid size boundary conditions help model what happens beyond the boundary according to gexcon 2015 the boundary condition of nozzle is adopted for outflow and sea surface boundaries while wind is adopted for other boundaries a nozzle formulation is utilized for sub sonic inflow outflow and sonic outflow for nozzle boundary condition a discharge coefficient is derived according to the drag coefficient and the area porosity this boundary condition works well for porous areas with small sharp edged cells the boundary condition of wind assists the external wind field simulation turbulence profiles and velocity are specified for the wind boundary condition the turbulence profiles can be determined by setting turbulence parameters or specifying the atmospheric stability class the pasquill class atmospheric stability class is d accordingly the wind speed profile can be calculated based on eq 11 and 12 11 u z μ a ln z z d z 0 z 0 z 0 0 12 u z u 0 z 0 0 where z represents the height above the sea level m a is von karman constant which is taken as 0 41 z d represents the height above the ground where the boundary layer starts m z 0 represents atmospheric roughness length which is taken as 0 0002 m in this study u 0 represents the reference wind speed m s μ represents friction velocity m s which can be calculated as follows 13 μ u 0 a ln z r e f z d z 0 z 0 where z ref represents the height above the ground where the wind speed equals the reference wind speed which is taken as 10 m in this study the simulation results are recorded in real time as the h2s profiles at 20s 90s and 190s on the horizontal planes at the height of 1 5 m zhang and zhao 2007 korhonen 2011 above the lower deck are extracted fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5 the dispersion area and the area with a high concentration of h2s above the lower deck are increasing at the steady leak stage then these areas gradually decrease after the esd system and blowdown system are activated overall the h2s profiles vary with both time and place with the influence of the esd system and blowdown system therefore the process protection system should be taken into account for consequences assessment of process industry accidents 3 3 emergency evacuation 3 3 1 emergency evacuation time according to the definition of evacuation time for large ships given by imo international maritime organization 2013 the total evacuation time t total for the individuals can be represented as follow 14 t total t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 where t 1 represents perception time the time required by the operator from the occurrence of a leak accident to the perception of danger through alarms or physical reactions t 2 represents response time the time required from receiving alarm to perform emergency evacuation t 3 represents movement time the time required to arrive at the emergency assembly area for the individuals t 4 represents the time to wear rescue equipment the time required to wear life saving equipment after arriving at the emergency assembly area ctcssoi 2005 claimed that the h2s detecting alarm system should be activated and sound the alarm once the concentration of h2s reaches 10 ppm and maximum allowable response time for h2s detecting alarm system is 30s assuming that the h2s is monitored immediately the leakage happens then the maximum perception time t 1 is 30s according to the emergency drill of this offshore platform the response time for the individuals t 2 is 30s the time to wear rescue equipment including wearing respirators and life saving equipment at assembly points is set to be 80s the rescue equipment is supposed to isolate the individual from h2s absolutely the movement time t 3 is calculated on the basis of the evacuation trajectories and moving speed table 2 shows the age structure of the workers li et al 2016 the corresponding moving speeds for different age groups are determined in line with imo and musharraf et al 2013 which is summarized in table 3 3 3 2 emergency evacuation trajectory instead of focusing on limited areas based on the h2s profile the overall offshore platform can be taken into account by introducing the grid based concept the accommodation module and cabins are not considered for inadequate information on the ventilation system and internal layout 1 m uniform grid is utilized to reach a balance between precision and computational burden the generated 2 d uniform grid network over the lower deck is illustrated in fig 2 further the evacuation trajectories regarding varied cells can be determined according to the varied cells and fixed destination for example point a and point b are the centers of two different cells fig 2 which denotes two potential initial positions of the workers point c is the ending point of different evacuation trajectories on the lower deck the workers on the lower deck first move to point c along their evacuation trajectories then reach the lifeboat area through the staircase a total of 879 cells are generated except for the cells in the accommodation module and cabins similarly 879 evacuation trajectories can be determined 3 4 hazardous area distribution after obtaining the cfd modeling results evacuation trajectories and emergency evacuation time model the absorbed dose of the individuals is calculated according to eq 8 further the probability of fatality can be calculated according to eq 9 and eq 10 there are 879 cells for the lower deck which implies 879 evacuation trajectories hence a total of 2637 sets of absorbed dose and the probability of fatality can be obtained given the age group and corresponding moving speeds the weighted mean value for the probability of fatalities for each evacuation trajectory is calculated to represent the severity of the corresponding starting point eq 15 15 p x y 0 50 p 1 0 45 p 2 0 05 p 3 where p x y represents the probability of fatality of the starting point x y p 1 p 2 and p 3 represent the probability of fatality obtained based on the moving speed of the individuals at the age group of 30 30 50 50 respectively fig 6 illustrates the hazardous area profile according to the dynamic approach isolines and different colors are employed to distinguish different severity it should be noted that the areas with grey are accommodation areas or cabins which are not within the scope of consideration in this study 4 discussion comparing fig 6 with fig 5 it is not hard to find that the hazardous area profile is diverse from the h2s profile at any time not only the concentration of h2s at every position is changing with time going by but also the position of the individual is changing during the emergency evacuation consequently the assessment of the consequences based solely on the h2s profile at a fixed time or a fixed position is inaccurate on the contrary both the dynamicity of human behavior and the h2s profile should be taken into account during identifying hazardous areas the authors discovered that consistent results can never be reached less serious consequences can be obtained for some position with the dynamic approach by considering the temporal spatial variation of released h2s profile and human behavior however more serious consequences can also be acquired at some position though the same method for example provided that the sufferer is initially located at a see fig 2 fig 7 illustrates the concentration of exposed h2s along the evacuation trajectory based on the emergency evacuation time model and the probability of fatality is 0 242 given that the sufferers remain static in the course of the accident the concentration of exposed h2s at the same time period is depicted in fig 8 and the corresponding probability of fatality is 0 872 comparing figs 7 and 8 the concentration of exposed h2s is consistent in the first 90s then the individual will escape from h2s with high concentration although h2s with higher concentration may be inhaled in a very short time if the emergency evacuation is conducted while the individual will be exposed to h2s with high concentration for a long time by assuming that the sufferer remains static therefore less serious consequences will be obtained by using the dynamic approach if the sufferer is initially located at b see fig 2 the concentration of exposed h2s based on the dynamic approach is illustrated in fig 9 and fig 10 provides the concentration of exposed h2s by assuming that the individual remains static in the same period comparing figs 9 to 10 it is not hard to find that the sufferer will almost always be exposed to h2s with higher concentration since 90s if the emergency evacuation is conducted the maximum concentration of exposed h2s with the dynamic approach is 7231 44 mg m3 while the maximum concentration of exposed h2s is 3641 31 mg m3 by assuming that the sufferer stays at b the probability of fatality based on h2s concentration curve in fig 9 and that in fig 10 are 0 904 and 0 663 respectively a more serious consequence is obtained by considering the emergency evacuation and the temporal spatial variation of released h2s profile the discovery is contrary to zhang and chen 2010 which pointed out that the worst consequences would be derived assuming that the human stay at a fixed position the conclusion is based on only one particular starting point as well as a designated evacuation trajectory and the starting point is located in the downwind direction and close to the source of leakage emergency evacuation contributes to reducing the duration of exposure to h2s with high concentration however if the sufferers are upwind of the leakage source at the initial stage such as b in the hypothetical accident h2s with higher concentration may be inhaled along their evacuation trajectories towards the lifeboat area consequently more serious consequences may be induced by considering the dynamic factors this discovery makes sense since the sufferers are not aware of the h2s profile during their emergency evacuation to illustrate the above two cases further fig 11 presents a simple graphical representation the red area possesses the highest concentration of toxic gas while the blue area possesses the lowest concentration of toxic gas the point s and s represent two different starting points and point d represents the destination evacuation trajectories are s d and s d respectively for the workers initially located at point s the concentration of exposed toxic gas is gradually decreasing along their trajectory less serious consequence will be obtained through the dynamic approach comparing that the workers stay at point s for the workers initially located at point s the higher concentration of toxic gas will be exposed along their trajectory comparing to remaining static thus more serious consequences will be induced if an emergency evacuation is conducted similar phenomena are common in high rise building fires accidents for example a conflagration happens on a floor in the middle the human living on the higher floors may move towards the floor with higher thermal radiation until they arrived at the lower floor in such conditions more serious consequences will be obtained by the dynamic approach the proposed dynamic approach based on the grid concept is promising and systematic but it should be noted that there are limitations existing in the current study firstly a great deal of computation is required by the proposed approach owing to a total of 2637 different evacuation scenarios it is not hard to imagine that there will be a higher computational burden when it comes to larger offshore facilities such as a floating production storage and offloading fpso facility wei 2013 dan et al 2014 thus a precise and high efficient method for calculating the adverse consequences is urgent which is the objective in the following study secondly the moving speeds of the workers are presumed to be constant during their evacuation nevertheless the moving speed may be influenced if the workers are exposed to h2s with high concentration this is also the gap of the existing evaluation model that the idea of feedback is not introduced for this reason targeted research should be conducted to evaluate the effect of h2s on the evacuation performance of the individuals 5 conclusion since the hazardous area distribution obtained based solely on the accumulation characteristics of toxic gas is defective a grid based approach is proposed to classify the hazardous area according to varied starting points and corresponding evacuation trajectories along which the dynamic factors including the workers position and temporal spatial variation of released h2s profile are taken into account the proposed approach particularly useful for the leakage accident scenario with a time varying leakage rate in which the toxic gas profile is also time varying the main advantage of the proposed approach is thorough by considering the whole platform with a grid based concept and dynamic by considering the dynamic factors during the emergency evacuation the proposed approach is also applicable to other facilities both onshore and offshore with various toxic substances by applying the proposed approach to a hypothetical accident involving an accidental h2s leakage and dispersion on an offshore platform some interesting phenomena have been discovered compared to the static approach which assumes the workers stay at a fixed position it is not always getting less serious consequences with the proposed dynamic approach more serious consequences may be obtained for some starting points located at the upwind direction of the leakage source since the workers may be exposed to h2s with high concentration along their trajectories towards the assembly area similar phenomena can also be observed in emergency evacuation in high rise building fires although the proposed approach is promising in identifying the hazardous areas due to toxic gas leakage and dispersion continuous efforts should be made to fill the gap of the current study a high efficient method for calculating the adverse consequences is urgent to reduce the computational burden the sub models which include the feedback between toxic gas and moving speed are also expected if a time varying moving speed is obtained much more accurate results will be provided besides a particular accident scenario is adopted to present the feasibility and application of the proposed approach enduring research should be performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the accident consequences to different factors which would be more helpful

21430,some attempts have been made to predict the adverse effects of released toxic gas on individuals however the classification of the hazardous area considering the dynamic changes and focusing on

identification a grid based concept offshore facilities dynamic 1 introduction accidental release of toxic gases has always been a severe hazard since the toxic gas poses a grave threat to human life according to the statistical data during the 2000s there are more than 3100 incidents involving hazardous chemicals among which the toxic gas release has the highest probability to result in serious consequences such as the appalling h2s leakage and dispersion accident in kaixian county china on december 23 2003 243 people lost their lives also a liquid ammonia leakage accident that occurred in shanghai china on august 31 2013 led to 15 deaths and 25 injuries about 90 people were affected in the chlorine leakage accident that occurred in iraq on march 16 2019 additionally the bhopal gas tragedy one of the worst ever disaster in the chemical industry caused incalculable losses the adverse impact of bhopal gas tragedy may still exist even after all these years abbasi and abbasi 2005 2007 khan and abbasi 1999a 1999b all these mentioned accidents occurred in the onshore process industry it is not difficult to imagine that once a toxic gas leakage happens on offshore facilities a catastrophic disaster ma and zhang 2011 dadashzadeh et al 2014 may be triggered due to the limited space and low accessibility of emergency resources yang et al 2018 for example the kab 121 platform in the gulf of mexico was involved in an accidental h2s containing natural gas leakage in 2007 which caused 21 deaths on the platform yang et al 2019 therefore accurate prediction and effective mitigation of the adverse effects for toxic gas leakage and dispersion accident are of great importance up to now extensive research has been conducted to evaluate the consequences of dangerous gas leakage and dispersion accident bagheri et al 2016 ma and zhang 2011 liu et al 2015 zhu et al 2010 yang et al 2017 yu et al 2008 alrukaibi et al 2018 zhang et al 2015 vasilopoulos et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 calculated the individual risk based on the developed complete toxic gas leakage accident scenario set parmar and shukla 2018 used aloha to predict the dispersion distance of chlorine dioxide and evaluate the accident consequences by incorporating population density anjana et al 2018 assessed the extent of hazard areas with accidental ammonia leakage in general all these attempts follow the method summarized by pietersen 1990 including 1 developing accident scenarios 2 modeling on gas dispersion behavior 3 obtaining dangerous gas profiles 4 evaluating the hazardous areas and adverse effects on the people according to dangerous gas profiles although the general method is instructive it is inadequate for ignoring some dynamic factors since the general method is conducted based on the released dangerous gas profiles only the areas with a high concentration of dangerous gas are of interest however not only the dangerous gas profiles but also emergency evacuation zhang and chen 2010 li et al 2016 is a key determinant to classify hazardous areas it makes no sense that the workers stay at a fixed position given that there are toxic gas leakage and dispersion accidents especially when the accidents occurred at offshore facilities emergency evacuation is almost imperative for fear of the following disastrous accidents e g explosion or fire accident bp 2010 ramsay et al 1994 kalantarnia et al 2010 and the activation of the toxic gas detecting alarm system would enforce the workers evacuating to the lifeboat area ctcssoi 2005 it is unreasonable to assume that the sufferers remain static and identifying the hazardous area based solely on the h2s profile is of low accuracy instead the temporal spatial variation of both the h2s profile and the individuals position should be considered in the research conducted by zhang and chen 2010 james 2015 zhu et al 2013 human behavior was considered zhang and chen 2010 demonstrated that emergency evacuation is extremely important for mitigating the consequences of toxic gas leakage accident zhu et al 2013 conducted evacuation trajectory optimization in toxic gas leakage accident by considering human behavior however the starting point was designated thereby only the specific locations rather than all potential locations were of concern it should be noted that all these attempts adopted a constant leakage rate by which a steady toxic gas profile can be reached after a period of leakage actually the leakage rate is usually time varying with the interference of process protection measures accordingly the accumulation characteristics of released toxic gas are also changing both along with both time and space all of the above researches ignored the temporal spatial variation for the accumulation characteristics of released toxic gas actually any position including the position with a low concentration of dangerous gas can become dangerous the workers located at the areas with a low concentration of dangerous gas may be injured since they may pass through areas with a high concentration of dangerous gas along their trajectories to the lifeboat area in some areas far from the source of leakage it takes a long time for the concentration of dangerous gas to reaches a high value so the workers located in these areas at the initial stage may suffer high concentration a gas with limited time therefore serious consequences may not be triggered thus the current researches based on the designated starting point is incomplete even the human behavior is considered therefore dynamic systematic research towards the whole offshore facilities remains to be further explored the objective of the current study is to present a systematic approach for identifying the hazardous areas on the offshore facilities in the toxic gas leakage and dispersion accident a grid based concept pula et al 2005 2006 2007 dadashzadeh et al 2013 zohdirad et al 2016 huang et al 2017 huang and ma 2018 is introduced which contributes to focusing on the whole offshore facility an improved dose response model is adopted to evaluate the adverse effects of individuals the innovations of the research are that the whole offshore facility is of interest and the hazardous areas are identified based on the varied initial position and their corresponding evacuation trajectories the dynamic factors including the emergency evacuation the time varying leakage rate and the temporal spatial variation of the toxic gas profile are taken into account the approach is presented by a hypothetical h2s leakage and dispersion accident on an offshore platform while the leakage rate in the hypothetical accident is time dependent considering the interference of the emergency shutdown systems esd and blowdown system the dispersion simulation for the hypothetical accident is performed by the cfd based code flame acceleration simulator flacs which has been validated through experiments with different scales savvides et al 2001 middha et al 2009 hansen et al 2010 bleyer et al 2012 and widely utilized in the process industry qiao and zhang 2010 gupta and chan 2016 shi et al 2018 the authors concentrated on proposing a systematic approach to identify the hazardous areas for toxic gas leakage accidents on offshore facilities therefore the potential fire and explosion accidents are not considered in the current study it should be mentioned that the purpose of the present study is to develop a systematic approach to estimate the accident consequences it is not the focus to discuss the spatial temporal variation of the released gas nor for evacuation modeling musharraf et al 2020 musharraf et al 2019 musharraf et al 2016 musharraf et al 2013 norazahar et al 2017 2018 on the contrary the authors want to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach the structure of the rest paper is organized as follows section 2 presents the major procedures of the proposed approach section 3 focuses on the application of the proposed approach section 4 devotes to the results and discussion and the conclusions of this paper are summarized in section 5 2 methodology fig 1 presents the major steps of the proposed methodology for hazardous areas identification in toxic gas leakage and dispersion accident on offshore facilities the detailed description is presented as follows 2 1 accident scenario definition the accident of toxic gas leakage and dispersion involves many factors which mainly include the leakage conditions and the meteorological conditions the leakage conditions include leakage rate leakage position and leakage direction etc the meteorological conditions include wind speed wind direction atmospheric stability and ambient temperature etc all these factors should be determined before the accident modeling is conducted it should be mentioned that the esd system and blowdown system will start in succession for process equipment once there is accidental leakage thereby a time varying leakage rate arises 2 1 1 leakage rate calculation the time varying leakage rate is adopted considering the interference of the esd system and the blowdown system both the esd system and the blowdown system can cause the leakage rate to decrease by depressurization spouge 1999 the leakage rate remains constant before the esd system responses and the initial leakage rate q 0 can be calculated by 1 q 0 c d a l p 0 m k r t 2 k 1 k 1 k 1 where c d is the leakage coefficient a l is the area of the leakage hole m2 p 0 is the initial system pressure n m2 r is the universal gas constant which takes 8 314 j mol k t is the gas temperature k m is the molecular weight of the gas k is the ratio of specific heats the leakage rate will decrease after the esd system activates since isolation is carried out the corresponding leakage rate q 1 is 2 q 1 q 0 exp q 0 m 0 t t e where m 0 is the initial mass of gas kg t e is the time of esd system activates s subsequently the blowdown system activates which induces the gas venting to the flare or a new vessel through the blowdown valve the total leakage rate q t through the leakage hole and blowdown valve when the blowdown system activates is given by 3 q t c d a l a b p 0 exp q 0 m 0 t b t e m k r t 2 k 1 k 1 k 1 where a b is the area of the blowdown valve m2 t b is the time of blowdown system activates s the leakage rate at the leakage hole q 2 is 4 q 2 q t a l a l a b the pressure continues to drop after the blowdown system activates the transient leakage rate can be calculated by 5 q 2 q t a l a l a b exp q t m b t t b 6 m b m 0 t e t b q 1 d t where m b is the remaining gas mass when the blowdown system activates kg the time varying leakage rate can be determined if the released gas parameters leakage source parameters and response time sequence of the esd system and blowdown system are available 2 2 cfd modeling the cfd code flacs which has been widely validated and verified through numerous experiments savvides et al 2001 middha et al 2009 hansen et al 2010 bleyer et al 2012 is utilized to perform the dispersion simulation computer aided scenario design casd which is the pre processor of flacs is adopted to perform geometry modeling generally basic primitives including boxes and cylinders are recommended to construct the geometric model for their advantage in computational efficiency gexcon 2015 plan drawing can be placed inside the casd to assist with adjusting the size and location of the primitive the 3 d grid model is developed in casd according to the guideline given by the flacs manual gexcon 2015 and grid sensitivity analysis the necessity and procedures for grid sensitivity analysis have been introduced in yang et al 2019 repetitions will not be performed the numerical calculation will run after setting corresponding scenario parameters the basic governing equations involved in gas dispersion are continuity equation momentum equation energy equation density equation and component mass conservation equation the standard k ε turbulent model is modified and used to close the equations the concrete forms of the governing equations have been presented in yang et al 2020 the space distribution of toxic gas is expected in this step the toxic gas profile at every moment is concerned since the toxic gas profile will be time dependent with a fully transient leakage rate 2 3 emergency evacuation the toxic gas detecting alarm system on the offshore facilities will activate once the concentration of toxic gas reaches a specified value then the workers on offshore facilities will move into the designated emergency assembly area i e the lifeboat area undoubtedly the emergency evacuation attaches great importance to the consequences of toxic gas release and dispersion accident emergency evacuation involves two core elements i e emergency evacuation time sequence and emergency evacuation trajectory the emergency evacuation time sequence should be determined according to the accident scenario e g it varies from offshore accident evacuation to onshore accident evacuation the grid based concept is introduced to identify the emergency evacuation trajectories the grid based concept contributes to considering the target areas systematically and thoroughly a 2 d uniform grid network is recommended to cover all potential locations for the individual further the evacuation trajectories are determined according to varied origin locations regarding different cell grids and the fixed destination regarding the lifeboat area it should be mentioned that the 2 d uniform grid network is distinguished from the grid model adopted in dispersion simulation the grid model adopted in dispersion simulation serves to cfd calculation while the 2 d uniform grid network mainly serves to identify the emergency evacuation trajectories 2 4 hazardous area identification after obtaining evacuation trajectories and toxic gas concentration profiles the adverse effects of the individuals are calculated based on the improved dose response and probit model assael and kakosimos 2010 the dose response and probit model is an effective method to predict the adverse effects of the individual exposed to toxic gas the dose refers to a toxic gas concentration administered over a period of time which is illustrated in eq 7 7 d t 0 t 1 c x 0 y 0 z 0 n d t where d represents inhalation dose of the toxic gas for the individual c represents the concentration of the toxic gas ppm or mg m3 t 0 and t 1 represent the starting time and ending time of being exposed to the toxic gas min x 0 y 0 z 0 represents the original coordinate of the individual n is a constant which has been tabulated based on experimental data and taken as 1 43 when it comes to h2s ccps 1999 the traditional method for inhalation dose of toxic gas eq 7 assumed that the sufferers staying at the original position during the process of toxic gas leakage and dispersion rather than conducting emergency evacuation no matter what the concentration of the toxic gas is accordingly the method for calculating the inhalation dose of toxic gas is modified by considering the emergency evacuation and the temporal spatial variation of the toxic gas profile during the emergency evacuation which is another kernel of this study the modified method for calculating the inhalation dose of toxic gas can be expressed as eq 8 the inhalation dose is calculated along each evacuation route and the concentration of toxic gas is extracted in real time and position 8 d l 0 1 v c x i y i z i n d t d l where x i y i z i represents the varied position on the evacuation trajectory l v represents the moving speed of the sufferer m s after the inhalation dose is calculated the standard probit model has been adopted to transform the inhalation dose to the probability of fatality for its superiority on the goodness of fit in the probit model the inhalation dose d is related to the probit variable y by eq 9 further the probability of fatality p can be calculated according to eq 10 9 y a b ln d 10 p 1 2 π y 5 e x 2 2 d x where a and b are constants which are taken as 31 42 and 3 008 respectively when it comes to h2s ccps 1999 through the above aforementioned a 2 d matrix for adverse effect results can be obtained then the contour plot for hazardous areas can be constructed contour plotting is a user friendly representation among various representation manners pula et al 2006 3 case study in this section the proposed approach is presented by a hypothetical accident the structure of this part is organized as below section 3 1 gives a brief introduction to the hypothetical accident scenario section 3 2 focuses on cfd modeling section 3 3 devotes to the emergency evacuation and section 3 4 presents hazardous area distribution 3 1 accident scenario the hypothetical accident involves an accidental h2s containing natural gas leakage and dispersion on an offshore platform in this study the lower deck is deliberately adopted to perform hazardous area identification the workers are supposed to locate at any position of the lower deck at the beginning of the accident fig 2 presents the layout of the lower deck of the offshore platform in which the equipment has been omitted the horizontal position of the leakage source point s has been provided in fig 2 and the leakage source is at the height of 6 m above the lower deck the leakage hole is a sharp circular hole with a diameter of 4 cm the leakage direction is vertical downward the initial pressure of the leakage gas is 0 1 mpa and the temperature is 300 k thus no phase change in this accident the initial mass of the gas in the failed device is 1340 kg the released gas composition is summarized in table 1 a time dependent leakage condition takes place in this accident with the influence of the esd system and the blowdown system api 1997 the esd system is assumed to complete isolation within 90s detection costs 60s while the response time of esd system costs 30s then the blow down valve 0 01 m2 is activated within 50s after determining the toxic gas parameters leakage source parameters and equipment operation parameters the initial leakage rate and the transient leakage rates can be calculated based on eqs 1 6 fig 3 illustrates the transient leakage rate profile in addition the wind direction blowing in the accommodation module is adopted according to the actual observation data in this area the average wind speed at the height of 10 m above the sea is 3 m s the temperature and initial ambient pressure are assumed to be 20 c and 100000pa respectively there is no ignition thus subsequent accidents such as fire explosion and other events that may be induced are not considered 3 2 cfd simulation the geometric model of the offshore platform is built based on the spatial layout and construction data fig 4 the overall size of the platform is 30 60 40 m the platform consists of a process module and an accommodation module there are the main deck the middle deck and the lower deck in the process module the lifeboat area is located at the east end of the platform which can be seen in fig 4 the grid model by 160 m 150 m 90 m in x y and z directions is established according to the flacs manual gexcon 2015 and grid sensitivity analysis 1 m is adopted as the normal grid size for the core area the stretched factor from the core domain to the boundary of the simulation dimension is 1 2 besides the grid around the leak position is refined to improve the precision and stability of dispersion simulation the smooth algorithm is applied to coarsen the refined grid to normal grid size boundary conditions help model what happens beyond the boundary according to gexcon 2015 the boundary condition of nozzle is adopted for outflow and sea surface boundaries while wind is adopted for other boundaries a nozzle formulation is utilized for sub sonic inflow outflow and sonic outflow for nozzle boundary condition a discharge coefficient is derived according to the drag coefficient and the area porosity this boundary condition works well for porous areas with small sharp edged cells the boundary condition of wind assists the external wind field simulation turbulence profiles and velocity are specified for the wind boundary condition the turbulence profiles can be determined by setting turbulence parameters or specifying the atmospheric stability class the pasquill class atmospheric stability class is d accordingly the wind speed profile can be calculated based on eq 11 and 12 11 u z μ a ln z z d z 0 z 0 z 0 0 12 u z u 0 z 0 0 where z represents the height above the sea level m a is von karman constant which is taken as 0 41 z d represents the height above the ground where the boundary layer starts m z 0 represents atmospheric roughness length which is taken as 0 0002 m in this study u 0 represents the reference wind speed m s μ represents friction velocity m s which can be calculated as follows 13 μ u 0 a ln z r e f z d z 0 z 0 where z ref represents the height above the ground where the wind speed equals the reference wind speed which is taken as 10 m in this study the simulation results are recorded in real time as the h2s profiles at 20s 90s and 190s on the horizontal planes at the height of 1 5 m zhang and zhao 2007 korhonen 2011 above the lower deck are extracted fig 5 as can be seen from fig 5 the dispersion area and the area with a high concentration of h2s above the lower deck are increasing at the steady leak stage then these areas gradually decrease after the esd system and blowdown system are activated overall the h2s profiles vary with both time and place with the influence of the esd system and blowdown system therefore the process protection system should be taken into account for consequences assessment of process industry accidents 3 3 emergency evacuation 3 3 1 emergency evacuation time according to the definition of evacuation time for large ships given by imo international maritime organization 2013 the total evacuation time t total for the individuals can be represented as follow 14 t total t 1 t 2 t 3 t 4 where t 1 represents perception time the time required by the operator from the occurrence of a leak accident to the perception of danger through alarms or physical reactions t 2 represents response time the time required from receiving alarm to perform emergency evacuation t 3 represents movement time the time required to arrive at the emergency assembly area for the individuals t 4 represents the time to wear rescue equipment the time required to wear life saving equipment after arriving at the emergency assembly area ctcssoi 2005 claimed that the h2s detecting alarm system should be activated and sound the alarm once the concentration of h2s reaches 10 ppm and maximum allowable response time for h2s detecting alarm system is 30s assuming that the h2s is monitored immediately the leakage happens then the maximum perception time t 1 is 30s according to the emergency drill of this offshore platform the response time for the individuals t 2 is 30s the time to wear rescue equipment including wearing respirators and life saving equipment at assembly points is set to be 80s the rescue equipment is supposed to isolate the individual from h2s absolutely the movement time t 3 is calculated on the basis of the evacuation trajectories and moving speed table 2 shows the age structure of the workers li et al 2016 the corresponding moving speeds for different age groups are determined in line with imo and musharraf et al 2013 which is summarized in table 3 3 3 2 emergency evacuation trajectory instead of focusing on limited areas based on the h2s profile the overall offshore platform can be taken into account by introducing the grid based concept the accommodation module and cabins are not considered for inadequate information on the ventilation system and internal layout 1 m uniform grid is utilized to reach a balance between precision and computational burden the generated 2 d uniform grid network over the lower deck is illustrated in fig 2 further the evacuation trajectories regarding varied cells can be determined according to the varied cells and fixed destination for example point a and point b are the centers of two different cells fig 2 which denotes two potential initial positions of the workers point c is the ending point of different evacuation trajectories on the lower deck the workers on the lower deck first move to point c along their evacuation trajectories then reach the lifeboat area through the staircase a total of 879 cells are generated except for the cells in the accommodation module and cabins similarly 879 evacuation trajectories can be determined 3 4 hazardous area distribution after obtaining the cfd modeling results evacuation trajectories and emergency evacuation time model the absorbed dose of the individuals is calculated according to eq 8 further the probability of fatality can be calculated according to eq 9 and eq 10 there are 879 cells for the lower deck which implies 879 evacuation trajectories hence a total of 2637 sets of absorbed dose and the probability of fatality can be obtained given the age group and corresponding moving speeds the weighted mean value for the probability of fatalities for each evacuation trajectory is calculated to represent the severity of the corresponding starting point eq 15 15 p x y 0 50 p 1 0 45 p 2 0 05 p 3 where p x y represents the probability of fatality of the starting point x y p 1 p 2 and p 3 represent the probability of fatality obtained based on the moving speed of the individuals at the age group of 30 30 50 50 respectively fig 6 illustrates the hazardous area profile according to the dynamic approach isolines and different colors are employed to distinguish different severity it should be noted that the areas with grey are accommodation areas or cabins which are not within the scope of consideration in this study 4 discussion comparing fig 6 with fig 5 it is not hard to find that the hazardous area profile is diverse from the h2s profile at any time not only the concentration of h2s at every position is changing with time going by but also the position of the individual is changing during the emergency evacuation consequently the assessment of the consequences based solely on the h2s profile at a fixed time or a fixed position is inaccurate on the contrary both the dynamicity of human behavior and the h2s profile should be taken into account during identifying hazardous areas the authors discovered that consistent results can never be reached less serious consequences can be obtained for some position with the dynamic approach by considering the temporal spatial variation of released h2s profile and human behavior however more serious consequences can also be acquired at some position though the same method for example provided that the sufferer is initially located at a see fig 2 fig 7 illustrates the concentration of exposed h2s along the evacuation trajectory based on the emergency evacuation time model and the probability of fatality is 0 242 given that the sufferers remain static in the course of the accident the concentration of exposed h2s at the same time period is depicted in fig 8 and the corresponding probability of fatality is 0 872 comparing figs 7 and 8 the concentration of exposed h2s is consistent in the first 90s then the individual will escape from h2s with high concentration although h2s with higher concentration may be inhaled in a very short time if the emergency evacuation is conducted while the individual will be exposed to h2s with high concentration for a long time by assuming that the sufferer remains static therefore less serious consequences will be obtained by using the dynamic approach if the sufferer is initially located at b see fig 2 the concentration of exposed h2s based on the dynamic approach is illustrated in fig 9 and fig 10 provides the concentration of exposed h2s by assuming that the individual remains static in the same period comparing figs 9 to 10 it is not hard to find that the sufferer will almost always be exposed to h2s with higher concentration since 90s if the emergency evacuation is conducted the maximum concentration of exposed h2s with the dynamic approach is 7231 44 mg m3 while the maximum concentration of exposed h2s is 3641 31 mg m3 by assuming that the sufferer stays at b the probability of fatality based on h2s concentration curve in fig 9 and that in fig 10 are 0 904 and 0 663 respectively a more serious consequence is obtained by considering the emergency evacuation and the temporal spatial variation of released h2s profile the discovery is contrary to zhang and chen 2010 which pointed out that the worst consequences would be derived assuming that the human stay at a fixed position the conclusion is based on only one particular starting point as well as a designated evacuation trajectory and the starting point is located in the downwind direction and close to the source of leakage emergency evacuation contributes to reducing the duration of exposure to h2s with high concentration however if the sufferers are upwind of the leakage source at the initial stage such as b in the hypothetical accident h2s with higher concentration may be inhaled along their evacuation trajectories towards the lifeboat area consequently more serious consequences may be induced by considering the dynamic factors this discovery makes sense since the sufferers are not aware of the h2s profile during their emergency evacuation to illustrate the above two cases further fig 11 presents a simple graphical representation the red area possesses the highest concentration of toxic gas while the blue area possesses the lowest concentration of toxic gas the point s and s represent two different starting points and point d represents the destination evacuation trajectories are s d and s d respectively for the workers initially located at point s the concentration of exposed toxic gas is gradually decreasing along their trajectory less serious consequence will be obtained through the dynamic approach comparing that the workers stay at point s for the workers initially located at point s the higher concentration of toxic gas will be exposed along their trajectory comparing to remaining static thus more serious consequences will be induced if an emergency evacuation is conducted similar phenomena are common in high rise building fires accidents for example a conflagration happens on a floor in the middle the human living on the higher floors may move towards the floor with higher thermal radiation until they arrived at the lower floor in such conditions more serious consequences will be obtained by the dynamic approach the proposed dynamic approach based on the grid concept is promising and systematic but it should be noted that there are limitations existing in the current study firstly a great deal of computation is required by the proposed approach owing to a total of 2637 different evacuation scenarios it is not hard to imagine that there will be a higher computational burden when it comes to larger offshore facilities such as a floating production storage and offloading fpso facility wei 2013 dan et al 2014 thus a precise and high efficient method for calculating the adverse consequences is urgent which is the objective in the following study secondly the moving speeds of the workers are presumed to be constant during their evacuation nevertheless the moving speed may be influenced if the workers are exposed to h2s with high concentration this is also the gap of the existing evaluation model that the idea of feedback is not introduced for this reason targeted research should be conducted to evaluate the effect of h2s on the evacuation performance of the individuals 5 conclusion since the hazardous area distribution obtained based solely on the accumulation characteristics of toxic gas is defective a grid based approach is proposed to classify the hazardous area according to varied starting points and corresponding evacuation trajectories along which the dynamic factors including the workers position and temporal spatial variation of released h2s profile are taken into account the proposed approach particularly useful for the leakage accident scenario with a time varying leakage rate in which the toxic gas profile is also time varying the main advantage of the proposed approach is thorough by considering the whole platform with a grid based concept and dynamic by considering the dynamic factors during the emergency evacuation the proposed approach is also applicable to other facilities both onshore and offshore with various toxic substances by applying the proposed approach to a hypothetical accident involving an accidental h2s leakage and dispersion on an offshore platform some interesting phenomena have been discovered compared to the static approach which assumes the workers stay at a fixed position it is not always getting less serious consequences with the proposed dynamic approach more serious consequences may be obtained for some starting points located at the upwind direction of the leakage source since the workers may be exposed to h2s with high concentration along their trajectories towards the assembly area similar phenomena can also be observed in emergency evacuation in high rise building fires although the proposed approach is promising in identifying the hazardous areas due to toxic gas leakage and dispersion continuous efforts should be made to fill the gap of the current study a high efficient method for calculating the adverse consequences is urgent to reduce the computational burden the sub models which include the feedback between toxic gas and moving speed are also expected if a time varying moving speed is obtained much more accurate results will be provided besides a particular accident scenario is adopted to present the feasibility and application of the proposed approach enduring research should be performed to evaluate the sensitivity of the accident consequences to different factors which would be more helpful

21431,the design of monopile offshore wind turbines requires consideration of the most diverse excitation spectra such as sea currents waves wind and earthquakes and it is often concerned with resonance aspects the structural system resembles an inverted pendulum where a variable cross section tower is coupled to a support structure that is embedded in the seabed this work presents original mathematical developments based on the collocation method for evaluation of bending torsional and longitudinal vibrations of these structures the proposed expressions consider a polynomial approximation of the mode shapes and collocation points on the tower and monopile which satisfy the differential equation of free vibrations effects of elastic supports rotary and torsional inertia geometric nonlinearity produced by the nacelle and water added mass are evaluated in different model approximations which are compared to results from 04 reference wind turbines the formulations are also analyzed using benchmarks for classical structural dynamics solutions proposed for vibrations of beams and shafts with variable cross section the results demonstrate the efficiency of this method which produces solutions with the same quality as those obtained with finite element models at the same time they indicate the possibility of a useful and straightforward procedure for the solution of

turbines that find in offshore installations the ideal conditions for its large dimensions in these cases a single multimegawatt wind turbine can supply the energy demand of a small city design requires consideration of the most diverse excitation spectra such as sea currents waves wind and earthquakes and it is concerned with resonance aspects for shallow waters the monopile foundation provides the majority of solutions for the support structure ewea 2016 the resulting structural system is given by an upper part composed by the tower and by a lower portion consisting of a pile monopile which is embedded in the seabed by percussion or vibration expressions for the natural frequencies of these structures are of great interest to designers and provide tools for selection of parameters that limit the extent of large amplitude vibrations the problem requires the eigenvalue analysis of a structure with variable cross section with elastic supports at the seabed and lumped mass at the opposite end it is in a way an extension of the problem of an inverted pendulum common in onshore wind turbines the mathematical background includes the solution of a differential equation with variable coefficients in different domains tower and monopile connected by a transition piece fig 1 although some authors have explored simplified formulations for bending vibrations wu and hsu 2006 adhikari and bhattacharya 2012 arany et al 2016 analytical procedures for modal analysis of these structures are relatively recent the closed form solution of natural modes of monopile offshore wind turbines owt if possible has yet to be found analysis of natural bending modes for the tower structure is closely related to the problem of lateral vibrations of a beam with variable cross section these include contributions with more than a century of development such as kirchhoff 1880 meyer zur capellen 1888 and morrow 1903 ward 1913 studied the problem with the proposal of polynomial variation laws for the cross section parameters bessel functions were applied for the solution of the partial differential equation of a euler bernoulli beam suppiger and taleb 1956 presented a detailed review of the problem the authors proposed an exponential variation for the area and moment of inertia of the cross section considerations about numerous boundary conditions were also discussed gaines and volterra 1966 proposed advances concerning the elementary theory of beams and effectively included shear and rotary inertia terms wang 1967 proposed a solution with the frobenius method and the use of hypergeometric functions for beams where area and inertia are described by polynomial approximations conway et al 1964 and sanger 1968 presented a comprehensive discussion about euler bernoulli beams vibration this background indicates that relevant contributions to the problem of bending modes were already achieved in the 1950 and 1960 decades but restricted to specific geometries or available through design abacuses contributions including the investigation of torsional and axial modes in beams with variable cross section are more limited mok and murray 1966 presented developments for different natural modes torsional bending and axial of a beam with variable cross section using smooth variations of the area and inertia terms pouyet and lataillade 1981 presented the rigorous solution of the differential equation that governs torsional vibrations for the same problem using bessel functions various boundary conditions were investigated including the shaft with a fixed end and a free end rezeka 1989 presented a pioneering work on torsional vibration of hollow shafts including the evaluation of non prismatic sections natural vibrations in axial modes were investigated by eisenberger 1991 using a power series solution in the assessment of eigenvalues in variable cross section bars kumar and sujith 1997 analyzed a similar problem proposing exact solutions for bars with cross sectional parameters defined by polynomial and sinusoidal functions this previous background unveils that the evaluation of natural modes of a variable cross section beams is challenging and the coupling to any model of owt is nonexistent the monopile foundation type requires additional assumptions since the support structure introduces a different domain these include i considerations about fluid added mass in the submerged part ii elastic supports at the mudline and iii continuity conditions at the tower monopile interface in the second half of the 20th century several studies were carried out with some resemblance to the tower structure mabie and rogers 1974 recognized the difficulties in achieving a closed form solution to the natural bending modes in beams of variable inertia and with lumped mass tip in an extension to previous work to 1982 proposed a uniform inertia model where considerations on the eccentricity of the lumped mass tip and its rotational inertia were discussed auciello 1996 using bessel functions effectively addressed a combination of these previous aspects proposing a closed form solution of a beam with variable cross section lumped mass tip elastic supports and mass eccentricity it is notable the development of research that explores approaches with some level of discretization of the domain assuming some of the features of numerical methods and producing hybrid strategies kai yuan et al 1992 developed elements governed by exact solutions and applied this technique for domain discretization wu and hsu 2006 applied the point added mass pam method where discrete masses substitute the continuous mass distribution and a generalized coordinate procedure is applied for computation of the frequency equation using another strategy malaeke and moeenfard 2016 solved the problem of bending modes in variable inertia towers with discretization by finite differences the contributions of naguleswaran 1994 and abdelghany et al 2015 which applied expansions in power series to study free vibrations of euler bernoulli beams with variable cross section are also within the same scope there is a recent interest of researchers in obtaining simplified solutions for bending modes in offshore structures wu and hsu 2006 proposed an analytical formulation for the free vibration of euler bernoulli beams with constant cross section partially submerged domain lumped mass tip rotary inertia and elastic supports adhikari and bhattacharya 2012 presented a mathematical model for the owt where the structure is converted to a beam with a uniform cross section and the foundation interaction is represented by means of elastic supports effects of the axial load produced by the nacelle were included in the formulation validation of this expression was performed using several existing wind turbines results for the fundamental frequency in an extension of the previous model arany et al 2016 proposed the division of the owt structure into two constant cross section domains tower and monopile the solution for bending modes was addressed using a euler bernoulli beam model and by imposing continuity conditions coupling between the domains in a more recent study darvishi alamouti et al 2017 applied the rayleigh method based on energy conservation to obtain the fundamental bending frequency of an offshore wind turbine of constant inertia with monopile foundation and winkler springs representing soil structure interaction this retrospect of more than a century of related work reveals that approaches involving rigorous theories which address the evaluation of higher modes for the tower monopile structure are simplified and focused on the fundamental frequency of the system for longitudinal and torsional modes this discussion is nonexistent numerical models in finite elements such as the ones analyzed by wang et al 2018 and amar bouzid et al 2018 overcome these limitations and represent alternatives to the inclusion of additional features such as p y winkler springs and fluid added mass even so the possibility of an analytical solution with more features than the existing formulations emerges as something beneficial for the initial estimation of the natural frequencies of owts the current proposal consists of an original analytical discrete approach based on the point collocation method pcm and taylor series expansion allowing the solution of bending torsional and axial vibrations in owts with monopile foundation the main feature of the proposal is a polynomial approximation of the mode shapes the differential equation is evaluated at various collocation points through the length of the tower and the monopile this discrete feature and the meshless nature of the method allow different levels of approximation for the natural frequencies and avoid the calculation of recurrence rules for the coefficients of the power series boundary and continuity conditions are applied to both domains the resulting equations are organized in a system of equations and the determinant of the coefficient matrix leads to the characteristic equation the approach can be easily understood and programmable consisting of basic algorithms without any level of approximation for the geometry of the cross section also it employs simple math and the strong form of the differential equation allowing rapid generalization to other problems validations on numerous test cases are carried out for bending and longitudinal vibrations using the formulations proposed by naguleswaran 1994 and eisenberger 1991 additionally several reference wind turbines are studied according to the data provided by arany et al 2016 with an evaluation of the effects of several variables on the natural frequencies and shape modes the results of the various simulations are compared to a reference finite element model and reveal that the proposed procedure is effective in the evaluation of natural frequencies and mode shapes of offshore wind turbines with monopile foundation 2 problem formulation free vibrations of monopile owt the problem consists of an offshore wind turbine with a monopile foundation as indicated in fig 1 three cases will be analyzed i bending ii torsional and iii longitudinal free vibrations in all cases the embedded monopile length is replaced by elastic supports at the seabed fig 1b c and 1d the remaining part of the monopile is assumed to be in contact with the fluid in the bending model torsion and axial models do not include the fluid structure interaction contribution in all cases the monopile is assumed to have a constant cross section through its length and couples directly to the tower of variable cross section for convenience the effect of the transition piece is neglected 2 1 mathematical model for undamped free vibrations bending a model for euler bernoulli transverse beam vibration clough and penzien 1993 rao 2006 of variable cross section with elastic and homogenous material is proposed for the case indicated in fig 1b the motion equation includes the term of fluid interaction proposed by nagaya and hai 1985 assuming the general case of a submerged part therefore 1 d 2 d x 2 e i x d 2 ν x d x 2 q d 2 ν x d x 2 m s x m f x ω 2 ν x 0 or with an expansion of the differentials 2 e d 2 i x d x 2 d 2 ν x d x 2 2 e d i x d x d 3 ν x d x 3 e i x d 4 ν x d x 4 q d 2 ν x d x 2 m s x m f x ω 2 ν x 0 which represents a fourth order linear differential equation with variable coefficients for free undamped vibrations with frequency ω solution of this problem requires the analysis of different parts in which the differential equation 1 is applied to two subdomains tower and monopile regarding the monopile subdomain the water added mass should be considered and for sake of simplicity the entire length of the pile is assumed with surrounding water some remarkable features of the problem arise with i variable inertia ii fluid added mass and iii axial load provided by the nacelle from this point on references in subscripts will be associated with the monopile 1 and tower 2 thus in compact notation results 3 e 1 i 1 ν 1 4 q ν 1 2 m 1 ω 2 ν 1 0 0 x l m p 4 e 2 i 2 2 ν 2 2 2 e 2 i 2 1 ν 2 3 e 2 i 2 ν 2 4 q ν 2 2 m 2 ω 2 ν 2 0 l m p x l where the subscripts denote the subdomains and the numbers in superscripts in the parenthesis define the derivative order with respect to x some additional features of the problem are given by a the differential equation for the monopile subdomain is considerably simpler since the derivatives of the moment of inertia are assumed as zero in the corresponding section in general the monopile presents a smooth variation of the transversal section which will not be considered in this development b the mass per unit length in the monopile portion uses the same requirements of nagaya and hai 1985 uściłowska and kołodziej 1998 wu and hsu 2006 and moll et al 2010 in a simplified form it is assumed that the effect of fluid structure interaction corresponds to a constant additional mass in direction x the absence of sediment and fluid is also assumed inside the monopile therefore 5 m 1 m s m f ρ 1 a 1 c m ρ w a 1 where cm 1 leading to the same value of additional mass indicated by kennard 1967 dean and dalrymple 1991 blevins 2016 for circular cross sections in an incompressible fluid with no viscosity according to the potential flow theory c the rna rotor nacelle assembly is idealized as a concentrated mass perfectly centered horizontally and without vertical eccentricity at the top of the structure thus the axial load is given by 6 q m t g the rotary inertia effect produced by the rna jr also composes the problem boundary conditions d the monopile lower end can be represented by a cantilever however this representation makes the system more rigid than it is because it ignores the soil structure interaction wu and hsu 2006 a more appropriate form of representation is through elastic springs which makes the structure more flexible arany et al 2016 translational kt rotational kr and cross coupled krt springs which captures cross effects such as the displacement caused by a rotation are adopted therefore 7 e 1 i 1 ν 1 2 k r ν 1 1 k r t ν 1 a t x 0 8 e 1 i 1 ν 1 3 q ν 1 1 k t ν 1 k r t ν 1 1 a t x 0 e at the tower top the mass effects of the rna are represented by 9 e 2 i 2 ν 2 2 j r ω 2 ν 2 1 a t x l 10 e 2 i 2 1 ν 2 2 e 2 i 2 ν 2 3 m t ω 2 ν 2 a t x l the equation set 7 10 represent bending moment and shear force at the base and top of the owt structure f continuity conditions at the transition of the subdomains are defined by 11 ν 1 ν 2 12 ν 1 1 ν 2 1 13 e 1 i 1 ν 1 2 e 2 i 2 ν 2 2 14 e 1 i 1 ν 1 3 e 2 i 2 1 ν 2 2 e 2 i 2 ν 2 3 which represent displacement rotation bending moment and shear force at x l m p 2 1 1 solution of bending natural modes using the collocation method a closed form solution for equation 2 is difficult to obtain since it presents variable coefficients and it is composed of two subdomains tower and monopile a clever strategy arises with the use of power series for an approximation of the mode shapes according to wright 1964 two paths are possible after choosing this type of approximation and its subsequent replacement in the differential equation i compare the coefficients of each power of the proposed polynomial associated with the independent variable and obtain a recurrence rule for these coefficients or ii satisfy the differential equation in a certain number of collocation points along the independent variable domain the following proposal is based on the second option defined as point collocation method pcm the basic idea is to choose as a solution a function and a set of collocation points requiring them to satisfy the differential equation at the prescribed points collatz 1966 approximating the displacements of the monopile and tower

x 2 20 x 3 the basic idea of pcm emerges with the following reasoning equations 17 and 18 remain valid for any collocation point therefore it is possible to construct a system of equations obtained by applying these expressions to several points of the subdomain of the monopile and the tower fig 2 where each collocation point corresponds to a line of the system at β as a result 21 β 1 β 2 τ 1 τ 2 v

ωi of the corresponding system to define an approximation of any degree n n 1 equations are required in each subdomain however the problem presents four boundary conditions and four continuity

b 2 i j ℝ n 2 3 n 2 1 the terms of the previous submatrices can be easily obtained with the application of 19 to equations 17 and 18 thus 23 b 1 i j e 1 i 1 j 1 j 2 j 3 j 4 x i j 5 q j 1 j 2 x i j 3 m

mathematical equivalence with the torsion model defined by 42 is remarkable the equivalent parameters are presented in table 1 the boundary conditions also present the same relation being defined as 68 e 1 a 1 u 1 1 k v u 1 a t x 0 69 e 2 a 2 u 2 1 ω 2 m t u 2 a t x l and the continuity conditions in the transition between subdomains can be written as 70 u 1 u 2 71 e 1 a 1 u 1 1 e 2 a 2 u 2 1 which correspond to the translation and the normal force respectively in x l m p 2 3 1 solution of longitudinal natural modes using the collocation method the use of the equivalence indicated in table

problem 3 benchmark tests bending and longitudinal vibrations a study of the pcm performance is presented for geometries analyzed by naguleswaran 1994 and eisenberger 1991 these are presented in fig 3 3 1 results for bending vibrations in a truncated wedge in this case several scenarios are adopted for the truncated wedge proposed by naguleswaran 1994 where the effective length l is defined in terms of a parameter α 72 l 1 α l fig 3a presents the wedge geometry where the clamped end is given by a square cross section of unitary side the other end is considered free the parameter α was analyzed in three scenarios for a beam of hypothetical length l 1 mass density and elastic modulus were taken as units to obtain dimensionless results table 2 shows the results obtained for the first three mode shapes in the xy plane the terms in parenthesis indicate the order of the polynomial expansion associated with the pcm fig 4 shows a graphical representation of these values the value of α influences the convergence rate and this aspect is perceived in fig 3a as a result the performance of pcm is geometry dependent sharp wedges with small values for alpha and shorter truncation length αl require a greater polynomial expansion for convergence this effect is attenuated as the value of α increases for the best case scenario α 0 50 differences of less than 0 5 are verified with polynomials of order equal to ten fig 4c even so all analyzed cases achieve convergence to the values presented by naguleswaran 1994 and less than 2 relative difference is perceived for more critical cases α 0 05 with the use of polynomials of order equal to thirty fig 4a for the specific case of wind turbine geometries this transition is smooth in the range of 0 5 0 6 in standard towers and it is not a problem it will be demonstrated in the subsequent sections that low order order polynomials are suitable for an accurate estimate of the bending modes in these structures in summary higher order polynomials are not required for practical results 3 2 results for longitudinal vibrations in a shaft two scenarios proposed by eisenberger 1991 are evaluated where a beam with variable cross section fig 3b has its longitudinal vibration modes computed with an exact solution table 3 shows the results obtained for the first five modes in the xy plane the terms in parenthesis indicate the order of the polynomial approximation associated with pcm the performance is superior to that obtained in the previous problem of bending vibrations but it is also a function of the analyzed geometry a linear variation of the cross sectional area exhibits a faster convergence rate with discrete performance gains compared to a quadratic variation once again convergence is obtained with an increased polynomial degree with the use of a polynomial of order fifteen the relative differences between frequencies is less than 0 5 for the two proposed geometries in practical applications involving wind turbine towers this variation is smooth and can be approximated with the use of low order polynomials 4 analysis of offshore wind turbines with monopile foundation the procedures described above were applied to four different geometries of monopile offshore wind turbines according to table 4 wind turbines blyth 2 mw belwind 3 mw and walney 3 6 mw correspond to real structures with parameters and reference results provided by arany et al 2016 in these cases the first five bending modes were evaluated by the pcm the fourth geometry corresponds to the concept turbine nrel 5 mw phase ii widely spread in literature the numerous parameters provided by bir and jonkman 2008 and jonkman and musial 2010 allow for the evaluation of bending torsional and longitudinal modes of this last wind turbine the results obtained with the pcm for these four geometries were also compared to results of a finite element simulation with detailed information described in the next section 4 1 finite element reference model a finite element code was developed by the authors using matlab and it is applied as a reference for the subsequent analyses bending torsional and longitudinal vibrations are governed by eqs 1 42 and 67 respectively the proposed two node finite element is defined by the following degrees of freedom bending degrees of freedom for translation and rotation 4 total longitudinal degree of freedom for axial translation 2 total rotational degree of freedom with respect to the longitudinal axis 2 total additionally cubic shape functions are employed for bending vibrations and linear shape functions are applied for axial translation and rotation with respect to the longitudinal axis a variable cross section is defined with respect to the longitudinal axis cross sectional area moment of inertia and polar moment of inertia are defined by second degree polynomials with key properties at the start midpoint and end of the element a weighted residual approach is applied for the solution of linear stiffness and mass matrices this solution is also complemented by a nonlinear geometric stiffness matrix which was not used in this paper but with effects verified for the pcm reference results are achieved with the following meshes valid for all the analyzed cases 50 elements for the tower structure 20 elements for the monopile element properties at start midpoint and end positions are computed previously and applied to each element matrix stiffness and mass reference simulations in fem also consider the following aspects i for bending vibrations foundation interaction and the influence of fluid added mass are considered the elastic supports are inserted at the monopile base mudline with lateral rotational and cross stiffness defined by table 04 for each turbine the additional mass is included in the monopile mass matrix influence of nonlinear geometric effects produced by the rna mass are neglected but included in the pcm method ii for torsional and longitudinal vibrations models with rigid supports and without additional mass are considered 4 2 general aspects of the pcm models in the analysis using the pcm the collocation points were defined as equally spaced the order of the polynomial expansion is indicated in each specific case and it is applied for the tower and monopile as a result a polynomial of order n1 n2 n defines an approximation of order n for these domains the evaluation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors was performed using matlab software with calculations considering double numerical precision in the solution of the roots of the characteristic equation different models are evaluated with respect to features such elastic supports fluid added mass and nonlinear geometric effects produced by the rna mass 4 3 pcm benchmark numerical convergence test figs 5 and 6 illustrate the convergence of the natural frequencies where the relative difference for the solution with the fem is indicated in all cases a polynomial approximation of n 10 gives results of remarkably high precision for the first five natural modes less than 1 of relative difference the numerical values of the natural frequencies for bending modes are shown in table 5 where the solutions by the pcm correspond to approximations using polynomials of the 15th degree the values obtained by arany et al 2016 and the values obtained by bir and jonkman 2008 are also presented a significant advantage of the pcm is the computation of higher modes which is an aspect still unexplored in simplified approaches torsional and longitudinal natural frequencies of the nrel wind turbine are indicated in table 6 and were obtained using polynomial approximations of the 10th degree in general higher modes present inferior convergence rate to the reference values obtained with the fem still the quality of the results is excellent the fem model adequately represents the problem geometry employing elements of variable cross section and adequate discretization this explains the small relative difference obtained between pcm and fem results 4 4 influence of soil rigidity water added mass and geometric nonlinearity for the bending mode shapes additional scenarios are defined for each type of wind turbine where the effects of soil rigidity water added mass and geometric nonlinearity produced by rna mass are evaluated these are defined in table 7 the numerical results are presented in table 8 where the reference case for relative differences is fw the characteristics of the pcm are the same as the previous item using a polynomial approximation 15th degree for every scenario the different scenarios allow a progressive evaluation of the contribution of the various parameters 4 4 1 discussion on the eigenvalue shift for the analyzed models the analysis of the relative differences in table 8 allows a series of considerations on the several variables i there is no significant influence of the axial load due to rna in the calculation of the first five natural bending frequencies in all cases the relative differences of the fwg case are less than 1 ii the relative difference in case f explains the relevance of water added mass effects for the first modes water influence is negligible for higher modes the relative difference is significant in some cases it is higher than 40 iii the simplified hypothesis of rigid supports corresponding to case r increases the relative difference for higher modes the flexibility effect of the foundation is more relevant than the contribution of the fluid added mass an exception is given by the blyth wind turbine which will be detailed in section 4 4 3 iv the fw model provides an excellent estimate of the problem for the five first mode shapes when compared to finite element results for the fundamental mode acceptable results are achieved with model f 4 4 2 general discussion on the eigenvectors for the analyzed models in addition to obtaining the natural frequencies the method also enables the evaluation of eigenvectors figs 7 10 illustrate these results for the first five bending modes of the blyth belwind walney and nrel wind turbines a solution using the fem is also presented as a reference for the fw model the results for the bending mode shapes in different wind turbines and different hypotheses reveal important characteristics for each level of analysis firstly there is a clear agreement between the fw and fem fw models this was already expected since the natural frequencies of the pcm are in accordance with the results obtained by the finite element model as shown in table 5 it is also observed that the different mode shapes in each model are related to the existing differences between the natural frequencies indicated in table 8 in general expressive differences between the natural frequencies appear as indications that the mode shapes are geometrically distinct an example is given by fig 8c which illustrates the third mode shape of the belwind wind turbine which is completely different for the r and fw models in this case the difference between frequencies in table 8 is of 63 on the other hand the fundamental mode is less sensitive to this effect as indicated in table 8 the consideration of hypothesis r in the fundamental mode results in a difference of 24 in relation to the fw model but fig 8a presents minor differences for this case it is evident that these observations are associated only with normalized displacements and greater differences must be observed for the derivatives associated with these functions anyway the inclusion of more refined models shows that there is not only a shift of eigenvalues but also a modification of the characteristics of the corresponding eigenvectors evaluation of the dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine is important for the initial design phase of the owt álamo et al 2018 avoiding resonant frequencies with the active loads also foundation interaction modifies the dynamic response as found by yang et al 2019 and xie et al 2020 the correct estimate of the natural modes enables a mode superposition approach which emerges as a great advantage in eventual applications of the pcm for responses in the time or frequency domains 4 4 3 aspects of soil structure interaction ssi the results indicate the influence of a coupled springs cs model on the natural modes of the problem described by model f the effect of foundation flexibility can be observed by comparing the mode shapes of r and f models in figs 7 10 the geometric difference is clear which becomes more evident for the higher modes these results are related to those obtained by galvín et al 2016 and wang et al 2018 who also identified differences between the fixed base mode shapes and those obtained with the consideration of ssi the vibration modes of the f model also present non zero values at the base displacement and rotation and this is explained by the boundary conditions with elastic supports which are different from those applied in the fixed base model it is important to note that the fundamental mode of the r hypothesis is a satisfactory approximation of the f case in any of the four analyzed wind turbines as shown in figs 7a 10a in this case even the most basic approach level which considers a rigid foundation and the absence of additional mass model r can provide an acceptable estimate for the fundamental mode shape however this does not necessarily imply that fundamental frequencies are in agreement with those obtained for more complete models or even derivatives associated with these mode shapes as discussed previously the possibility of fundamental frequency shift must be observed for all wind turbines an analysis of table 8 for the differences recorded in the r models in relation to the fw case indicates that differences greater than 10 are obtained for all turbines except blyth as noticed by álamo et al 2018 even rigid soil parameters can lead to changes in natural frequencies in all cases the inclusion of elastic supports results in natural frequencies lower than those obtained for the hypothesis of rigid foundation in fact model r leads to an overestimation for the natural frequencies which follows what was observed by jung et al 2015 and darvishi alamouti et al 2017 from the 2nd mode shape and beyond expressive differences become clearer and this is illustrated in figs 7b 10b an isolated analysis of the hypothesis of support flexibility reveals that the consideration of rigid supports in r model produces distinct mode shapes from those obtained for the f case higher modes present significant differences for the belwind walney and nrel wind turbines figs 8 10 it is evident that these results depend on the stiffness defined for the torsional longitudinal and cross springs located at the monopile s base in the blyth wind turbine fig 7 these differences arise only from the 3rd mode and beyond and the rigid foundation model adequately represents the 2nd mode shape fig 7b which does not occur in the other turbines this is explained by the fact that soil parameters of the blyth turbine are associated with a rocky material weathered bedrock as detailed by arany et al 2016 while the others consist of combinations of clay and sand belwind or just sand walney and nrel for the 2nd vibration mode of the blyth wind turbine the natural frequencies for the f and r cases are 3 379 and 3 553 hz respectively as shown in table 8 this eigenvalue similarity is a key parameter in the fact that the elastic support has little influence on the result of this mode shape and in a discrete way affects the other modes however this is an exception among the analyzed turbines and in general significant differences are expected for the 2nd mode shape and beyond the influence of soil parameters in higher modes might be even more relevant in distributed spring models distributed springs ds which effectively consider the buried length and the corresponding mass of this pile segment in this case the contribution of the pile inertia in the formulations can alter the results obtained by the concentrated spring model darvishi alamouti et al 2017 these considerations are beyond the scope of this research but can be assessed with the inclusion of an additional section of the buried length of the monopile which corresponds to a third domain in the proposed solution emerged section submerged section buried section 4 4 4 aspects of fluid structure interaction fsi the inclusion fluid structure interaction to the ssi model represented by the fw model also modifies the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the structure in this case the observations are associated with the differences obtained between models f flexible base without fluid and fw flexible base with fluid the shift of natural frequencies is obtained in all analyzed turbines for the first five mode shapes and can be seen in the results of table 8 these changes were also observed by other authors in similar problems such as nagaya and hai 1985 uscilowska and kolodziej 1998 wu and hsu 2006 wu and chen 2007 in this last work the combination of both effects as in the fw model is evident results using elastic support and fluid added mass where the added mass provides an additional shift of natural frequencies to those provided by the flexible base model without fluid thus a model of type f overestimates the natural frequencies in relation to a more complete model of type fw for the fluid added mass the effect is a function of both the submerged length of the pile and its diameter this additional mass distribution can be interpreted as a material with an equivalent density that is higher than its in vacuum value as indicated in eq 5 as the structure s stiffness is not modified this leads to lower natural frequency values the geometric differences between the mode shapes of the f and fw models are shown in figs 7 10 the higher modes are more influenced by fsi effect and this is evident for the belwind walney and nrel wind turbines for the blyth wind turbine an important and unique characteristic among the analyzed cases is verified the curves of the r and f models are geometrically related for the first five mode shapes there is also an agreement in natural frequencies of models r and f as shown in table 8 as indicated in the ssi discussion the effect of ssi appears to be insignificant for the blyth turbine however fig 7c e present important changes when the fw model is compared to the f model therefore it is concluded that the alteration of the eigenvectors of the blyth wind turbine is provided mainly by the fsi effects in an overview it is concluded that both the additional mass and the elastic supports influence the eigenvalues and the geometric characteristics of the eigenvectors for an estimate for the first mode shape model f is sufficient however the combined effects of ssi and fsi in the fw model appears with significant importance for the higher modes an analysis of table 8 reveals that the progressive inclusion of the support flexibility effect model f and additional mass model fw leads to lower natural frequency results than the initial fixed base model r for the first five mode shapes in the analyzed cases the flexibility effect is more expressive than the inclusion of fluid interaction except for the blyth wind turbine in this way both ssi and fsi considerably modify the natural frequencies and the mode shapes of the four analyzed wind turbines and should be considered as important analysis parameters 4 5 analysis of torsional and longitudinal vibrations the longitudinal and torsional modes of the nrel wind turbine are depicted in fig 11 and are also compared to those obtained with the fem in both cases polynomials of order fifteen were employed and for the fem discretization was maintained with fifty elements in the tower and twenty in the monopile both models include the hypothesis of rigid supports and the absence of added mass on the monopile the results are excellent in both cases again as in the bending modes the agreement between the results is explained by the small relative error between the natural frequencies evaluated with the pcm and the fem shown in table 6 for the torsional eigenvalues the difference is less than 0 5 for longitudinal vibrations this difference is less than 0 2 the eigenvectors of fig 11a and b are similar and this is due to the existing analogy between the differential equation for torsional and longitudinal vibrations eqs 42 and 67 respectively in practice the use of the analogy indicated in table 1 facilitates the solution of these problems since the torsion code can be adapted for the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the longitudinal vibration problem the effects of fsi and ssi are beyond the scope of this research however the first effect can be easily included in a scenario where vertical and torsional stiffness are specified in eqs 45 and 68 the current case with rigid support implies in eigenvectors with zero displacement or rotation at position x 0 similarly to what occurs in the study of bending modes for the rigid base model r 4 6 influence of rotary and torsional inertia of the rna information about the moment of inertia of the rna for typical wind turbines is generally undisclosed and mostly kept as classified information however the values found by the pcm for the fundamental mode agree with the reference ones even if the modal analysis disregards such values table 5 the authors recognize the limitations in the analysis of higher modes for blyth belwind and walney owts since rotary and torsional inertia influence was neglected in this section the behavior of the natural frequencies is investigated with the selection of a range for these constants in order to evaluate its influence in higher modes a frequency coefficient is defined representing the ratio between the frequencies with the consideration of the rotary inertia and its absence therefore this multiplier provides some insight on the expected effects of inertia terms of the rna figs 12 and 13 a present semi log graphs that demonstrate the relationship between the rotary inertia and the bending frequency multiplier for the first five natural modes in this case 15th order polynomials were applied in the pcm for the analysis of the first five bending modes from the plots shown in figs 12 and 13a it is observed that the effect of rotary inertia reduces the natural bending frequencies in the first five modes for the three analyzed turbines multipliers less than 1 in the graphs thus the greater the rotary inertia the lower the natural frequency value these results are in line with those obtained by nagaya and hai 1985 uscilowska and kolodziej 1998 and wu and hsu 2006 who also investigated the same effect the influence of rotary inertia is more significant in higher modes which initiate the frequency reduction before lower modes it is also important to note that some differences are observed in the multiplier values of each turbine this is due to the distinct geometric characteristics of each structure such as the length and diameter of the tower and the monopile a similar of study was performed to analyze the influence of torsional inertia in the torsion modes of the nrel wind turbine fig 13b illustrates these results where the range of the inertia parameter was extended to a value of 1010 kg m2 and just as before 15th order polynomials were applied in the pcm for the analysis of the first five torsion modes the torsional frequencies of the nrel wind turbine behave differently from the bending frequencies for different values of the rna torsional inertia value there is still a reduction in natural frequencies for the first five modes however an increase in torsional inertia is more significant for reducing the frequencies of the initial modes this is exactly the opposite of what was observed for the bending mode shapes with the influence of rotary inertia the torsional fundamental mode is more sensitive to a variation in torsional inertia value asymptotic behavior of the torsional frequency multiplier is also observed a fact that does not occur in the same interval for the bending modes figs 12 and 13a however a more effective comparison is given by analyzing existing numerical values for rotary and torsional inertias in each wind turbine in the specific case of the nrel wind turbine the rotary inertia is approximately 2 5e7 kg m2 while the torsional inertia is approximately 2 6e7 kg m2 table 4 for these values a minor change is expected in the fundamental bending mode in simulations that consider the absence of rotary inertia and progressive differences with the increase in the vibration modes however a significant change appears for the fundamental torsion mode and the absence of this parameter will certainly lead to inadequate results for the first mode shape such results with notable variations in the first torsional frequencies indicate that projects with an interest in the torsional modes and in the dynamic response of the wind turbine must be aware of possible uncertainties existing in the evaluation of torsional inertia 5 concluding remarks this article presents a unified approach for the evaluation of natural modes in offshore wind turbines with monopile foundation this is a complex problem the mathematical model is governed by a differential equation with variable coefficients nonuniform cross sections and it is defined in two distinct domains moreover water added mass elastic supports and geometric nonlinearity provided by the rna mass are also some of the features that might discourage efforts in the path for closed form solutions in the current proposal an equivalent monopile is directly coupled to the tower there are also sections immersed in the support structure which are influenced by fluid interaction the final format is a differential equation defined in two distinct sections one of them with variable coefficients to the authors knowledge a closed form approach to this problem is non existent therefore an approximation of the mode shapes is proposed by means of powers series collocation points are uniformly established through the tower and the monopile allowing approximations of any polynomial order it is an analytic discrete method the resulting equations including the boundary and continuity conditions are organized into a system of equations from which the determinant of the coefficient matrix produces the characteristic equation this is an elegant approach and able to solve the problem with adequate accuracy it uses only classical mathematics simple algebra and the strong form of the problem the treatment of the boundary conditions arises easily with an expressive advantage over the finite differences method fdm at the same time it allows a simpler generalization than the finite element method since no integral form is needed in beams with variable cross section the results of the pcm converge in several benchmarks for the values of natural frequencies obtained by naguleswaran 1994 in bending and longitudinal frequencies obtained by eisenberger 1991 therefore the method can also be applied to general problems of mechanical vibrations as well as onshore wind turbines in practical applications involving four offshore wind turbines the various analysis and parameters investigated such as elastic supports axial load and fluid interaction demonstrate the versatility of the method in an overview 1 pcm is an elegant and simple alternative for the evaluation of bending torsional and longitudinal vibrations in beams and shafts 2 convergence studies demonstrate the validity of polynomial approximations in basic geometries beams and shafts of variable cross section and several benchmarks are provided based on previous research results 3 the coupling between sections with polynomial approximations of a different order is effective in the solution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in wind turbines with monopile foundation the proposed procedure is extremely compact effective and can be easily programmed on computer algebra system cas 4 the influence of several variables on an owt can be evaluated with the pcm 5 the flexibility of the foundation and the water added mass play an essential role in evaluating higher modes of offshore wind turbines simplified models that ignore these features allow only the evaluation of the fundamental mode with suitable approximation 6 in real structures the effects of rotary inertia are more expressive in higher modes the opposite occurs with torsional inertia 7 the pcm is versatile and generalizations for other differential equations or additional hypotheses for the structure of the owt are possible and may include a fluid added masses that vary with fluid depth b pile with an embedded length in soil buried length and distributed spring model c additional segment domain for the inclusion of the

21431,the design of monopile offshore wind turbines requires consideration of the most diverse excitation spectra such as sea currents waves wind and earthquakes and it is often concerned with resonance aspects the structural system resembles an inverted pendulum where a variable cross section tower is coupled to a support structure that is embedded in the seabed this work presents original mathematical developments based on the collocation method for evaluation of bending torsional and longitudinal vibrations of these structures the proposed expressions consider a polynomial approximation of the mode shapes and collocation points on the tower and monopile which satisfy the differential equation of free vibrations effects of elastic supports rotary and torsional inertia geometric nonlinearity produced by the nacelle and water added mass are evaluated in different model approximations which are compared to results from 04 reference wind turbines the formulations are also analyzed using benchmarks for classical structural dynamics solutions proposed for vibrations of beams and shafts with variable cross section the results demonstrate the efficiency of this method which produces solutions with the same quality as those obtained with finite element models at the same time they indicate the possibility of a useful and straightforward procedure for the solution of natural modes using basic mathematics that allows generalization to other boundary conditions and differential equations keywords offshore wind turbines monopile structural dynamics natural

turbines that find in offshore installations the ideal conditions for its large dimensions in these cases a single multimegawatt wind turbine can supply the energy demand of a small city design requires consideration of the most diverse excitation spectra such as sea currents waves wind and earthquakes and it is concerned with resonance aspects for shallow waters the monopile foundation provides the majority of solutions for the support structure ewea 2016 the resulting structural system is given by an upper part composed by the tower and by a lower portion consisting of a pile monopile which is embedded in the seabed by percussion or vibration expressions for the natural frequencies of these structures are of great interest to designers and provide tools for selection of parameters that limit the extent of large amplitude vibrations the problem requires the eigenvalue analysis of a structure with variable cross section with elastic supports at the seabed and lumped mass at the opposite end it is in a way an extension of the problem of an inverted pendulum common in onshore wind turbines the mathematical background includes the solution of a differential equation with variable coefficients in different domains tower and monopile connected by a transition piece fig 1 although some authors have explored simplified formulations for bending vibrations wu and hsu 2006 adhikari and bhattacharya 2012 arany et al 2016 analytical procedures for modal analysis of these structures are relatively recent the closed form solution of natural modes of monopile offshore wind turbines owt if possible has yet to be found analysis of natural bending modes for the tower structure is closely related to the problem of lateral vibrations of a beam with variable cross section these include contributions with more than a century of development such as kirchhoff 1880 meyer zur capellen 1888 and morrow 1903 ward 1913 studied the problem with the proposal of polynomial variation laws for the cross section parameters bessel functions were applied for the solution of the partial differential equation of a euler bernoulli beam suppiger and taleb 1956 presented a detailed review of the problem the authors proposed an exponential variation for the area and moment of inertia of the cross section considerations about numerous boundary conditions were also discussed gaines and volterra 1966 proposed advances concerning the elementary theory of beams and effectively included shear and rotary inertia terms wang 1967 proposed a solution with the frobenius method and the use of hypergeometric functions for beams where area and inertia are described by polynomial approximations conway et al 1964 and sanger 1968 presented a comprehensive discussion about euler bernoulli beams vibration this background indicates that relevant contributions to the problem of bending modes were already achieved in the 1950 and 1960 decades but restricted to specific geometries or available through design abacuses contributions including the investigation of torsional and axial modes in beams with variable cross section are more limited mok and murray 1966 presented developments for different natural modes torsional bending and axial of a beam with variable cross section using smooth variations of the area and inertia terms pouyet and lataillade 1981 presented the rigorous solution of the differential equation that governs torsional vibrations for the same problem using bessel functions various boundary conditions were investigated including the shaft with a fixed end and a free end rezeka 1989 presented a pioneering work on torsional vibration of hollow shafts including the evaluation of non prismatic sections natural vibrations in axial modes were investigated by eisenberger 1991 using a power series solution in the assessment of eigenvalues in variable cross section bars kumar and sujith 1997 analyzed a similar problem proposing exact solutions for bars with cross sectional parameters defined by polynomial and sinusoidal functions this previous background unveils that the evaluation of natural modes of a variable cross section beams is challenging and the coupling to any model of owt is nonexistent the monopile foundation type requires additional assumptions since the support structure introduces a different domain these include i considerations about fluid added mass in the submerged part ii elastic supports at the mudline and iii continuity conditions at the tower monopile interface in the second half of the 20th century several studies were carried out with some resemblance to the tower structure mabie and rogers 1974 recognized the difficulties in achieving a closed form solution to the natural bending modes in beams of variable inertia and with lumped mass tip in an extension to previous work to 1982 proposed a uniform inertia model where considerations on the eccentricity of the lumped mass tip and its rotational inertia were discussed auciello 1996 using bessel functions effectively addressed a combination of these previous aspects proposing a closed form solution of a beam with variable cross section lumped mass tip elastic supports and mass eccentricity it is notable the development of research that explores approaches with some level of discretization of the domain assuming some of the features of numerical methods and producing hybrid strategies kai yuan et al 1992 developed elements governed by exact solutions and applied this technique for domain discretization wu and hsu 2006 applied the point added mass pam method where discrete masses substitute the continuous mass distribution and a generalized coordinate procedure is applied for computation of the frequency equation using another strategy malaeke and moeenfard 2016 solved the problem of bending modes in variable inertia towers with discretization by finite differences the contributions of naguleswaran 1994 and abdelghany et al 2015 which applied expansions in power series to study free vibrations of euler bernoulli beams with variable cross section are also within the same scope there is a recent interest of researchers in obtaining simplified solutions for bending modes in offshore structures wu and hsu 2006 proposed an analytical formulation for the free vibration of euler bernoulli beams with constant cross section partially submerged domain lumped mass tip rotary inertia and elastic supports adhikari and bhattacharya 2012 presented a mathematical model for the owt where the structure is converted to a beam with a uniform cross section and the foundation interaction is represented by means of elastic supports effects of the axial load produced by the nacelle were included in the formulation validation of this expression was performed using several existing wind turbines results for the fundamental frequency in an extension of the previous model arany et al 2016 proposed the division of the owt structure into two constant cross section domains tower and monopile the solution for bending modes was addressed using a euler bernoulli beam model and by imposing continuity conditions coupling between the domains in a more recent study darvishi alamouti et al 2017 applied the rayleigh method based on energy conservation to obtain the fundamental bending frequency of an offshore wind turbine of constant inertia with monopile foundation and winkler springs representing soil structure interaction this retrospect of more than a century of related work reveals that approaches involving rigorous theories which address the evaluation of higher modes for the tower monopile structure are simplified and focused on the fundamental frequency of the system for longitudinal and torsional modes this discussion is nonexistent numerical models in finite elements such as the ones analyzed by wang et al 2018 and amar bouzid et al 2018 overcome these limitations and represent alternatives to the inclusion of additional features such as p y winkler springs and fluid added mass even so the possibility of an analytical solution with more features than the existing formulations emerges as something beneficial for the initial estimation of the natural frequencies of owts the current proposal consists of an original analytical discrete approach based on the point collocation method pcm and taylor series expansion allowing the solution of bending torsional and axial vibrations in owts with monopile foundation the main feature of the proposal is a polynomial approximation of the mode shapes the differential equation is evaluated at various collocation points through the length of the tower and the monopile this discrete feature and the meshless nature of the method allow different levels of approximation for the natural frequencies and avoid the calculation of recurrence rules for the coefficients of the power series boundary and continuity conditions are applied to both domains the resulting equations are organized in a system of equations and the determinant of the coefficient matrix leads to the characteristic equation the approach can be easily understood and programmable consisting of basic algorithms without any level of approximation for the geometry of the cross section also it employs simple math and the strong form of the differential equation allowing rapid generalization to other problems validations on numerous test cases are carried out for bending and longitudinal vibrations using the formulations proposed by naguleswaran 1994 and eisenberger 1991 additionally several reference wind turbines are studied according to the data provided by arany et al 2016 with an evaluation of the effects of several variables on the natural frequencies and shape modes the results of the various simulations are compared to a reference finite element model and reveal that the proposed procedure is effective in the evaluation of natural frequencies and mode shapes of offshore wind turbines with monopile foundation 2 problem formulation free vibrations of monopile owt the problem consists of an offshore wind turbine with a monopile foundation as indicated in fig 1 three cases will be analyzed i bending ii torsional and iii longitudinal free vibrations in all cases the embedded monopile length is replaced by elastic supports at the seabed fig 1b c and 1d the remaining part of the monopile is assumed to be in contact with the fluid in the bending model torsion and axial models do not include the fluid structure interaction contribution in all cases the monopile is assumed to have a constant cross section through its length and couples directly to the tower of variable cross section for convenience the effect of the transition piece is neglected 2 1 mathematical model for undamped free vibrations bending a model for euler bernoulli transverse beam vibration clough and penzien 1993 rao 2006 of variable cross section with elastic and homogenous material is proposed for the case indicated in fig 1b the motion equation includes the term of fluid interaction proposed by nagaya and hai 1985 assuming the general case of a submerged part therefore 1 d 2 d x 2 e i x d 2 ν x d x 2 q d 2 ν x d x 2 m s x m f x ω 2 ν x 0 or with an expansion of the differentials 2 e d 2 i x d x 2 d 2 ν x d x 2 2 e d i x d x d 3 ν x d x 3 e i x d 4 ν x d x 4 q d 2 ν x d x 2 m s x m f x ω 2 ν x 0 which represents a fourth order linear differential equation with variable coefficients for free undamped vibrations with frequency ω solution of this problem requires the analysis of different parts in which the differential equation 1 is applied to two subdomains tower and monopile regarding the monopile subdomain the water added mass should be considered and for sake of simplicity the entire length of the pile is assumed with surrounding water some remarkable features of the problem arise with i variable inertia ii fluid added mass and iii axial load provided by the nacelle from this point on references in subscripts will be associated with the monopile 1 and tower 2 thus in compact notation results 3 e 1 i 1 ν 1 4 q ν 1 2 m 1 ω 2 ν 1 0 0 x l m p 4 e 2 i 2 2 ν 2 2 2 e 2 i 2 1 ν 2 3 e 2 i 2 ν 2 4 q ν 2 2 m 2 ω 2 ν 2 0 l m p x l where the subscripts denote the subdomains and the numbers in superscripts in the parenthesis define the derivative order with respect to x some additional features of the problem are given by a the differential equation for the monopile subdomain is considerably simpler since the derivatives of the moment of inertia are assumed as zero in the corresponding section in general the monopile presents a smooth variation of the transversal section which will not be considered in this development b the mass per unit length in the monopile portion uses the same requirements of nagaya and hai 1985 uściłowska and kołodziej 1998 wu and hsu 2006 and moll et al 2010 in a simplified form it is assumed that the effect of fluid structure interaction corresponds to a constant additional mass in direction x the absence of sediment and fluid is also assumed inside the monopile therefore 5 m 1 m s m f ρ 1 a 1 c m ρ w a 1 where cm 1 leading to the same value of additional mass indicated by kennard 1967 dean and dalrymple 1991 blevins 2016 for circular cross sections in an incompressible fluid with no viscosity according to the potential flow theory c the rna rotor nacelle assembly is idealized as a concentrated mass perfectly centered horizontally and without vertical eccentricity at the top of the structure thus the axial load is given by 6 q m t g the rotary inertia effect produced by the rna jr also composes the problem boundary conditions d the monopile lower end can be represented by a cantilever however this representation makes the system more rigid than it is because it ignores the soil structure interaction wu and hsu 2006 a more appropriate form of representation is through elastic springs which makes the structure more flexible arany et al 2016 translational kt rotational kr and cross coupled krt springs which captures cross effects such as the displacement caused by a rotation are adopted therefore 7 e 1 i 1 ν 1 2 k r ν 1 1 k r t ν 1 a t x 0 8 e 1 i 1 ν 1 3 q ν 1 1 k t ν 1 k r t ν 1 1 a t x 0 e at the

3 e 2 i 2 1 ν 2 2 e 2 i 2 ν 2 3 which represent displacement rotation bending moment and shear force at x l m p 2 1 1 solution of bending natural modes using the collocation method a closed form solution for equation 2 is difficult to obtain since it presents variable coefficients and it is composed of two subdomains tower and monopile a clever strategy arises with the use of power series for an approximation of the mode shapes according to wright 1964 two paths are possible after choosing this type of approximation and its subsequent replacement in the differential equation i compare the coefficients of each power of the proposed polynomial associated with the independent variable and obtain a recurrence rule for these coefficients or ii satisfy the differential equation in a certain number of collocation points along the independent variable domain the following proposal is based on the second option defined as point collocation method pcm the basic idea is to choose as a solution a function and a set of collocation points requiring them to satisfy the differential equation at the prescribed points collatz 1966 approximating the displacements of the monopile and tower

x 2 20 x 3 the basic idea of pcm emerges with the following reasoning equations 17 and 18 remain valid for any collocation point therefore it is possible to construct a system of equations obtained by applying these expressions to several points of the subdomain of the monopile and the tower fig 2 where each collocation point corresponds to a line of the system at β as a result 21 β 1 β 2 τ 1 τ 2 v 1 v 2 c d 0 s c d 0 where the rows of the submatrices β 1 and β 2 are defined according to equations 17 and 18 respectively submatrices of the 2nd t 1 t 2 and 3rd rows v 1 v 2 are related to boundary conditions eqs 7 10 and continuity eqs 11 14 in fig 2 the submatrices of eq 21 can be identified the non trivial solution of 21b is s 0 where its i th eigenvalue represents the i th natural frequency ωi of the corresponding system to define an approximation of any degree n n 1 equations are required in each subdomain however the problem presents four boundary conditions and four continuity conditions hence n n 3 is the total of the required collocation points for each subdomain consequently this will result in rectangular submatrices in 21 in an overview 22 β 1 b 1 i j ℝ n 1 3 n 1 1 β 2 b 2 i j ℝ n 2 3 n 2 1 the terms of the previous submatrices can be easily obtained with the application of 19 to equations 17 and 18 thus 23 b 1 i j e 1 i 1 j 1 j 2 j 3 j 4 x i j 5 q j 1 j 2 x i j 3 m

analysis is made considering two subdomains where equation 42 is applied separately to the monopile with constant cross section and to the tower with variable cross section in a compact notation 43 j

torsional elastic constant ktor c boundary conditions are defined by 45 g 1 j 1 θ 1 1 k t o r θ 1 a t x 0 46 g 2 j 2 θ 2 1 ω 2 j t θ 2 a t x l which define a concentrated torque at these positions d continuity conditions at the transition of the subdomains are defined by 47 θ 1 θ 2 48 g 1 j 1 θ 1 1 g 2 j 2 θ 2 1 which define compatibility between angle and torque at the interface e fluid structure interaction is neglected for the monopile 2 2 1 solution of torsional natural modes using the collocation method the procedure follows the same reasoning as the proposed solution to the bending problem i e an approximation of the torsion angle in each subdomain through taylor series centered at x 0 therefore 49 θ 1 x θ ˆ 1 x i 0 n 1 c i x i 1 x x 2 x 3 x n 1 c 1 c 2 c 3 c 4 t p 1 c

ω 2 p 2 d 0 the following system of equations is obtained using the same logic as the bending problem 53 β 1 β 2 τ 1 τ 2 v 1 v 2 c d 0 s c d 0 the non trivial solution of 53b is s 0 where its i th eigenvalue represents the i th natural frequency ω i of the corresponding system this specific case requires two boundary and two continuity conditions thus n n 1 is the total number of collocation points required for each subdomain hence 54 β 1 b 1 i j ℝ n 1 1 n 1 1 β 2 b 2 i j ℝ n 2 1 n 2 1 the elements of the above submatrices are defined by 55 b 1 i j g 1 j 1 j 1 j 2 x i j 3 j m 1 ω 2 x i j

61 t 2 2 j g 2 j 2 x l j 1 l j 2 j t ω 2 l j 1 finally replacing 49 and 50 in the continuity conditions 47 and 48 respectively results in 62 p 1 c p 2 d 0 63 g 1 j 1 p 1 1 c g 2 j 2 p 2 1 d 0 both valid in x l m p defining the following submatrices 64 v 1 v 1 i j ℝ 2 n 1 1 v 2 v 2 i j ℝ 2 n 2 1 where the corresponding elements are defined by 65 v 1 1 j l m p j 1 v 1 2 j g 1 j 1 j 1 l m p j 2 66

natural frequency ω in a shaft of variable cross section composed by an elastic and homogeneous material eisenberger 1991 67 m x ω 2 u x e d a x d x d u x d x a x d 2 u x d x 2 0 where the mathematical equivalence with the torsion model defined by 42 is remarkable the equivalent parameters are presented in table 1 the boundary conditions also present the same relation being defined as 68 e 1 a 1 u 1 1 k v u 1 a t x 0 69 e 2 a 2 u 2 1 ω 2 m t u 2 a t x l and the continuity conditions in the transition between subdomains can be written as 70 u 1 u 2 71 e 1 a 1 u 1 1 e 2 a 2 u 2 1 which correspond to the translation and the normal force respectively in x l m p 2 3 1 solution of longitudinal natural modes using the collocation method the use of the equivalence indicated in table 1 emerges with an immediate advantage the procedure is the same as the torsion problem and the previous submatrices can be used for evaluation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the axial vibration problem 3 benchmark tests bending and longitudinal vibrations a study of the pcm performance is presented for geometries analyzed by naguleswaran 1994 and eisenberger 1991 these are presented in fig 3 3 1 results for bending vibrations in a truncated wedge in this case several scenarios are adopted for the truncated wedge proposed by naguleswaran 1994 where the effective length l is defined in terms of a parameter α 72 l 1 α l fig 3a presents the wedge geometry where the clamped end is given by a square cross section of unitary side the other end is considered free the parameter α was analyzed in three scenarios for a beam of hypothetical length l 1 mass density and elastic modulus were taken as units to obtain dimensionless results table 2 shows the results obtained for the first three mode shapes in the xy plane the terms in parenthesis indicate the order of the polynomial expansion associated with the pcm fig 4 shows a graphical representation of these values the value of α influences the convergence rate and this aspect is perceived in fig 3a as a result the performance of pcm is geometry dependent sharp wedges with small values for alpha and shorter truncation length αl require a greater polynomial expansion for convergence this effect is attenuated as the value of α increases for the best case scenario α 0 50 differences of less than 0 5 are verified with polynomials of order equal to ten fig 4c even so all analyzed cases achieve convergence to the values presented by naguleswaran 1994 and less than 2 relative difference is perceived for more critical cases α 0 05 with the use of polynomials of order equal to thirty fig 4a for the specific case of wind turbine geometries this transition is smooth in the range of 0 5 0 6 in standard towers and it is not a problem it will be demonstrated in the subsequent sections that low order order polynomials are suitable for an accurate estimate of the bending modes in these structures in summary higher order polynomials are not required for practical results 3 2 results for longitudinal vibrations in a shaft two scenarios proposed by eisenberger 1991 are evaluated where a beam with variable cross section fig 3b has its longitudinal vibration modes computed with an exact solution table 3 shows the results obtained for the first five modes in the xy plane the terms in parenthesis indicate the order of the polynomial approximation associated with pcm the performance is superior to that obtained in the previous problem of bending vibrations but it is also a function of the analyzed geometry a linear variation of the cross sectional area exhibits a faster convergence rate with discrete performance gains compared to a quadratic variation once again convergence is obtained with an increased polynomial degree with the use of a polynomial of order fifteen the relative differences between frequencies is less than 0 5 for the two proposed geometries in practical applications involving wind turbine towers this variation is smooth and can be approximated with the use of low order polynomials 4 analysis of offshore wind turbines with monopile foundation the procedures described above were applied to four different geometries of monopile offshore wind turbines according to table 4 wind turbines blyth 2 mw belwind 3 mw and walney 3 6 mw correspond to real structures with parameters and reference results provided by arany et al 2016 in these cases the first five bending modes were evaluated by the pcm the fourth geometry corresponds to the concept turbine nrel 5 mw phase ii widely spread in literature the numerous parameters provided by bir and jonkman 2008 and jonkman and musial 2010 allow for the evaluation of bending torsional and longitudinal modes of this last wind turbine the results obtained with the pcm for these four geometries were also compared to results of a finite element simulation with detailed information described in the next section 4 1 finite element reference model a finite element code was developed by the authors using matlab and it is applied as a reference for the subsequent analyses bending torsional and longitudinal vibrations are governed by eqs 1 42 and 67 respectively the proposed two node finite element is defined by the following degrees of freedom bending degrees of freedom for translation and rotation 4 total longitudinal degree of freedom for axial translation 2 total rotational degree of freedom with respect to the longitudinal axis 2 total additionally cubic shape functions are employed for bending vibrations and linear shape functions are applied for axial translation and rotation with respect to the longitudinal axis a variable cross section is defined with respect to the longitudinal axis cross sectional area moment of inertia and polar moment of inertia are defined by second degree polynomials with key properties at the start midpoint and end of the element a weighted residual approach is applied for the solution of linear stiffness and mass matrices this solution is also complemented by a nonlinear geometric stiffness matrix which was not used in this paper but with effects verified for the pcm reference results are achieved with the following meshes valid for all the analyzed cases 50 elements for the tower structure 20 elements for the monopile element properties at start midpoint and end positions are computed previously and applied to each element matrix stiffness and mass reference simulations in fem also consider the following aspects i for bending vibrations foundation interaction and the influence of fluid added mass are considered the elastic supports are inserted at the monopile base mudline with lateral rotational and cross stiffness defined by table 04 for each turbine the additional mass is included in the monopile mass matrix influence of nonlinear geometric effects produced by the rna mass are neglected but included in the pcm method ii for torsional and longitudinal vibrations models with rigid supports and without additional mass are considered 4 2 general aspects of the pcm models in the analysis using the pcm the collocation points were defined as equally spaced the order of the polynomial expansion is indicated in each specific case and it is applied for the tower and monopile as a result a polynomial of order n1 n2 n defines an approximation of order n for these domains the evaluation of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors was performed using matlab software with calculations considering double numerical precision in the solution of the roots of the characteristic equation different models are evaluated with respect to features such elastic supports fluid added mass and nonlinear geometric effects produced by the rna mass 4 3 pcm benchmark numerical convergence test figs 5 and 6 illustrate the convergence of the natural frequencies where the relative difference for the solution with the fem is indicated in all cases a polynomial approximation of n 10 gives results of remarkably high precision for the first five natural modes less than 1 of relative difference the numerical values of the natural frequencies for bending modes are shown in table 5 where the solutions by the pcm correspond to approximations using polynomials of the 15th degree the values obtained by arany et al 2016 and the values obtained by bir and jonkman 2008 are also presented a significant advantage of the pcm is the computation of higher modes which is an aspect still unexplored in simplified approaches torsional and longitudinal natural frequencies of the nrel wind turbine are indicated in table 6 and were obtained using polynomial approximations of the 10th degree in general higher modes present inferior convergence rate to the reference values obtained with the fem still the quality of the results is excellent the fem model adequately represents the problem geometry employing elements of variable cross section and adequate discretization this explains the small relative difference obtained between pcm and fem results 4 4 influence of soil rigidity water added mass and geometric nonlinearity for the bending mode shapes additional scenarios are defined for each type of wind turbine where the effects of soil rigidity water added mass and geometric nonlinearity produced by rna mass are evaluated these are defined in table 7 the numerical results are presented in table 8 where the reference case for relative differences is fw the characteristics of the pcm are the same as the previous item using a polynomial approximation 15th degree for every scenario the different scenarios allow a progressive evaluation of the contribution of the various parameters 4 4 1 discussion on the eigenvalue shift for the analyzed models the analysis of the relative differences in table 8 allows a series of considerations on the several variables i there is no significant influence of the axial load due to rna in the calculation of the first five natural bending frequencies in all cases the relative differences of the fwg case are less than 1 ii the relative difference in case f explains the relevance of water added mass effects for the first modes water influence is negligible for higher modes the relative difference is significant in some cases it is higher than 40 iii the simplified hypothesis of rigid supports corresponding to case r increases the relative difference for higher modes the flexibility effect of the foundation is more relevant than the contribution of the fluid added mass an exception is given by the blyth wind turbine which will be detailed in section 4 4 3 iv the fw model provides an excellent estimate of the problem for the five first mode shapes when compared to finite element results for the fundamental mode acceptable results are achieved with model f 4 4 2 general discussion on the eigenvectors for the analyzed models in addition to obtaining the natural frequencies the method also enables the evaluation of eigenvectors figs 7 10 illustrate these results for the first five bending modes of the blyth belwind walney and nrel wind turbines a solution using the fem is also presented as a reference for the fw model the results for the bending mode shapes in different wind turbines and different hypotheses reveal important characteristics for each level of analysis firstly there is a clear agreement between the fw and fem fw models this was already expected since the natural frequencies of the pcm are in accordance with the results obtained by the finite element model as shown in table 5 it is also observed that the different mode shapes in each model are related to the existing differences between the natural frequencies indicated in table 8 in general expressive differences between the natural frequencies appear as indications that the mode shapes are geometrically distinct an example is given by fig 8c which illustrates the third mode shape of the belwind wind turbine which is completely different for the r and fw models in this case the difference between frequencies in table 8 is of 63 on the other hand the fundamental mode is less sensitive to this effect as indicated in table 8 the consideration of hypothesis r in the fundamental mode results in a difference of 24 in relation to the fw model but fig 8a presents minor differences for this case it is evident that these observations are associated only with normalized displacements and greater differences must be observed for the derivatives associated with these functions anyway the inclusion of more refined models shows that there is not only a shift of eigenvalues but also a modification of the characteristics of the corresponding eigenvectors evaluation of the dynamic characteristics of the wind turbine is important for the initial design phase of the owt álamo et al 2018 avoiding resonant frequencies with the active loads also foundation interaction modifies the dynamic response as found by yang et al 2019 and xie et al 2020 the correct estimate of the natural modes enables a mode superposition approach which emerges as a great advantage in eventual applications of the pcm for responses in the time or frequency domains 4 4 3 aspects of soil structure interaction ssi the results indicate the influence of a coupled springs cs model on the natural modes of the problem described by model f the effect of foundation flexibility can be observed by comparing the mode shapes of r and f models in figs 7 10 the geometric difference is clear which becomes more evident for the higher modes these results are related to those obtained by galvín et al 2016 and wang et al 2018 who also identified differences between the fixed base mode shapes and those obtained with the consideration of ssi the vibration modes of the f model also present non zero values at the base displacement and rotation and this is explained by the boundary conditions with elastic supports which are different from those applied in the fixed base model it is important to note that the fundamental mode of the r hypothesis is a satisfactory approximation of the f case in any of the four analyzed wind turbines as shown in figs 7a 10a in this case even the most basic approach level which considers a rigid foundation and the absence of additional mass model r can provide an acceptable estimate for the fundamental mode shape however this does not necessarily imply that fundamental frequencies are in agreement with those obtained for more complete models or even derivatives associated with these mode shapes as discussed previously the possibility of fundamental frequency shift must be observed for all wind turbines an analysis of table 8 for the differences recorded in the r models in relation to the fw case indicates that differences greater than 10 are obtained for all turbines except blyth as noticed by álamo et al 2018 even rigid soil parameters can lead to changes in natural frequencies in all cases the inclusion of elastic supports results in natural frequencies lower than those obtained for the hypothesis of rigid foundation in fact model r leads to an overestimation for the natural frequencies which follows what was observed by jung et al 2015 and darvishi alamouti et al 2017 from the 2nd mode shape and beyond expressive differences become clearer and this is illustrated in figs 7b 10b an isolated analysis of the hypothesis of support flexibility reveals that the consideration of rigid supports in r model produces distinct mode shapes from those obtained for the f case higher modes present significant differences for the belwind walney and nrel wind turbines figs 8 10 it is evident that these results depend on the stiffness defined for the torsional longitudinal and cross springs located at the monopile s base in the blyth wind turbine fig 7 these differences arise only from the 3rd mode and beyond and the rigid foundation model adequately represents the 2nd mode shape fig 7b which does not occur in the other turbines this is explained by the fact that soil parameters of the blyth turbine are associated with a rocky material weathered bedrock as detailed by arany et al 2016 while the others consist of combinations of clay and sand belwind or just sand walney and nrel for the 2nd vibration mode of the blyth wind turbine the natural frequencies for the f and r cases are 3 379 and 3 553 hz respectively as shown in table 8 this eigenvalue similarity is a key parameter in the fact that the elastic support has little influence on the result of this mode shape and in a discrete way affects the other modes however this is an exception among the analyzed turbines and in general significant differences are expected for the 2nd mode shape and beyond the influence of soil parameters in higher modes might be even more relevant in distributed spring models distributed springs ds which effectively consider the buried length and the corresponding mass of this pile segment in this case the contribution of the pile inertia in the formulations can alter the results obtained by the concentrated spring model darvishi alamouti et al 2017 these considerations are beyond the scope of this research but can be assessed with the inclusion of an additional section of the buried length of the monopile which corresponds to a third domain in the proposed solution emerged section submerged section buried section 4 4 4 aspects of fluid structure interaction fsi the inclusion fluid structure interaction to the ssi model represented by the fw model also modifies the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the structure in this case the observations are associated with the differences obtained between models f flexible base without fluid and fw flexible base with fluid the shift of natural frequencies is obtained in all analyzed turbines for the first five mode shapes and can be seen in the results of table 8 these changes were also observed by other authors in similar problems such as nagaya and hai 1985 uscilowska and kolodziej 1998 wu and hsu 2006 wu and chen 2007 in this last work the combination of both effects as in the fw model is evident results using elastic support and fluid added mass where the added mass provides an additional shift of natural frequencies to those provided by the flexible base model without fluid thus a model of type f overestimates the natural frequencies in relation to a more complete model of type fw for the fluid added mass the effect is a function of both the submerged length of the pile and its diameter this additional mass distribution can be interpreted as a material with an equivalent density that is higher than its in vacuum value as indicated in eq 5 as the structure s stiffness is not modified this leads to lower natural frequency values the geometric differences between the mode shapes of the f and fw models are shown in figs 7 10 the higher modes are more influenced by fsi effect and this is evident for the belwind walney and nrel wind turbines for the blyth wind turbine an important and unique characteristic among the analyzed cases is verified the curves of the r and f models are geometrically related for the first five mode shapes there is also an agreement in natural frequencies of models r and f as shown in table 8 as indicated in the ssi discussion the effect of ssi appears to be insignificant for the blyth turbine however fig 7c e present important changes when the fw model is compared to the f model therefore it is concluded that the alteration of the eigenvectors of the blyth wind turbine is provided mainly by the fsi effects in an overview it is concluded that both the additional mass and the elastic supports influence the eigenvalues and the geometric characteristics of the eigenvectors for an estimate for the first mode shape model f is sufficient however the combined effects of ssi and fsi in the fw model appears with significant importance for the higher modes an analysis of table 8 reveals that the progressive inclusion of the support flexibility effect model f and additional mass model fw leads to lower natural frequency results than the initial fixed base model r for the first five mode shapes in the analyzed cases the flexibility effect is more expressive than the inclusion of fluid interaction except for the blyth wind turbine in this way both ssi and fsi considerably modify the natural frequencies and the mode shapes of the four analyzed wind turbines and should be considered as important analysis parameters 4 5 analysis of torsional and longitudinal vibrations the longitudinal and torsional modes of the nrel wind turbine are depicted in fig 11 and are also compared to those obtained with the fem in both cases polynomials of order fifteen were employed and for the fem discretization was maintained with fifty elements in the tower and twenty in the monopile both models include the hypothesis of rigid supports and the absence of added mass on the monopile the results are excellent in both cases again as in the bending modes the agreement between the results is explained by the small relative error between the natural frequencies evaluated with the pcm and the fem shown in table 6 for the torsional eigenvalues the difference is less than 0 5 for longitudinal vibrations this difference is less than 0 2 the eigenvectors of fig 11a and b are similar and this is due to the existing analogy between the differential equation for torsional and longitudinal vibrations eqs 42 and 67 respectively in practice the use of the analogy indicated in table 1 facilitates the solution of these problems since the torsion code can be adapted for the calculation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the longitudinal vibration problem the effects of fsi and ssi are beyond the scope of this research however the first effect can be easily included in a scenario where vertical and torsional stiffness are specified in eqs 45 and 68 the current case with rigid support implies in eigenvectors with zero displacement or rotation at position x 0 similarly to what occurs in the study of bending modes for the rigid base model r 4 6 influence of rotary and torsional inertia of the rna information about the moment of inertia of the rna for typical wind turbines is generally undisclosed and mostly kept as classified information however the values found by the pcm for the fundamental mode agree with the reference ones even if the modal analysis disregards such values table 5 the authors recognize the limitations in the analysis of higher modes for blyth belwind and walney owts since rotary and torsional inertia influence was neglected in this section the behavior of the natural frequencies is investigated with the selection of a range for these constants in order to evaluate its influence in higher modes a frequency coefficient is defined representing the ratio between the frequencies with the consideration of the rotary inertia and its absence therefore this multiplier provides some insight on the expected effects of inertia terms of the rna figs 12 and 13 a present semi log graphs that demonstrate the relationship between the rotary inertia and the bending frequency multiplier for the first five natural modes in this case 15th order polynomials were applied in the pcm for the analysis of the first five bending modes from the plots shown in figs 12 and 13a it is observed that the effect of rotary inertia reduces the natural bending frequencies in the first five modes for the three analyzed turbines multipliers less than 1 in the graphs thus the greater the rotary inertia the lower the natural frequency value these results are in line with those obtained by nagaya and hai 1985 uscilowska and kolodziej 1998 and wu and hsu 2006 who also investigated the same effect the influence of rotary inertia is more significant in higher modes which initiate the frequency reduction before lower modes it is also important to note that some differences are observed in the multiplier values of each turbine this is due to the distinct geometric characteristics of each structure such as the length and diameter of the tower and the monopile a similar of study was performed to analyze the influence of torsional inertia in the torsion modes of the nrel wind turbine fig 13b illustrates these results where the range of the inertia parameter was extended to a value of 1010 kg m2 and just as before 15th order polynomials were applied in the pcm for the analysis of the first five torsion modes the torsional frequencies of the nrel wind turbine behave differently from the bending frequencies for different values of the rna torsional inertia value there is still a reduction in natural frequencies for the first five modes however an increase in torsional inertia is more significant for reducing the frequencies of the initial modes this is exactly the opposite of what was observed for the bending mode shapes with the influence of rotary inertia the torsional fundamental mode is more sensitive to a variation in torsional inertia value asymptotic behavior of the torsional frequency multiplier is also observed a fact that does not occur in the same interval for the bending modes figs 12 and 13a however a more effective comparison is given by analyzing existing numerical values for rotary and torsional inertias in each wind turbine in the specific case of the nrel wind turbine the rotary inertia is approximately 2 5e7 kg m2 while the torsional inertia is approximately 2 6e7 kg m2 table 4 for these values a minor change is expected in the fundamental bending mode in simulations that consider the absence of rotary inertia and progressive differences with the increase in the vibration modes however a significant change appears for the fundamental torsion mode and the absence of this parameter will certainly lead to inadequate results for the first mode shape such results with notable variations in the first torsional frequencies indicate that projects with an interest in the torsional modes and in the dynamic response of the wind turbine must be aware of possible uncertainties existing in the evaluation of torsional inertia 5 concluding remarks this article presents a unified approach for the evaluation of natural modes in offshore wind turbines with monopile foundation this is a complex problem the mathematical model is governed by a differential equation with variable coefficients nonuniform cross sections and it is defined in two distinct domains moreover water added mass elastic supports and geometric nonlinearity provided by the rna mass are also some of the features that might discourage efforts in the path for closed form solutions in the current proposal an equivalent monopile is directly coupled to the tower there are also sections immersed in the support structure which are influenced by fluid interaction the final format is a differential equation defined in two distinct sections one of them with variable coefficients to the authors knowledge a closed form approach to this problem is non existent therefore an approximation of the mode shapes is proposed by means of powers series collocation points are uniformly established through the tower and the monopile allowing approximations of any polynomial order it is an analytic discrete method the resulting equations including the boundary and continuity conditions are organized into a system of equations from which the determinant of the coefficient matrix produces the characteristic equation this is an elegant approach and able to solve the problem with adequate accuracy it uses only classical mathematics simple algebra and the strong form of the problem the treatment of the boundary conditions arises easily with an expressive advantage over the finite differences method fdm at the same time it allows a simpler generalization than the finite element method since no integral form is needed in beams with variable cross section the results of the pcm converge in several benchmarks for the values of natural frequencies obtained by naguleswaran 1994 in bending and longitudinal frequencies obtained by eisenberger 1991 therefore the method can also be applied to general problems of mechanical vibrations as well as onshore wind turbines in practical applications involving four offshore wind turbines the various analysis and parameters investigated such as elastic supports axial load and fluid interaction demonstrate the versatility of the method in an overview 1 pcm is an elegant and simple alternative for the evaluation of bending torsional and longitudinal vibrations in beams and shafts 2 convergence studies demonstrate the validity of polynomial approximations in basic geometries beams and shafts of variable cross section and several benchmarks are provided based on previous research results 3 the coupling between sections with polynomial approximations of a different order is effective in the solution of eigenvalues and eigenvectors in wind turbines with monopile foundation the proposed procedure is extremely compact effective and can be easily programmed on computer algebra system cas 4 the influence of several variables on an owt can be evaluated with the pcm 5 the flexibility of the foundation and the water added mass play an essential role in evaluating higher modes of offshore wind turbines simplified models that ignore these features allow only the evaluation of the fundamental mode with suitable approximation 6 in real structures the effects of rotary inertia are more expressive in higher modes the opposite occurs with torsional inertia 7 the pcm is versatile and generalizations for other differential equations or additional hypotheses for the structure of the owt are possible and may include a fluid added masses that vary with fluid depth b pile with an embedded length in soil buried length and distributed spring model c additional segment domain for the inclusion of the

21432,in this study the stability of cube armour units in the lower slope and berm of rubble mound breakwaters with a berm was investigated for irregular and regular placement methods cubes are simple and cheap in production however the design conditions for the upper slope and lower slope may differ depending on the water level of the dominant storm conditions for the upper slope relatively higher water levels are dominant the berm has a reducing effect on the wave loading on the upper slope and therefore it may be relevant to use cubes in the lower slope in combination with rock in the upper slope in this study a regular placement technique named the double pyramid placement method was applied for cubes placed on the lower slope and the berm this placement technique was compared with the irregular placement technique by performing experiments in a wave flume as a result of this investigation the regular placement method was found to be superior for the stability of cubes in the lower slope and berm of rubble mound breakwaters with a berm keywords berm type breakwater cube blocks berth structures berm lower slope 1 introduction berm breakwaters have been introduced in the early 1980s as mass armoured reshaping structures where the wave action causes that the structure reshapes into a more favorable s shape later the multi layered less reshaping structures known as the icelandic type have become popular for locations with severe wave loading where large stones are available berm breakwaters are divided into different categories depending on the reshaping and on the construction method pianc 2003 gave a classification based on the reshaping behavior van der meer and sigurdarson 2016 proposed a classification of berm breakwaters partly based on their structural behavior such as hardly reshaping partly reshaping and fully reshaping in the last decades an extensive number of studies focused on berm type breakwaters because a berm in the seaward slope is cost effective to reduce overtopping compared to increasing the crest and it can also increase the stability of the armour layer burcharth and frigaard 1988 van der meer 1988a hall and kao 1991 lamberti et al 1994 tomasicchio et al 1994 van gent 1995 lamberti and tomasicchio 1997 tørum et al 1999 pianc 2003 tørum et al 2003 lykke andersen 2006 lykke andersen and burcharth 2010 moghim and tørum 2012 sigurdarson and van der meer 2012 sigurdarson and van der meer 2013 van gent 2013 sigurdarson et al 2008 lykke andersen et al 2014 moghim and alizadeh 2014 tørum and sigurdarson 2014 van der meer and sigurdarson 2014 ehsani et al 2020 a berm in the seaward slope can also be very effective to adapt to the increasing wave conditions due to climate change see also van gent 2019 berm type breakwaters are classified with respect to their structural and hydraulic behavior which are defined by pianc 2003 van gent 2013 and van der meer and sigurdarson 2016 within the concept of a dynamically stable rubble mound breakwater van der meer 1988a the use of relatively small material in combination with allowing a degree of reshaping of the seaward slope leads to reshaping berm type breakwaters while allowing only a traditional amount of damage in terms of hudson s stability formula and broderick 1983 s damage parameter s to the armour layer leads to berm type breakwaters that can also be described as rubble mound breakwaters with a berm it appeared that rubble mound breakwaters with a berm are more effective in increasing the stability of the breakwater armour layer compared to conventional breakwaters breakwaters with a berm can significantly reduce overtopping and the required rock size compared to straight slopes without a berm however the potential damage at the transition from the lower slope to the berm plays a very important role in the stability of this kind of structures hence for rubble mound structures with a berm the most critical section is the transition from the lower slope to the berm yuksel et al 2018 the berm width and berm level affect the stability of the lower slope and the upper slope van gent 2013 analyzed rubble mound structures consisting of a rock armoured slope and gave the design formulas for non reshaping or hardly reshaping mass armour type breakwaters with a berm van gent 2013 also recommended a study to investigate the influence of a berm on the stability of concrete armour units in the lower slope and berm see also van gent and van der werf 2017 if the required armour size is too large to use available rock concrete armour units in the lower slope may be an option for rock armoured breakwaters with a berm various types of concrete armour units may be considered to be used in the lower slope for instance tetrapodes and cubes and they are relatively easy to construct the stability of armour units can be mainly expressed in contributions of weight and interlocking capacity the stability of cubes is controlled mostly by their weight rather than the capacity of interlocking compared to other concrete units cubes are the easiest to cast and place and can be cost effective despite the larger amount of concrete compared to more slender interlocking armour units therefore in the present study cubes are intended to be used in the lower slope and the berm in combination with rock in the upper slope the cube is one of the oldest armour units among the many other concrete armor units and they are still being used for breakwaters all over the world in addition to the main stability formula for concrete armour units by hudson 1953 van der meer 1988b also presented an empirical stability formula for cube units 1 h s δ d n 6 7 n o 0 4 n 0 3 1 0 s 0 m 0 1 where hs is the significant wave height δ is the relative density dn is the nominal diameter no is the relative damage number n is the number of waves s 0 m is the wave steepness based on the mean period the placement of the concrete units also affects the stability of the armour layers frens et al 2008 studied the impact of different placement methods with different packing densities on the stability of antifer block armour layers for conventional breakwaters they found that regular placement methods were more stable than irregular placement methods for similar packing densities they stated that the so called double pyramid placement method see fig 1 for packing densities around 55 and 60 was the best performing placement method this regular placement method is relatively easy to construct compared to more complex regular placement patterns that have been constructed by contractors in various structures with cube armour layers in the present study cubes were applied in the lower slope and the berm while in the upper slope rock was applied the rock in the upper slope was fixed with a wire mesh cubes were placed in the lower slope and berm using two different placement methods as irregular and regular placements with a packing density of 59 for both of them the double pyramid placement method frens et al 2008 has been chosen for the cube armour units as a regular placement method this study also considered the design of a placement configuration in the transition from the lower slope to the berm with closed transitions as defined in yuksel et al 2018 it should also be noted that here breakwaters with a non reshaping statically stable berm have been studied 2 experimental setup and procedures experimental research was carried out in the wave flume of the coastal and harbor engineering laboratory at the yildiz technical university the flume has a length of 26 m a width of 1 m and a height of 1 m the channel is equipped with an edinburgh designs piston type wave generator that has an active reflection compensation system fig 2 the cross sections for two different placements regular double pyramid and irregular placement are given in fig 3 the breakwater model was placed on a horizontal foreshore the nominal diameter of the cubes at the 1 1 5 lower slope and at the berm was 40 mm for the 1 2 upper slope the size of the rock in the armour layer was dn 32 5 mm however the material at the upper slope was fixed in place with a wire mesh because this study focused on the stability of the lower slope and berm fig 4 the underlayer consisted of stones with a nominal diameter of 19 mm the packing density of the blocks was 59 by using the irregular placement and the double pyramid placement methods fig 5 the lower slope and berm had the same number of cubes at each row for the irregular and the regular placements to obtain the same packing density and porosity using a theoretical layer thickness of 2 dn for both placement methods the width and position of the berm with respect to the water level were varied the berm widths were 3dn 4dn 5dn defined as narrow berms in the following and 10dn 14 dn defined as wide berms three different water depths d of 0 45 0 55 and 0 65 m were studied to investigate the effect of the position of the berm with respect to the still water level in other words the still water levels swl were 0 1 m below at and 0 1 m above the berm db d 0 222 0 and 0 154 where db is the vertical distance between berm and swl db dn 2 5 0 and 2 5 the core of the breakwater was placed according to the dimensions given in fig 3 before placing the cubes the theoretical length of the armour layer was calculated for the irregular and regular placement methods with the same packing density for both placements i e the same number of cubes for the irregular placement the blocks were placed by letting them fall free from a few centimeters above to gain the intended position and to increase the irregularity of the placement however blocks were placed one by one to each calculated location on the slope for regular placement as shown in fig 5 the second layer was shifted horizontally relative to the first layer each layer was placed staggered over the slope the layer thickness is equal to two times the block height for both placement methods the units were placed in colored bands to improve the visualization of the displacement and thus to observe and measure the damage the standard froude scaling method for the underlayer which is the core material is based on a relation between the armour block weight and the underlayer material weight m a r m o u r m 50 u n d e r l a y e r a relation based on the nominal diameter of the armour and underlayers d n a r m o u r d n 50 u n d e r l a y e r is also commonly used van gent 2003 recommended a ratio between 2 and 2 5 the ratios were considered as d n a r m o u r d n 50 u n d e r l a y e r 40 19 2 1 and d n 50 a r m o u r d n 50 u n d e r l a y e r 34 19 1 8 for lower slope and berm and upper slope respectively the viscous scale effects are considered negligible when the reynolds number is higher than 2 103 hughes 1993 lykke andersen and burcharth 2010 wolters et al 2010 the reynolds number is calculated by re u d ν where d is the characteristic dimension of the armour material and ν is the kinematic viscosity which for water at 10 is 1 33 10 6 m2 s u is the seepage velocity u p h s l m 2 d t p is the porosity of the core material hi is the significant wave height at the toe l is the mean wave length of the waves and t is the mean wave period at the toe the resulting reynolds number is 5 103 for the typical values used in this study i e p 0 49 hi 0 14 m tm 1 16 s d 0 45 m dn50 0 019 m which indicates that experiments are not influenced by scale effects however in a small scale physical model the friction forces between units may not be equal to those in the prototype because the armour unit surface can be relatively rougher in the model than for the large scale units as painting the unit provides a somewhat smoother surface all units were painted with different colors the stability of the toe of the structure is not part of this research to guarantee the toe stability without affecting the results for the stability of the armour layer the toe was fixed by a steel frame the width and the thickness of the toe were 4dn and 2dn 8 cm respectively fig 3a and b and 4 the crest width of the structure was gc 4dn a total of 11 irregular wave conditions with a jonswap spectrum γ 3 3 in deep water conditions were selected for all tests wave conditions were measured at five different locations one of the wave probes was placed in front of the structure toe one was close to the wave board four gauges were in constant water depth with known spacing to separate incident and reflected waves from the measured surface elevations fig 2 the applied method for separating the incident and reflected waves was employed by using the mansard and funke 1980 method the spectral significant wave height hs in this paper hs hm0 4 m0 0 5 and wave period tm 1 0 tm 1 0 m 1 m0 were obtained from the measured wave energy spectra in total 360 wave tests were carried out for both the irregular and regular placement methods in addition a number of additional experiments were performed to check the repeatability of the tests the analysis was based on the time series of the incident waves at the toe in addition waves were also calibrated at the toe by comparing the incident waves for the experiments without structure using a gravel beach instead of structure with those with the structure per test the incoming significant wave height in front of the toe was gradually increased to define the wave height leading to failure the design wave height was considered as hs 0 20 m the damage was repaired after each series of test runs but not after each individual test run similar to van gent 2013 each placement method was tested for the wave steepness of around s p 2 π h s g t p 2 0 033 each test run consisted of about 1000 waves the damage was cumulative for each test series and determined by using a visualization technique by taking digital photos before and after each run from a fixed location perpendicular to the slope the damage was also determined by counting the moved armor units and measuring the movement distance in terms of displaced units related to a width along the longitudinal axis of the breakwater of nominal diameter dn moreover the profile of the structure slope was measured before and after each test run for the tests with the irregular placement method the measurement of the profile was made with a profiler at a spacing of 0 10 m across the flume width for only irregular placement an average erosion profile was computed and this average profile was used to determine the eroded area ae for each test the measured damage level was defined with s a e d n 2 to avoid potential side wall effects affecting the results 1dn widths from both sides of the wall were not considered for the calculation of the damage to determine the damage the reference area should be defined because the displaced units are not uniformly distributed over the slope related to the section affected by wave action a larger reference area results in lower damage numbers therefore the selection of the reference area is important the reference area was defined as the area between the two levels of swl hs which corresponds to swl 5dn for the selected design wave height of hs 0 20 m by considering these issues the reference area was kept constant as 10dn below the berm for all water levels in this study damage is defined in the following way no damage no units are displaced initial damage a few units are displaced failure the underlayer is exposed to direct wave attack above definitions of the damage were calculated and evaluated as follows 1 the damage ratio was calculated with the equation given below 2 damage ratio d i number of displaced units total number of units within reference area the damage ratio was classified as d1 d2 and dt which represent displacements between 1dn and 2dn above 2dn and above 1dn respectively hence dt indicates all displaced cubes total displacement between each sea state the damage was not repaired so the damage ratio after each sea state is the cumulative damage 2 damage level only for irregular placement 3 s a e d n 2 3 relative damage number damage to concrete units can be described by the relative damage number no which is defined by the actual number of displaced units related to a width along the longitudinal axis of the breakwater of one nominal diameter dn the definition of no is comparable with the definition of s although s includes displacement and settlement it does not take into account the porosity of the armour layer in this study the damage number was found by counting the displaced units of one nominal diameter width in the reference area from the camera records 4 n o number of displaced units of one nominal diameter d n in reference area l d n where l is the width of the model structure excluded one nominal diameter from each side wall and dn is the nominal diameter of the cube table 1 provides an overview of the applied values of the most important parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural responses of the irregular and regular placement on the lower slope and berm two different placement methods were tested for five different berm widths with three different berm levels hence fifteen different configurations were applied for each placement method the performance of each placement method was evaluated depending on the berm width and berm level the performance of the placement methods was expressed using the observed movements and displacements of the cubes to visualize the movements within the layer the digital overlay technique was used by a camera and video records were taken during the test photos were also taken after each test run when the water was tranquil again from exactly the same location as the camera was installed above the wave channel the positions of the cubes were compared using these digital photos by overlaying with the positions on the photo that was taken before the first test run the moving blocks in the layer were counted the blocks connected to the glass of the flume were not included to exclude potential wall effects other cubes that move because of the movement of these wall blocks were also not included in this way 3 different categories of movement are expressed in relation to the nominal diameter 0 0 0 5dn 0 5 1 0dn and 0 0 2 0dn are indicated with m1 m2 and mt respectively while displacements are represented with d1 d2 and dt in relation to 1dn 2dn above 2dn and above 1dn respectively frens et al 2008 3 1 1 irregular placement figs 6 and 7 show the percentage of movements m and damage ratio d in the lower slope for 5dn and 14dn berm widths respectively as examples of narrow and wide berms the movement ratio for the lower slope is already rather large under small wave actions and displacements are observed for higher waves in the case of the emerged berm when the stability of the blocks on the emerged berm and the lower slope are considered together the damage starts first on the lower slope around swl and later extends also to the berm for the case of the berm at swl the damage occurred first at the berm rather than at the lower slope the movement ratio is smaller for the submerged berm yet it rapidly increases under larger wave heights these findings indicate that the berm level is critical if the berm is exposed to direct wave attack damage can occur to the berm while if the berm is emerged and the transition between the lower slope and berm is less exposed to direct wave attack damage occurs first at the lower slope failure starts earlier at the transition between the lower slope and the berm when the berm is at the swl because waves directly act on this transition section and damage occurs both on the berm and on the lower slope on the other hand waves also act to the berm for the submerged berm therefore initial damage occurs on the berm the data of movements for this irregular placement method shows a lot of scatter especially for large movement ratios but the damage ratios show less scatter movements start at smaller waves than displacements and these movements increase the strength of the layer due to clamping between the units and initially unfavourably positioned cubes relocate to better positions so the displacements start at higher waves fig 6 a shows that the first block displaced during wave series of hm0 0 10 m on the lower slope while the block displaced at h m0 0 14 m from the emerged berm most of the displaced cubes stayed in the slope i e most movements and displacements occurred within the slope hence they still contributed somehow to the strength of the lower slope stability overtopping was not observed for the emerged berm in these experiments fig 6 b shows that displacements occurred at the same wave height of hm0 0 10 m for the berm and the lower slope and failure was observed rapidly at hm0 0 13 m for the berm at swl overtopping was also observed during the wave series of hm0 0 15 m for the configuration with a submerged berm b 5dn displacement started first on the berm at hm0 0 08 m while in the lower slope the first block displaced later at hm0 0 13 m fig 6 c in this case overtopping was observed earlier than for the other berm levels at hm0 0 08 m as the water level is higher although for some tests some overtopping occurred almost all wave energy was still concentrated on the front slope see also frens et al 2008 and the limited overtopping is considered not to have an effect on the stability similar movements and displacements were observed for the more narrow berms b 3dn and 4dn observations showed that most of the displaced units were still on the slope and they contributed to the lower slope stability for all cases overtopping started earlier for the narrower berm widths of b 3dn and 4dn although overtopping was not observed for the emerged berm width of b 4dn overtopping was observed for b 3dn also for the emerged berm as expected the berm width and level are effective parameters for reducing the overtopping fig 7 a shows that displacement started at hm0 0 14 m on the lower slope for b 14dn later the first displacement occurred at hm0 0 15 m on the berm for emerged berm case however failure was not observed for this case displacement for the berm at swl started earlier hm0 0 11 m than on the lower slope hm0 0 13 m where the failure occurred at hm0 0 17 m in this case the movement rate was less than the emerged berm case fig 7 b fig 7 c shows that a similar displacement rate for the submerged berm was observed as the berm at swl the first displacement occurred at hm0 0 12 m for the submerged berm and later displacement started at the wave series of hm0 0 14 on the lower slope failure was observed at h m0 0 18 m on the lower slope the results shown in fig 7 are representative for the other wide berm 10dn like in the narrow berm case most movements and displacements also occurred within the slope and they contributed to the strength of the lower slope however no overtopping was observed for the configurations with the emerged berm and the berm at swl yet there was still limited overtopping for h m0 0 18 m 3 1 2 regular placement figs 8 and 9 show the movement and displacement rates for the regular placement method the stability of the lower slope increased when the berm width increased for all berm levels however the stability of the berm affected the lower slope because of the transition between the berm and lower slope even though a closed transition was formed during the experiments to increase the stability yuksel et al 2018 once instability was experienced at the transition from the lower slope to the berm the stability of the lower slope was affected thereafter for the emerged berm the berm itself remained more stable than for the other berm level conditions and the berm was less affected than the lower slope because smaller waves were not effective on the berm for the emerged berm condition however the waves directly hit the lower slope hence there were a lot of movements on the lower slope for the emerged berm case much more than for the berm at swl and the submerged berm displacements occurred at the higher waves during the test because the layer on the lower slope gained stability with clamping of the blocks one another under the smaller wave effect for the emerged berm the initial damage started later than for the other berm levels however a chain reaction brittle failure occurred when the block displacement started for this placement method for the berm level at swl waves affected the berm and the transition primarily hence displacements initiated early thereafter the berm instability affected the lower slope stability the initiation of damage for the berm at swl started earlier than the other berm levels for the submerged berm the stability of the berm was affected more than the lower slope there were fewer movements than for the other berm levels while damage initiation started earlier than for the emerged berm because the lower slope was affected by the instability of the transition when the berm width increased initiation of the displacement delayed and the stability increased the double pyramid placement is a regular placement method therefore the displacement of one block causes a chain reaction however in our observations the displaced cubes mostly stayed on the slope and contributed to stability only a few cubes extracted from the slope during the tests mostly observed for the case of the emerged berm the transition between lower slope and berm mostly controls the lower slope stability especially for the submerged berm and the berm at swl conditions because the incident waves are in direct interaction with the transition region fig 8 is given for the narrow berm case b 5dn for emerged berm shown in fig 8 a movements started at the first wave series but displacements initiated much later at hs 0 17 m on the lower slope however displacement was not observed at the berm observations showed that all displaced blocks on the lower slope stayed on the slope although the movement ratio increased gradually with the increasing wave height the displacement ratio increased rapidly and caused a chain reaction the movement data with a regular placement shows much clearer trends less scattered data than the irregular placement the movements initiated at the beginning of the waves yet displacements on the lower slope started later at hs 0 13 m and failure occurred at hs 0 18 m for the case of the berm at swl fig 8 b the same wave series hs 0 13 m caused the first displacement at the berm only a few blocks displaced out of the slope to the toe for this case the movement for the case of the submerged berm on the lower slope was less than the emerged berm case yet the displacement initiated at hs 0 14 m which was earlier than the emerged berm case fig 8 c and the failure also occurred earlier at hs 0 15 m the initiation of the cube displacements at the berm started at the same wave series with the lower slope a few cube blocks displaced out of the slope to the toe for this case during failure fig 9 a shows that the displacement started later at hs 0 19 m for the emerged berm when the berm width is larger b 14dn failure did not occur on the lower slope during the tests there was no displacement at the berm as well fig 9 b shows the movement and displacement ratios for the case of the berm at swl for b 14dn the initiation of the displacement started at hs 0 16 m for both the lower slope and the berm the failure occurred at hs 0 19 m on the lower slope the first displacement started at hs 0 17 m on the lower slope while it was started at hs 0 14 m on the berm for the submerged berm case fig 9 c the movement ratio was less than 15 for this case however a chain reaction caused the failure after the initiation of the displacement observations showed that all displaced blocks on the lower layer stayed on the slope for b 14dn there was no overtopping for all berm levels for b 14dn however no overtopping was also observed for the emerged berm of b 5dn while it appeared at hs 0 16 m and hs 0 14 m for the berm at swl and at the submerged berm respectively which were similar to the irregular placement when the movement and displacement ratios for the regular placement were compared to the irregular placement regular placement was found to be more stable than the irregular placement this is because the regular placement gains additional stability due to clamping between the blocks 3 2 stability of irregular placements the stability of the lower slope and berm for double layer irregular placement of cube blocks were tested for the berm widths of b 3dn 4dn 5dn 10dn and 14dn at different levels of the berm from swl db relative to water depth at toe of the breakwater dtoe relative damage n0 and also damage level s were determined by using camera records and bed profile measurements respectively when the relative damage n0 is evaluated the submerged lower slope is found to be more stable than the other berm levels fig 10 except for b 3dn for all conditions the stability of the lower slope for the berm at swl is least than that for the other berm levels because the amount of water during the wave run down is reduced for configurations with a high berm fig 10 clearly shows that on average the stability improves for wider berms for all levels of the berm fig 10 continued in eq 1 given by van der meer 1988b initial damage and failure are defined by n0 0 5 and n0 2 respectively for conventional breakwaters in this study initial damage is defined using the stability number ns h s δ d n at which the displacement of cubes is initiated within one nominal diameter in the defined reference area stability numbers at the emerged berm the berm at swl and the submerged berm conditions were found to be as ns 1 43 1 25 and 1 25 respectively for b 3dn however ns 1 43 1 25 and 1 79 and ns 1 79 1 79 and 2 32 were obtained at the emerged berm the berm at swl and the submerged berm for b 4dn and 5dn respectively for the narrow berms in general relative damage indicated that the lower slope of submerged berms was slightly more stable than the other berm levels except for the berm width of b 3dn lower stability was observed at the berm at swl cases the results for wide berms b 10dn and 14dn showed that the stability numbers were calculated as ns 2 14 1 96 and 2 50 and ns 2 50 1 78 and 2 50 for the emerged berm the berm at swl and the submerged berm respectively similar responses for the wide berms were obtained as the narrow berms yet larger stability numbers were obtained for wide berms than those for the narrow berms for the irregular placement method the stability numbers for the initial damage except for the berm width of b 3dn which is less effective on the stability can be summarized as below ns 1 4 2 5 for the emerged berm ns 1 3 2 0 for the berm at swl ns 1 8 2 5 for the submerged berm figs 11 13 present the stability number ns versus relative damage n0 for each berm level and berm width the figures clearly show that the berm width has a significant influence on the lower slope stability the stability number increases with increasing berm width the stability of wide berms deviates significantly from the narrow berms while the curves representing the narrow berm stabilities are located close to each other the presented experimental results are also shown in fig 14 which shows the relative damage number n0 and the stability number ns together with the results calculated by the formula by van der meer 1988b for conventional cube breakwaters without a berm for breakwaters with a berm the reduction in relative damage on the lower slope depends on the level of the berm and the width of the berm as shown in fig 14 for the breakwaters with submerged berms there is a slight reduction in the relative damage on the lower slope for the breakwaters with narrow berms compared to those with straight slopes while the reduction in the relative damage is more apparent for the breakwaters with wide berms fig 14 a this is expected to be caused by the influence of the berm on the wave run down for the breakwaters with submerged berms there is a clear reduction in the relative damage except for b 3dn fig 14 b the reduction in damage increases as the berm width increases for the narrow berms with a width of 3 or 4 diameters at swl there is no reduction in damage compared to the expression for straight slopes without a berm for all other berm widths and all other berm levels there is a clear increase in the stability compared to a straight slope without a berm to show the variation of damage level s against stability number ns figs 15 17 were drawn for the emerged berm the berm at swl and the submerged berm respectively the evaluation of damage level s indicated that the emerged berm is more stable and berm at swl is less stable than the other berm levels while the submerged berm was found to be more stable than other berm levels in terms of relative damage n0 because the measured damage levels s include also damage of the berm itself and often the damage occurs at the transition from the lower slope to the berm a clear distinction between the damage at the lower slope and damage at the berm cannot be made van gent 2013 damage to the lower slope was observed mostly around the transition from the lower slope to the berm especially for the berm at swl moreover the initial displacement started earlier in the emerged berm than the submerged berm the experiments show that the stability of the lower slope depends mainly on the relative berm level db d and berm width b for narrow berm widths 3dn 4dn and 5dn when the berm was emerged initiation of instability s 2 and n0 0 5 was at ns 2 while it was at 1 25 ns 2 0 for the berm at swl and for the submerged berm yet the stability number of ns 2 5 was obtained for all wide berm levels 10dn and 14dn the berm recession rec of the models has been measured and analyzed as shown in figs 18 20 the idea of the berm recession in here is that the cube from second layer can be displaced on the berm however the berm still keep their geometry it appears that the recession of the berm depends on the amount of damage and the level of the berm db the amount of damage is more significant for the berm at swl because wave loads directly affect the transition region however the lowest recession is observed for the emerged berm case for which the effect of the waves on the berm is relatively limited 3 3 stability of regular placement the relative damage n0 for the regular placement method is calculated based on the largest stability number ns with no displacement relative damage against the stability number was given in figs 11 13 for three different berm levels together with five different berm widths these figures also include n0 ns curves for irregular placement in order to compare the stabilities as can be understood from these figures the regular placement method leads to a more stable armour layer than the irregular placement method yet a chain reaction more brittle failure occurred after the initial damage steeper stability curves hence it has been observed that transition from the initial damage to failure occurs with a small increase in wave height similar to the behavior of concrete blocks placed in a single armour layer the initiation of damage is followed by displacements at the second layer of cubes and then the underlayer becomes exposed failure for the emerged berms although the initial displacement started later than the other berm levels damage suddenly increased and failure was reached more quickly this result is different than for the irregular placement method for this regular placement the transition from the lower slope to the berm is very sensitive to direct wave loads for the berm at swl and for the submerged berm and therefore damage starts earlier than for the emerged berm case when the first block around swl is displaced for the emerged berm regular placement exhibits more strength than irregular placement in terms of initiation of the block displacement for the regular placement method the stability numbers just before displacement except b 3dn where the berm width is less effective on the stability were found to be as follows n s 2 9 3 4 for the emerged berm n s 1 8 2 5 for the berm at swl n s 2 1 2 7 for the submerged berm these values are significantly larger than for the irregular placement method again the damage occurs earlier for the structure with a berm at swl than for a structure with an emerged or submerged berm again the values depend on the width of the berm with wider berms leading to a higher strength of the armour layer figs 11 13 also show that stability number increases as the berm width increases the berm level and width were found to be effective on the stability of the lower slope and berm regular placement double pyramid method increases the stability for all berm levels compared to irregular placement no recession was observed at the emerged berms for b 5dn berm recession started later in the models with regular placement compared to irregular placement for all the berm levels and berm widths tested figs 18 20 the stability of the lower slope of a berm breakwater with a regular double pyramid placement method was found to be much more stable than conventional breakwaters with irregularly placed double layer this finding can also be observed in comparisons with the prediction formula of van der meer 1988b for straight slope as shown in fig 21 3 4 stability coefficients kd different stability coefficients are defined for different placements the hudson stability coefficient kdh is based on the significant wave height were the first displacements appear within a damage ratio of 0 5 if this first damage exceeds the damage ratio of 5 the significant wave height from the preceding wave series is applied to calculate the kdh value for regular placement methods a different damage level is required because it results in a chain reaction the significant wave height before the wave series at which the first displacement appears is applied for calculation of the stability parameter kd0 for regular placement therefore a damage ratio of 0 is required before the first displacement to compare the irregular and regular placement methods another stability coefficient is defined kd 5 in the tests with the irregular placement method it was observed that shortly after the initial damage there is a slightly higher wave condition where the damage ratio suddenly increases and exceeds 5 therefore the kd value is calculated with the significant wave height where the damage ratio was still below 5 kd 5 the stability coefficient kd can be calculated as a function of ns and the lower slope angle cot α as shown below 5 k d n s 3 cot α the calculated stability coefficients are summarized in table 2 for irregular placement the lowest stability coefficients were found for the berm width of b 3dn as berm width increased the stability coefficients increased similar calculations were carried out to find the stability coefficients for regular placement table 3 the coefficients were found to be larger than those of the irregular placement this result also shows that the regular placement on the lower slope is more stable than the irregular placement these stability coefficients increase with increasing berm width similar to the irregular placement the stability coefficients in the lower slope with regular placement may be represented as following for b 4dn k d0 15 6 for the emerged berm k d0 3 8 for the berm at swl k d0 8 3 for the submerged berm 3 5 prediction method for the lower slope stability 3 5 1 irregular placement based on the physical model tests prediction methods were derived for the stability of the lower slope here empirical formulae are described to determine the required cube size at the lower slope for the emerged the berm at swl and the submerged berms in order to account for the influence of the berm on the lower slope with cubes the parameters that are considered here are the width of the berm the position of the berm and the wave steepness then a reduction in cube size is recommended with the calibrated expressions for each berm position this reduction factor γ b e r m due to the berm can be applied in combination with eq 1 and the equation becomes 6 n s 6 7 n 0 γ berm 0 4 n 0 3 1 s m 1 0 0 1 for emerged berms the reduction in relative damage n0 for the lower slope was found to be dependent on the level of the berm position db

steepness sm 1 0 was observed for the berm at swl similar to the submerged berm the calibrated reduction expression for the berm at swl may be written as follows 9 γ berm 1 0 07 b h s for d b 0 fig 22 shows the measurements compared to the predicted stability numbers obtained from eq 6 good agreements between the measured and calculated stability parameters were obtained for all the berm levels and widths in fig 22 the data for berm at swl show more scatter compared to those for the submerged and emerged berms due to interactions of waves with the transition between the berm and the lower slope fig 22 3 5 2 regular placement although regular placement increases the stability for all berm levels compared to irregular placement damage suddenly increased and brittle failure was reached more quickly as it is presented in section 3 3 the stability numbers are in a narrow range or can be seen as almost constant see table 4 no clear influence of the wave steepness was observed for all berm levels for design purposes it is recommended to use the smaller values of the each given range for the narrow berms b 5 d n and the larger values for wider berms b 5 d n 3 6 recession of the berm in this study the cube at the berm was the same as the cube at the lower slope damage occurs at the seaward side of the berm for both placement methods the horizontal distance between the seaward side of the berm and the position where no damage occurs is referred to as the recession of the berm rec 3 6 1 irregular placement the amount of recession at the berm depends on the level of the berm db and the width of the berm b the recession is smaller for the emerged berms than the other berm levels if the berm is at swl the recession is greater than the case of the submerged and emerged berm levels due to its direct interaction with the waves the following expression has been derived for the recession 10 r e c d n γ r e c n 0 1 8 1 15 where γ r e c is a factor which depends on the berm level and width for the emerged berm d b h s 0 and the submerged berm d b h s 0 11 γ rec d b h s b h s 0 5 and for the berm at swl with d b h s 0 12 γ rec b h s 0 5 fig 23 shows that the accuracy of eqs 10 12 are relatively low which is similar to as discussed by van gent 2013 for rock armour the rms error is between 0 5 and 0 8 between measured and predicted values 3 6 2 regular placement figs 18 20 show that the berm stability is higher for the regular placement method than for the irregular placement stability at the berm depends on the berm level and width the recession of the berm for the emerged berm condition is always less than that for the other berm levels experiments showed no recession for b 5dn for the emerged berm while recession starts at ns 2 86 for b 5dn and displacement at the berm occurs after the displacement on the lower slope begins the recession of the berm at swl is significant although the recession decreases with increasing berm width the recession starts at ns 2 3 for a berm width wider than 3dn a berm width of b 3dn is not advised since those armour layers are always less stable than the other berm widths 4 conclusions in this study the stability of cubes in the lower slope and berm of a rubble mound breakwater with a berm was studied irregular and regular placement patterns were investigated with special attention to the units at the transition from the lower slope to the berm the upper slope was armoured with rock and this part of the structure was fixed with a wire mesh in the tests slope angles were 1 2 and 1 1 5 for the upper and lower slopes respectively three different berm levels and five different berm widths were tested the packing density of the cube armour layer was 59 for both irregular and regular placements i e the same amount of units was used for each placement pattern the tests have led to the following conclusions 4 1 irregular placement the stability of cubes in the lower slope and berm depends on the level of the berm and the width of the berm the stability in the lower slope also slightly depends on the wave steepness for the structures with an emerged berm the damage starts first in the lower slope around swl for the structures with a submerged berm and for structures with a berm at swl the damage occurs first at the transition between the lower slope and the berm rather than at the lower slope for wider berms the damage reduces significantly it is advised not to apply a berm width smaller than 4 cube diameters the largest damage was found for a berm at swl damage starts at stability numbers between 1 3 and 2 0 depending on the width of the berm a stability expression was derived to account for the reducing effects of a berm including the effects of the berm width and the level of the berm 4 2 regular placement the stability in the lower slope and berm increases as the berm level and berm width increase regular placement is more stable than irregular placement but a chain reaction in damage is observed brittle behavior after the initial damage for the regular placement no apparent influence of the wave steepness is observed for the regular placement patterns for wider berms the damage reduces significantly it is advised not to apply a berm width smaller than 4 cube diameters the largest damage was found for a berm at swl damage starts at stability numbers between 1 8 and 2 5 depending on the width of the berm a stability expression is not derived because the stability numbers are in a narrow range or almost constant such that a design can be based on the stability number the transition between the lower slope and the berm is very sensitive in terms of damage it is advised to apply the placement pattern at the transition as applied in the present tests nevertheless if the berm level is at swl the displacement starts earlier than for other berm levels the initiation of the cube displacement in the lower slope starts later for the emerged berm level than the other berm levels but the stability suddenly decreases and failure is reached more quickly for the emerged berm this behavior is different from the irregular placement because the movements of the cubes exposed to smaller waves increase the clamping strength of the units between the adjacent blocks the initiation of the recession starts later for the regular placement than for the irregular placement no recession is observed for the emerged berms with b 5dn a prediction method is given to estimate the stability for the lower slope with two layer cubes in section 3 5 the limitations for the design condition are given in table 1 4 3 recommendations the cube is the simplest concrete block as an armour unit the behavior of the cube unit depends on the geometry of the front slope porosity and placement techniques etc but not on so called interlocking other concrete units such as the tetrapod and the accropode have interlocking capability it is recommended to study the performance of the other concrete armour units on the lower slope and berm of rubble mound breakwaters with a berm in addition it is recommended to study the influence of the berm level for various water depths shallow

21432,in this study the stability of cube armour units in the lower slope and berm of rubble mound breakwaters with a berm was investigated for irregular and regular placement methods cubes are simple and cheap in production however the design conditions for the upper slope and lower slope may differ depending on the water level of the dominant storm conditions for the upper slope relatively higher water levels are dominant the berm has a reducing effect on the wave loading on the upper slope and therefore it may be relevant to use cubes in the lower slope in combination with rock in the upper slope in this study a regular placement technique named the double pyramid placement method was applied for cubes placed on the lower slope and the berm this placement technique was compared with the irregular placement technique by performing experiments in a wave flume as a result of this investigation the regular placement method was found to be superior for the stability of cubes in the lower slope and berm of rubble mound breakwaters with a berm keywords berm type breakwater cube blocks berth structures berm lower slope 1 introduction berm breakwaters have been introduced in the early 1980s as mass armoured reshaping structures where the wave action causes that the structure reshapes into a more favorable s shape later the multi layered less reshaping structures known as the icelandic type have become popular for locations with severe wave loading where large stones are available berm breakwaters are divided into different categories depending on the reshaping and on the construction method pianc 2003 gave a classification based on the reshaping behavior van der meer and sigurdarson 2016 proposed a classification of berm breakwaters partly based on their structural behavior such as hardly reshaping partly reshaping and fully reshaping in the last decades an extensive number of studies focused on berm type breakwaters because a berm in the seaward slope is cost effective to reduce overtopping compared to increasing the crest and it can also increase the stability of the armour layer burcharth and frigaard 1988 van der meer 1988a hall and kao 1991 lamberti et al 1994 tomasicchio et al 1994 van gent 1995 lamberti and tomasicchio 1997 tørum et al 1999 pianc 2003 tørum et al 2003 lykke andersen 2006 lykke andersen and burcharth 2010 moghim and tørum 2012 sigurdarson and van der meer 2012 sigurdarson and van der meer 2013 van gent 2013 sigurdarson et al 2008 lykke andersen et al 2014 moghim and alizadeh 2014 tørum and sigurdarson 2014 van der meer and sigurdarson 2014 ehsani et al 2020 a berm in the seaward slope can also be very effective to adapt to the increasing wave conditions due to climate change see also van gent 2019 berm type breakwaters are classified with respect to their structural and hydraulic behavior which are defined by pianc 2003 van gent 2013 and van der meer and sigurdarson 2016 within the concept of a dynamically stable rubble mound breakwater van der meer 1988a the use of relatively small material in combination with allowing a degree of reshaping of the seaward slope leads to reshaping berm type breakwaters while allowing only a traditional amount of damage in terms of hudson s stability formula and broderick 1983 s damage parameter s to the armour layer leads to berm type breakwaters that can also be described as rubble mound breakwaters with a berm it appeared that rubble mound breakwaters with a berm are more effective in increasing the stability of the breakwater armour layer compared to conventional breakwaters breakwaters with a berm can significantly reduce overtopping and the required rock size compared to straight slopes without a berm however the potential damage at the transition from the lower slope to the berm plays a very important role in the stability of this kind of structures hence for rubble mound structures with a berm the most critical section is the transition from the lower slope to the berm yuksel et al 2018 the berm width and berm level affect the stability of the lower slope and the upper slope van gent 2013 analyzed rubble mound structures consisting of a rock armoured slope and gave the design formulas for non reshaping or hardly reshaping mass armour type breakwaters with a berm van gent 2013 also recommended a study to investigate the influence of a berm on the stability of concrete armour units in the lower slope and berm see also van gent and van der werf 2017 if the required armour size is too large to use available rock concrete armour units in the lower slope may be an option for rock armoured breakwaters with a berm various types of concrete armour units may be considered to be used in the lower slope for instance tetrapodes and cubes and they are relatively easy to construct the stability of armour units can be mainly expressed in contributions of weight and interlocking capacity the stability of cubes is controlled mostly by their weight rather than the capacity of interlocking compared to other concrete units cubes are the easiest to cast and place and can be cost effective despite the larger amount of concrete compared to more slender interlocking armour units therefore in the present study cubes are intended to be used in the lower slope and the berm in combination with rock in the upper slope the cube is one of the oldest armour units among the many other concrete armor units and they are still being used for breakwaters all over the world in addition to the main stability formula for concrete armour units by hudson 1953 van der meer 1988b also presented an empirical stability formula for cube units 1 h s δ d n 6 7 n o 0 4 n 0 3 1 0 s 0 m 0 1 where hs is the significant wave height δ is the relative density dn is the nominal diameter no is the relative damage number n is the number of waves s 0 m is the wave steepness based on the mean period the placement of the concrete units also affects the stability of the armour layers frens et al 2008 studied the impact of different placement methods with different packing densities on the stability of antifer block armour layers for conventional breakwaters they found that regular placement methods were more stable than irregular placement methods for similar packing densities they stated that the so called double pyramid placement method see fig 1 for packing densities around 55 and 60 was the best performing placement method this regular placement method is relatively easy to construct compared to more complex regular placement patterns that have been constructed by contractors in various structures with cube armour layers in the present study cubes were applied in the lower slope and the berm while in the upper slope rock was applied the rock in the upper slope was fixed with a wire mesh cubes were placed in the lower slope and berm using two different placement methods as irregular and regular placements with a packing density of 59 for both of them the double pyramid placement method frens et al 2008 has been chosen for the cube armour units as a regular placement method this study also considered the design of a placement configuration in the transition from the lower slope to the berm with closed transitions as defined in yuksel et al 2018 it should also be noted that here breakwaters with a non reshaping statically stable berm have been studied 2 experimental setup and procedures experimental research was carried out in the wave flume of the coastal and harbor engineering laboratory at the yildiz technical university the flume has a length of 26 m a width of 1 m and a height of 1 m the channel is equipped with an edinburgh designs piston type wave generator that has an active reflection compensation system fig 2 the cross sections for two different placements regular double pyramid and irregular placement are given in fig 3 the breakwater model was placed on a horizontal foreshore the nominal diameter of the cubes at the 1 1 5 lower slope and at the berm was 40 mm for the 1 2 upper slope the size of the rock in the armour layer was dn 32 5 mm however the material at the upper slope was fixed in place with a wire mesh because this study focused on the stability of the lower slope and berm fig 4 the underlayer consisted of stones with a nominal diameter of 19 mm the packing density of the blocks was 59 by using the irregular placement and the double pyramid placement methods fig 5 the lower slope and berm had the same number of cubes at each row for the irregular and the regular placements to obtain the same packing density and porosity using a theoretical layer thickness of 2 dn for both placement methods the width and position of the berm with respect to the water level were varied the berm widths were 3dn 4dn 5dn defined as narrow berms in the following and 10dn 14 dn defined as wide berms three different water depths d of 0 45 0 55 and 0 65 m were studied to investigate the effect of the position of the berm with respect to the still water level in other words the still water levels swl were 0 1 m below at and 0 1 m above the berm db d 0 222 0 and 0 154 where db is the vertical distance between berm and swl db dn 2 5 0 and 2 5 the core of the breakwater was placed according to the dimensions given in fig 3 before placing the cubes the theoretical length of the armour layer was calculated for the irregular and regular placement methods with the same packing density for both placements i e the same number of cubes for the irregular placement the blocks were placed by letting them fall free from a few centimeters above to gain the intended position and to increase the irregularity of the placement however blocks were placed one by one to each calculated location on the slope for regular placement as shown in fig 5 the second layer was shifted horizontally relative to the first layer each layer was placed staggered over the slope the layer thickness is equal to two times the block height for both placement methods the units were placed in colored bands to improve the visualization of the displacement and thus to observe and measure the damage the standard froude scaling method for the underlayer which is the core material is based on a relation between the armour block weight and the underlayer material weight m a r m o u r m 50 u n d e r l a y e r a relation based on the nominal diameter of the armour and underlayers d n a r m o u r d n 50 u n d e r l a y e r is also commonly used van gent 2003 recommended a ratio between 2 and 2 5 the ratios were considered as d n a r m o u r d n 50 u n d e r l a y e r 40 19 2 1 and d n 50 a r m o u r d n 50 u n d e r l a y e r 34 19 1 8 for lower slope and berm and upper slope respectively the viscous scale effects are considered negligible when the reynolds number is higher than 2 103 hughes 1993 lykke andersen and burcharth 2010 wolters et al 2010 the reynolds number is calculated by re u d ν where d is the characteristic dimension of the armour material and ν is the kinematic viscosity which for water at 10 is 1 33 10 6 m2 s u is the seepage velocity u p h s l m 2 d t p is the porosity of the core material hi is the significant wave height at the toe l is the mean wave length of the waves and t is the mean wave period at the toe the resulting reynolds number is 5 103 for the typical values used in this study i e p 0 49 hi 0 14 m tm 1 16 s d 0 45 m dn50 0 019 m which indicates that experiments are not influenced by scale effects however in a small scale physical model the friction forces between units may not be equal to those in the prototype because the armour unit surface can be relatively rougher in the model than for the large scale units as painting the unit provides a somewhat smoother surface all units were painted with different colors the stability of the toe of the structure is not part of this research to guarantee the toe stability without affecting the results for the stability of the armour layer the toe was fixed by a steel frame the width and the thickness of the toe were 4dn and 2dn 8 cm respectively fig 3a and b and 4 the crest width of the structure was gc 4dn a total of 11 irregular wave conditions with a jonswap spectrum γ 3 3 in deep water conditions were selected for all tests wave conditions were measured at five different locations one of the wave probes was placed in front of the structure toe one was close to the wave board four gauges were in constant water depth with known spacing to separate incident and reflected waves from the measured surface elevations fig 2 the applied method for separating the incident and reflected waves was employed by using the mansard and funke 1980 method the spectral significant wave height hs in this paper hs hm0 4 m0 0 5 and wave period tm 1 0 tm 1 0 m 1 m0 were obtained from the measured wave energy spectra in total 360 wave tests were carried out for both the irregular and regular placement methods in addition a number of additional experiments were performed to check the repeatability of the tests the analysis was based on the time series of the incident waves at the toe in addition waves were also calibrated at the toe by comparing the incident waves for the experiments without structure using a gravel beach instead of structure with those with the structure per test the incoming significant wave height in front of the toe was gradually increased to define the wave height leading to failure the design wave height was considered as hs 0 20 m the damage was repaired after each series of test runs but not after each individual test run similar to van gent 2013 each placement method was tested for the wave steepness of around s p 2 π h s g t p 2 0 033 each test run consisted of about 1000 waves the damage was cumulative for each test series and determined by using a visualization technique by taking digital photos before and after each run from a fixed location perpendicular to the slope the damage was also determined by counting the moved armor units and measuring the movement distance in terms of displaced units related to a width along the longitudinal axis of the breakwater of nominal diameter dn moreover the profile of the structure slope was measured before and after each test run for the tests with the irregular placement method the measurement of the profile was made with a profiler at a spacing of 0 10 m across the flume width for only irregular placement an average erosion profile was computed and this average profile was used to determine the eroded area ae for each test the measured damage level was defined with s a e d n 2 to avoid potential side wall effects affecting the results 1dn widths from both sides of the wall were not considered for the calculation of the damage to determine the damage the reference area should be defined because the displaced units are not uniformly distributed over the slope related to the section affected by wave action a larger reference area results in lower damage numbers therefore the selection of the reference area is important the reference area was defined as the area between the two levels of swl hs which corresponds to swl 5dn for the selected design wave height of hs 0 20 m by considering these issues the reference area was kept constant as 10dn below the berm for all water levels in this study damage is defined in the following way no damage no units are displaced initial damage a few units are displaced failure the underlayer is exposed to direct wave attack above definitions of the damage were calculated and evaluated as follows 1 the damage ratio was calculated with the equation given below 2 damage ratio d i number of displaced units total number of units within reference area the damage ratio was classified as d1 d2 and dt which represent displacements between 1dn and 2dn above 2dn and above 1dn respectively hence dt indicates all displaced cubes total displacement between each sea state the damage was not repaired so the damage ratio after each sea state is the cumulative damage 2 damage level only for irregular placement 3 s a e d n 2 3 relative damage number damage to concrete units can be described by the relative damage number no which is defined by the actual number of displaced units related to a width along the longitudinal axis of the breakwater of one nominal diameter dn the definition of no is comparable with the definition of s although s includes displacement and settlement it does not take into account the porosity of the armour layer in this study the damage number was found by counting the displaced units of one nominal diameter width in the reference area from the camera records 4 n o number of displaced units of one nominal diameter d n in reference area l d n where l is the width of the model structure excluded one nominal diameter from each side wall and dn is the nominal diameter of the cube table 1 provides an overview of the applied values of the most important parameters 3 results and discussion 3 1 structural responses of the irregular and regular placement on the lower slope and berm two different placement methods were tested for five different berm widths with three different berm levels hence fifteen different configurations were applied for each placement method the performance of each placement method was evaluated depending on the berm width and berm level the performance of the placement methods was expressed using the observed movements and displacements of the cubes to visualize the movements within the layer the digital overlay technique was used by a camera and video records were taken during the test photos were also taken after each test run when the water was tranquil again from exactly the same location as the camera was installed above the wave channel the positions of the cubes were compared using these digital photos by overlaying with the positions on the photo that was taken before the first test run the moving blocks in the layer were counted the blocks connected to the glass of the flume were not included to exclude potential wall effects other cubes that move because of the movement of these wall blocks were also not included in this way 3 different categories of movement are expressed in relation to the nominal diameter 0 0 0 5dn 0 5 1 0dn and 0 0 2 0dn are indicated with m1 m2 and mt respectively while displacements are represented with d1 d2 and dt in relation to 1dn 2dn above 2dn and above 1dn respectively frens et al 2008 3 1 1 irregular placement figs 6 and 7 show the percentage of movements m and damage ratio d in the lower slope for 5dn and 14dn berm widths respectively as examples of narrow and wide berms the movement ratio for the lower slope is already rather large under small wave actions and displacements are observed for higher waves in the case of the emerged berm when the stability of the blocks on the emerged berm and the lower slope are considered together the damage starts first on the lower slope around swl and later extends also to the berm for the case of the berm at swl the damage occurred first at the berm rather than at the lower slope the movement ratio is smaller for the submerged berm yet it rapidly increases under larger wave heights these findings indicate that the berm level is critical if the berm is exposed to direct wave attack damage can occur to the berm while if the berm is emerged and the transition between the lower slope and berm is less exposed to direct wave attack damage occurs first at the lower slope failure starts earlier at the transition between the lower slope and the berm when the berm is at the swl because waves directly act on this transition section and damage occurs both on the berm and on the lower slope on the other hand waves also act to the berm for the submerged berm therefore initial damage occurs on the berm the data of movements for this irregular placement method shows a lot of scatter especially for large movement ratios but the damage ratios show less scatter movements start at smaller waves than displacements and these movements increase the strength of the layer due to clamping between the units and initially unfavourably positioned cubes relocate to better positions so the displacements start at higher waves fig 6 a shows that the first block displaced during wave series of hm0 0 10 m on the lower slope while the block displaced at h m0 0 14 m from the emerged berm most of the displaced cubes stayed in the slope i e most movements and displacements occurred within the slope hence they still contributed somehow to the strength of the lower slope stability overtopping was not observed for the emerged berm in these experiments fig 6 b shows that displacements occurred at the same wave height of hm0 0 10 m for the berm and the lower slope and failure was observed rapidly at hm0 0 13 m for the berm at swl overtopping was also observed during the wave series of hm0 0 15 m for the configuration with a submerged berm b 5dn displacement started first on the berm at hm0 0 08 m while in the lower slope the first block displaced later at hm0 0 13 m fig 6 c in this case overtopping was observed earlier than for the other berm levels at hm0 0 08 m as the water level is higher although for some tests some overtopping occurred almost all wave energy was still concentrated on the front slope see also frens et al 2008 and the limited overtopping is considered not to have an effect on the stability similar movements and displacements were observed for the more narrow berms b 3dn and 4dn observations showed that most of the displaced units were still on the slope and they contributed to the lower slope stability for all cases overtopping started earlier for the narrower berm widths of b 3dn and 4dn although overtopping was not observed for the emerged berm width of b 4dn overtopping was observed for b 3dn also for the emerged berm as expected the berm width and level are effective parameters for reducing the overtopping fig 7 a shows that displacement started at hm0 0 14 m on the lower slope for b 14dn later the first displacement occurred at hm0 0 15 m on the berm for emerged berm case however failure was not observed for this case displacement for the berm at swl started earlier hm0 0 11 m than on the lower slope hm0 0 13 m where the failure occurred at hm0 0 17 m in this case the movement rate was less than the emerged berm case fig 7 b fig 7 c shows that a similar displacement rate for the submerged berm was observed as the berm at swl the first displacement occurred at hm0 0 12 m for the submerged berm and later displacement started at the wave series of hm0 0 14 on the lower slope failure was observed at h m0 0 18 m on the lower slope the results shown in fig 7 are representative for the other wide berm 10dn like in the narrow berm case most movements and displacements also occurred within the slope and they contributed to the strength of the lower slope however no overtopping was observed for the configurations with the emerged berm and the berm at swl yet there was still limited overtopping for h m0 0 18 m 3 1 2 regular placement figs 8 and 9 show the movement and displacement rates for the regular placement method the stability of the lower slope increased when the berm width increased for all berm levels however the stability of the berm affected the lower slope because of the transition between the berm and lower slope even though a closed transition was formed during the experiments to increase the stability yuksel et al 2018 once instability was experienced at the transition from the lower slope to the berm the stability of the lower slope was affected thereafter for the emerged berm the berm itself remained more stable than for the other berm level conditions and the berm was less affected than the lower slope because smaller waves were not effective on the berm for the emerged berm condition however the waves directly hit the lower slope hence there were a lot of movements on the lower slope for the emerged berm case much more than for the berm at swl and the submerged berm displacements occurred at the higher waves during the test because the layer on the lower slope gained stability with clamping of the blocks one another under the smaller wave effect for the emerged berm the initial damage started later than for the other berm levels however a chain reaction brittle failure occurred when the block displacement started for this placement method for the berm level at swl waves affected the berm and the transition primarily hence displacements initiated early thereafter the berm instability affected the lower slope stability the initiation of damage for the berm at swl started earlier than the other berm levels for the submerged berm the stability of the berm was affected more than the lower slope there were fewer movements than for the other berm levels while damage initiation started earlier than for the emerged berm because the lower slope was affected by the instability of the transition when the berm width increased initiation of the displacement delayed and the stability increased the double pyramid placement is a regular placement method therefore the displacement of one block causes a chain reaction however in our observations the displaced cubes mostly stayed on the slope and contributed to stability only a few cubes extracted from the slope during the tests mostly observed for the case of the emerged berm the transition between lower slope and berm mostly controls the lower slope stability especially for the submerged berm and the berm at swl conditions because the incident waves are in direct interaction with the transition region fig 8 is given for the narrow berm case b 5dn for emerged berm shown in fig 8 a movements started at the first wave series but displacements initiated much later at hs 0 17 m on the lower slope however displacement was not observed at the berm observations showed that all displaced blocks on the lower slope stayed on the slope although the movement ratio increased gradually with the increasing wave height the displacement ratio increased rapidly and caused a chain reaction the movement data with a regular placement shows much clearer trends less scattered data than the irregular placement the movements initiated at the beginning of the waves yet displacements on the lower slope started later at hs 0 13 m and failure occurred at hs 0 18 m for the case of the berm at swl fig 8 b the same wave series hs 0 13 m caused the first displacement at the berm only a few blocks displaced out of the slope to the toe for this case the movement for the case of the submerged berm on the lower slope was less than the emerged berm case yet the displacement initiated at hs 0 14 m which was earlier than the emerged berm case fig 8 c and the failure also occurred earlier at hs 0 15 m the initiation of the cube displacements at the berm started at the same wave series with the lower slope a few cube blocks displaced out of the slope to the toe for this case during failure fig 9 a shows that the displacement started later at hs 0 19 m for the emerged berm when the berm width is larger b 14dn failure did not occur on the lower slope during the tests there was no displacement at the berm as well fig 9 b shows the movement and displacement ratios for the case of the berm at swl for b 14dn the initiation of the displacement started at hs 0 16 m for both the lower slope and the berm the failure occurred at hs 0 19 m on the lower slope the first displacement started at hs 0 17 m on the lower slope while it was started at hs 0 14 m on the berm for the submerged berm case fig 9 c the movement ratio was less than 15 for this case however a chain reaction caused the failure after the initiation of the displacement observations showed that all displaced blocks on the lower layer stayed on the slope for b 14dn there was no overtopping for all berm levels for b 14dn however no overtopping was also observed for the emerged berm of b 5dn while it appeared at hs 0 16 m and hs 0 14 m for the berm at swl and at the submerged berm respectively which were similar to the irregular placement when the movement and displacement ratios for the regular placement were compared to the irregular placement regular placement was found to be more stable than the irregular placement this is because the regular placement gains additional stability due to clamping between the blocks 3 2 stability of irregular placements the stability of the lower slope and berm for double layer irregular placement of cube blocks were tested for the berm widths of b 3dn 4dn 5dn 10dn and 14dn at different levels of the berm from swl db relative to water depth at toe of the breakwater dtoe relative damage n0 and also damage level s were determined by using camera records and bed profile measurements respectively when the relative damage n0 is evaluated the submerged lower slope is found to be more stable than the other berm levels fig 10 except for b 3dn for all conditions the stability of the lower slope for the berm at swl is least than that for the other berm levels because the amount of water during the wave run down is reduced for configurations with a high berm fig 10 clearly shows that on average the stability improves for wider berms for all levels of the berm fig 10 continued in eq 1 given by van der meer 1988b initial damage and failure are defined by n0 0 5 and n0 2 respectively for conventional breakwaters in this study initial damage is defined using the stability number ns h s δ d n at which the displacement of cubes is initiated within one nominal diameter in the defined reference area stability numbers at the emerged berm the berm at swl and the submerged berm conditions were found to be as ns 1 43 1 25 and 1 25 respectively for b 3dn however ns 1 43 1 25 and 1 79 and ns 1 79 1 79 and 2 32 were obtained at the emerged berm the berm at swl and the submerged berm for b 4dn and 5dn respectively for the narrow berms in general relative damage indicated that the lower slope of submerged berms was slightly more stable than the other berm levels except for the berm width of b 3dn lower stability was observed at the berm at swl cases the results for wide berms b 10dn and 14dn showed that the stability numbers were calculated as ns 2 14 1 96 and 2 50 and ns 2 50 1 78 and 2 50 for the emerged berm the berm at swl and the submerged berm respectively similar responses for the wide berms were obtained as the narrow berms yet larger stability numbers were obtained for wide berms than those for the narrow berms for the irregular placement method the stability numbers for the initial damage except for the berm width of b 3dn which is less effective on the stability can be summarized as below ns 1 4 2 5 for the emerged berm ns 1 3 2 0 for the berm at swl ns 1 8 2 5 for the submerged berm figs 11 13 present the stability number ns versus relative damage n0 for each berm level and berm width the figures clearly show that the berm width has a significant influence on the lower slope stability the stability number increases with increasing berm width the stability of wide berms deviates significantly from the narrow berms while the curves representing the narrow berm stabilities are located close to each other the presented experimental results are also shown in fig 14 which shows the relative damage number n0 and the stability number ns together with the results calculated by the formula by van der meer 1988b for conventional cube breakwaters without a berm for breakwaters with a berm the reduction in relative damage on the lower slope depends on the level of the berm and the width of the berm as shown in fig 14 for the breakwaters with submerged berms there is a slight reduction in the relative damage on the lower slope for the breakwaters with narrow berms compared to those with straight slopes while the reduction in the relative damage is more apparent for the breakwaters with wide berms fig 14 a this is expected to be caused by the influence of the berm on the wave run down for the breakwaters with submerged berms there is a clear reduction in the relative damage except for b 3dn fig 14 b the reduction in damage increases as the berm width increases for the narrow berms with a width of 3 or 4 diameters at swl there is no reduction in damage compared to the expression for straight slopes without a berm for all other berm widths and all other berm levels there is a clear increase in the stability compared to a straight slope without a berm to show the variation of damage level s against stability number ns figs 15 17 were drawn for the emerged berm the berm at swl and the submerged berm respectively the evaluation of damage level s indicated that the emerged berm is more stable and berm at swl is less stable than the other berm levels while the submerged berm was found to be more stable than other berm levels in terms of relative damage n0 because the measured damage levels s include also damage of the berm itself and often the damage occurs at the transition from the lower slope to the berm a clear distinction between the damage at the lower slope and damage at the berm cannot be made van gent 2013 damage to the lower slope was observed mostly around the transition from the lower slope to the berm especially for the berm at swl moreover the initial displacement started earlier in the emerged berm than the submerged berm the experiments show that the stability of the lower slope depends mainly on the relative berm level db d and berm width b for narrow berm widths 3dn 4dn and 5dn when the berm was emerged initiation of instability s 2 and n0 0 5 was at ns 2 while it was at 1 25 ns 2 0 for the berm at swl and for the submerged berm yet the stability number of ns 2 5 was obtained for all wide berm levels 10dn and 14dn the berm recession rec of the models has been measured and analyzed as shown in figs 18 20 the idea of the berm recession in here is that the cube from second layer can be displaced on the berm however the berm still keep their geometry it appears that the recession of the berm depends on the amount of damage and the level of the berm db the amount of damage is more significant for the berm at swl because wave loads directly affect the transition region however the lowest recession is observed for the emerged berm case for which the effect of the waves on the berm is relatively limited 3 3 stability of regular placement the relative damage n0 for the regular placement method is calculated based on the largest stability number ns with no displacement relative damage against the stability number was given in figs 11 13 for three different berm levels together with five different berm widths these figures also include n0 ns curves for irregular placement in order to compare the stabilities as can be understood from these figures the regular placement method leads to a more stable armour layer than the irregular placement method yet a chain reaction more brittle failure occurred after the initial damage steeper stability curves hence it has been observed that transition from the initial damage to failure occurs with a small increase in wave height similar to the behavior of concrete blocks placed in a single armour layer the initiation of damage is followed by displacements at the second layer of cubes and then the underlayer becomes exposed failure for the emerged berms although the initial displacement started later than the other berm levels damage suddenly increased and failure was reached more quickly this result is different than for the irregular placement method for this regular placement the transition from the lower slope to the berm is very sensitive to direct wave loads for the berm at swl and for the submerged berm and therefore damage starts earlier than for the emerged berm case when the first block around swl is displaced for the emerged berm regular placement exhibits more strength than irregular placement in terms of initiation of the block displacement for the regular placement method the stability numbers just before displacement except b 3dn where the berm width is less effective on the stability were found to be as follows n s 2 9 3 4 for the emerged berm n s 1 8 2 5 for the berm at swl n s 2 1 2 7 for the submerged berm these values are significantly larger than for the irregular placement method again the damage occurs earlier for the structure with a berm at swl than for a structure with an emerged or submerged berm again the values depend on the width of the berm with wider berms leading to a higher strength of the armour layer figs 11 13 also show that stability number increases as the berm width increases the berm level and width were found to be effective on the stability of the lower slope and berm regular placement double pyramid method increases the stability for all berm levels compared to irregular placement no recession was observed at the emerged berms for b 5dn berm recession started later in the models with regular placement compared to irregular placement for all the berm levels and berm widths tested figs 18 20 the stability of the lower slope of a berm breakwater with a regular double pyramid placement method was found to be much more stable than conventional breakwaters with irregularly placed double layer this finding can also be observed in comparisons with the prediction formula of van der meer 1988b for straight slope as shown in fig 21 3 4 stability coefficients kd different stability coefficients are defined for different placements the hudson stability coefficient kdh is based on the significant wave height were the first displacements appear within a damage ratio of 0 5 if this first damage exceeds the damage ratio of 5 the significant wave height from the preceding wave series is applied to calculate the kdh value for regular placement methods a different damage level is required because it results in a chain reaction the significant wave height before the wave series at which the first displacement appears is applied for calculation of the stability parameter kd0 for regular placement therefore a damage ratio of 0 is required before the first displacement to compare the irregular and regular placement methods another stability coefficient is defined kd 5 in the tests with the irregular placement method it was observed that shortly after the initial damage there is a slightly higher wave condition where the damage ratio suddenly increases and exceeds 5 therefore the kd value is calculated with the significant wave height where the damage ratio was still below 5 kd 5 the stability coefficient kd can be calculated as a function of ns and the lower slope angle cot α as shown below 5 k d n s 3 cot α the calculated stability coefficients are summarized in table 2 for irregular placement the lowest stability coefficients were found for the berm width of b 3dn as berm width increased the stability coefficients increased similar calculations were carried out to find the stability coefficients for regular placement table 3 the coefficients were found to be larger than those of the irregular placement this result also shows that the regular placement on the lower slope is more stable than the irregular placement these stability coefficients increase with increasing berm width similar to the irregular placement the stability coefficients in the lower slope with regular placement may be represented as following for b 4dn k d0 15 6 for the emerged berm k d0 3 8 for the berm at swl k d0 8 3 for the submerged berm 3 5 prediction method for the lower slope stability 3 5 1 irregular placement based on the physical model tests prediction methods were derived for the stability of the lower slope here empirical formulae are described to determine the required cube size at the lower slope for the emerged the berm at swl and the submerged berms in order to account for the influence of the berm on the lower slope with cubes the parameters that are considered here are the width of the berm the position of the berm and the wave steepness then a reduction in cube size is recommended with the calibrated expressions for each berm position this reduction factor γ b e r m due to the berm can be applied in combination with eq 1 and the equation becomes 6 n s 6 7 n 0 γ berm 0 4 n 0 3 1 s m 1 0 0 1 for emerged berms the reduction in relative damage n0 for the lower slope was found to be dependent on the level of the berm position db hs the width of the berm b hs and wave steepness sm 1 0 the calibrated reduction expression for emerged berms reads 7 γ b e r m 1 0 07 b h s 1 c 1 s m 1 0 c 3 d b h s c 2 f o r d b 0 where c1 0 5 c2 0 5 and c3 0 5 with 0 γberm 1 0 for submerged berms the reduction in relative damage n0 to the lower slope depends on the level of the berm position db hs and the width of the berm b hs no clear influence of the wave steepness was observed for submerged berms sm 1 0 the calibrated reduction expression for submerged berms is presented below 8 γ b e r m 1 0 07 b h s 1 c 1 d b h s c 2 f o r d b

steepness sm 1 0 was observed for the berm at swl similar to the submerged berm the calibrated reduction expression for the berm at swl may be written as follows 9 γ berm 1 0 07 b h s for d b 0 fig 22 shows the measurements compared to the predicted stability numbers obtained from eq 6 good agreements between the measured and calculated stability parameters were obtained for all the berm levels and widths in fig 22 the data for berm at swl show more scatter compared to those for the submerged and emerged berms due to interactions of waves with the transition between the berm and the lower slope fig 22 3 5 2 regular placement although regular placement increases the stability for all berm levels compared to irregular placement damage suddenly increased and brittle failure was reached more quickly as it is presented in section 3 3 the stability numbers are in a narrow range or can be seen as almost constant see table 4 no clear influence of the wave steepness was observed for all berm levels for design purposes it is recommended to use the smaller values of the each given range for the narrow berms b 5 d n and the larger values for wider berms b 5 d n 3 6 recession of the berm in this study the cube at the berm was the same as the cube at the lower slope damage occurs at the seaward side of the berm for both placement methods the horizontal distance between the seaward side of the berm and the position where no damage occurs is referred to as the recession of the berm rec 3 6 1 irregular placement the amount of recession at the berm depends on the level of the berm db and the width of the berm b the recession is smaller for the emerged berms than the other berm levels if the berm is at swl the recession is greater than the case of the submerged and emerged berm levels due to its direct interaction with the waves the following expression has been derived for the recession 10 r e c d n γ r e c n 0 1 8 1 15 where γ r e c is a factor which depends on the berm level and width for the emerged berm d b h s 0 and the submerged berm d b h s 0 11 γ rec d b h s b h s 0 5 and for the berm at swl with d b h s 0 12 γ rec b h s 0 5 fig 23 shows that the accuracy of eqs 10 12 are relatively low which is similar to as discussed by van gent 2013 for rock armour the rms error is between 0 5 and 0 8 between measured and predicted values 3 6 2 regular placement figs 18 20 show that the berm stability is higher for the regular placement method than for the irregular placement stability at the berm depends on the berm level and width the recession of the berm for the emerged berm condition is always less than that for the other berm levels experiments showed no recession for b 5dn for the emerged berm while recession starts at ns 2 86 for b 5dn and displacement at the berm occurs after the displacement on the lower slope begins the recession of the berm at swl is significant although the recession decreases with increasing berm width the recession starts at ns 2 3 for a berm width wider than 3dn a berm width of b 3dn is not advised since those armour layers are always less stable than the other berm widths 4 conclusions in this study the stability of cubes in the lower slope and berm of a rubble mound breakwater with a berm was studied irregular and regular placement patterns were investigated with special attention to the units at the transition from the lower slope to the berm the upper slope was armoured with rock and this part of the structure was fixed with a wire mesh in the tests slope angles were 1 2 and 1 1 5 for the upper and lower slopes respectively three different berm levels and five different berm widths were tested the packing density of the cube armour layer was 59 for both irregular and regular placements i e the same amount of units was used for each placement pattern the tests have led to the following conclusions 4 1 irregular placement the stability of cubes in the lower slope and berm depends on the level of the berm and the width of the berm the stability in the lower slope also slightly depends on the wave steepness for the structures with an emerged berm the damage starts first in the lower slope around swl for the structures with a submerged berm and for structures with a berm at swl the damage occurs first at the transition between the lower slope and the berm rather than at the lower slope for wider berms the damage reduces significantly it is advised not to apply a berm width smaller than 4 cube diameters the largest damage was found for a berm at swl damage starts at stability numbers between 1 3 and 2 0 depending on the width of the berm a stability expression was derived to account for the reducing effects of a berm including the effects of the berm width and the level of the berm 4 2 regular placement the stability in the lower slope and berm increases as the berm level and berm width increase regular placement is more stable than irregular placement but a chain reaction in damage is observed brittle behavior after the initial damage for the regular placement no apparent influence of the wave steepness is observed for the regular placement patterns for wider berms the damage reduces significantly it is advised not to apply a berm width smaller than 4 cube diameters the largest damage was found for a berm at swl damage starts at stability numbers between 1 8 and 2 5 depending on the width of the berm a stability expression is not derived because the stability numbers are in a narrow range or almost constant such that a design can be based on the stability number the transition between the lower slope and the berm is very sensitive in terms of damage it is advised to apply the placement pattern at the transition as applied in the present tests nevertheless if the berm level is at swl the displacement starts earlier than for other berm levels the initiation of the cube displacement in the lower slope starts later for the emerged berm level than the other berm levels but the stability suddenly decreases and failure is reached more quickly for the emerged berm this behavior is different from the irregular placement because the movements of the cubes exposed to smaller waves increase the clamping strength of the units between the adjacent blocks the initiation of the recession starts later for the regular placement than for the irregular placement no recession is observed for the emerged berms with b 5dn a prediction method is given to estimate the stability for the lower slope with two layer cubes in section 3 5 the limitations for the design condition are given in table 1 4 3 recommendations the cube is the simplest concrete block as an armour unit the behavior of the cube unit depends on the geometry of the front slope porosity and placement techniques etc but not on so called interlocking other concrete units such as the tetrapod and the accropode have interlocking capability it is recommended to study the performance of the other concrete armour units on the lower slope and berm of rubble mound breakwaters with a berm in addition it is recommended to study the influence of the berm level for various water depths shallow

21433,a synchronized path following control scheme for a cluster of networked unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs suffering from unknown dynamics and unknown sideslip angles is proposed in this paper on the basis of uuv kinematics model the unknown sideslip angles are successfully identified using finite time observers thereby ensuring high accurate path following performance by virtue of individual path following and consensus information the coordinated light of sight guidance and the path update protocol are employed respectively which provide sufficient technology support for desired formation pattern simultaneously an adaptive approximation is incorporated into the distributed dynamics controllers where the lumped unknowns involving modeling uncertainties and time varying ocean currents are estimated accurately thereby enhancing the formation system anti disturbance performance it is proven that with the proposed scheme all vehicles can track the multiple parametric paths synchronously and the entire closed loop system is globally asymptotically stable finally simulation results for coordinated path following of four underactuated uuvs are exhibited and discussed keywords unknown sideslip coordinated light of sight guidance adaptive approximation synchronized path following control unmanned underwater vehicles 1 introduction recent advances in nonlinear control theory and multi agent system have sparked in interest in coordinated control of multiple vehicles air ground and marine viel et al 2019 feng and zheng 2019 polvara et al 2019 apparently the coordinated system can stimulate single vehicle to collaborate with neighbors to perform the whole mission thereby providing high efficiency and effectiveness fan et al 2019 in marine applications both unmanned surface vehicles usvs and unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs perform an extremely important role liu et al 2016a wang and yao 2018 such as marine replenishment joint search and rescue underwater pipeline inspection etc in this context coordinated path following control where a cluster of marine vehicles track parametric paths without collision has become a crucial issue wynn et al 2014 to be specific unmanned guidance and coordinated control are taken into account for the coordinated path following control for the former intuitively it is used to mimic an experienced sailor whereby vehicles are guided to the predefined targets or the predetermined trajectories based on varieties of perception information wang and pan 2019 qu et al 2020 from a detailed review of literature fossen et al 2015 oh and sun 2010 liu et al 2016b the look ahead based light of sight los has been widely proven effective as a guidance method for both straight line paths and curved paths besides by the aid of integral technology borhaug et al 2008 or proportional technology fossen and pettersen 2014 the los guidance can be successfully extended to resist external disturbances however it should be highlighted that the external disturbances in borhaug et al 2008 fossen and pettersen 2014 are assumed as constants or slow time varying thereby causing environment constraints in the path following control process in addition to the los guidance the surge heading guidance and the dynamic virtual ship guidance are proposed in wang et al 2019a and zhang and zhang 2015 respectively note that uuvs or usvs invariably suffer from variations in sway direction wang and su 2019 thereby resulting in a nonzero sideslip angle the sideslip angle would enlarge tracking errors and even degrade the controller performance to tackle the vehicle sideslip and compensate for its influence the straightforward approach is to measure by utilizing accelerometer and other sensors however measuring sideslip angle represents a disproportionate cost and the equipment may not provide sufficient accuracy stephant et al 2007 lekkas and fossen 2014 based on the practical considerations in fossen et al 2015 an adaptive integral los guidance is designed for path following control system where sideslip angle is treated as an unknown constant parameter in liu et al 2017 the unknown sideslip angle is identified by a reduced order extended state observer it is a pity that the vehicle sideslip in fossen et al 2015 liu et al 2017 has to be taken as a smaller or slow time varying parameter to relax this assumption a large sideslip observer with finite time stability is proposed in wang et al 2018 where the time varying large sideslip angle can be accurately estimated however this sideslip observer is susceptible to the path following error dynamics additionally the accurate knowledge of tracking errors vehicle velocities and predefined paths must be simultaneously available thus increasing computational complexity within coordinated control community fruitful approaches have been applied to coordinated path following of multiple uuvs in xiang et al 2012 a decentralized speed synchronization strategy is proposed for a cluster of uuvs under communication topology constraints where path parameters are synchronized using graph theory in chen and wei 2014 a consensus based adaptive control scheme is developed for multiple vehicles with an undirected communication topology thereby relaxing the assumption in xiang et al 2012 that each vehicle must obtain the reference signal however the predetermined trajectories are defined as a group of convex and closed curves thus causing limitations in some practical cases on the other hand uuvs sailing in the ocean invariably suffer from sensor limitations and network constraints thereby causing great difficulties in global information exchanges alternatively the distributed control scheme has been widely developed where the global objective can be achieved via neighbor to neighbor information exchanges ghabcheloo et al 2006 peng et al 2013 it is worth mentioning that the dynamics of uuvs or usvs possesses modeling uncertainties and external disturbances in this context fruitful nonlinear control or approximation approaches i e finite time qin et al 2019a 2019b wang and deng 2020 neural network gao et al 2017 yoo and kim 2015 and fuzzy logic wang et al 2019b 2019c 2019d have been explored and proposed it is worth mentioning that prior researches mostly focus on the path following control along one geometric path thus limiting the practical applications of uuvs especially in multiple pipeline detecting and region searching motivated by the aspects mentioned above this paper investigates the synchronized path following control problem for a cluster of networked uuvs along multiple parametric paths to be specific the solution to the synchronized control problem contains two sub problems one is to make each uuv track the predefined path regardless of unknown dynamics and unknown sideslip angle another is to coordinate the motion such that multiple uuvs track the predefined paths with a desired formation pattern main contributions are highlighted as follows 1 on the basis of uuv kinematics an improved finite time observer is proposed for vehicle sideslip compensation compared with the previous studies in fossen et al 2015 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the developed sideslip observer is simplified and more suitable for underactuated uuvs cruising in complex marine environment 2 the sideslip observer based coordinated los clos guidance is proposed for a cluster of uuvs along multiple parametric paths and the neighbor information based path update protocol is designed for achieving vehicle synchronization 3 to effectively compensate the lumped unknowns consisting of modeling uncertainties and time varying ocean currents adaptive approximation based surge and yaw controllers are developed whereby uuvs can track the desired signals generated by the clos guidance besides an entire synchronized path following control scheme is proposed with globally asymptotically stability the present paper is arranged as follows some necessary preliminaries related to finite time stability and graph theory are given in section 2 and problem is stated in section 3 the proposed sideslip observer is employed in section 4 and the synchronized control scheme is designed in section 5 stability analysis and simulation results are provided in section 6 and section 7 respectively finally the conclusion ends this paper 2 preliminaries 2 1 finite time stability consider the system of differential equations as follows x t f x t x 0 0 f 0 0 x u 0 r m where x x 0 x m t and f u 0 r m is continuous on an open neighborhood u 0 of the origin lemma 1 shtessel et al 2007 if the system x t f x t can be written as the following differential inclusion 1 x 0 z 0 x 1 z 0 μ 0 l 1 m 1 x 0 m m 1 sgn x 0 x 1 z 1 x 2 z 1 μ 1 l 1 m x 1 x 0 m 1 m sgn x 1 x 0 x m 1 z m 1 x m z m 1 μ m 1 l 1 2 x m 1 x m 2 1 2 sgn x m 1 x m 2 x m z m l l z m μ m l sgn x m x m 1 with μ l l being positive constants and l 0 1 m then the origin of system 1 is finite time stable remark 1 lemma 1 is obtained as a consequence of shtessel et al 2007 and it is widely used in nonlinear observer design such as the sideslip observer wang et al 2018 and the velocity observer qu et al 2020 2 2 graph theory the graph theory can be conveniently used to model information exchange among uuvs let g υ ε be an undirected graph of order n with a finite set of nodes υ n 1 n n and a finite set of edges ε n i n j υ υ note that a node corresponds to a uuv and the element n i n j represents the communication from one node to another the adjacency matrix a a i j r n n is denoted with nonnegative adjacency elements a i j in which a i j 1 if and only if n i n j ε otherwise a i j 0 then the laplacian matrix l l i j r n n of this graph can be denoted as l d a where d is the diagonal in degree matrix defined by 2 d d 1 0 0 0 d 2 0 0 0 d n with d i j 1 n a i j within an undirected graph l is symmetric positive semi definite and satisfies 3 l i j 0 i j j 1 n l i j 0 i 1 n accordingly a key lemma can be summarized as follows lemma 2 hou et al 2009 consider a undirected graph g and a positive definite matrix p then by defining c c i r n 1 d e d e i r n 1 and d e i j 1 n a i j d i d j one has c t lc d e t p d e 3 problem statement 3 1 uuv model as depicted in fig 1 let u i v i and r i be the surge sway and yaw velocities of uuv in the kinetic coordinate system respectively let x i y i be the uuv displacements and ψ i be the heading angle in the geodetic coordinate system consider a cluster of networked uuvs and each uuv in the horizontal plane has the following kinematic equations fossen 2011 4 x i u i cos ψ i v i sin ψ i y i u i sin ψ i v i cos ψ i ψ i r i to decrease the computational complexity and facilitate the path following control design the uuv dynamics is simplified into three degrees of freedom model appropriately fossen 2011 in this context the dynamic equations of uuv with modeling uncertainties and ocean currents can be described by 5 m u i δ m u i u i m v i δ m v i v i r i d u i δ d u i u i τ u i δ u i m v i δ m v i v i m u i δ m u i u i r i d v i δ d v i v i δ v i m r i δ m r i r i m v i δ m v i m u i δ m u i u i v i d r i δ d r i r i τ r i δ r i where m u i m v i m r i d u i d v i and d r i are uuv parameters added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients modeling uncertainties δ m u i δ m v i δ m r i δ d u i δ d v i and δ d r i are unknown but locate in a known compact set control inputs are surge forces τ u i and yaw moments τ r i δ u i δ v i and δ r i denote the time varying ocean currents acting on uuvs to facilitate the estimation for both modeling uncertainties and ocean currents the dynamic eq 5 can be transformed into 6 u i f u i u i v i r i τ u i m u i g u i u i v i r i v i f v i u i v i r i g v i u i v i r i r i f r i u i v i r i τ r i m r i g r i u i v i r i where f u i u i v i r i m v i v i r i m u i d u i u i m u i f v i u i v i r i m u i u i r i m v i d v i v i m v i f r i u i v i r i m u i m v i u i v i m r i d r i r i m r i the lumped unknowns g i u v r involving modeling uncertainties and ocean currents are govern by 7 g u i 1 m u i δ m u i u i δ m v i v i r i δ d u i u i δ u i g v i 1 m v i δ m v i v i δ m u i u i r i δ d v i v i δ v i g r i 1 m r i δ m r i r i δ m u i δ m v i u i v i δ d r i r i δ r i before going on some assumptions are required for solving the synchronized path following control problem assumption 1 in 6 the lumped unknowns g i are bounded and differentiable i e g i g i with a known bound g i assumption 2 time delay from message transmission to receipt is not considered when information exchanges among uuvs through network 3 2 problem formulation consider a set of geometric curved paths shown in fig 1 and then a path tangent frame ptf can be defined at any point x p i ϖ i y p i ϖ i along one path where ϖ i is a parametric variable without temporal constraints the ptf is rotated with the angle α p i atan 2 y p i ϖ i x p i ϖ i relative to the geodetic coordinate system where x p i ϖ i x p i ϖ i and y p i ϖ i y p i ϖ i for the ith uuv at the point x i y i the along track error x e i and the cross track error y e i are used to describe the discrepancies between x p i ϖ i y p i ϖ i and x i y i in the ptf hence 8 x e i y e i cos α p i sin α p i sin α p i cos α p i t x i x p i ϖ i y i y p i ϖ i expanding 8 and computing the time derivative of it along 4 there is 9 x e i u i cos ψ i α p i u i sin ψ i α p i tan β i y e i α p i v p i ϖ i y e i u i sin ψ i α p i u i cos ψ i α p i tan β i x e i α p i where v p i x p i 2 y p i 2 and β i atan 2 v i u i is the sideslip angle on this background the control objective of synchronized path following is depicted as follows consider a cluster of networked uuvs given by 4 and 6 design a synchronized control scheme for multiple uuvs by utilizing the local states and neighbor states such that vehicles constitute a desired formation pattern along a set of geometric paths to be specific the objective can be described as 10 lim t x e i 0 lim t y e i 0 and 11 lim t ϖ i ϖ j 0 where i 1 n j 1 n and i j remark 2 it should be highlight that the sideslip angle β i in practical engineering is usually unknown and there is no actuation in the sway dynamics which may well result in large tracking errors the solution to unknown sideslip angle is specified in the next section 4 finite time sideslip observer to tackle the vehicle sideslip compensation an improved finite time sideslip observer ftso is developed in this section in the preceding of designing the ftso the surge kinematics i e the first equation in 4 can be rewritten as 12 x i u i cos ψ i o i u i ψ i β i where o i u i ψ i β i u i sin ψ i tan β i by noticing that the nonlinear term o i u i ψ i β i is differentiable one has o i u i ψ i β i v i sin ψ i v i r i cos ψ i f v i g v i sin ψ i v i r i cos ψ i for uuvs sailing in the ocean the velocities u i v i r i and the heading angle ψ i are all bounded due to the actuator constraints which indicates that o i is bounded thus it can be assumed o i o i with a bounded constant o i by the aid of kinematics 12 the sideslip observer with finite time stability is constructed as 13 x ˆ i u i cos ψ i z i z i λ 1 i l i 1 2 x ˆ i x i 1 2 sgn x ˆ i x i o ˆ i o ˆ i λ 2 i l i sgn o ˆ i z i where λ 1 i 0 λ 2 i 0 and l i 0 are observer gains x ˆ i o ˆ i are the estimations for x i o i respectively the following theorem presents the stability of 13 theorem 1 applying the ftso 13 to path following control of uuvs suffering from unknown sideslip angles the nonlinear term o i u i ψ i β i related to sideslip can be accurately observed within a finite time proof to verity the ftso convergence observation errors e 1 i x ˆ i x i and e 2 i o ˆ i o i are defined besides the time derivative of observation errors along 13 can be calculated as 14 e 1 i u i cos ψ i z i x i λ 1 i l i 1 2 x ˆ i x i 1 2 sgn x ˆ i x i o ˆ i o i λ 1 i l i 1 2 e 1 i 1 2 sgn e 1 i e 2 i and 15 e 2 i λ 2 i l i sgn o ˆ i z i o i λ 2 i l i sgn λ 1 i l i 1 2 e 1 i 1 2 sgn e 1 i o i λ 2 i l i sgn e 2 i e 1 i o i o i by virtue of lemma 1 and the differential inclusions 14 15 errors e 1 i and e 2 i converge to zero within a finite time i e x ˆ i x i o ˆ i o i it implies that the sideslip angle can be estimated accurately therefore theorem 1 holds remark 3 one benefit of the proposed ftso is that the sideslip need not be regarded as a small constant i e sin β i β i cos β i 1 fossen et al 2015 liu et al 2016c thus ensuring the tracking accuracy of uuvs besides it provides a good solution to the unknown sideslip angle and the unknown attack angle for uuvs moving in three dimensions liang et al 2018 by virtue of the uuv kinematics and lemma 1 the finite time observer can be developed for estimating the sideslip angle and the attack angle simultaneously the interested readers can investigate the three dimensional observation by following the above procedures remark 4 from 13 we know that composite term o ˆ i is a function related to x i u i and ψ i once o i is derived the vehicle sideslip β i can be determined uniquely compared with the sideslip observer in wang et al 2018 where observer depends on the path following error dynamics the proposed ftso tries to estimate the vehicle sideslip based on the kinematics thus reducing computational complexity 5 synchronized control scheme in this section a synchronized path following control scheme is proposed for a cluster of networked uuvs which includes the clos guidance the path synchronization and the dynamics controller the entire synchronized control scheme is deployed by the following three steps step 1 clos guidance design by the definition of ψ e i ψ i ψ d i and ϖ i v r ζ i where ψ d i is the desired heading angle v r is a reference dynamic velocity and ζ i is an intermediate control variable with respect to path synchronization the error dynamics 9 can be formulated as 16 x e i u i cos ψ i α p i u i sin ψ i α p i tan β ˆ i y e i α p i v p i v r ζ i y e i u i sin ψ i α p i u i cos ψ i α p i tan β ˆ i x e i α p i and ψ e i r i ψ d i where β ˆ i is govern by the ftso and theorem 1 using the fact u i cos ψ i α p i 2 u i cos 2 ψ i α p i 2 u i 16 can be rewritten as follows 17 x e i 2 u i cos 2 ψ i α p i 2 u i u i sin ψ i α p i tan β ˆ i y e i ψ d i v p i v r ζ i y e i u i sin ψ d i α p i β ˆ i u i χ i x e i α p i where u i u i 2 v i 2 and χ i sin ψ i ψ d i β ˆ i sin ψ d i α p i β ˆ i the clos guidance laws are designed as 18 u d i k 1 i x e i v p i v r 2 u i cos 2 ψ i α p i 2 u i sin ψ i α p i tan β ˆ i r d i k 2 i ψ e i y e i u i χ i ψ e i ψ d i with ψ d i α p i arctan y e i δ i β ˆ i where k 1 i 0 and k 2 i 0 are guidance parameters and δ i 0 is the look ahead distance remark 5 within the clos guidance design the guidance signals u d i and r d i for the ith vehicle are able to collaboratively adapt to tracking errors where the heading angle ψ d i is produced by the los approach fossen et al 2015 by noting that ψ e i ψ i ψ d i ψ i α p i β ˆ i ψ d i α p i β ˆ i one has lim ψ e i 0 χ i ψ e i lim ψ e i 0 sin ψ e i cos ψ d i α p i β ˆ i ψ e i cos ψ d i α p i β ˆ i making use of 19 sin arctan y e i δ i y e i y e i 2 δ i 2 and substituting 18 into 16 there are 20 x e i k 1 i x e i v p i ζ i y e i α p i y e i u i y e i y e i 2 δ i 2 u i χ i x e i α p i and 21 ψ e i k 2 i ψ e i y e i u i χ i ψ e i step 2 path parameter synchronization under assumption 2 information exchanges among uuvs can be described using the graph g υ ε to maintain a desired formation pattern a consensus based path update protocol is proposed as 22 ζ i ξ i v p i x e i ξ i ϖ e i ϖ e i j 1 n a i j ϖ i ϖ j where ξ i 0 and ϖ e i are path synchronization errors letting ϖ ϖ 1 ϖ n t ζ ζ 1 ζ n t v r v r v r t and ϖ e ϖ e 1 ϖ e n t we have 23 ϖ v r ζ ϖ e l ϖ since l 1 n 0 and ϖ i v r ζ i taking time derivative along ϖ e yields 24 ϖ e l v r ζ l ζ where 1 n denotes a column vector of n sizes then 20 21 and 24 can be invoked to conclude the entire path following error dynamics 25 x e i k 1 i x e i v p i ζ i y e i α p i y e i u i y e i y e i 2 δ i 2 u i χ i x e i α p i ψ e i k 2 i ψ e i y e i u i χ i ψ e i ϖ e l ζ step 3 dynamics controller design based on the practical considerations the accurate knowledge of g u i and g r i in dynamics 6 may not be available and thus additional compensation scheme should be developed let g ˆ u i and g ˆ r i denote the adaptive estimations for the lumped unknowns g u i and g r i respectively the adaptive approximation laws can be designed such that the lumped unknowns in 6 can be compensated the main results are summarized in theorem 2 theorem 2 under assumption 1 the adaptive approximation laws 26 g ˆ u i λ u i 0 t g ˆ u i m v i v i r i d u i u i m u i τ u i d σ λ u i u i g ˆ r i λ r i 0 t g ˆ r i m u i m v i u i v i d v i r i m r i τ r i d σ λ r i r i applied to the dynamics 6 with λ u i 0 and λ r i 0 make the estimation errors g u i g u i g ˆ u i and g r i g r i g ˆ r i uniformly ultimately bounded uub proof consider the following lyapunov function candidate 27 v g 1 2 g u i 2 g r i 2 computing the time derivative of v g along errors g u i and g r i yields 28 v g g u i g u i g ˆ u i g r i g r i g ˆ r i λ u i g u i g ˆ u i m v i v i r i d u i u i m u i τ u i u i λ r i g r i m u i m v i u i v i d 33 r i m r i τ r i g ˆ r i r i g u i g u i g r i g r i substituting the adaptive approximation laws 26 into 28 and using g i g i in assumption 2 result in 29 v g λ u i g u i 2 λ r i g r i 2 g u i g u i g r i g r i λ u i g u i 2 λ r i g r i 2 g u i g u i g r i g r i λ v δ ε i g i where λ min 2 λ u i 2 λ r i ε i g i are constants with arbitrarily small which implies v g 0 as v g γ and λ ε i g i γ therefore the observation errors g i are uub furthermore solving the inequality 29 renders 30 v δ 1 λ ε i g i 1 e λ t v δ 0 e λ t note that g i 2 2 v δ and g i can exponentially converge to the following compact set 31 ω i g i g i 2 ε i g i λ i as t for the construction of 31 one can conclude that observation errors can be made arbitrarily small when ε i λ i is arbitrarily small by choosing appropriate large λ i therefore theorem 2 holds in what follows the control inputs including surge forces τ u i and yaw moments τ r i are derived define the surge errors and the yaw errors as 32 u e i u i u d i r e i r i r d i where u d i and r d i are the guidance velocities govern by the clos guidance laws 18 in conjunction with 6 and 32 the surge and yaw tracking error dynamics can be expressed by 33 u e i f u i u i v i r i τ u i m u i g u i u i v i r i u d i and 34 r e i f r i u i v i r i τ r i m r i g r i u i v i r i r d i then the lyapunov based feedback control inputs can be derived from 33 and 34 which are 35 τ u i m u i k u i u e i u d i f u i u i v i r i g ˆ u i u i v i r i τ r i m r i k r i r e i r d i f r i u i v

using 26 thereby rendering g ˆ u i g u i g ˆ r i g r i as t in this context velocity error dynamics 33 and 34 can be further computed as u e i k u i u e i r e i k r i r e i respectively remark 7 aiming at the unknown nonlinearities the adaptive approximation can be replaced by utilizing other nonlinear approximation such as neural network liang et al 2019a 2020a fuzzy logic liang et al 2019b 2020b and similar results will be conducted without any difficulties 6 stability analysis in this section the stability analysis of the entire closed loop system is conducted through path following error dynamics main results are summarized as follows theorem 3 under assumptions 1 2 consider a cluster of uuvs with modeling uncertainties and ocean currents and the error dynamics govern by x e i y e i ψ e i u e i r e i ϖ e i then by setting positive gains λ i k 1 i k 2 i δ i ξ i k u i k r i the clos guidance 18 the path update protocol 22 and the adaptive dynamics controllers 35 render the origin of the error system globally asymptotically stable gas proof consider the following lyapunov function candidate 36 v 1 2 i 1 n x e i 2 y e i 2 ψ e i 2 u e i 2 r e i 2 1 2 ϖ e t p ϖ e by the aid of lemma 2 36 can be rewritten as 37 v 1 2 i 1 n x e i 2 y e i 2 ψ e i 2 u e i 2 r e i 2 1 2 ϖ t l ϖ whose time derivative is calculated as 38 v i 1 n x e i x e i y e i y e i ψ e i ψ e i u e i u e i r

13 the clos guidance 18 with 22 and the adaptive dynamics controller 35 with 26 is entirely illustrated in fig 2 worthy of mention is that each part of the scheme is independent and thus it can be modified and improved without influencing the entire scheme 7 simulation results in this section simulation studies are performed to verify the validity of the proposed synchronized path following control scheme consider the case where four underactuated uuvs called wl ii track a set of parametric paths under assumption 2 the communication topology is given by fig 3 correspondingly the laplacian matrix is given by l 1 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 1 1 the weight of wl ii is 45 kg and the length is 1 46 m and inertia parameters of uuv are given as the same as that of liang et al 2018

are present in figs 4 11 fig 4 represents the synchronized path following performance for four uuvs by virtue of the proposed control scheme uuvs track the desired multiple paths with a synchronized formation pattern regardless of unknown dynamics and unknown sideslip angles tracking errors involving along track errors and cross track errors are present in figs 5 and 6 respectively and path synchronization errors are present in fig 7 obviously tracking errors x e i y e i and path synchronization errors ϖ e i converge to a small neighborhood of the zero thereby verifying the availability of the proposed clos guidance 18 and the path update protocol 22 besides figs 5 and 6 exhibit the comparison results in terms of transient responses the proposed control scheme has faster convergence than the control scheme in wang et al 2013 fig 8 represents the uuv surge velocities and yaw rate velocities by the aid of the proposed ftso and theorem 1 unknown sideslip angel is accurately observed

formation pattern simultaneously an adaptive approximation is incorporated into the distributed dynamics controllers where the lumped unknowns involving modeling uncertainties and time varying ocean currents are estimated accurately thereby enhancing the formation system anti disturbance performance it is proven that with the proposed scheme all vehicles can track the multiple parametric paths synchronously and the entire closed loop system is globally asymptotically stable finally simulation results for coordinated path following of four underactuated uuvs are exhibited and discussed keywords unknown sideslip coordinated light of sight guidance adaptive approximation synchronized path following control unmanned underwater vehicles 1 introduction recent advances in nonlinear control theory and multi agent system have sparked in interest in coordinated control of multiple vehicles air ground and marine viel et al 2019 feng and zheng 2019 polvara et al 2019 apparently the coordinated system can stimulate single vehicle to collaborate with neighbors to perform the whole mission thereby providing high efficiency and effectiveness fan et al 2019 in marine applications both unmanned surface vehicles usvs and unmanned underwater vehicles uuvs perform an extremely important role liu et al 2016a wang and yao 2018 such as marine replenishment joint search and rescue underwater pipeline inspection etc in this context coordinated path following control where a cluster of marine vehicles track parametric paths without collision has become a crucial issue wynn et al 2014 to be specific unmanned guidance and coordinated control are taken into account for the coordinated path following control for the former intuitively it is used to mimic an experienced sailor whereby vehicles are guided to the predefined targets or the predetermined trajectories based on varieties of perception information wang and pan 2019 qu et al 2020 from a detailed review of literature fossen et al 2015 oh and sun 2010 liu et al 2016b the look ahead based light of sight los has been widely proven effective as a guidance method for both straight line paths and curved paths besides by the aid of integral technology borhaug et al 2008 or proportional technology fossen and pettersen 2014 the los guidance can be successfully extended to resist external disturbances however it should be highlighted that the external disturbances in borhaug et al 2008 fossen and pettersen 2014 are assumed as constants or slow time varying thereby causing environment constraints in the path following control process in addition to the los guidance the surge heading guidance and the dynamic virtual ship guidance are proposed in wang et al 2019a and zhang and zhang 2015 respectively note that uuvs or usvs invariably suffer from variations in sway direction wang and su 2019 thereby resulting in a nonzero sideslip angle the sideslip angle would enlarge tracking errors and even degrade the controller performance to tackle the vehicle sideslip and compensate for its influence the straightforward approach is to measure by utilizing accelerometer and other sensors however measuring sideslip angle represents a disproportionate cost and the equipment may not provide sufficient accuracy stephant et al 2007 lekkas and fossen 2014 based on the practical considerations in fossen et al 2015 an adaptive integral los guidance is designed for path following control system where sideslip angle is treated as an unknown constant parameter in liu et al 2017 the unknown sideslip angle is identified by a reduced order extended state observer it is a pity that the vehicle sideslip in fossen et al 2015 liu et al 2017 has to be taken as a smaller or slow time varying parameter to relax this assumption a large sideslip observer with finite time stability is proposed in wang et al 2018 where the time varying large sideslip angle can be accurately estimated however this sideslip observer is susceptible to the path following error dynamics additionally the accurate knowledge of tracking errors vehicle velocities and predefined paths must be simultaneously available thus increasing computational complexity within coordinated control community fruitful approaches have been applied to coordinated path following of multiple uuvs in xiang et al 2012 a decentralized speed synchronization strategy is proposed for a cluster of uuvs under communication topology constraints where path parameters are synchronized using graph theory in chen and wei 2014 a consensus based adaptive control scheme is developed for multiple vehicles with an undirected communication topology thereby relaxing the assumption in xiang et al 2012 that each vehicle must obtain the reference signal however the predetermined trajectories are defined as a group of convex and closed curves thus causing limitations in some practical cases on the other hand uuvs sailing in the ocean invariably suffer from sensor limitations and network constraints thereby causing great difficulties in global information exchanges alternatively the distributed control scheme has been widely developed where the global objective can be achieved via neighbor to neighbor information exchanges ghabcheloo et al 2006 peng et al 2013 it is worth mentioning that the dynamics of uuvs or usvs possesses modeling uncertainties and external disturbances in this context fruitful nonlinear control or approximation approaches i e finite time qin et al 2019a 2019b wang and deng 2020 neural network gao et al 2017 yoo and kim 2015 and fuzzy logic wang et al 2019b 2019c 2019d have been explored and proposed it is worth mentioning that prior researches mostly focus on the path following control along one geometric path thus limiting the practical applications of uuvs especially in multiple pipeline detecting and region searching motivated by the aspects mentioned above this paper investigates the synchronized path following control problem for a cluster of networked uuvs along multiple parametric paths to be specific the solution to the synchronized control problem contains two sub problems one is to make each uuv track the predefined path regardless of unknown dynamics and unknown sideslip angle another is to coordinate the motion such that multiple uuvs track the predefined paths with a desired formation pattern main contributions are highlighted as follows 1 on the basis of uuv kinematics an improved finite time observer is proposed for vehicle sideslip compensation compared with the previous studies in fossen et al 2015 liu et al 2017 wang et al 2018 the developed sideslip observer is simplified and more suitable for underactuated uuvs cruising in complex marine environment 2 the sideslip observer based coordinated los clos guidance is proposed for a cluster of uuvs along multiple parametric paths and the neighbor information based path update protocol is designed for achieving vehicle synchronization 3 to effectively compensate the lumped unknowns consisting of modeling uncertainties and time varying ocean currents adaptive approximation based surge and yaw controllers are developed whereby uuvs can track the desired signals generated by the clos guidance besides an entire synchronized path following control scheme is proposed with globally asymptotically stability the present paper is arranged as follows some necessary preliminaries related to finite time stability and graph theory are given in section 2 and problem is stated in section 3 the proposed sideslip observer is employed in section 4 and the synchronized control scheme is designed in section 5 stability analysis and simulation results are provided in section 6 and section 7 respectively finally the conclusion ends this paper 2 preliminaries 2 1 finite time stability consider the system of differential equations as follows x t f x t x 0 0 f 0 0 x u 0 r m where x x 0 x m t and f u 0 r m is continuous on an open neighborhood u 0 of the origin lemma 1 shtessel et al 2007 if the system x t f x t can be written as the following differential inclusion 1 x 0 z 0 x 1 z 0 μ 0 l 1 m 1 x 0 m m 1 sgn x 0 x 1 z 1 x 2 z 1 μ 1 l 1 m x 1 x 0 m 1 m sgn x 1 x 0 x m 1 z m 1 x m z m 1 μ m 1 l 1 2 x m 1 x m 2 1 2 sgn x m 1 x m 2 x m z m l l z m μ m l sgn x m x m 1 with μ l l being positive constants and l 0 1 m then the origin of system 1 is finite time stable remark 1 lemma 1 is obtained as a consequence of shtessel et al 2007 and it is widely used in nonlinear observer design such as the sideslip observer wang et al 2018 and the velocity observer qu et al 2020 2 2 graph theory the graph theory can be conveniently used to model information exchange among uuvs let g υ ε be an undirected graph of order n with a finite set of nodes υ n 1 n n and a finite set of edges ε n i n j υ υ note that a node corresponds to a uuv and the element n i n j represents the communication from one node to another the adjacency matrix a a i j r n n is denoted with nonnegative adjacency elements a i j in which a i j 1 if and only if n i n j ε otherwise a i j 0 then the laplacian matrix l l i j r n n of this graph can be denoted as l d a where d is the diagonal in degree matrix defined by 2 d d 1 0 0 0 d 2 0 0 0 d n with d i j 1 n a i j within an undirected graph l is symmetric positive semi definite and satisfies 3 l i j 0 i j j 1 n l i j 0 i 1 n accordingly a key lemma can be summarized as follows lemma 2 hou et al 2009 consider a undirected graph g and a positive definite matrix p then by defining c c i r n 1 d e d e i r n 1 and d e i j 1 n a i j d i d j one has c t lc d e t p d e 3 problem statement 3 1 uuv model as depicted in fig 1 let u i v i and r i be the surge sway and yaw velocities of uuv in the kinetic coordinate system respectively let x i y i be the uuv displacements and ψ i be the heading angle in the geodetic coordinate system consider a cluster of networked uuvs and each uuv in the horizontal plane has the following kinematic equations fossen 2011 4 x i u i cos ψ i v i sin ψ i y i u i sin ψ i v i cos ψ i ψ i r i to decrease the computational complexity and facilitate the path following control design the uuv dynamics is simplified into three degrees of freedom model appropriately fossen 2011 in this context the dynamic equations of uuv with modeling uncertainties and ocean currents can be described by 5 m u i δ m u i u i m v i δ m v i v i r i d u i δ d u i u i τ u i δ u i m v i δ m v i v i m u i δ m u i u i r i d v i δ d v i v i δ v i m r i δ m r i r i m v i δ m v i m u i δ m u i u i v i d r i δ d r i r i τ r i δ r i where m u i m v i m r i d u i d v i and d r i are uuv parameters added mass and hydrodynamic damping coefficients modeling uncertainties δ m u i δ m v i δ m r i δ d u i δ d v i and δ d r i are unknown but locate in a known compact set control inputs are surge forces τ u i and yaw moments τ r i δ u i δ v i and δ r i denote the time varying ocean currents acting on uuvs to facilitate the estimation for both modeling uncertainties and ocean currents the dynamic eq 5 can be transformed into 6 u i f u i u i v i r i τ u i m u i g u i u i v i r i v i f v i u i v i r i g v i u i v i r i r i f r i u i v i r i τ r i m r i g r i u i v i r i where f u i u i v i r i m v i v i r i m u i d u i u i m u i f v i u i v i r i m u i u i r i m v i d v i v i m v i f r i u i v i r i m u i m v i u i v i m r i d r i r i m r i the lumped unknowns g i u v r involving modeling uncertainties and ocean currents are govern by 7 g u i 1 m u i δ m u i u i δ m v i v i r i δ d u i u i δ u i g v i 1 m v i δ m v i v i δ m u i u i r i δ d v i v i δ v i g r i 1 m r i δ m r i r i δ m u i δ m v i u i v i δ d r i r i δ r i before going on some assumptions are required for solving the synchronized path following control problem assumption 1 in 6 the lumped unknowns g i are bounded and differentiable i e g i g i with a known bound g i assumption 2 time delay from message transmission to receipt is not considered when information exchanges among uuvs through network 3 2 problem formulation consider a set of geometric curved paths shown in fig 1 and then a path tangent frame ptf can be defined at any point x p i ϖ i y p i ϖ i along one path where ϖ i is a parametric variable without temporal constraints the ptf is rotated with the angle α p i atan 2 y p i ϖ i x p i ϖ i relative to the geodetic coordinate system where x p i ϖ i x p i ϖ i and y p i ϖ i y p i ϖ i for the ith uuv at the point x i y i the along track error x e i and the cross track error y e i are used to describe the discrepancies between x p i ϖ i y p i ϖ i and x i y i in the ptf hence 8 x e i y e i cos α p i sin α p i sin α p i cos α p i t x i x p i ϖ i y i y p i ϖ i expanding 8 and computing the time derivative of it along 4 there is 9 x e i u i cos ψ i α p i u i sin ψ i α p i tan β i y e i α p i v p i ϖ i y e i u i sin ψ i α p i u i cos ψ i α p i tan β i x e i α p i where v p i x p i 2 y p i 2 and β i atan 2 v i u i is the sideslip angle on this background the control objective of synchronized path following is depicted as follows consider a cluster of networked uuvs given by 4 and 6 design a synchronized control scheme for multiple uuvs by utilizing the local states and neighbor states such that vehicles constitute a desired formation pattern along a set of geometric paths to be specific the objective can be described as 10 lim t x e i 0 lim t y e i 0 and 11 lim t ϖ i ϖ j 0 where i 1 n j 1 n and i j remark 2 it should be highlight that the sideslip angle β i in practical engineering is usually unknown and there is no actuation in the sway dynamics which may well result in large tracking errors the solution to unknown sideslip angle is specified in the next section 4 finite time sideslip observer to tackle the vehicle sideslip compensation an improved finite time sideslip observer ftso is developed in this section in the preceding of designing the ftso the surge kinematics i e the first equation in 4 can be rewritten as 12 x i u i cos ψ i o i u i ψ i β i where o i u i ψ i β i u i sin ψ i tan β i by noticing that the nonlinear term o i u i ψ i β i is differentiable one has o i u i ψ i β i v i sin ψ i v i r i cos ψ i f v i g v i sin ψ i v i r i cos ψ i for uuvs sailing in the ocean the velocities u i v i r i and the heading angle ψ i are all bounded due to the actuator constraints which indicates that o i is bounded thus it can be assumed o i o i with a bounded constant o i by the aid of kinematics 12 the sideslip observer with finite time stability is constructed as 13 x ˆ i u i cos ψ i z i z i λ 1 i l i 1 2 x ˆ i x i 1 2 sgn x ˆ i x i o ˆ i o ˆ i λ 2 i l i sgn o ˆ i z i where λ 1 i 0 λ 2 i 0 and l i 0 are observer gains x ˆ i o ˆ i are the estimations for x i o i respectively the following theorem presents the stability of 13 theorem 1 applying the ftso 13 to path following control of uuvs suffering from unknown sideslip angles the nonlinear term o i u i ψ i β i related to sideslip can be accurately observed within a finite time proof to verity the ftso convergence observation errors e 1 i x ˆ i x i and e 2 i o ˆ i o i are defined besides the time derivative of observation errors along 13 can be calculated as 14 e 1 i u i cos ψ i z i x i λ 1 i l i 1 2 x ˆ i x i 1 2 sgn x ˆ i x i o ˆ i o i λ 1 i l i 1 2 e 1 i 1 2 sgn e 1 i e 2 i and 15 e 2 i λ 2 i l i sgn o ˆ i z i o i λ 2 i l i sgn λ 1 i l i 1 2 e 1 i 1 2 sgn e 1 i o i λ 2 i l i sgn e 2 i e 1 i o i o i by virtue of lemma 1 and the differential inclusions 14 15 errors e 1 i and e 2 i converge to zero within a finite time i e x ˆ i x i o ˆ i o i it implies that the sideslip angle can be estimated accurately therefore theorem 1 holds remark 3 one benefit of the proposed ftso is that the sideslip need not be regarded as a small constant i e sin β i β i cos β i 1 fossen et al 2015 liu et al 2016c thus ensuring the tracking accuracy of uuvs besides it provides a good solution to the unknown sideslip angle and the unknown attack angle for uuvs moving in three dimensions liang et al 2018 by virtue of the uuv kinematics and lemma 1 the finite time observer can be developed for estimating the sideslip angle and the attack angle simultaneously the interested readers can investigate the three dimensional observation by following the above procedures remark 4 from 13 we know that composite term o ˆ i is a function related to x i u i and ψ i once o i is derived the vehicle sideslip β i can be determined uniquely compared with the sideslip observer in wang et al 2018 where observer depends on the path following error dynamics the proposed ftso tries to estimate the vehicle sideslip based on the kinematics thus reducing computational complexity 5 synchronized control scheme in this section a synchronized path following control scheme is proposed for a cluster of networked uuvs which includes the clos guidance the path synchronization and the dynamics controller the entire synchronized control scheme is deployed by the following three steps step 1 clos guidance design by the definition of ψ e i ψ i ψ d i and ϖ i v r ζ i where ψ d i is the desired heading angle v r is a reference dynamic velocity and ζ i is an intermediate control variable with respect to path synchronization the error dynamics 9 can be formulated as 16 x e i u i cos ψ i α p i u i sin ψ i α p i tan β ˆ i y e i α p i v p i v r ζ i y e i u i sin ψ i α p i u i cos ψ i α p i tan β ˆ i x e i α p i and ψ e i r i ψ d i where β ˆ i is govern by the ftso and theorem 1 using the fact u i cos ψ i α p i 2 u i cos 2 ψ i α p i 2 u i 16 can be rewritten as follows 17 x e i 2 u i cos 2 ψ i α p i 2 u i u i sin ψ i α p i tan β ˆ i y e i ψ d i v p i v r ζ i y e i u i sin ψ d i α p i β ˆ i u i χ i x e i α p i where u i u i 2 v i 2 and χ i sin ψ i ψ d i β ˆ i sin ψ d i α p i β ˆ i the clos guidance laws are designed as 18 u d i k 1 i x e i v p i v r 2 u i cos 2 ψ i α p i 2 u i sin ψ i α p i tan β ˆ i r d i k 2 i ψ e i y e i u i χ i ψ e i ψ d i with ψ d i α p i arctan y e i δ i β ˆ i where k 1 i 0 and k 2 i 0 are guidance parameters and δ i 0 is the look ahead distance remark 5 within the clos guidance design the guidance signals u d i and r d i for the ith vehicle are able to collaboratively adapt to tracking errors where the heading angle ψ d i is produced by the los approach fossen et al 2015 by noting that ψ e i ψ i ψ d i ψ i α p i β ˆ i ψ d i α p i β ˆ i one has lim ψ e i 0 χ i ψ e i lim ψ e i 0 sin ψ e i cos ψ d i α p i β ˆ i ψ e i cos ψ d i α p i β ˆ i making use of 19 sin arctan y e i δ i y e i y e i 2 δ i 2 and substituting 18 into 16 there are 20 x e i k 1 i x e i v p i ζ i y e i α p i y e i u i y e i y e i 2 δ i 2 u i χ i x e i α p i and 21 ψ e i k 2 i ψ e i y e i u i χ i ψ e i step 2 path parameter synchronization under assumption 2 information exchanges among uuvs can be described using the graph g υ ε to maintain a desired formation pattern a consensus based path update protocol is proposed as 22 ζ i ξ i v p i x e i ξ i ϖ e i ϖ e i j 1 n a i j ϖ i ϖ j where ξ i 0 and ϖ e i are path synchronization errors letting ϖ ϖ 1 ϖ n t ζ ζ 1 ζ n t v r v r v r t and ϖ e ϖ e 1 ϖ e n t we have 23 ϖ v r ζ ϖ e l ϖ since l 1 n 0 and ϖ i v r ζ i taking time derivative along ϖ e yields 24 ϖ e l v r ζ l ζ where 1 n denotes a column vector of n sizes then 20 21 and 24 can be invoked to conclude the entire path following error dynamics 25 x e i k 1 i x e i v p i ζ i y e i α p i y e i u i y e i y e i 2 δ i 2 u i χ i x e i α p i ψ e i k 2 i ψ e i y e i u i χ i ψ e i ϖ e l ζ step 3 dynamics controller design based on the practical considerations the accurate knowledge of g u i and g r i in dynamics 6 may not be available and thus additional compensation scheme should be developed let g ˆ u i and g ˆ r i denote the adaptive estimations for the lumped unknowns g u i and g r i respectively the adaptive approximation laws can be designed such that the lumped unknowns in 6 can be compensated the main results are summarized in theorem 2 theorem 2 under assumption 1 the adaptive approximation laws 26 g ˆ u i λ u i 0 t g ˆ u i m v i v i r i d u i u i m u i τ u i d σ λ u i u i g ˆ r i λ r i 0 t g ˆ r i m u i m v i u i v i d v i r i m r i τ r i d σ λ r

function candidate 27 v g 1 2 g u i 2 g r i 2 computing the time derivative of v g along errors g u i and g r i yields 28 v g g u i g u i g ˆ u i g r i g r i g ˆ r i λ u i g u i g ˆ u i m v i v i r i d u i u i m u i τ u i u i λ r i g r i m u i m v i u i v i d 33 r i m r i τ r i g ˆ r i r i g u i g u i g r i g r i substituting the adaptive approximation laws 26 into 28 and using g i g i in assumption 2 result in 29 v g λ u i g u i 2 λ r i g r i 2 g u i g u i g r i g r i λ u i g u i 2 λ r i g r i 2 g u i g u i g r i g r i λ v δ ε i g i where λ min 2 λ u i 2 λ r i ε i g i are constants with arbitrarily small which implies v g 0 as v g γ and λ ε i g i γ therefore the observation errors g i are uub furthermore solving the inequality 29 renders 30 v δ 1 λ ε i g i 1 e λ t v δ 0 e λ t note that g i 2 2 v δ and g i can exponentially converge to the following compact set 31 ω i g i g i 2 ε i g i λ i as t for the construction of 31 one can conclude that observation errors can be made arbitrarily small when ε i λ i is arbitrarily small by choosing appropriate large λ i therefore theorem 2 holds in what follows the control inputs including surge forces τ u i and yaw moments τ r i are derived define the surge errors and the yaw errors as 32 u e i u i u d i r e i r i r d i where u d i and r d i are the guidance velocities govern by the clos guidance laws 18 in conjunction with 6 and 32 the surge and yaw tracking error dynamics can be expressed by 33 u e i f u i u i v i r i τ u i m u i g u i u i v i r i u d i and 34 r e i f r i u i v i r i τ r i m r i g r i u i v i r i r d i then the lyapunov based feedback control inputs can be derived from 33 and 34 which are 35 τ u i m u i k u i u e i u d i f u i u i v i r i g ˆ u i u i v i r i τ r i m r i k r i r e i r d i f r i u i v

using 26 thereby rendering g ˆ u i g u i g ˆ r i g r i as t in this context velocity error dynamics 33 and 34 can be further computed as u e i k u i u e i r e i k r i r e i respectively remark 7 aiming at the unknown nonlinearities the adaptive approximation can be replaced by utilizing other nonlinear approximation such as neural network liang et al 2019a 2020a fuzzy logic liang et al 2019b 2020b and similar results will be conducted without any difficulties 6 stability analysis in this section the stability analysis of the entire closed loop system is conducted through path following error dynamics main results are summarized as follows theorem 3 under assumptions 1 2 consider a cluster of uuvs with modeling uncertainties and ocean currents and the error dynamics govern by x e i y

unknowns and satisfies 45 v i t v i t 0 e 0 5 d v i t t 0 2 ϑ d v i remark 9 based on the practical operation considerations the proposed synchronized path following control scheme including the ftso 13 the clos guidance 18 with 22 and the adaptive dynamics controller 35 with 26 is entirely illustrated in fig 2 worthy of mention is that each part of the scheme is independent and thus it can be modified and improved without influencing the entire scheme 7 simulation results in this section simulation studies are performed to verify the validity of the proposed synchronized path following control scheme consider the case where four underactuated uuvs called wl ii track a set of parametric paths under assumption 2 the communication topology is given by fig 3 correspondingly the laplacian matrix is given by l 1 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 1 2 1 0 0 1 1 the weight of wl ii is 45 kg and the length is 1 46 m and inertia parameters of uuv are given as the same as that of liang et al 2018

21434,loosely coupled scheme is extensively used to simulate fluid structure interaction fsi problems due to its efficiency however it meets the numerical difficulty of instability in the strong added mass scenario in this paper a loosely coupled scheme is proposed for solving the flow induced flapping problem of two dimensional 2d flexible plate with strong added mass effect specifically finite volume method is used to simulate the flow field and mode superposition method is applied to calculate the structure field in order to avoid the added mass induced numerical instability governing equation of the flexible plate is modified with added mass being added to its both sides first of all this proposed scheme is validated through simulating hydrodynamic response of a single cantilever flexible plate in uniform flows then to study the stability of the proposed scheme the flow induced oscillations of a cantilever flexible plate with various low mass ratios and strong added mass effects are studied the critical stability boundary of the flapping dynamics of a cantilever flexible plate is also presented finally the proposed scheme is applied to simulate the hydrodynamic behaviors of two parallel plates in uniform flows two distinct flapping dynamics models in phase and out of phase oscillations are obtained and their corresponding flow details are illustrated keywords fluid structure interaction loosely coupled scheme added mass effect stability flapping dynamics 1 introduction the phenomenon of flexible bodies interacting with flow is ubiquitous in our daily life such as waving flags and foils in the air flapping fins in the water and artificial membranes in the blood flow it draws a lot of attention not only for the richness of fluid structure interaction fsi behavior but also for its development of bionics pan et al 2012 becker et al 2015 huang 1995 zhang et al 2000 and schouveiler et al 2005 studied this interaction behavior experimentally and found that there were two different states stretched straight and flapping states of a single flexible plate ristroph and zhang 2008 studied the interacting hydrodynamic behavior of two flexible flags in the tandem configuration experimentally and found that the leading flag could enjoy a significant drag reduction of up to 50 while the downstream flag suffered a drag increase brummelen 2009 and jaiman et al 2014 discussed the reason of the onset of flapping instability of a single flexible plate with both ends or one end clamped theoretically and the influencing parameters of added mass tension were further investigated compared to the experimental and theoretical methods above numerical simulation provides flow details lift and drag forces on the flexible plate as well as displacements along the flexible plate which helps to improve our understanding about this fsi phenomenon fsi problems have been solved in the past using two different numerical methods monolithic scheme and partitioned scheme monolithic scheme solves governing equations of the whole coupling system simultaneously this approach meets two main difficulties 1 the governing equations of fluid and structure fields have different mathematical and numerical properties in which the matrices are symmetric for the structure field but asymmetric for the fluid field 2 the nature of the coupling problem is implicit rather than explicit so the isolation of the unknown parameter such as pressure or velocity in the coupling interface is not easy consequently monolithic scheme is computationally challenging and not used extensively alternatively partitioned scheme is popular in solving fsi problems it calculates the fluid and structure field in a sequentially staggered manner by which specifically designed codes computational fluid dynamics cfd and computational structure dynamics csd softwares on different fields can be utilized a single flexible plate clamped at the leading edge flapping freely in a uniform flow was studied by the partitioned scheme piperno et al 1995 matthies and steindorf 2002 liu et al 2014 recently enlightened by energetic benefit and enhanced performance among the collective behaviors in biological and natural systems e g fish schools and bird flocks multiple flexible plates in different tandem and side by side configurations were investigated through the partitioned scheme zhu et al 2014a 2014b uddin et al 2015 huang et al 2018 peng et al 2018a 2018b those researches introduced different modes of collective locomotion and their corresponding underlying mechanisms were discussed added mass is an inherent characteristic of fluid load added to the object as it moves the same volume of surrounding fluid during the accelerating or decelerating motion added mass effect occurs in fsi problems if the densities of the fluid and the object are comparable in impressible flow or either the object or the fluid domain is of a slender shape on the one hand added mass effect produces numerical difficulties such as instabilities and non convergence idelsohn et al 2009 summarized that added mass effect caused different numerical difficulties in various fluid structure coupled schemes which are instabilities in the loosely coupled scheme non convergent iterative solutions in the strongly coupled scheme and the monolithic scheme with pressure segregation respectively partitioned schemes that classified as strongly coupled and loosely coupled schemes are used extensively in fsi numerical simulations in order to overcome the numerical difficulties induced by added mass effect piperno et al 1995 piperno and farhat 2000 causin et al 2005 förster et al 2007 and vierendeels et al 2008 explored the causes of the numerical instabilities and non convergence problems encountered in the simulation of fsi problem with strong added mass effect theoretically and various partitioned strongly coupled methods were developed to obtain a stable and convergent solution the strongly coupled scheme involves an iterative process which means the fluid and structure fields are solved several times within a single time step until the coupling conditions are met causin et al 2005 vierendeels et al 2008 kütter and wall 2008 2009 idelsohn et al 2009 wang 2010 sudhakar and wall 2018 in consideration of the high computational cost of sub iterations in strongly coupled scheme a stable second order scheme based on loosely coupled method was developed by liu et al 2014 this second order scheme concerned more about reducing the total error and found an efficient way to reach the desired order of accuracy rather than eliminating it through further iterations as done in strongly coupled scheme on the other hand added mass is an important design parameter of fsi applications for example in aerospace engineering applications foil of long length produces low mass rate with the surrounding fluid this strong added mass effect influences the value of critical velocity of onset of flapping instability brummelen 2009 jaiman et al 2014 liu et al 2014 and would induce the undesired instabilities in the low flight velocity in the ejection performances of the sub launched missile or the independent escape capsule narrow launching tube or housing makes the added mass effect strong consequently it would lead to the massive ballistic thrust needed for the ejected missile or the disadvantages of extended time for the successful ejection of the escape capsule zhang et al 2019a 2019b inspired by the researches above here we propose to develop a loosely coupled scheme for the fsi problem of the flapping flexible plate with strong added mass effect based on the platform of cfd software fluent version 13 0 1 in this loosely coupled scheme fluid is solved by finite volume method fvm rather than the commonly used arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method dynamic mesh technique sas ip 2010 is applied to trace the movement of nodes on the surface of flexible plates the euler bernoulli approximation is adopted for the simplicity of the structural description the dynamical responses of the plate are solved by mode superposition method and the corresponding user defined function udf is implemented in fluent the purposes of the current work are twofold first we would like to provide a stable and efficient loosely coupled scheme to solve the fully fsi problem of flow induced flapping plates with strong added mass effect second the proposed loosely coupled scheme based on the commercial software provides a powerful tool to study collective behavior and the researches of multiple flexible plates interacting with flow are benefit for the studies of collective behavior and the development of the bionics the rest of this paper is arranged as follows section 2 presents governing equations of the fluid structure coupling system in section 3 the numerical simulation method and the loosely coupling scheme are illustrated section 4 describes the verification of the loosely coupling scheme by simulating a flapping plate in a uniform flow section 5 presents the application of the proposed loosely coupled scheme to study the flow induced flapping dynamic problems of a single flexible plate with strong added mass effect and two parallel plates conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 governing equations as shown in fig 1 a two dimensional impressible inviscid fluid domain ω f is considered in which a 2d flexible plate structure domain represented by ω s is embedded the leading edge of the flexible plate is fixed and its trailing edge is free to flap in the axial uniform flow depending on the hydrodynamic force the flexible plate of thickness h and length l h l is modeled as euler bernoulli beam the flow velocity is u 0 this simple setting of a thin elastic plate oscillating in a mean flow is extensively used to derive many fundamental aspects of added mass effect jaiman et al 2014 2 1 governing equations of fluid the flow of an incompressible inviscid fluid is governed by the conservation of mass and momentum the navier stokes equations are as follows 1a u f 0 in ω f 0 t 1b ρ f u f t ρ f u f u f p f ρ f g f in ω f 0 t where u f ρ f p f g f are the fluid velocity vector density pressure and external applied body force vector respectively to complete the system appropriate initial and boundary conditions are need 2a u f t 0 u 0 f in ω 0 f 2b u f u d f on γ d f 0 t 2c σ f n f σ n f on γ n f 0 t 2d u f u i on γ i 0 t where γ f d and γ f n represent the dirichlet and neumann boundaries in the fluid domain respectively u f d and σ f n are velocity vector and traction force vector on these two boundaries respectively here σ f is the value of the traction force and n f the unit outward normal vector the fluid velocity condition u i applied at the interface γ i ω f ω s γs d between fluid and structure is described by the flapping movement of the plate 2 2 governing equations of structure as shown in fig 1 let x and y be the coordinates in horizontal and vertical directions the fixed edge of the plate is at the origin of the coordinate system the dynamic equilibrium of the thin flexible plate in the lagrangian frame of reference is approximated through governing equation of the euler bernoulli beam as 3 ρ l 2 y x t t 2 e i 4 y x t x 4 δ p x t in ω s 0 t with ρ l ρ s h i h 3 12 where ρ l e ρ s and i are the linear density young s modulus density and inertia moment of the structure respectively y x t and δp x t are the flapping displacement along the plate and the net pressure on the plate in the vertical direction respectively in all the simulations presented in this study the tension acting along the axis of the plate is neglected which is consistence with that the viscous shear stress in a potential flow along the flat plate is zero the governing equation is complemented by the following appropriate initial and boundary conditions 4a y x 0 y 0 x in ω 0 s 4b y x 0 t v 0 x in ω 0 s 4c y x t y x t on γ d s 0 t 4d p x t n s δ p x t on γ i 0 t where δp x t defines the traction force on the interface it is not a user defined value but obtained from the fluid solution 2 3 interface let γ i ω f ω s γs d be the fluid structure interface through which two different fields fluid and structure interact with each other it can be seen from eqs 2d and 4d that the interface condition applied on one field is dictated by the behavior of the other fluid field produces hydrodynamic force that alters the dynamic condition of the structure field and this dynamic behavior of structure in turn provides kinematic condition that influences the fluid field on γ i the whole fsi system should satisfy both velocity and traction continuities as follows 5 u i y x t t on γ i 0 t 6 σ f n f p x t n s on γ i 0 t 3 loosely coupled scheme loosely coupled scheme one kind of partitioned schemes is particularly appealing in terms of its efficiency because it calculates fluid and structure field only once per a single time step the general cycle is described as a advance the fluid field under given boundary conditions and compute pressure load b advance the structural field under the obtained pressure load and c update the fluid mesh accordingly in this paper fluent version 13 0 1 is applied for secondary development and a loosely coupled scheme is proposed fluid domain is solved by fvm rather than extensively used ale method in the fsi problems structure domain is approximated by the theoretical solution of euler bernoulli beam for simplicity in which mode superposition method is adopted rather than the commonly used fem method dynamic mesh technique is applied to update fluid mesh accordingly 3 1 fluid fvm uses a control volume based technique to convert a general transport equation to an algebraic equation it integrates the transport equation on a control volume basis yielding a discrete equation satisfying the conservation law as follows 7 v ρ f φ t d v ρ f φ u f n a d a γ φ φ n a d a v s φ d v where φ represents a scalar quantity in the unsteady conservation equation v and a are an arbitrary control volume in the fluid field and its corresponding surfaces respectively n a is the normal vector of the surfaces γ φ is the diffusion coefficient for φ s φ is the source of φ per unit volume eq 7 is applied to each control volume or cell in the fluid domain and its spatial discretization form is expressed as 8 ρ f φ t v ρ f φ u f n a a γ φ φ n a a s φ v the time derivative term in eq 8 is defined in temporal discretization for transient simulations a generic expression for the time evolution of a variable φ is given by 9 φ t f φ where the function f incorporates any spatial discretization first order implicit time integration is applied as follows 10 φ n 1 φ n δ t f φ n 1 where φ n and φ n 1 represent the values at the current time step and the next time step respectively the implicit equation is solved iteratively at each time step before moving to the next time level to enable the coupling the hydrodynamic force extracted from the fluid solution on the structure field is expressed as 11 p l δ p x t n s d x its spatial discretization form is 12 p δ p x t n s δ x 3 2 structure to solve eq 3 boundary conditions for euler bernoulli beam with one edge fixed are provided as follows 13 y 0 t 0 y 0 t t 0 2 y l t x 2 0 3 y l t x 3 0 the initial conditions are as follows 14 y x 0 y 0 x y x 0 t v 0 x where eqs 13 and 14 are the specific descriptions for eqs 4a 4c of the euler bernoulli beam with the leading edge fixed in the model superposition method the displacement is expressed as 15 y x t ϕ j x q j t variables separation method is adopted with substituting eq 15 into eq 3 and setting δp x t 0 two differential equations are obtained 16a 2 q j t t 2 ω j 2 q j t 0 16b 4 ϕ j x x 4 β j 4 ϕ j x 0 with ω j β j 2 e i ρ l where ω j is inherent frequency β j is constant coefficient the mode

changes to 19 m j 2 q j t t 2 ω j 2 q j t p j t with m j 0 l ϕ j 2 x ρ l d x p j t 0 l ϕ j x δ p x t d x where m j p j t are the generalized mass and generalized force respectively the duhamel s integral solution is as follows 20 q j t 1 m j ω j 0 t p j τ sin ω j t τ d τ q j 0 cos ω j t q j t ω j t sin ω j t enlightened by the studies förster et al 2007 brummelen 2009 jaiman et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a 2019b the artificial added mass of the structure is added in the both sides of governing equation in order to avoid the well known added mass instability in the loosely coupled scheme the theoretical value of the added mass of flapping flexible plate per unit length in the uniform incompressible flow is frequency dependent brummelen 2009 jaiman et al 2014 as follows 21 λ j 2 ρ f w β j where w is the width of the flexible plate which equals to 1 in the two dimensional simulation consequently eq 18 changes to 22 ρ l λ j ϕ j x 2 q j t t 2 e i 4 ϕ j x x 4 q j t δ p x t λ j ϕ j x 2 q j

t to enable the coupling this structural displacement needs to be transferred to the fluid domain through dynamic mesh technology in fluent version 13 0 1 specifically diffusion based mesh smoothing sas ip 2010 is adopted in this paper 3 3 algorithm the complete coupling steps from time level t n to t n 1 is described in algorithm 1 as follows algorithm 1 loosely coupled scheme based on fluent version 13 0 1 1 start from known solutions u f u f n y x t y x t n y x t t v x t n at time t n 2 advance from time level t n to t n 1 a obtain p f n by solving fluid equation eq 7 b define the structural position y x t n 1 by solving structural equation eq 22 c update the fluid field accordingly using dynamic mesh technology the corresponding calculation flow chart is shown in fig 2 it is realized that this proposed scheme retains and carries numerical errors at each time step without reducing them through sub iterations as strongly coupled scheme does but the governing equations of fluid and structure fields are solved only once at each time step which makes the loosely coupled scheme very sufficient in this paper more concerns are put on acquiring the desired accuracy by this more economic loosely coupled scheme in solving fsi problem with strong added mass effect 4 verification of the loosely coupled scheme to validate the present loosely coupled scheme hydrodynamic behavior of a single flexible plate with its leading edge fixed in uniform flows is simulated and the results are compared with the solutions by a strongly coupled scheme wang 2010 the characteristic length l velocity u 0 and density ρ f are applied to form the dimensionless equations of the cantilever beam as follows 24 ρ l ρ f l 2 y ˆ x t t ˆ 2 e i ρ f u 0 2 l 3 4 y ˆ x t x ˆ 4 δ p ˆ x t y ˆ y l x ˆ x l t ˆ t u 0 l δ p ˆ δ p ρ f u 0 2 in ω s 0 t define two dimensionless parameters s ρ s h ρ f l u 12 ρ f l 3 e h 3 u 0 eq 24 changes to 25 s 2 y ˆ x t t ˆ 2 u 2 4 y ˆ x t x ˆ 4 δ p ˆ x t in ω s 0 t it indicates that flow induced flapping motion of a single cantilever plate is determined by these two dimensionless parameters mass ratio s and dimensionless velocity u the numerical case of s 1 and u 7 is implemented to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed scheme a small amplitude disturbing displacement y x 0 0 01ϕ 1 x of the flexible plate is considered at t 0s computational domain and boundary conditions refer to fig 1 based on our convergence studies with different computational domains the size of the flow domain is set as 2l 7l 2l 2l in the x and y directions quadrangular structured mesh is used for spatial discretization of the flow field three different grid systems g1 g2 and g3 with increasing densities are considered for mesh sensitivity analysis fig 3 shows the medium density grid system g2 in which mesh around the vicinity of the thin plate and the wake region is refined in order capture the details of the flow mesh sensitivity analysis is performed using a constant time step size δt 0 01s and number of natural modes j max 5 three different time step sizes δt 0 05s δt 0 01s and δt 0 002s are tested for the temporal accuracy in which the same grid system g2 and j max 5 are adopted additionally three different numbers of natural modes j max 3 j max 5 and j max 10 are used for mode truncation study in which the same grid system g2 and δt 0 01s are chosen tables 1 3 provide the tip displacement frequency and lift coefficient for three grid systems time step sizes and numbers of natural modes respectively it can be seen that numerical results are monotonically convergent with the increase of mesh density and number of natural modes as well as the decrease of time step size the maximum difference between grid systems g2 and g3 is 2 76 of lifting coefficient the maximum difference between time step sizes δt 0 01s and δt 0 002s is 2 95 of lifting coefficient and the maximum difference between j max 5 and j max 10 is 2 86 of lifting coefficient next fig 4 compares the obtained stable results the lifting coefficient curve and the trailing edge tip displacement curve with the solutions by wang 2010 the computed frequency by the proposed loosely scheme is slightly different from that by wang 2010 so in order to make the comparison clear the zero value of the dimensionless time represents any time when the stable results are acquired rather than the initial time at which the numerical simulation starts it can be seen from fig 4 that the computed values are overall in good agreement with each other therefore we believe that grid system g2 time step size δt 0 01s and number of natural modes j max 5 produce enough accurate results and are adopted in the following works if not otherwise specified 5 application to flapping dynamics in this section both a single flexible plate with strong added mass effect and two side by side flexible plates in uniform flows are studied 5 1 a single flexible plate validation case of s 1 and u 7 has been presented above in addition a single flexible plate with various low mass ratios s is simulated in order to illustrate the stability and convergence of the proposed scheme named as m2 in this strong added mass scenario another loosely coupled scheme m1 is adopted for comparison m1 the proposed loosely coupled scheme refers to algorithm 1 in which the structural equation eq 18 is solved m2 the proposed loosely coupled scheme refers to algorithm 1 in which the structural equation eq 22 is solved m2 differs from m1 in the dealing way of governing equation of the structure the numerical case of s 0 25 and u 20 is implemented to indicate the numerical difficulties instability and non convergence encountered in fsi problem with strong added mass effect and its corresponding stable and convergent results by the proposed scheme m2 fig 5 gives the lifting coefficient curve and the tip displacement curve these two figures have double x and double y axes and the red and black curves represent results by m1 and m2 respectively the red curves show clearly that the lifting force on the plate changes between positive and negative values at continuous time steps and the maximum lifting coefficient exceeds 1000 within 7 computational time steps which leads to the trailing edge tip displacement of the single flexible plate oscillates severely at the meantime the lifting coefficient curve indicates the numerical difficulties instability and divergence encountered by using m1 in the strong added mass scenario the obtained tip displacement curve also violates the correct hydrodynamic behavior of the flexible plate in uniform flows however the proposed loosely coupled scheme m2 considering the added mass in governing equation of the structure creates convergence and stable solutions the black curves show that the sinusoidal lifting coefficient grows gradually and eventually its amplitude keeps stable at about 0 5 the stable hydrodynamic behavior of the single plate is achieved after tu 0 l 30 and the flapping amplitude is 0 258l the explanation is given as follows fig 6 illustrates the upward flapping motion velocity v y 0 and acceleration a y 0 of flexible plate under lifting force f l by the uniform flow drag force f d and added mass force f a are the hydrodynamic forces that hinder the motion of plate f i is the internal force of plate it is commonly known that lifting force induced by the uniform flow falls with the decreases of the deformation of flexible plate which drives the flow induced acceleration to go down 26 a y t n 1 a y t n 0 according to the force analysis in fig 6 eq 18 can also be written as 27 ρ l a y t n f i t n f l t n f d t n f a t n with f a t n λ a y t n in the loosely coupling scheme m1 the calculated eq 18 is 28 ρ l a y l t n f i t n f l t n f d t n f a t n 1 where al y t n is adopted to distinguish from the real time acceleration a y t n in eq 27 in strong added mass scenario λ ρ l a situation may occur according to eq 26 29 λ a y t n 1 λ a y t n ρ l a y t n eqs 27 and 29 are substituted into eq 28 30 ρ l a y l t n f l t n f d t n f i t n λ a y t n 1 f l t n f d t n f i t n λ a y t n ρ l a y t n 0 it can be seen that the obtained acceleration al y t n 0 which is not consistent with eq 26 consequently the simulation by m1 cannot describe the correct physical flapping motion and it may break down due to this divergence problem as shown by the red curves in fig 5 in order to overcome this problem eq 28 is modified as follows 31 ρ l a y l t n λ a y t n 1 f i t n f l t n f d t n f a t n 1 λ a y t n 1 in consideration of little change of lifting force at two consecutive time steps it can be assume that a y t n al y t n a y t n 1 then eq 31 changes to 32 ρ l λ a y l t n f i t n f l t n f d t n f a t n 1 λ a y t n 1 it prevents the calculated acceleration al y t n 0 and produces convergent results as shown by the black curves in fig 5 so eq 32 is adopted in the loosely coupling scheme m2 the first five natural frequencies of this single flexible plate s 0 25 and u 20 are 0 056 0 351 0 982 1 924 and 3 181 respectively to further study the tip displacement of its trailing edge its amplitude frequency spectrum is plotted in fig 7 a it indicates that a single dominant frequency of 0 599 characterizes the regular sinusoidal tip displacement curve this flow induced flapping frequency is between the values of the second and third natural modes the same phenomenon also appears in fig 7 b the generalized coordinates of each mode show that the amplitudes of the second and third modes are comparable with that of the first mode while the amplitudes of the fourth and fifth modes are rather small the overall response of the plate in uniform flows is obtained by superposing the amplitudes of each mode q j t as eq 23 so the influence of those high order modes fourth and fifth modes on the displacement of flexible plate is negligible fig 8 a shows the profile of this single flexible plate at various time instants during a complete cycle of flow induced flapping motion it can be seen that the flapping mode along the length of the plate is similar to the third mode of the cantilever beam which illustrates that the third mode influences the flapping motion of the plate most hereafter the flapping mode of the plate in case of s 0 25 and u 20 is referred to as 3rd mode and the mode that most influences the flapping motion is referred to as the primary mode watanabe et al 2002 several vortices contours in the wake zone of this single plate at different time instants are presented in fig 8 b f the shear layer shed from the trailing edge of the plate curls into wake zone and a pair of von kármán vortices occurs in one complete flapping cycle for corresponding flow fields please refer to the supplementary movies the numerical case of a single flexible plate with s 0 25 and u 20 is shown in the supplementary movie 1 another four simulation cases case 1 s 0 25 and u 17 5 case 2 s 0 05 and u 44 case 3 s 0 1 and u 35 5 and case 4 s 0 5 and u 14 are also studied number of natural modes j max 10 is adopted in the calculation of cases 2 and 3 their corresponding tip displacements of the trailing edge are presented in fig 9 the tip displacement decreases with time and finally the plate straightens in case 1 while the plates in the other three cases finally flap periodically with different time periods and amplitudes amplitude frequency analyses to the tip displacement history curves in fig 10 a show that the single dominant frequencies are 2 098 1 998 and 0 689 in cases 2 4 respectively it can be seen from the generalized coordinates of each mode in figs 10 b and c that the fourth mode in cases 2 and 3 exhibits larger amplitude than the second third and fifth modes do the influence of sixth mode on the displacement of flexible plate is limited obviously the fourth mode is the primary mode in cases 2 and 3 the corresponding flapping modes of the flexible plates in cases 2 and 3 are referred to as 4th mode the comparison between figs 5 b and 9 a indicates that different dimensionless velocities u decide the onset of the flapping of the flexible plate with same mass ratio s the comparison between figs 9 b c and d illustrates that different plates with various s flap at different dimensionless velocities u as reported by other researchers huang 1995 watanabe et al 2002 wang 2010 a critical stability boundary exists in the s u plane the flexible plate keeps stretched straight under the critical stability boundary above which a harmonic flapping motion is achieved fig 11 compares different theoretical and numerical critical stability boundaries in the figure the solid and dash dot lines indicate theoretical and numerical results by watanabe et al 2002 and wang 2010 respectively triangles and circles are our results and dash line is a fitted critical stability boundary we can see that on the one hand our solutions are closer to the theoretical results by watanabe et al 2002 than the numerical results by wang 2010 and on the other hand the solutions in strong added mass scenario with s 0 3 are obtained by our proposed loosely coupled scheme rather than the strongly coupled scheme by wang 2010 the primary mode of the flapping flexible plate is also presented in fig 11 5 2 two side by side flexible plates the flexible plates are used for the numerical study of collective behaviors such as fish schools and flying formation due to the simplicity of structural description peng et al 2018 a b indicated that few numerical simulations were performed for flow mediated interactions between two self propelled bodies and one related study zhu et al 2014a was mentioned different from a single flexible plate with low mass ratios in infinite flow domain hydrodynamic behaviors of the multiple plates are influenced by each other through the flow among them one plate can be seen as a confined boundary for another plate if side by side configuration is applied and jaiman et al 2014 proved theoretically that confined channel would lead to stronger added mass effect hereafter two side by side flexible plates one of the simplest group configurations for the basic element of collective behaviors are studied by the proposed loosely coupled scheme rather than the commonly used strongly coupled scheme the side by side configuration refers to fig 12 besides s and u the fsi problem of the parallel plates in uniform flows is also decided by another dimensionless parameter d d l d is the lateral spacing between the two fixed leading edges of the flexible plates experimental investigation zhang et al 2000 indicated that the lateral spacing determined the oscillating mode of flexible plates in which two parallel flexible filaments flapped in phase with each other when d 0 21 0 04 and out of phase when d 0 21 two identical plates of same s are studied numerically with changing u and d in order to present these two different types of hydrodynamic behaviors of the parallel plates and the reasons are discussed from the aspect of force 1 in phase oscillation the results of numerical case with s 1 u 6 and d 0 15 are presented fig 13 a shows the obtained stable tip displacements of the free edges of two parallel plates during in phase oscillation two parallel plates flap in phase with each other with the same amplitude about 0 205l and frequency fig 13 b illustrates the corresponding amplitude frequency spectrum of two flexible plates a single dominant frequency of 0 499 characterizes the regular sinusoidal tip displacement fig 14 a shows the profile of two flexible plates at various time instants during a complete cycle of flow induced flapping motion which illustrates that the second mode influences both parallel flexible plates most some typical wake structures during the whole flapping cycle are shown in fig 14 b h two parallel shear layers detached from the trailing edges of two plates at tu 0 l 500 mix together from tu 0 l 500 1 to tu 0 l 500 3 and finally a single von kármán vortex forms at tu 0 l 500 7 before where two new shed parallel shear layers start to generate and then the same process takes again for corresponding flow fields please refer to the supplementary movie 2 compared to the vortices contours of a single flexible plate in fig 8 the overall wake structure is the same that a pair of von kármán vortices generated during a complete cycle except for the mixing process of two detached shear layers existing in the numerical case of two parallel plates during in phase oscillation 2 out of phase oscillation numerical case of s 1 u 5 5 and d 0 4 is simulated the tip displacement history curves of the free edges of two parallel plates and their corresponding amplitude frequency spectrum are illustrated in fig 15 the two flexible plates oscillate symmetrically about their center line y 0 2l in which the peak value of plate a is equal to the valley value of plate b and the valley value of plate a is equal to the peak value of plate b the peak displacement 0 189l of plate a is larger than its valley displacement 0 163l both plates vibrate with a single dominant frequency of 0 5 this mode is defined as the out of phase oscillation fig 16 shows the shapes of two flexible plates and some typical vortices contours during one out of phase oscillation circle for corresponding flow fields please refer to the supplementary movie 3 two shear layers generated at the upper surface and lower surface of the leading edge of each plate detach from the trailing edge at tu 0 l 45 05 and then the vortices of opposite signs are formed behind the trailing edge of two plates at tu 0 l 45 45 in which the upper plate produces clockwise vortex and the lower plate counterclockwise vortex two pairs of vortices mushroom shape vortices are swept downstream together by uniform flows at tu 0 l 45 75 from then on two end tips of plates start to moving closer to each other and the spacing between two end tips narrows down where the enclosed fluid is released like a droplet and it spreads along the center line of the two plates into the wake region from tu 0 l 45 8 to tu 0 l 46 55 this same phenomenon was also described in the experimental study zhang et al 2000 in order to explore the reasons of two different oscillating modes the lifting coefficients of two parallel flexible plates are given in fig 17 the directions of forces on the two in phase oscillating plates are the same while forces on the two out of phase oscillating plates are the opposite the nearly same positive and negative amplitudes in fig 17 a make the average lifting coefficient equal to zero under which two parallel flexible plates flap synchronously like a single flow induced flapping plate with the same peak and valley amplitude of 0 205l as seen in fig 13 a the opposite lifting forces repulsive forces in fig 17 b of unequally positive and negative amplitudes 0 821 and 0 566 drive two plates flap symmetrically about their center line with different peak and valley amplitude of 0 189l and 0 163l as shown in fig 15 a the hydrodynamic behavior of two parallel flexible plates with s 1 u 6 and d 0 4 is also simulated fig 18 shows that the amplitude of tip displacement increases beyond 0 2l at around tu 0 l 30 1 when two parallel flexible plates collide with each other and then the simulation stops due to the updated fluid grid of negative volume in order to carry on the calculation contact mechanics should be introduced to describe the corresponding collision behavior between those two plates which is our future work comparison of two different hydrodynamic behaviors in figs 13 a and fig 18 illustrates the conclusion that d determines the oscillating mode of two parallel flexible plates zhang et al 2000 and comparison of results in figs 15 a and fig 18 indicates that u influences the amplitude of tip displacement two typical hydrodynamic behaviors in phase and out of phase oscillations of two parallel cantilever plates found in experiment zhang et al 2000 are simulated by the proposed loosely coupled scheme and the flow details are accurately captured although collective behaviors involving the self propelled motion of the flapping plates are not studied directly here it is easy to see from section 2 2 that if the self propelled motion is defined in eq 4c instead of the fixed boundary condition of the cantilever plates in the present paper the corresponding collective behavior can also be simulated by this proposed loosely coupled scheme 6 conclusions the present contribution is concern with the provision of a stable loosely coupled scheme for the fsi problem of the flow induced flapping dynamics of 2d flexible plate with strong added mass effect the commercial cfd solver fluent version 13 0 1 is extended with a dedicated user defined function udf in which the modified governing equation of the structure field considering its added mass in incompressible flow field is solved by mode superposition method hydrodynamic response of a single cantilever flexible plate with mass ratio s 1 in a uniform flow u 7 is simulated by the proposed loosely coupled scheme comparison of the tip displacement and lifting coefficient to the solutions by a strongly coupled scheme illustrates the accuracy of the proposed scheme and then this scheme is further used to simulate the flow induced flapping responses of a single flexible plate with various low mass ratios in different uniform flows through which the numerical stability of the loosely coupled scheme is assessed besides as a function of mass ratio s the flapping dynamics of a single cantilever plate in various flow velocities u presents two distinct states stretched straight and harmonic flapping states the harmonic flapping motions of the flexible plates with various mass ratios are discussed it is found that the deformed shape of the flexible plate with lower mass ratio is influenced more by its higher natural mode finally the flow induced hydrodynamic responses of two parallel cantilever plates are studied different from a single flexible plate in infinite flow domain hydrodynamic behaviors of the multiple plates are influenced by each other through the flow among them in which intensity unknown added mass effect occurs the in phase and out of phase oscillations of two parallel cantilever plates are obtained by this proposed scheme and the flow details are accurately presented this proposed loosely coupled scheme can be easily extended to study the collective behavior only requiring the definition of the corresponding self propelled motion of the flapping plates

21434,loosely coupled scheme is extensively used to simulate fluid structure interaction fsi problems due to its efficiency however it meets the numerical difficulty of instability in the strong added mass scenario in this paper a loosely coupled scheme is proposed for solving the flow induced flapping problem of two dimensional 2d flexible plate with strong added mass effect specifically finite volume method is used to simulate the flow field and mode superposition method is applied to calculate the structure field in order to avoid the added mass induced numerical instability governing equation of the flexible plate is modified with added mass being added to its both sides first of all this proposed scheme is validated through simulating hydrodynamic response of a single cantilever flexible plate in uniform flows then to study the stability of the proposed scheme the flow induced oscillations of a cantilever flexible plate with various low mass ratios and strong added mass effects are studied the critical stability boundary of the flapping dynamics of a cantilever flexible plate is also presented finally the proposed scheme is applied to simulate the hydrodynamic behaviors of two parallel plates in uniform flows two distinct flapping dynamics models in phase and out of phase oscillations are obtained and their corresponding flow details are illustrated keywords fluid structure interaction loosely coupled scheme added mass effect stability flapping dynamics 1 introduction the phenomenon of flexible bodies interacting with flow is ubiquitous in our daily life such as waving flags and foils in the air flapping fins in the water and artificial membranes in the blood flow it draws a lot of attention not only for the richness of fluid structure interaction fsi behavior but also for its development of bionics pan et al 2012 becker et al 2015 huang 1995 zhang et al 2000 and schouveiler et al 2005 studied this interaction behavior experimentally and found that there were two different states stretched straight and flapping states of a single flexible plate ristroph and zhang 2008 studied the interacting hydrodynamic behavior of two flexible flags in the tandem configuration experimentally and found that the leading flag could enjoy a significant drag reduction of up to 50 while the downstream flag suffered a drag increase brummelen 2009 and jaiman et al 2014 discussed the reason of the onset of flapping instability of a single flexible plate with both ends or one end clamped theoretically and the influencing parameters of added mass tension were further investigated compared to the experimental and theoretical methods above numerical simulation provides flow details lift and drag forces on the flexible plate as well as displacements along the flexible plate which helps to improve our understanding about this fsi phenomenon fsi problems have been solved in the past using two different numerical methods monolithic scheme and partitioned scheme monolithic scheme solves governing equations of the whole coupling system simultaneously this approach meets two main difficulties 1 the governing equations of fluid and structure fields have different mathematical and numerical properties in which the matrices are symmetric for the structure field but asymmetric for the fluid field 2 the nature of the coupling problem is implicit rather than explicit so the isolation of the unknown parameter such as pressure or velocity in the coupling interface is not easy consequently monolithic scheme is computationally challenging and not used extensively alternatively partitioned scheme is popular in solving fsi problems it calculates the fluid and structure field in a sequentially staggered manner by which specifically designed codes computational fluid dynamics cfd and computational structure dynamics csd softwares on different fields can be utilized a single flexible plate clamped at the leading edge flapping freely in a uniform flow was studied by the partitioned scheme piperno et al 1995 matthies and steindorf 2002 liu et al 2014 recently enlightened by energetic benefit and enhanced performance among the collective behaviors in biological and natural systems e g fish schools and bird flocks multiple flexible plates in different tandem and side by side configurations were investigated through the partitioned scheme zhu et al 2014a 2014b uddin et al 2015 huang et al 2018 peng et al 2018a 2018b those researches introduced different modes of collective locomotion and their corresponding underlying mechanisms were discussed added mass is an inherent characteristic of fluid load added to the object as it moves the same volume of surrounding fluid during the accelerating or decelerating motion added mass effect occurs in fsi problems if the densities of the fluid and the object are comparable in impressible flow or either the object or the fluid domain is of a slender shape on the one hand added mass effect produces numerical difficulties such as instabilities and non convergence idelsohn et al 2009 summarized that added mass effect caused different numerical difficulties in various fluid structure coupled schemes which are instabilities in the loosely coupled scheme non convergent iterative solutions in the strongly coupled scheme and the monolithic scheme with pressure segregation respectively partitioned schemes that classified as strongly coupled and loosely coupled schemes are used extensively in fsi numerical simulations in order to overcome the numerical difficulties induced by added mass effect piperno et al 1995 piperno and farhat 2000 causin et al 2005 förster et al 2007 and vierendeels et al 2008 explored the causes of the numerical instabilities and non convergence problems encountered in the simulation of fsi problem with strong added mass effect theoretically and various partitioned strongly coupled methods were developed to obtain a stable and convergent solution the strongly coupled scheme involves an iterative process which means the fluid and structure fields are solved several times within a single time step until the coupling conditions are met causin et al 2005 vierendeels et al 2008 kütter and wall 2008 2009 idelsohn et al 2009 wang 2010 sudhakar and wall 2018 in consideration of the high computational cost of sub iterations in strongly coupled scheme a stable second order scheme based on loosely coupled method was developed by liu et al 2014 this second order scheme concerned more about reducing the total error and found an efficient way to reach the desired order of accuracy rather than eliminating it through further iterations as done in strongly coupled scheme on the other hand added mass is an important design parameter of fsi applications for example in aerospace engineering applications foil of long length produces low mass rate with the surrounding fluid this strong added mass effect influences the value of critical velocity of onset of flapping instability brummelen 2009 jaiman et al 2014 liu et al 2014 and would induce the undesired instabilities in the low flight velocity in the ejection performances of the sub launched missile or the independent escape capsule narrow launching tube or housing makes the added mass effect strong consequently it would lead to the massive ballistic thrust needed for the ejected missile or the disadvantages of extended time for the successful ejection of the escape capsule zhang et al 2019a 2019b inspired by the researches above here we propose to develop a loosely coupled scheme for the fsi problem of the flapping flexible plate with strong added mass effect based on the platform of cfd software fluent version 13 0 1 in this loosely coupled scheme fluid is solved by finite volume method fvm rather than the commonly used arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method dynamic mesh technique sas ip 2010 is applied to trace the movement of nodes on the surface of flexible plates the euler bernoulli approximation is adopted for the simplicity of the structural description the dynamical responses of the plate are solved by mode superposition method and the corresponding user defined function udf is implemented in fluent the purposes of the current work are twofold first we would like to provide a stable and efficient loosely coupled scheme to solve the fully fsi problem of flow induced flapping plates with strong added mass effect second the proposed loosely coupled scheme based on the commercial software provides a powerful tool to study collective behavior and the researches of multiple flexible plates interacting with flow are benefit for the studies of collective behavior and the development of the bionics the rest of this paper is arranged as follows section 2 presents governing equations of the fluid structure coupling system in section 3 the numerical simulation method and the loosely coupling scheme are illustrated section 4 describes the verification of the loosely coupling scheme by simulating a flapping plate in a uniform flow section 5 presents the application of the proposed loosely coupled scheme to study the flow induced flapping dynamic problems of a single flexible plate with strong added mass effect and two parallel plates conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 governing equations as shown in fig 1 a two dimensional impressible inviscid fluid domain ω f is considered in which a 2d flexible plate structure domain represented by ω s is embedded the leading edge of the flexible plate is fixed and its trailing edge is free to flap in the axial uniform flow depending on the hydrodynamic force the flexible plate of thickness h and length l h l is modeled as euler bernoulli beam the flow velocity is u 0 this simple setting of a thin elastic plate oscillating in a mean flow is extensively used to derive many fundamental aspects of added mass effect jaiman et al 2014 2 1 governing equations of fluid the flow of an incompressible inviscid fluid is governed by the conservation of mass and momentum the navier stokes equations are as follows 1a u f 0 in ω f 0 t 1b ρ f u f t ρ f u f u f p f ρ f g f in ω f 0 t where u f ρ f p f g f are the fluid velocity vector density pressure and external applied body force vector respectively to complete the system appropriate initial and boundary conditions are need 2a u f t 0 u 0 f in ω 0 f 2b u f u d f on γ d f 0 t 2c σ f n f σ n f on γ n f 0 t 2d u f u i on γ i 0 t where γ f d and γ f n represent the dirichlet and neumann boundaries in the fluid domain respectively u f d and σ f n are velocity vector and traction force vector on these two boundaries respectively here σ f is the value of the traction force and n f the unit outward normal vector the fluid velocity condition u i applied at the interface γ i ω f ω s γs d between fluid and structure is described by the flapping movement of the plate 2 2 governing equations of structure as shown in fig 1 let x and y be the coordinates in horizontal and vertical directions the fixed edge of the plate is at the origin of the coordinate system the dynamic equilibrium of the thin flexible plate in the lagrangian frame of reference is approximated through governing equation of the euler bernoulli beam as 3 ρ l 2 y x t t 2 e i 4 y x t x 4 δ p x t in ω s 0 t with ρ l ρ s h i h 3 12 where ρ l e ρ s and i are the linear density young s modulus density and inertia moment of the structure respectively y x t and δp x t are the flapping displacement along the plate and the net pressure on the plate in the vertical direction respectively in all the simulations presented in this study the tension acting along the axis of the plate is neglected which is consistence with that the viscous shear stress in a potential flow along the flat plate is zero the governing equation is complemented by the following appropriate initial and boundary conditions 4a y x 0 y 0 x in ω 0 s 4b y x 0 t v 0 x in ω 0 s 4c y x t y x t on γ d s 0 t 4d p x t n s δ p x t on γ i 0 t where δp x t defines the traction force on the interface it is not a user defined value but obtained from the fluid solution 2 3 interface let γ i ω f ω s γs d be the fluid structure interface through which two different fields fluid and structure interact with each other it can be seen from eqs 2d and 4d that the interface condition applied on one field is dictated by the behavior of the other fluid field produces hydrodynamic force that alters the dynamic condition of the structure field and this dynamic behavior of structure in turn provides kinematic condition that influences the fluid field on γ i the whole fsi system should satisfy both velocity and traction continuities as follows 5 u i y x t t on γ i 0 t 6 σ f n f p x t n s on γ i 0 t 3 loosely coupled scheme loosely coupled scheme one kind of partitioned schemes is particularly appealing in terms of its efficiency because it calculates fluid and structure field only once per a single time step the general cycle is described as a advance the fluid field under given boundary conditions and compute pressure load b advance the structural field under the obtained pressure load and c update the fluid mesh accordingly in this paper fluent version 13 0 1 is applied for secondary development and a loosely coupled scheme is proposed fluid domain is solved by fvm rather than extensively used ale method in the fsi problems structure domain is approximated by the theoretical solution of euler bernoulli beam for simplicity in which mode superposition method is adopted rather than the commonly used fem method dynamic mesh technique is applied to update fluid mesh accordingly 3 1 fluid fvm uses a control volume based technique to convert a general transport equation to an algebraic equation it integrates the transport equation on a control volume basis yielding a discrete equation satisfying the conservation law as follows 7 v ρ f φ t d v ρ f φ u f n a d a γ φ φ n a d a v s φ d v where φ represents a scalar quantity in the unsteady conservation equation v and a are an arbitrary control volume in the fluid field and its corresponding surfaces respectively n a is the normal vector of the surfaces γ φ is the diffusion coefficient for φ s φ is the source of φ per unit volume eq 7 is applied to each control volume or cell in the fluid domain and its spatial discretization form is expressed as 8 ρ f φ t v ρ f φ u f n a a γ φ φ n a a s φ v the time derivative term in eq 8 is defined in temporal discretization for transient simulations a generic expression for the time evolution of a variable φ is given by 9 φ t f φ where the function f incorporates any spatial discretization first order implicit time integration is applied as follows 10 φ n 1 φ n δ t f φ n 1 where φ n and φ n 1 represent the values at the current time step and the next time step respectively the implicit equation is solved iteratively at each time step before moving to the next time level to enable the coupling the hydrodynamic force extracted from the fluid solution on the structure field is expressed as 11 p l δ p x t n s d x its spatial discretization form is 12 p δ p x t n s δ x 3 2 structure to solve eq 3 boundary conditions for euler bernoulli beam with one edge fixed are provided as follows 13 y 0 t 0 y 0 t t 0 2 y l t x 2 0 3 y l t x 3 0 the initial conditions are as follows 14 y x 0 y 0 x y x 0 t v 0 x where eqs 13 and 14 are the specific descriptions for eqs 4a 4c of the euler bernoulli beam with the leading edge fixed in the model superposition method the displacement is expressed as 15 y x t ϕ j x q j t variables separation method is adopted with substituting eq 15 into eq 3 and setting δp x t 0 two differential equations are obtained 16a 2 q j t t 2 ω j 2 q j t 0 16b 4 ϕ j x x 4 β j 4 ϕ j x 0 with ω j β j 2 e i ρ l where ω j is inherent frequency β j is constant coefficient the mode

changes to 19 m j 2 q j t t 2 ω j 2 q j t p j t with m j 0 l ϕ j 2 x ρ l d x p j t 0 l ϕ j x δ p x t d x where m j p j t are the generalized mass and generalized force respectively the duhamel s integral solution is as follows 20 q j t 1 m j ω j 0 t p j τ sin ω j t τ d τ q j 0 cos ω j t q j t ω j t sin ω j t enlightened by the studies förster et al 2007 brummelen 2009 jaiman et al 2014 zhang et al 2019a 2019b the artificial added mass of the structure is added in the both sides of governing equation in order to avoid the well known added mass instability in the loosely coupled scheme the theoretical value of the added mass of flapping flexible plate per unit length in the uniform incompressible flow is frequency dependent brummelen 2009 jaiman et al 2014 as follows 21 λ j 2 ρ f w β j where w is the width of the flexible plate which equals to 1 in the two dimensional simulation consequently eq 18 changes to 22 ρ l λ j ϕ j x 2 q j t t 2 e i 4 ϕ j x x 4 q j t δ p x t λ j ϕ j x 2 q j

t to enable the coupling this structural displacement needs to be transferred to the fluid domain through dynamic mesh technology in fluent version 13 0 1 specifically diffusion based mesh smoothing sas ip 2010 is adopted in this paper 3 3 algorithm the complete coupling steps from time level t n to t n 1 is described in algorithm 1 as follows algorithm 1 loosely coupled scheme based on fluent version 13 0 1 1 start from known solutions u f u f n y x t y x t n y x t t v x t n at time t n 2 advance from time level t n to t n 1 a obtain p f n by solving fluid equation eq 7 b define the structural position y x t n 1 by solving structural equation eq 22 c update the fluid field accordingly using dynamic mesh technology the corresponding calculation flow chart is shown in fig 2 it is realized that this proposed scheme retains and carries numerical errors at each time step without reducing them through sub iterations as strongly coupled scheme does but the governing equations of fluid and structure fields are solved only once at each time step which makes the loosely coupled scheme very sufficient in this paper more concerns are put on acquiring the desired accuracy by this more economic loosely coupled scheme in solving fsi problem with strong added mass effect 4 verification of the loosely coupled scheme to validate the present loosely coupled scheme hydrodynamic behavior of a single flexible plate with its leading edge fixed in uniform flows is simulated and the results are compared with the solutions by a strongly coupled scheme wang 2010 the characteristic length l velocity u 0 and density ρ f are applied to form the dimensionless equations of the cantilever beam as follows 24 ρ l ρ f l 2 y ˆ x t t ˆ 2 e i ρ f u 0 2 l 3 4 y ˆ x t x ˆ 4 δ p ˆ x t y ˆ y l

t it indicates that flow induced flapping motion of a single cantilever plate is determined by these two dimensionless parameters mass ratio s and dimensionless velocity u the numerical case of s 1 and u 7 is implemented to illustrate the accuracy of the proposed scheme a small amplitude disturbing displacement y x 0 0 01ϕ 1 x of the flexible plate is considered at t 0s computational domain and boundary conditions refer to fig 1 based on our convergence studies with different computational domains the size of the flow domain is set as 2l 7l 2l 2l in the x and y directions quadrangular structured mesh is used for spatial discretization of the flow field three different grid systems g1 g2 and g3 with increasing densities are considered for mesh sensitivity analysis fig 3 shows the medium density grid system g2 in which mesh around the vicinity of the thin plate and the wake region is refined in order capture the details of the flow mesh sensitivity analysis is performed using a constant time step size δt 0 01s and number of natural modes j max 5 three different time step sizes δt 0 05s δt 0 01s and δt 0 002s are tested for the temporal accuracy in which the same grid system g2 and j max 5 are adopted additionally three different numbers of natural modes j max 3 j max 5 and j max 10 are used for mode truncation study in which the same grid system g2 and δt 0 01s are chosen tables 1 3 provide the tip displacement frequency and lift coefficient for three grid systems time step sizes and numbers of natural modes respectively it can be seen that numerical results are monotonically convergent with the increase of mesh density and number of natural modes as well as the decrease of time step size the maximum difference between grid systems g2 and g3 is 2 76 of lifting coefficient the maximum difference between time step sizes δt 0 01s and δt 0 002s is 2 95 of lifting coefficient and the maximum difference between j max 5 and j max 10 is 2 86 of lifting coefficient next fig 4 compares the obtained stable results the lifting coefficient curve and the trailing edge tip displacement curve with the solutions by wang 2010 the computed frequency by the proposed loosely scheme is slightly different from that by wang 2010 so in order to make the comparison clear the zero value of the dimensionless time represents any time when the stable results are acquired rather than the initial time at which the numerical simulation starts it can be seen from fig 4 that the computed values are overall in good agreement with each other therefore we believe that grid system g2 time step size δt 0 01s and number of natural modes j max 5 produce enough accurate results and are adopted in the following works if not otherwise specified 5 application to flapping dynamics in this section both a single flexible plate with strong added mass effect and two side by side flexible plates in uniform flows are studied 5 1 a single flexible plate validation case of s 1 and u 7 has been presented above in addition a single flexible plate with various low mass ratios s is simulated in order to illustrate the stability and convergence of the proposed scheme named as m2 in this strong added mass scenario another loosely coupled scheme m1 is adopted for comparison m1 the proposed loosely coupled scheme refers to algorithm 1 in which the structural equation eq 18 is solved m2 the proposed loosely coupled scheme refers to algorithm 1 in which the structural equation eq 22 is solved m2 differs from m1 in the dealing way of governing equation of the structure the numerical case of s 0 25 and u 20 is implemented to indicate the numerical difficulties instability and non convergence encountered in fsi problem with strong added mass effect and its corresponding stable and convergent results by the proposed scheme m2 fig 5 gives the lifting coefficient curve and the tip displacement curve these two figures have double x and double y axes and the red and black curves represent results by m1 and m2 respectively the red curves show clearly that the lifting force on the plate changes between positive and negative values at continuous time steps and the maximum lifting coefficient exceeds 1000 within 7 computational time steps which leads to the trailing edge tip displacement of the single flexible plate oscillates severely at the meantime the lifting coefficient curve indicates the numerical difficulties instability and divergence encountered by using m1 in the strong added mass scenario the obtained tip displacement curve also violates the correct hydrodynamic behavior of the flexible plate in uniform flows however the proposed loosely coupled scheme m2 considering the added mass in governing equation of the structure creates convergence and stable solutions the black curves show that the sinusoidal lifting coefficient grows gradually and eventually its amplitude keeps stable at about 0 5 the stable hydrodynamic behavior of the single plate is achieved after tu 0 l 30 and the flapping amplitude is 0 258l the explanation is given as follows fig 6 illustrates the upward flapping motion velocity v y 0 and acceleration a y 0 of flexible plate under lifting force f l by the uniform flow drag force f d and added mass force f a are the hydrodynamic forces that hinder the motion of plate f i is the internal force of plate it is commonly known that lifting force induced by the uniform flow falls with the decreases of the deformation of flexible plate which drives the flow induced acceleration to go down 26 a y t n 1 a y t n 0 according to the force analysis in fig 6 eq 18 can also be written as 27 ρ l a y t n f i t n f l t n f d t n f a t n with f a t n λ a y t n in the loosely coupling scheme m1 the calculated eq 18 is 28 ρ l a y l t n f i t n f l t n f d t n f a t n 1 where al y t n is adopted to distinguish from the real time acceleration a y t n in eq 27 in strong added mass scenario λ ρ l a situation may occur according to eq 26 29 λ a y t n 1 λ a y t n ρ l a y t n eqs 27 and 29 are substituted into eq 28 30 ρ l a y l t n f l t n f d t n f i t n λ a y t n 1 f l t n f d t n f i t n λ a y t n ρ l a y t n 0 it can be seen that the obtained acceleration al y t n 0 which is not consistent with eq 26 consequently the simulation by m1 cannot describe the correct physical flapping motion and it may break down due to this divergence problem as shown by the red curves in fig 5 in order to overcome this problem eq 28 is modified as follows 31 ρ l a y l t n λ a y t n 1 f i t n f l t n f d t n f a t n 1 λ a y t n 1 in consideration of little change of lifting force at two consecutive time steps it can be assume that a y t n al y t n a y t n 1 then eq 31 changes to 32 ρ l λ a y l t n f i t n f l t n f d t n f a t n 1 λ a y t n 1 it prevents the calculated acceleration al y t n 0 and produces convergent results as shown by the black curves in fig 5 so eq 32 is adopted in the loosely coupling scheme m2 the first five natural frequencies of this single flexible plate s 0 25 and u 20 are 0 056 0 351 0 982 1 924 and 3 181 respectively to further study the tip displacement of its trailing edge its amplitude frequency spectrum is plotted in fig 7 a it indicates that a single dominant frequency of 0 599 characterizes the regular sinusoidal tip displacement curve this flow induced flapping frequency is between the values of the second and third natural modes the same phenomenon also appears in fig 7 b the generalized coordinates of each mode show that the amplitudes of the second and third modes are comparable with that of the first mode while the amplitudes of the fourth and fifth modes are rather small the overall response of the plate in uniform flows is obtained by superposing the amplitudes of each mode q j t as eq 23 so the influence of those high order modes fourth and fifth modes on the displacement of flexible plate is negligible fig 8 a shows the profile of this single flexible plate at various time instants during a complete cycle of flow induced flapping motion it can be seen that the flapping mode along the length of the plate is similar to the third mode of the cantilever beam which illustrates that the third mode influences the flapping motion of the plate most hereafter the flapping mode of the plate in case of s 0 25 and u 20 is referred to as 3rd mode and the mode that most influences the flapping motion is referred to as the primary mode watanabe et al 2002 several vortices contours in the wake zone of this single plate at different time instants are presented in fig 8 b f the shear layer shed from the trailing edge of the plate curls into wake zone and a pair of von kármán vortices occurs in one complete flapping cycle for corresponding flow fields please refer to the supplementary movies the numerical case of a single flexible plate with s 0 25 and u 20 is shown in the supplementary movie 1 another four simulation cases case 1 s 0 25 and u 17 5 case 2 s 0 05 and u 44 case 3 s 0 1 and u 35 5 and case 4 s 0 5 and u 14 are also studied number of natural modes j max 10 is adopted in the calculation of cases 2 and 3 their corresponding tip displacements of the trailing edge are presented in fig 9 the tip displacement decreases with time and finally the plate straightens in case 1 while the plates in the other three cases finally flap periodically with different time periods and amplitudes amplitude frequency analyses to the tip displacement history curves in fig 10 a show that the single dominant frequencies are 2 098 1 998 and 0 689 in cases 2 4 respectively it can be seen from the generalized coordinates of each mode in figs 10 b and c that the fourth mode in cases 2 and 3 exhibits larger amplitude than the second third and fifth modes do the influence of sixth mode on the displacement of flexible plate is limited obviously the fourth mode is the primary mode in cases 2 and 3 the corresponding flapping modes of the flexible plates in cases 2 and 3 are referred to as 4th mode the comparison between figs 5 b and 9 a indicates that different dimensionless velocities u decide the onset of the flapping of the flexible plate with same mass ratio s the comparison between figs 9 b c and d illustrates that different plates with various s flap at different dimensionless velocities u as reported by other researchers huang 1995 watanabe et al 2002 wang 2010 a critical stability boundary exists in the s u plane the flexible plate keeps stretched straight under the critical stability boundary above which a harmonic flapping motion is achieved fig 11 compares different theoretical and numerical critical stability boundaries in the figure the solid and dash dot lines indicate theoretical and numerical results by watanabe et al 2002 and wang 2010 respectively triangles and circles are our results and dash line is a fitted critical stability boundary we can see that on the one hand our solutions are closer to the theoretical results by watanabe et al 2002 than the numerical results by wang 2010 and on the other hand the solutions in strong added mass scenario with s 0 3 are obtained by our proposed loosely coupled scheme rather than the strongly coupled scheme by wang 2010 the primary mode of the flapping flexible plate is also presented in fig 11 5 2 two side by side flexible plates the flexible plates are used for the numerical study of collective behaviors such as fish schools and flying formation due to the simplicity of structural description peng et al 2018 a b indicated that few numerical simulations were performed for flow mediated interactions between two self propelled bodies and one related study zhu et al 2014a was mentioned different from a single flexible plate with low mass ratios in infinite flow domain hydrodynamic behaviors of the multiple plates are influenced by each other through the flow among them one plate can be seen as a confined boundary for another plate if side by side configuration is applied and jaiman et al 2014 proved theoretically that confined channel would lead to stronger added mass effect hereafter two side by side flexible plates one of the simplest group configurations for the basic element of collective behaviors are studied by the proposed loosely coupled scheme rather than the commonly used strongly coupled scheme the side by side configuration refers to fig 12 besides s and u the fsi problem of the parallel plates in uniform flows is also decided by another dimensionless parameter d d l d is the lateral spacing between the two fixed leading edges of the flexible plates experimental investigation zhang et al 2000 indicated that the lateral spacing determined the oscillating mode of flexible plates in which two parallel flexible filaments flapped in phase with each other when d 0 21 0 04 and out of phase when d 0 21 two identical plates of same s are studied numerically with changing u and d in order to present these two different types of hydrodynamic behaviors of the parallel plates and the reasons are discussed from the aspect of force 1 in phase oscillation the results of numerical case with s 1 u 6 and d 0 15 are presented fig 13 a shows the obtained stable tip displacements of the free edges of two parallel plates during in phase oscillation two parallel plates flap in phase with each other with the same amplitude about 0 205l and frequency fig 13 b illustrates the corresponding amplitude frequency spectrum of two flexible plates a single dominant frequency of 0 499 characterizes the regular sinusoidal tip displacement fig 14 a shows the profile of two flexible plates at various time instants during a complete cycle of flow induced flapping motion which illustrates that the second mode influences both parallel flexible plates most some typical wake structures during the whole flapping cycle are shown in fig 14 b h two parallel shear layers detached from the trailing edges of two plates at tu 0 l 500 mix together from tu 0 l 500 1 to tu 0 l 500 3 and finally a single von kármán vortex forms at tu 0 l 500 7 before where two new shed parallel shear layers start to generate and then the same process takes again for corresponding flow fields please refer to the supplementary movie 2 compared to the vortices contours of a single flexible plate in fig 8 the overall wake structure is the same that a pair of von kármán vortices generated during a complete cycle except for the mixing process of two detached shear layers existing in the numerical case of two parallel plates during in phase oscillation 2 out of phase oscillation numerical case of s 1 u 5 5 and d 0 4 is simulated the tip displacement history curves of the free edges of two parallel plates and their corresponding amplitude frequency spectrum are illustrated in fig 15 the two flexible plates oscillate symmetrically about their center line y 0 2l in which the peak value of plate a is equal to the valley value of plate b and the valley value of plate a is equal to the peak value of plate b the peak displacement 0 189l of plate a is larger than its valley displacement 0 163l both plates vibrate with a single dominant frequency of 0 5 this mode is defined as the out of phase oscillation fig 16 shows the shapes of two flexible plates and some typical vortices contours during one out of phase oscillation circle for corresponding flow fields please refer to the supplementary movie 3 two shear layers generated at the upper surface and lower surface of the leading edge of each plate detach from the trailing edge at tu 0 l 45 05 and then the vortices of opposite signs are formed behind the trailing edge of two plates at tu 0 l 45 45 in which the upper plate produces clockwise vortex and the lower plate counterclockwise vortex two pairs of vortices mushroom shape vortices are swept downstream together by uniform flows at tu 0 l 45 75 from then on two end tips of plates start to moving closer to each other and the spacing between two end tips narrows down where the enclosed fluid is released like a droplet and it spreads along the center line of the two plates into the wake region from tu 0 l 45 8 to tu 0 l 46 55 this same phenomenon was also described in the experimental study zhang et al 2000 in order to explore the reasons of two different oscillating modes the lifting coefficients of two parallel flexible plates are given in fig 17 the directions of forces on the two in phase oscillating plates are the same while forces on the two out of phase oscillating plates are the opposite the nearly same positive and negative amplitudes in fig 17 a make the average lifting coefficient equal to zero under which two parallel flexible plates flap synchronously like a single flow induced flapping plate with the same peak and valley amplitude of 0 205l as seen in fig 13 a the opposite lifting forces repulsive forces in fig 17 b of unequally positive and negative amplitudes 0 821 and 0 566 drive two plates flap symmetrically about their center line with different peak and valley amplitude of 0 189l and 0 163l as shown in fig 15 a the hydrodynamic behavior of two parallel flexible plates with s 1 u 6 and d 0 4 is also simulated fig 18 shows that the amplitude of tip displacement increases beyond 0 2l at around tu 0 l 30 1 when two parallel flexible plates collide with each other and then the simulation stops due to the updated fluid grid of negative volume in order to carry on the calculation contact mechanics should be introduced to describe the corresponding collision behavior between those two plates which is our future work comparison of two different hydrodynamic behaviors in figs 13 a and fig 18 illustrates the conclusion that d determines the oscillating mode of two parallel flexible plates zhang et al 2000 and comparison of results in figs 15 a and fig 18 indicates that u influences the amplitude of tip displacement two typical hydrodynamic behaviors in phase and out of phase oscillations of two parallel cantilever plates found in experiment zhang et al 2000 are simulated by the proposed loosely coupled scheme and the flow details are accurately captured although collective behaviors involving the self propelled motion of the flapping plates are not studied directly here it is easy to see from section 2 2 that if the self propelled motion is defined in eq 4c instead of the fixed boundary condition of the cantilever plates in the present paper the corresponding collective behavior can also be simulated by this proposed loosely coupled scheme 6 conclusions the present contribution is concern with the provision of a stable loosely coupled scheme for the fsi problem of the flow induced flapping dynamics of 2d flexible plate with strong added mass effect the commercial cfd solver fluent version 13 0 1 is extended with a dedicated user defined function udf in which the modified governing equation of the structure field considering its added mass in incompressible flow field is solved by mode superposition method hydrodynamic response of a single cantilever flexible plate with mass ratio s 1 in a uniform flow u 7 is simulated by the proposed loosely coupled scheme comparison of the tip displacement and lifting coefficient to the solutions by a strongly coupled scheme illustrates the accuracy of the proposed scheme and then this scheme is further used to simulate the flow induced flapping responses of a single flexible plate with various low mass ratios in different uniform flows through which the numerical stability of the loosely coupled scheme is assessed besides as a function of mass ratio s the flapping dynamics of a single cantilever plate in various flow velocities u presents two distinct states stretched straight and harmonic flapping states the harmonic flapping motions of the flexible plates with various mass ratios are discussed it is found that the deformed shape of the flexible plate with lower mass ratio is influenced more by its higher natural mode finally the flow induced hydrodynamic responses of two parallel cantilever plates are studied different from a single flexible plate in infinite flow domain hydrodynamic behaviors of the multiple plates are influenced by each other through the flow among them in which intensity unknown added mass effect occurs the in phase and out of phase oscillations of two parallel cantilever plates are obtained by this proposed scheme and the flow details are accurately presented this proposed loosely coupled scheme can be easily extended to study the collective behavior only requiring the definition of the corresponding self propelled motion of the flapping plates
