revealing the importance of scale effect which is linked to the degree of different progressive failure as the anchor scale changes the scale effect is pictured because of the distinction between the strength of small size specimen within the laboratory which of a bigger specimen in real size omine et al 2005 it has been stated that the progressive failure is linked to bifurcation or shear banding phenomena papanastasiou and vardoulakis 1989 furthermore the importance of the consideration of grain size effect has been detected by numerous researchers tatsuoka et al 1997 sakai et al 1998 cerato and lutenegger 2007 athani et al 2017 during the study of scale effect if the grain size effect is ignored it might presumably considerably overestimate the pull out capacity of the anchor in full scale athani et al 2017 so to use the framework of elastoplasticity in fem to deal with the scale effect an in depth study is required in relation to calibration for the sophisticated hardening softening constitutive models and verification as well as validation of rigorous fe models for some important problems therefore this research is designed to simulate the ultimate uplift capacity of a shallow circular anchor in different types of sand using the widely used numerical technique fem and a constitutive relation of sand developed in such a way that it defines explicitly all the affecting factors in a relatively simple but sophisticated way this research also pays special attention to the scale effect in the traditional small scale models in relation to the proper modelling of progressive failure in the sand and tries to identify the different components of above mentioned effects 2 physical modelling the experimental setup is presented in fig 1 a 590 mm diameter cylindrical container is used as a soil bin so that it does not give any boundary effects flat and circular steel anchor foundation with three different diameters i e 5 10 and 15 cm with a 5 mm thick steel plate is used to conduct the anchor pull out test this test is directed at an embedment ratio h d where h depth of sand mass and d diameter of the anchor of 2 in a homogeneous bed as illustrated in fig 2 a load cell is linked with an anchor bar to measure the vertical pull out load at pulling out speeds of 0 03 mm min and a displacement transducer is equipped on the top of the anchor bar to measure the upward displacement the pull out mechanism of anchors in the sand mass is observed by keeping contact in the side of a glass wall a computerized data acquisition system is used to record the data the movement of the anchor is controlled until the residual conditions are obtained with the help of a direct current dc motor air dried toyoura sand having specific gravity gs 2 64 average particle size d50 0 016 cm maximum void ratio emax 0 98 minimum void ratio emin 0 61 and no fine content less than 0 00075 cm is used in this test for the construction of the ground above the anchor foundation air pluviation method is used with the help of two sieves in the mould the test is conducted on toyoura sand of different densities obtained by differing sieve opening size and sand falling height however the maintenance of unvarying density is necessary for the formation of the depth of the sand mass depending on the sand falling height and the deposition intensity during the air pluviation process various uniform densities can be obtained to estimate the average unit weight in the homogenous sand mass the sand is weighed after the anchor pull out test owing to the difference of sieve opening size and sand falling height the density of sand varies from dense to loose relative density dr 95 5 and the density γd 1630 kg m3 to 1350 kg m3 allowing an error of 10 kg m3 the density of the ground is measured by using 6 hundred cc cylinder shaped samplers d 50 mm which are placed on the soil bin s bottom 3 numerical modelling in numerical modelling an explicit dynamic relaxation method tanaka and kawamoto 1987 sakai and tanaka 2007 is used due to its robust ability to handle extremely nonlinear material to deal with the bifurcation problems so that any specific measures need not be taken easy to be coded and very small data storage are needed owing to its explicit nature use of approximate critical damping for linear isoparametric elements with reduced integration can implicitly suppress the hourglass modes at failure this method is incorporated in the personally developed fortran program in conjunction with the generalized return mapping algorithm by considering an elasto plastic framework incorporating isotropic hardening softening law tanaka and sakai 1993 following the non associated flow rule including shear band sakai and tanaka 2007 a shear band sb is a narrow band where all the plastic strains are localized after peak as illustrated in fig 3 the inclusion of a shear band is essential to make the constitutive model and its calibration independent on the size of fe as the prevailing solutions of strain softening material are firmly reliant on the size of mesh several approaches such as pietruszczak and mroz 1981 suggested an uncomplicated form of mesh size reliant on hardening modulus technique for resolution of the mesh dependent pathology of fe solutions following this technique shear banding can be incorporated through a strain localization parameter s according to one assumption of elastoplasticity theory the assumption is that total strain increments d ε can be decomposed additively into elastic d ε e and plastic d ε p parts as follows tanaka and sakai 1993 sakai and tanaka 2007 1 d ε d ε e s d ε p where s is the ratio of the area of a single shear band in each element fb to the total area of the finite element fe however the decision of fb is taken based on the sb thickness moreover the effects of the sb orientation in an apiece element is ignored and thus the approximate form of sb considered in this study can be defined as 2 s s b f e the sb thickness for sands is about 10 30 times of mean grain size diameter of a particle mühlhaus and vardoulakis 1987 yoshida et al 1993 mc yield criterion is used as its material parameters are well known in soil mechanics model tests and drucker prager dp potential function is used due to its smoothness and easy differentiability the yield function can be introduced as 3 f α κ i 1 j 2 d g θ κ 1 0 where i 1 is the first invariant of stress i e hydrostatic stress component positive in compression j 2 d is the second stress invariant i e the deviatoric stress and g θ is the function of lode angle θ in case of mc material model it can be defined as 4 g θ 3 sin φ m o b 2 3 cos θ 2 sin θ sin φ m o b where 5 θ 1 3 cos 1 3 3 2 j 3 d j 2 d 3 2 and j 3 d is the third deviatoric stress invariants the plastic strain rates can be calculated from non associated flow rules expressed as 6 d ε p d λ d g d σ where g and d λ are the plastic potential and a positive constant known as plastic rate multiplier respectively the plastic potential function takes a similar form as the yield function equation 3 with g θ 1 0 in equation 6 as 7 g α κ i 1 j 2 d κ 2 0 the internal variable κ can be found by considering the incremental deviatoric plastic strains expressed as 8 κ 2 d e i i p 2 1 δ j k d e j k p 2 1 2 due to the use of dry sand in simulation and test in this study the cohesion can be ignored and so the function κ can be ignored in equations 3 and 6 the frictional function α κ can be expressed as 9 α κ α p 2 κ ε f κ ε f m hardening regime κ ε f 10 α κ α r α p α r e κ ε f ε r 2 softening regime κ ε f where m ε f and ε r are the constants which considers the hardening softening material condition and 11 α p 2 s i n φ p 3 3 s i n φ p 12 α r 2 s i n φ r 3 3 s i n φ r where φ p is the peak and φ r is the residual frictional angle respectively for plastic potential functions the constant α can be expressed as 13 α 2 sin ψ 3 3 sin ψ from the modified rowe s stress dilatancy relationship the dilatancy angle ψ can be expressed as 14 ψ sin 1 sin φ m o b sin φ r 1 sin φ m o b sin φ r where 15 sin φ m o b 3 3 α κ 2 3 α κ 16 φ r κ φ r 1 β e κ ε d 2 where β and ε d are the stress dilatancy material parameters controlling the rate of dilatancy so therefore these 5 numbers of indeterminate constitutive parameters m ε f ε r β and ε d have to be optimized in the calibration process by back prediction of the anchor pull out test the problems of circular anchor are analysed in this study using the four node quadrilateral isoparametric finite elements fig 4 to overcome the boundary effects the mesh extends at a distance of a minimum of 4d from the anchor edges moreover finer discretization is used in the centre with the quadrilateral elements than edges where limited deformation is expected furthermore along the anchor boundary differential quasi elastic displacements are introduced until failure at minor successive increments and the corresponding nodal forces are averaged with respect to the displacement control nodes to ascertain the ultimate load the normalized displacement factor δ d where δ presents the displacement of the ground and the pull out resistance factor np p γdha γd is the effective unit weight of dry sand and a is the surface area of the anchor are obtained by considering the proposals of lindsay 1980 whereas δ is the displacement and p is the uplift load 4 calibration of hardening and softening material models the accurate modelling of the stress strain relationship obtained from the experiment depends on the accurate constitutive models which is so much challenging task for the practical engineers in this context the calibration of constitutive models of linear elastic material is very simple on the other hand most of the engineering materials found in nature such as soils display the nonlinear hardening softening behaviour which can be modelled by sophisticated strain hardening softening material model having an elasto plastic framework with a non associated flow rule costing of numerous parameters and so calibration is necessary to fit those parameter values by laboratory test results before used in the numerical analysis moreover if the model is highly nonlinear the mathematical complexities amalgamated with the accuracy and sophistication of the model can be overcome by costing more parameters rokonuzzaman and sakai 2010 for this reason extensive numerical tests on the constitutive relations of toyoura sand of different relative densities and the effects of different parameters of the constitutive relations on the results are examined further a parametric study is done to find out the appropriate material parameter values to use in the sophisticated strain hardening softening model a series of drained triaxial compression tests are performed on cylindrical saturated toyoura sand gs 2 64 emax 0 977 emin 0 605 uc 1 46 no fines samples prepared by air pluviation method of diameter and height is 70 mm and 150 mm respectively for different densities and confining pressures fukushima and tatsuoka 1984 fe meshes used for the analysis are presented in fig 5 the results of the parametric studies on the hardening softening material parameters are presented in figs 6 and 7 by parametric study it is detected that when the hardening softening material parameters εf εr and m are 0 1 the calculated result coincides with the experimental result in dense sand on the other hand when the hardening softening material parameters εf εr and m are 0 1 0 4 and 0 2 respectively the calculated outcome is agreed with the experimental outcome in medium sand the parameters for loose sand are adopted from sakai and tanaka 2007 after the parametric study the selected parameters are used for the analysis is presented in table 1 here 0 3 cm wide shear band is adopted which equals to twenty times of mean particle diameter d50 of the toyoura sand yoshida et al 1993 fig 8 presents the effect of two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d fem model on stress strain volume change relationship small difference is observed on stress strain volume change relationship using the 2d and the 3d fem models due to the difference in their kinematic boundary conditions the 2d model constraints are greater than the 3d models as the 3d numerical simulation needs a larger amount of elements and therefore a larger amount of integration points nodes time and resources are needed in comparison with the 2d model however there is no effect of aspect ratio in the circular anchor as in the rectangular anchor volumetric strain is more in 3d model the differences between the results from those models are negligible and so 2d model is used for the analysis figs 9 and 10 presents the stress strain volume change relationship achieved from the research recommended by fukushima and tatsuoka 1984 and the corresponding fe analysis the effect of the shear band on the material parameters are also analysed in this study for the analysis a single element and multi element of 56 is used the experimental result indicates close agreement with the analysis considering maximum deviator stress without the shear band the softening part is affected due to the element size especially in dense sand and so due to the mesh size effect after the peak the shear band is introduced in this study 5 validation and effect of constitutive models besides the effects of different constitutive models on the anchor foundation are examined the curves shown in fig 11 depict the experimental and numerical relationships between the pullout resistance and the displacement factor of the circular anchor foundation h d 2 and d 10 cm at different density condition by considering different constitutive models from all the curves three distinct phases are evident a sharp increase of pullout resistance with anchor displacement in the initial phase followed by a shallow decrease and finally in the residual phase the pullout resistance remains unaffected with the further uplifting of the anchor from the overall shape of the load displacement curve it can be assumed that progressive failure is attributed and strain hardening softening model is presented better outcomes with respect to the other models with the experiment which is validated for the further study 6 effect of mesh size calculating step size and shear band also the effect of mesh size and calculating step size constants of the constitutive models and shear band option on the anchor foundation are studied due to the sensitiveness of mesh size in the fe solutions the numerical model integrating hardening softening rule must be authenticated before used for the analysis of the anchor foundation for the analysis of the anchor foundation h d 2 d 10 cm 2400 quadrilateral finite elements 5 mm in size 1536 quadrilateral finite elements 6 25 mm in size and 600 quadrilateral finite elements 10 mm in size in the central zone are used as presented in fig 12 the curves in fig 13 point out the relationship between the displacement factor and the pullout resistance factor due to having the shear band thickness in the constitutive model the load displacement behaviour of anchor foundation is independent on the mesh size thus re meshing is avoided by scaling up a smaller proportional model in the parametric study in the pre peak regime deformation of a given sand element under a uniform boundary stress condition is analogous strain localization starts suddenly at the peak stress state it is assumed that shear bands start to develop at the peak for the post peak parts strains are the ones defined locally within a band including a shear band it is assumed that the rate of strain softening is independent of bedding plane orientation angle and φmob becomes a constant value φr at the same relative displacement across a shear band the stress strain relationship inside a shear band is independent of the size shape and boundary conditions of a given element containing the shear band this relation and shear band thickness is unique for a given mass of sand and independent of the density and pressure level in the absence of a shear band the effect of mesh size is predominant after peak especially for softening dense sand and so the result is influenced and so a shear band is used in the further analysis of anchor problem fig 14 shows the mesh size dependency in shear strain and the deformation pattern of the specimen at different density conditions though the overall distributions of the shear strain are almost similar in all meshes it is much sharper in finer mesh than in the coarser mesh on the other hand there is not much difference in the deformation pattern figs 15 17 shows the influence of the calculating steps in different meshes from all the curves it can be recapitulated that to obtain a stable result more than 5000 calculating steps are needed after that the relationship between the pull out resistance and the displacement factor will be the same in all the calculating steps figs 18 20 shows the mesh size dependency in different calculating steps it is observed that more than the calculating steps 5000 the peak strength is not affected at all in different meshes while the residual strength changed in such a tendency that the finer the mesh is less the residual strength will be when the number of elements is 1536 and 2400 the difference between the residual strength is almost zero and so for further study calculating step 15000 is selected 7 effect of material parameters it is assumed that the progression of localized deformation is obtained from the triaxial compression test with the pull out test the hardening softening material parameters values εf εr and m are evaluated on the back prediction of the anchor pullout test by comparing the experimental and the finite element analysis results calculated and experimental results for d 10 cm at h d 2 are presented in fig 21 which presents the pullout resistance and displacement factor curves after the parametric study the same values are obtained as observed in calibration results using the sand of different densities table 1 already summarized the parameters used in the finite element analysis 8 study of progressive failure according to terzaghi and peck 1948 it can be expressed as the term progressive failure indicates the spreading of the failure over the potential surface of sliding from a point or line towards the boundaries of the surface while the stresses in the clay near the periphery of this surface approach the peak value the shearing resistance of the clay at the area where the failure started is already approaching the much smaller ultimate value as a consequence the total shearing force that acts on a surface of sliding at the instant of complete failure is considerably smaller than the shearing resistance computed on the basis of the peak values thus progressive failure can be referred to as the state of affairs which indicates the consecutive failure of individual elements of soil in a soil mass this method spreads in an area and needs time to occur whereas time aspects might not continuously be necessary beneath some circumstances an understanding of spatial progressive failure is most vital lo 1972 lo also stated that the prime necessary condition for the occurrence of progressive failure is that the material should follow the stress strain softening relationship a study of taylor 1937 on shearing resistance on sands using effective stress concept stated the associated progression of failure with the redistribution of shear stress on a potential failure surface and neglected the propagation of progression of failure direction but the importance of the determination of propagation of progressive failure is so much crucial for estimating the available shearing resistance along the sliding surface the failure in the ground when loaded with an anchor is highly progressive in a view that the soil s peak strength is not mobilized along potential failure surfaces while the perfectly plastic assumption leads to that the peak soil strength is mobilized concurrently along the potential failure surface therefore the soil shear strength is not concurrently mobilized at all points of a slip surface it is also supposed that the strength properties of soil are unaltered even if large strains are introduced by loading however this hypothesis is insignificant for the soils categorized by noticeable strain softening behaviour like dense sands actually in these materials it happens that a few segments of the sand initially fail due to loading with the shear strain that is situated in a zone of restricted thickness shear band with the increase of strain inside this zone soil quality decreases from the peak towards the critical state because of the consequential stress redistribution the shear band spreads in the sand and a slip surface dynamically creates up to causing the collapse of the soil foundation framework in the case of the failure condition the average strength mobilized along the slip surface is not as much as the pinnacle quality and more prominent than the quality at the critical condition of the sand under consideration for the documentation of this failure phenomenon the amassed plastic deformation zones above the anchor calculated for any loading stage d 10 cm at h d 2 at different densities of sand are illustrated in fig 22 for the same δ d ratio δ is larger for larger d as the shear bandwidth is independent of pressure level its ratio with d decreases proportionally as d increases then once shear bands have appeared the relative displacement across a shear band at corresponding points becomes larger for larger d resulting in a larger ratio of shear band length relative to d and more non uniform distribution of φmob thus a larger degree of progressive failure in fig 22a some loading stages i e a c are presented to support the demonstration of the outcomes fig 22b shows that at stage c the slip surface is inclined in case of dense sand and vertical in case of loose sand it is also evident that in dense sand failure is not fully happened and on the other hand for loose sand the failure is outcropped on the surface and so it can be said that the failure of dense sand is more progressive than the others as less unloading is required to initiate the failure that spreads over a larger space within the soil mass 9 width scale effect the problems of the transformation of the model test results to a prototype is mainly due to width scale effect the scale effects are examined by varying h and d proportionally e g the fe mesh for h d 2 d 5 cm is scaled up by a factor of 10 to have anchor with h d 2 d 50 cm and this procedure is supported by such kind of numerical model insensitive to mesh size effect fig 23 presents the relationship between the experimental results and the numerical results at h d 2 d 5 10 and 15 cm which is presented that numerical results well predict the experimental results figs 24 27 presents the uplift resistance displacement factor relationships at different embedment figs 28 and 29 display that npu and δu d decreases with d which may be attributed to the combined effect of particle size and stress level according to tatsuoka et al 1991 and increases with the increase of the embedment this trend of scale effect with varying embedment is attributed to the various degree of progressive failure with shear band development due to high confining pressure and particle size effect or more progressive nature of the failure of the material the scale effect is predominant in dense sand on the other hand less softening in the material behaviour so less scale effect in medium and or loose sand in 1 g test result the scale effect consists of the effect of the pressure level and particle size the latter effect is observed in centrifuge tests with varying the g level using the same anchor size and the same type of sand as a small scale physical model has high dimensionless power care must be taken while extrapolating the laboratory model test results small scale to the full scale structures 10 conclusions progressive failure behaviour mainly occurs due to the non mobilization of peak strength of soil in potential failure regions whereas scale effect is predominant in softening soil it is observed that based on calibration test results the numerical models can well predict the experimental stress strain data points from element tests very closely using the appropriate set of material constants of the constitutive models and yield surface as the mc model and potential surface as the smooth dp model with shear band effect using the explicit dynamic relaxation method framework the sophisticated hardening softening material model shows better performance as it is capable to closely predict the pull out resistance and settlement patterns costing five numbers of material parameters due to the consideration of the shear band thickness in the constitutive model the load displacement behaviour of anchor foundation is independent on the mesh size the peak resistance factor presents a decreasing tendency with the increase of the width of the foundation which is scale effect the failure pattern of dense sand is more progressive than loose sand and so scale effect is predominant in dense sand the settlement at the ultimate bearing capacity of the anchor foundation always increases with the decrease of width

height however the maintenance of unvarying density is necessary for the formation of the depth of the sand mass depending on the sand falling height and the deposition intensity during the air pluviation process various uniform densities can be obtained to estimate the average unit weight in the homogenous sand mass the sand is weighed after the anchor pull out test owing to the difference of sieve opening size and sand falling height the density of sand varies from dense to loose relative density dr 95 5 and the density γd 1630 kg m3 to 1350 kg m3 allowing an error of 10 kg m3 the density of the ground is measured by using 6 hundred cc cylinder shaped samplers d 50 mm which are placed on the soil bin s bottom 3 numerical modelling in numerical modelling an explicit dynamic relaxation method tanaka and kawamoto 1987 sakai and tanaka 2007 is used due to its robust ability to handle extremely nonlinear material to deal with the bifurcation problems so that any specific measures need not be taken easy to be coded and very small data storage are needed owing to its explicit nature use of approximate critical damping for linear isoparametric elements with reduced integration can implicitly suppress the hourglass modes at failure this method is incorporated in the personally developed fortran program in conjunction with the generalized return mapping algorithm by considering an elasto plastic framework incorporating isotropic hardening softening law tanaka and sakai 1993 following the non associated flow rule including shear band sakai and tanaka 2007 a shear band sb is a narrow band where all the plastic strains are localized after peak as illustrated in fig 3 the inclusion of a shear band is essential to make the constitutive model and its calibration independent on the size of fe as the prevailing solutions of strain softening material are firmly reliant on the size of mesh several approaches such as pietruszczak and mroz 1981 suggested an uncomplicated form of mesh size reliant on hardening modulus technique for resolution of the mesh dependent pathology of fe solutions following this technique shear banding can be incorporated through a strain localization parameter s according to one assumption of elastoplasticity theory the assumption is that total strain increments d ε can be decomposed additively into elastic d ε e and plastic d ε p parts as follows tanaka and sakai 1993 sakai and tanaka 2007 1 d ε d ε e s d ε p where s is the ratio of the area of a single shear band in each element fb to the total area of the finite element fe however the decision of fb is taken based on the sb thickness moreover the effects of the sb orientation in an apiece element is ignored and thus the approximate form of sb considered in this study can be defined as 2 s s b f e the sb thickness for sands is about 10 30 times of mean grain size diameter of a particle mühlhaus and vardoulakis 1987 yoshida et al 1993 mc yield criterion is used as its material parameters are well known in soil mechanics model tests and drucker prager dp potential function is used due to its smoothness and easy differentiability the yield function can be introduced as 3 f α κ i 1 j 2 d g θ κ 1 0 where i 1 is the first invariant of stress i e hydrostatic stress component positive in compression j 2 d is the second stress invariant i e the deviatoric stress and g θ is the function of lode angle θ in case of mc material model it can be defined as 4 g θ 3 sin φ m o b 2 3 cos θ 2 sin θ sin φ m o b where 5 θ 1 3 cos 1 3 3 2 j 3 d j 2 d 3 2 and j 3 d is the third deviatoric stress invariants the plastic strain rates can be calculated from non associated flow rules expressed as 6 d ε p d λ d g d σ where g and d λ are the plastic potential and a positive constant known as plastic rate multiplier respectively the plastic potential function takes a similar form as the yield function equation 3 with g θ 1 0 in equation 6 as 7 g α κ i 1 j 2 d κ 2 0 the internal variable κ can be found by considering the incremental deviatoric plastic strains expressed as 8 κ 2 d e i i p 2 1 δ j k d e j k p 2 1 2 due to the use of dry sand in simulation and test in this study the cohesion can be ignored and so the function κ can be ignored in equations 3 and 6 the frictional function α κ can be expressed as 9 α κ α p 2 κ ε f κ ε f m hardening regime κ ε f 10 α κ α r α p α r e κ ε f ε r 2 softening regime κ ε f where m ε f and ε r are the constants which considers the hardening softening material condition and 11 α p 2 s i n φ p 3 3 s i n φ p 12 α r 2 s i n φ r 3 3 s i n φ r where φ p is the peak and φ r is the residual frictional angle respectively for plastic potential functions the constant α can be expressed as 13 α 2 sin ψ 3 3 sin ψ from the modified rowe s stress dilatancy relationship the dilatancy angle ψ can be expressed as 14 ψ sin 1 sin φ m o b sin φ r 1 sin φ m o b sin φ r where 15 sin φ m o b 3 3 α κ 2 3 α κ 16 φ r κ φ r 1 β e κ ε d 2 where β and ε d are the stress dilatancy material parameters controlling the rate of dilatancy so therefore these 5 numbers of indeterminate constitutive parameters m ε f ε r β and ε d have to be optimized in the calibration process by back prediction of the anchor pull out test the problems of circular anchor are analysed in this study using the four node quadrilateral isoparametric finite elements fig 4 to overcome the boundary effects the mesh extends at a distance of a minimum of 4d from the anchor edges moreover finer discretization is used in the centre with the quadrilateral elements than edges where limited deformation is expected furthermore along the anchor boundary differential quasi elastic displacements are introduced until failure at minor successive increments and the corresponding nodal forces are averaged with respect to the displacement control nodes to ascertain the ultimate load the normalized displacement factor δ d where δ presents the displacement of the ground and the pull out resistance factor np p γdha γd is the effective unit weight of dry sand and a is the surface area of the anchor are obtained by considering the proposals of lindsay 1980 whereas δ is the displacement and p is the uplift load 4 calibration of hardening and softening material models the accurate modelling of the stress strain relationship obtained from the experiment depends on the accurate constitutive models which is so much challenging task for the practical engineers in this context the calibration of constitutive models of linear elastic material is very simple on the other hand most of the engineering materials found in nature such as soils display the nonlinear hardening softening behaviour which can be modelled by sophisticated strain hardening softening material model having an elasto plastic framework with a non associated flow rule costing of numerous parameters and so calibration is necessary to fit those parameter values by laboratory test results before used in the numerical analysis moreover if the model is highly nonlinear the mathematical complexities amalgamated with the accuracy and sophistication of the model can be overcome by costing more parameters rokonuzzaman and sakai 2010 for this reason extensive numerical tests on the constitutive relations of toyoura sand of different relative densities and the effects of different parameters of the constitutive relations on the results are examined further a parametric study is done to find out the appropriate material parameter values to use in the sophisticated strain hardening softening model a series of drained triaxial compression tests are performed on cylindrical saturated toyoura sand gs 2 64 emax 0 977 emin 0 605 uc 1 46 no fines samples prepared by air pluviation method of diameter and height is 70 mm and 150 mm respectively for different densities and confining pressures fukushima and tatsuoka 1984 fe meshes used for the analysis are presented in fig 5 the results of the parametric studies on the hardening softening material parameters are presented in figs 6 and 7 by parametric study it is detected that when the hardening softening material parameters εf εr and m are 0 1 the calculated result coincides with the experimental result in dense sand on the other hand when the hardening softening material parameters εf εr and m are 0 1 0 4 and 0 2 respectively the calculated outcome is agreed with the experimental outcome in medium sand the parameters for loose sand are adopted from sakai and tanaka 2007 after the parametric study the selected parameters are used for the analysis is presented in table 1 here 0 3 cm wide shear band is adopted which equals to twenty times of mean particle diameter d50 of the toyoura sand yoshida et al 1993 fig 8 presents the effect of two dimensional 2d and three dimensional 3d fem model on stress strain volume change relationship small difference is observed on stress strain volume change relationship using the 2d and the 3d fem models due to the difference in their kinematic boundary conditions the 2d model constraints are greater than the 3d models as the 3d numerical simulation needs a larger amount of elements and therefore a larger amount of integration points nodes time and resources are needed in comparison with the 2d model however there is no effect of aspect ratio in the circular anchor as in the rectangular anchor volumetric strain is more in 3d model the differences between the results from those models are negligible and so 2d model is used for the analysis figs 9 and 10 presents the stress strain volume change relationship achieved from the research recommended by fukushima and tatsuoka 1984 and the corresponding fe analysis the effect of the shear band on the material parameters are also analysed in this study for the analysis a single element and multi element of 56 is used the experimental result indicates close agreement with the analysis considering maximum deviator stress without the shear band the softening part is affected due to the element size especially in dense sand and so due to the mesh size effect after the peak the shear band is introduced in this study 5 validation and effect of constitutive models besides the effects of different constitutive models on the anchor foundation are examined the curves shown in fig 11 depict the experimental and numerical relationships between the pullout resistance and the displacement factor of the circular anchor foundation h d 2 and d 10 cm at different density condition by considering different constitutive models from all the curves three distinct phases are evident a sharp increase of pullout resistance with anchor displacement in the initial phase followed by a shallow decrease and finally in the residual phase the pullout resistance remains unaffected with the further uplifting of the anchor from the overall shape of the load displacement curve it can be assumed that progressive failure is attributed and strain hardening softening model is presented better outcomes with respect to the other models with the experiment which is validated for the further study 6 effect of mesh size calculating step size and shear band also the effect of mesh size and calculating step size constants of the constitutive models and shear band option on the anchor foundation are studied due to the sensitiveness of mesh size in the fe solutions the numerical model integrating hardening softening rule must be authenticated before used for the analysis of the anchor foundation for the analysis of the anchor foundation h d 2 d 10 cm 2400 quadrilateral finite elements 5 mm in size 1536 quadrilateral finite elements 6 25 mm in size and 600 quadrilateral finite elements 10 mm in size in the central zone are used as presented in fig 12 the curves in fig 13 point out the relationship between the displacement factor and the pullout resistance factor due to having the shear band thickness in the constitutive model the load displacement behaviour of anchor foundation is independent on the mesh size thus re meshing is avoided by scaling up a smaller proportional model in the parametric study in the pre peak regime deformation of a given sand element under a uniform boundary stress condition is analogous strain localization starts suddenly at the peak stress state it is assumed that shear bands start to develop at the peak for the post peak parts strains are the ones defined locally within a band including a shear band it is assumed that the rate of strain softening is independent of bedding plane orientation angle and φmob becomes a constant value φr at the same relative displacement across a shear band the stress strain relationship inside a shear band is independent of the size shape and boundary conditions of a given element containing the shear band this relation and shear band thickness is unique for a given mass of sand and independent of the density and pressure level in the absence of a shear band the effect of mesh size is predominant after peak especially for softening dense sand and so the result is influenced and so a shear band is used in the further analysis of anchor problem fig 14 shows the mesh size dependency in shear strain and the deformation pattern of the specimen at different density conditions though the overall distributions of the shear strain are almost similar in all meshes it is much sharper in finer mesh than in the coarser mesh on the other hand there is not much difference in the deformation pattern figs 15 17 shows the influence of the calculating steps in different meshes from all the curves it can be recapitulated that to obtain a stable result more than 5000 calculating steps are needed after that the relationship between the pull out resistance and the displacement factor will be the same in all the calculating steps figs 18 20 shows the mesh size dependency in different calculating steps it is observed that more than the calculating steps 5000 the peak strength is not affected at all in different meshes while the residual strength changed in such a tendency that the finer the mesh is less the residual strength will be when the number of elements is 1536 and 2400 the difference between the residual strength is almost zero and so for further study calculating step 15000 is selected 7 effect of material parameters it is assumed that the progression of localized deformation is obtained from the triaxial compression test with the pull out test the hardening softening material parameters values εf εr and m are evaluated on the back prediction of the anchor pullout test by comparing the experimental and the finite element analysis results calculated and experimental results for d 10 cm at h d 2 are presented in fig 21 which presents the pullout resistance and displacement factor curves after the parametric study the same values are obtained as observed in calibration results using the sand of different densities table 1 already summarized the parameters used in the finite element analysis 8 study of progressive failure according to terzaghi and peck 1948 it can be expressed as the term progressive failure indicates the spreading of the failure over the potential surface of sliding from a point or line towards the boundaries of the surface while the stresses in the clay near the periphery of this surface approach the peak value the shearing resistance of the clay at the area where the failure started is already approaching the much smaller ultimate value as a consequence the total shearing force that acts on a surface of sliding at the instant of complete failure is considerably smaller than the shearing resistance computed on the basis of the peak values thus progressive failure can be referred to as the state of affairs which indicates the consecutive failure of individual elements of soil in a soil mass this method spreads in an area and needs time to occur whereas time aspects might not continuously be necessary beneath some circumstances an understanding of spatial progressive failure is most vital lo 1972 lo also stated that the prime necessary condition for the occurrence of progressive failure is that the material should follow the stress strain softening relationship a study of taylor 1937 on shearing resistance on sands using effective stress concept stated the associated progression of failure with the redistribution of shear stress on a potential failure surface and neglected the propagation of progression of failure direction but the importance of the determination of propagation of progressive failure is so much crucial for estimating the available shearing resistance along the sliding surface the failure in the ground when loaded with an anchor is highly progressive in a view that the soil s peak strength is not mobilized along potential failure surfaces while the perfectly plastic assumption leads to that the peak soil strength is mobilized concurrently along the potential failure surface therefore the soil shear strength is not concurrently mobilized at all points of a slip surface it is also supposed that the strength properties of soil are unaltered even if large strains are introduced by loading however this hypothesis is insignificant for the soils categorized by noticeable strain softening behaviour like dense sands actually in these materials it happens that a few segments of the sand initially fail due to loading with the shear strain that is situated in a zone of restricted thickness shear band with the increase of strain inside this zone soil quality decreases from the peak towards the critical state because of the consequential stress redistribution the shear band spreads in the sand and a slip surface dynamically creates up to causing the collapse of the soil foundation framework in the case of the failure condition the average strength mobilized along the slip surface is not as much as the pinnacle quality and more prominent than the quality at the critical condition of the sand under consideration for the documentation of this failure phenomenon the amassed plastic deformation zones above the anchor calculated for any loading stage d 10 cm at h d 2 at different densities of sand are illustrated in fig 22 for the same δ d ratio δ is larger for larger d as the shear bandwidth is independent of pressure level its ratio with d decreases proportionally as d increases then once shear bands have appeared the relative displacement across a shear band at corresponding points becomes larger for larger d resulting in a larger ratio of shear band length relative to d and more non uniform distribution of φmob thus a larger degree of progressive failure in fig 22a some loading stages i e a c are presented to support the demonstration of the outcomes fig 22b shows that at stage c the slip surface is inclined in case of dense sand and vertical in case of loose sand it is also evident that in dense sand failure is not fully happened and on the other hand for loose sand the failure is outcropped on the surface and so it can be said that the failure of dense sand is more progressive than the others as less unloading is required to initiate the failure that spreads over a larger space within the soil mass 9 width scale effect the problems of the transformation of the model test results to a prototype is mainly due to width scale effect the scale effects are examined by varying h and d proportionally e g the fe mesh for h d 2 d 5 cm is scaled up by a factor of 10 to have anchor with h d 2 d 50 cm and this procedure is supported by such kind of numerical model insensitive to mesh size effect fig 23 presents the relationship between the experimental results and the numerical results at h d 2 d 5 10 and 15 cm which is presented that numerical results well predict the experimental results figs 24 27 presents the uplift resistance displacement factor relationships at different embedment figs 28 and 29 display that npu and δu d decreases with d which may be attributed to the combined effect of particle size and stress level according to tatsuoka et al 1991 and increases with the increase of the embedment this trend of scale effect with varying embedment is attributed to the various degree of progressive failure with shear band development due to high confining pressure and particle size effect or more progressive nature of the failure of the material the scale effect is predominant in dense sand on the other hand less softening in the material behaviour so less scale effect in medium and or loose sand in 1 g test result the scale effect consists of the effect of the pressure level and particle size the latter effect is observed in centrifuge tests with varying the g level using the same anchor size and the same type of sand as a small scale physical model has high dimensionless power care must be taken while extrapolating the laboratory model test results small scale to the full scale structures 10 conclusions progressive failure behaviour mainly occurs due to the non mobilization of peak strength of soil in potential failure regions whereas scale effect is predominant in softening soil it is observed that based on calibration test results the numerical models can well predict the experimental stress strain data points from element tests very closely using the appropriate set of material constants of the constitutive models and yield surface as the mc model and potential surface as the smooth dp model with shear band effect using the explicit dynamic relaxation method framework the sophisticated hardening softening material model shows better performance as it is capable to closely predict the pull out resistance and settlement patterns costing five numbers of material parameters due to the consideration of the shear band thickness in the constitutive model the load displacement behaviour of anchor foundation is independent on the mesh size the peak resistance factor presents a decreasing tendency with the increase of the width of the foundation which is scale effect the failure pattern of dense sand is more progressive than loose sand and so scale effect is predominant in dense sand the settlement at the ultimate bearing capacity of the anchor foundation always increases with the decrease of width 
22276,the economic competitiveness of the wave energy converter can be improved by adopting a novel approach of integrating a wave energy converter with a vertical porous chambered breakwater the scope of utilising the wave energy trapped inside a chambered breakwater using a heaving type wave energy converter model is assessed through experimental and numerical investigations three different

for electricity production sawin 2017 india with a coastline more than 7500 km is exposed to seasonal high wave conditions and the potential wave power that can be harvested is approximately estimated to be about 41 gw sannasiraj and sundar 2016 in addition coastlines of india are prone to seasonal erosion and 23 of the shoreline along the indian mainland is reported to be affected by erosion kumar et al 2006 the concept of the chambered breakwater was presented by jarlan 1961 with a motivation to minimize the reflection from the vertical impermeable structure by placing a porous barrier at certain distance researchers in the past have examined the wave attenuation characteristics of individual and multiple chambered breakwaters sawaragi and iwata 1978 fugazza and natale 1992 bergmann and oumeraci 2000 yip and chwang 2000 doug et al 2001 in the case of single chamber breakwater the reflection characteristics are generally reported to be less for a chamber width b to wavelength l ratio of 0 2 b l 0 30 the performance of the modified jarlan type perforated breakwater is also studied in the past to improve wave absorbing ability liu et al 2007 in a study by ramakrishnan 2011 the wave oscillations between two porous barriers were analysed through a numerical wave tank model study and reported amplification in wave heights inside the chamber huang et al 2011 classified various configurations of jarlan type perforated wall caissons considering the wave reflection transmission and wave forces from different cases of perforated slotted coastal structures the past studies on the different types of chambered breakwater system reveal that the reflection characteristics and wave attenuation of the structure are found to depend primarily on the porosity of the front wall and relative chamber width a chambered breakwater model is modified to include a wave energy converter to absorb the waves trapped inside the chamber the incident waves are allowed to pass over the seaside porous wall and by varying the b l ratio these oscillating waves are trapped inside the chamber the trapped oscillating wave energy can then be extracted using a suitable wave energy converter wec without compromising the primary purpose of the chambered breakwater in recent times there has been advancement in the area of development of different wave energy converter designs due to the

the absorption system the commercial viability of wec s is found limited due to the high construction cost integrating wec s with other marine facility is found to improve the performance of the wec and promotes cost sharing zhao et al 2019 ning et al 2018 the study by mciver and evans 1988 and mavrakos et al 2004 found that integrating wec s in front of the seawalls has improved the efficiency of wec schay et al 2013 studied the hydrodynamic performance of a heaving point absorber near a vertical wall through numerical investigation and the presence of wall perpendicular to the wave heading was found to increase the performance of the device mustapa et al 2017 reviewed the latest status on the integration of wave energy converter with other marine facilities for the medium wave conditions and the benefits challenges of integrating the two systems it is evident from the past literatures that no attempt has been made to utilize the exploitable wave energy trapped inside a chamber of a chambered breakwater system by introducing a wave energy converter inside the chamber a novel integrated wave energy absorption system comprising of a vertical porous chambered breakwater and wec proposed in the study can effectively utilize the wave power potential and protect the eroding coastline this integration can enhance the cost efficiency of the wec systems the present study discusses the hydrodynamic performance of the integrated wave energy absorption system and the benefit of introducing the wec model inside the chamber to exploit the wave energy trapped inside the chambered breakwater system 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental investigation 2 1 1 test facility the experimental investigations were carried out in a wave flume of dimension 50 m long 1 m wide

capable of simulating a wide range of regular and random waves a rubble mound and perforated sloping plate arrangement capable of absorbing the generated waves is placed at the other end of the wave flume 2 1 2 model details and instrumentation the chambered breakwater model is an assembly of a seaside porous wall and an impermeable back wall each made of acrylic sheet with dimensions of 0 98 m 0 97 m with a thickness of 0 010 m arranged at different chamber width conditions for investigation the porous front wall is made with circular holes of 0 03 m diameter and varying center to center

of acrylic material with an outer diameter of 0 15 m and inner diameter of 0 14 m was adopted to represent the wave energy converter in the present study to restrict the motion of the sphere wec model

negligible friction in the system the sphere wec model has a total weight of 0 80 kg and it is semi submerged in the wave tank typical view of the sphere wec model inside the wave flume facility is as shown in fig 1 the variations of wave surface elevations at different locations along the length of wave flume were measured using resistance type wave probes connected to the wave meter each wave

the model and wave probes are illustrated in fig 2 a for the tests with model 1 wave periods were chosen so as to obtain b l ranging from 0 20 to 0 30 the porosities of seaside front wall varied as 5 10 15 and 20 to measure the reflected waves from the breakwater model three wave probes p1 p2 and p3 were placed as shown in fig 2 the distance between these probes were estimated as per mansard and funke 1980 p1 was placed at a distance of 12 m towards the seaside of the breakwater model to measure the wave elevations inside the chamber four wave probes p4 p5 p6 and p7 were placed separated by an equidistance of 0 20 m as shown in fig 2 a in experiments with model 2 chamber width was varied such that the resonant period of the chamber is close to the incident wave period the resonant mode of n 0 is adopted to define the resonant period of the chamber in the present study the resonant period t n for a closed chamber condition is considered as adopting the closed chamber condition is found to amplify the wave energy due to resonance effect ramakrishnan 2011 the t n of the chamber in closed basin condition n 0 is expressed as sorensen 2005 1 t n 2 b n 1 g d where n is the fundamental oscillation mode g is the acceleration due to gravity and d is the water depth for the experiments with model 2 the porosity of the seaside wall was kept constant as 20 and the wave periods and the chamber length were varied the b l is ranging from 0 53 to 0 63 for the tests with model 2 the arrangement of model 2 with the wave probes in the wave flume is shown in fig 2 b the wave elevations trapped inside the chamber with varying chamber widths were measured using three wave probes p4 p5 and p6 one wave probe was placed at the middle of the chamber p5 and the other two p4

shown in fig 3 in the second case of experiments case ii the response of the s wec model to the incident waves were investigated without any chambered breakwater model the s wec model was placed at a distance of 24 m from the wave paddle as shown in fig 4 the responses of the wec model were then captured through video footages and the heave response of the model was analysed using tracker 4 92 tool brown 2009 one wave probe was placed near to the s wec model to measure the wave elevations at the same location the heave response of the s wec model was measured at a distance of 0 20 m from the impermeable wall to the center of the s wec inside the constant chamber width in case iii model 1 in the varying chamber width set up the s wec was placed at same locations of the wave probes as adopted in case i model 2 the schematic of s wec model case iii model 1 2 set up in wave flume is shown in fig 5 and view of the s wec model inside the chamber is shown in fig 6 the range of input

porous wall are compared with the theoretical estimates of fugazza and natale 1992 and experimental results by kondo 1979 as illustrated in fig 13 it is observed from the figures that the kr values of model 2 are less which may be due to the adopted chamber width where the resonant periods of the chamber closely match the incident wave period and more wave energy is being trapped inside the chamber in order to understand the wave elevation characteristics inside the chamber the instantaneous wave surface elevation is captured when the wave elevation is at its maximum crest and minimum trough at the impermeable wall fig 14 illustrates typical instantaneous wave surface elevations measured inside the chamber at different locations along with the theoretical wave profile of a closed basin sorensen 2005 it is interesting to note that the measured wave elevations follow the similar trend of theoretical closed basin oscillation characteristics for both the wave crest and trough the variations of the h c h i with respect to the b l obtained at three positions are shown in fig 15 the incident wave is observed to be amplified at positions near to the seaside wall and towards the impermeable wall due to the interference of the reflected and incoming incident waves an incident wave height of 0 14 m for a wave period of 2 0 s is found to be amplified up to 0 25 m near to the seaside wall and 0 20 m near to the impermeable back wall which demands the use of a wec system at these locations for possible extraction of wave energy 3 2 case ii s wec as mentioned earlier in this

and 18 the estimated heave responses from numerical model are in good agreement with that of experiments it is to be noted here that the wave elevations measured from the experiments using the wave probes placed at different locations inside the chamber are given as input to the numerical model in order to understand the effect of introducing wec inside the chamber on the reflection characteristics the variation of kr with respect to b l fig 19 for case i and case iii are examined for case iii model 1 the average kr value is found to increase by 11 due to the presence of s wec model in the chamber the average kr values obtained for case iii model 1 is 0 12 whereas the average kr for case i model 1 is 0 11 in case of varying chamber width case iii model 2 the average kr value obtained is found to be minimized by 22 in comparison to case i model 2 the s wec model is found to effectively absorb the oscillating wave energy inside the chamber after introducing the s wec the kr values ranges from 0 07 to 0 35 for wave heights of 0 10 m and 0 14 m respectively the position of the s wec inside the varying chamber width case iii model 2 is found insignificant while analyzing the reflection characteristics the heave response amplitude operator rao defined as the ratio of the measured heave displacement of the wec model to the incident wave elevation are estimated for the case ii and iii models as shown in fig 20 as the b l ranges are varying for case iii model 1 and 2 the heave rao is plotted against dimensionless wave number kd where k is wave number and defined as 2π l the heave rao of the s wec is ranging from 0 89 to 1 05 for case ii for all the tested wave conditions for case iii model 1 the average heave rao is found to be 6 higher than that of case ii the heave rao range from 0 89 to 1 11 the average heave rao of the s wec introduced inside the varying chamber width breakwater model case iii model 2 at location near to the seaside porous wall is observed to be 19 higher than case ii the heave rao is observed to range from 0 84 to 1 37 and 0 78 to 1 09 near to the seaside porous wall and impermeable wall respectively the heave rao obtained for case iii model 2 is comparatively higher with respect to other two study cases as the adopted closed basin chamber width condition is capable of trapping wave energy and creates resonance inside the chamber the response of the s wec obtained through experimental investigation is compared to the numerical results corresponding to no pto force in fig 21 the numerical results are found to be slightly less than predicted values except the results obtained for case iii model 2 the heave rao obtained for the s wec model integrated with the chambered breakwater is observed to be higher than the reference case case ii the study further attempts to analyze the power generation performance of s wec the average power obtained by using the s wec model in case ii and case iii is assessed through wec sim the variation of normalized average power for a 20 n s m linear damping pto force obtained for the s wec model case ii placed inside constant case iii model 1 and varying chamber width case iii model 2 are shown in fig 22 the theoretical power obtained for case ii ranges from 21 25 w m2 to 38 49 w m2 whereas it ranges from 17 12 w m2 to 27 36 w m2 for case iii model 1 the potential average power from s wec placed in the constant chamber width is reduced by 25 when compared to the s wec standalone the reduced power generation performance may be due to the ineffective wave trapping oscillations inside the chamber or the adopted pto force however this system can be considered in regions where the reflection of the breakwater system should be minimal the average power generation performance of s wec for case iii model 2 at position p4 near to the seaside porous wall is found to be more in the range from 31 05 w m2 to 55 27 w m2 for kd values of 0 73 0 86 and 1 06 the h c h i values obtained for case i model 2 as shown in fig 15 also reveals the same trend and amplification of wave elevations due to wave oscillations is evident in these ranges the results show that the amplified wave energy is found to be effectively utilized by the s wec it is observed that the h c h i ratio heave rao and the average power of the s wec for kd value of 0 63 is found to be less which may be due to the adopted location of the s wec inside the chamber which is far from both the walls in the test set up the average power of the s wec model at position 6 p6 near to the impermeable wall is found to be ranging from 12 68 w m2 to 26 64 w m2 for both the wave heights from the results it is found that the maximum average power generation capability of the s wec model introduced in the varying chamber width breakwater model case iii model 2 near to the seaside porous wall is increased by 20 when compared to the standalone s wec model case ii the efficiency of the integrated system was found to increase when the resonant period of the chamber matched the predominant wave period the influence of different pto damping on the performance of s wec is out of the scope of the present study further to maximize the power generation capability of the s wec integrated to the chambered breakwater the model has to be positioned near to the seaside porous or impermeable wall 4 conclusions the hydrodynamic performance of a novel integrated wave energy absorption system comprised of a chambered breakwater and a wave energy converter is investigated through experimental and numerical investigation the power absorption capability of the s wec is evaluated using wec sim and the linear pto damping force is used to calculate the absorbed power the following conclusions can be drawn from this investigation 1 the reflection characteristic of chambered breakwater with 20 porosity of the seaside porous wall is better among the tested range of porosities 2 the wave elevations trapped inside the chamber are experimentally verified to be amplified when the resonant period of the chamber matches with that of the incident wave period the experimental measured wave profile inside the chamber also confirms the near resonant behaviour 3 the average reflection from the chambered breakwater model is reduced by 22 after introducing the s wec model inside the chamber 4 the performance of the s wec is improved after integrating the model with the chambered breakwater a maximum increase of average power of about 20 is obtained when s wec placed inside the chamber as compared to standalone s wec 5 the performance of the s wec is observed to have enhanced by placing the model near to the seaside porous wall or impermeable wall inside the chamber by integrating the wave energy converter and the chambered breakwater system the financial benefit in terms of construction and maintenance cost of these systems can be improved the proposed

majority of global energy requirement is met from coal petroleum natural gas and hydropower or in another form of non renewable resources in recent years the energy needs have substantially increased with industrialization and technological advancements the dependence on non renewable sources of energy is likewise alleged to be contributing to global warming thereby demanding more clean energy among various renewable energy resources ocean energy is one of the most promising resources with an approximate oceans cover of 71 of the earth yet merely 0 4 of ocean energy is reportedly utilized for electricity production sawin 2017 india with a coastline more than 7500 km is exposed to seasonal high wave conditions and the potential wave power that can be harvested is approximately estimated to be about 41 gw sannasiraj and sundar 2016 in addition coastlines of india are prone to seasonal erosion and 23 of the shoreline along the indian mainland is reported to be affected by erosion kumar et al 2006 the concept of the chambered breakwater was presented by jarlan 1961 with a motivation to minimize the reflection from the vertical impermeable structure by placing a porous barrier at certain distance researchers in the past have examined the wave attenuation characteristics of individual and multiple chambered breakwaters sawaragi and iwata 1978 fugazza and natale 1992 bergmann and oumeraci 2000 yip and chwang 2000 doug et al 2001 in the case of single chamber breakwater the reflection characteristics are generally reported to be less for a chamber width b to wavelength l ratio of 0 2 b l 0 30 the performance of the modified jarlan type perforated breakwater is also studied in the past to improve wave absorbing ability liu et al 2007 in a study by ramakrishnan 2011 the wave oscillations between two porous barriers were analysed through a numerical wave tank model study and reported amplification in wave heights inside the chamber huang et al 2011 classified various configurations of jarlan type perforated wall caissons considering the wave reflection transmission and wave forces from different cases of perforated slotted coastal structures the past studies on the different types of chambered breakwater system reveal that the reflection characteristics and wave attenuation of the structure are found to depend primarily on the porosity of the front wall and relative chamber width a chambered breakwater model is modified to include a wave energy converter to absorb the waves trapped inside the chamber the incident waves are allowed to pass over the seaside porous wall and by varying the b l ratio these oscillating waves are trapped inside the chamber the trapped oscillating wave energy can then be extracted using a suitable wave energy converter wec without compromising the primary purpose of the chambered breakwater in recent times there has been advancement in the area of development of different wave energy converter designs due to the growth of robust numerical models power take off systems and open sea test sites falcão 2010 presented the status of the development of wave energy converters mehrangiza et al 2013 classified wave

generation performance of s wec for case iii model 2 at position p4 near to the seaside porous wall is found to be more in the range from 31 05 w m2 to 55 27 w m2 for kd values of 0 73 0 86 and 1 06 the h c h i values obtained for case i model 2 as shown in fig 15 also reveals the same trend and amplification of wave elevations due to wave oscillations is evident in these ranges the results show that the amplified wave energy is found to be effectively utilized by the s wec it is observed that the h c h i ratio heave rao and the average power of the s wec for kd value of 0 63 is found to be less which may be due to the adopted location of the s wec inside the chamber which is far from both the walls in the test set up the average power of the s wec model at position 6 p6 near to the impermeable wall is found to be ranging from 12 68 w m2 to 26 64 w m2 for both the wave heights from the results it is found that the maximum average power generation capability of the s wec model introduced in the varying chamber width breakwater model case iii model 2 near to the seaside porous wall is increased by 20 when compared to the standalone s wec model case ii the efficiency of the integrated system was found to increase when the resonant period of the chamber matched the predominant wave period the influence of different pto damping on the performance of s wec is out of the scope of the present study further to maximize the power generation capability of the s wec integrated to the chambered breakwater the model has to be positioned near to the seaside porous or impermeable wall 4 conclusions the hydrodynamic performance of a novel integrated wave energy absorption system comprised of a chambered breakwater and a wave energy converter is investigated through experimental and numerical investigation the power absorption capability of the s wec is evaluated using wec sim and the linear pto damping force is used to calculate the absorbed power the following conclusions can be drawn from this investigation 1 the reflection characteristic of chambered breakwater with 20 porosity of the seaside porous wall is better among the tested range of porosities 2 the wave elevations trapped inside the chamber are experimentally verified to be amplified when the resonant period of the chamber matches with that of the incident wave period the experimental measured wave profile inside the chamber also confirms the near resonant behaviour 3 the average reflection from the chambered breakwater model is reduced by 22 after introducing the s wec model inside the chamber 4 the performance of the s wec is improved after integrating the model with the chambered breakwater a maximum increase of average power of about 20 is obtained when s wec placed inside the chamber as compared to standalone s wec 5 the performance of the s wec is observed to have enhanced by placing the model near to the seaside porous wall or impermeable wall inside the chamber by integrating the wave energy converter and the chambered breakwater system the financial benefit in terms of construction and maintenance cost of these systems can be improved the proposed system finds a wide application in utilising the ocean renewable energy and developing coastal protective structures such integrated system shall serve as a multipurpose structure with primary aim to protect the coast against erosion and also capture the wave energies seasonally 
22277,during research on the propeller ice contact process it was found that there is a shadowing effect that has a significant influence on the propeller loading the shadowing effect was observed to occur with both staggered configurations of multi propellers along with the separate blades of single propellers the shadowing effect causes the load from the ice to decrease on the aft propellers or a following blade compared to the blade currently in contact with the ice two numerical simulation models based on the peridynamics method have been established in order to study shadowing effect for both forward and aft multi propeller ice configurations as well as individual blades of a single propeller the influence mechanism of the shadowing effect on the sea ice failure mode along with the loads acting on the propellers are examined in this paper additionally a new analytical shadowing effect coefficient on the ratio of the front and back contacts divided by the axial length of the damaged ice is put forward based the results show that the shadowing effects are well modeled by both peridynamic numerical simulations and the analytical shadowing coefficient keywords propeller ice

the problem of the collision of the ships propeller or propellers with sea ice e g williams et al 1992 cowper et al 1992 browne 1997 has always been a topic of significant interest it has been found that for low values of the advanced coefficient values j the loads acting on the forward and aft propeller blades exhibit significant differences this is due to the fact the ice resistance acting on the aft propeller blades are decreased due to the prior damage from the forward propeller blades this phenomenon is referred to as the shadowing effect wang et al 2005 and does not always have an effect depending on the specific external working conditions thus a study into the shadowing effect will provide further details regarding the contact of a propeller with ice currently very little research exits in open literature regarding the shadowing effect with water vessel engineering and for the most part the shadowing effect is concerned mainly with offshore platforms katok et al 1994 carried out the first experiment on a model to obtain shadowing coefficients for vertical and cone platforms subjected to ice flows in different directions based on the study of the four leg structure of the bohai jz20 2 oil and gas operation area timoc et al 1992 did experiments and analyzed the shadowing effect associated with the effects of ice loads acting on four leg structures wang et al 2016 employed the discrete element method dem to study the shadowing effect associated with ice flow loads acting on a multi pile vertebra platform in different directions and additionally proposed a new shadowing coefficient equation for determining the influence of this effect for this type of structure however the shadowing effect for a propeller in contact with ice is different in the research of polar propeller wang et al 2005 carried out a series of model tests of the pod propeller in the ice tank of the iot institute for ocean technology according to the test results it was concluded that shadowing would have an effect on propeller ice loading and a shadowing effect coefficient was proposed that neglected the blade thickness based on peridynamics ye et al 2017 developed a propeller ice contact model to study this interaction using this work wang et al 2018 considered propeller ice milling conditions and studied the influence of advance speeds contact positions propeller rotation speeds and different sizes of ice structures in the study it is determined that the shadowing effect influences the damage to ice blocks in many cases however the shadowing effect was not specifically investigated in general previous research on the shadowing effect of propeller has mainly explained the simple concept but not focused on the cause and the mechanism of the effect hence in order to study the mechanism of the shadowing effect during propeller ice interaction it is necessary to carry out a more in depth study based on the theory of peridynamics silling and askari 2005 silling et al 2007 this study establishes two predictive bond based peridynamic numerical simulation techniques to examine the shadowing effect associated with both front and aft propellers for multi propeller ice milling conditions along with the shadowing effect due to individual blades of a single propeller ice subjected to milling conditions the focus of the study is to reveal the cause and the mechanisms of the shadowing effect of the propeller ice contacting process 2 peridynamics theory and method proof 2 1 peridynamics theory the traditional continuum mechanics theory is based on a continuum hypothesis and this theory has singularities in solving the discontinuous problems of differential equation in abstract spaces therefore the traditional continuum mechanics theory is not suitable for use in solving the propeller ice contact problem because many discontinuous problems occur during the ice crushing process such as damage fracturing cracking and so on peridynamics is a new meshless method based on continuous medium theory in which a continuum is discretized into a series of material points with finite volume and finite mass this method accounts for the affecting force of the material points in the near field range but it does not account for the continuity or discontinuity of the displacement field the peridynamics method shows great adaptability in handling many discontinuous problems silling and askari 2005 2007 in peridynamics theory more account is taken into to focus on the interaction between the two material points which would be expressed by a bond somewhat like a spring in this theory there exists positive number δ which represents for the radius of the horizon of the material point as shown in fig 1 to describe the mechanical properties of the material points in the domain the relative positions between the two material points are defined as ξ x x and the relative displacements at time t are defined as η u x t u x t so the vector ξ η is the relative position of the two interacting points at t the action of the bond between the material points changes with the deformation of the material which is indicated by the elongation of the bonds 1 s ξ η ξ y ξ ξ 2 y ξ η y x t y x t y x x the key aspect of pd theory is the basic equation representing the displacement and force of the material points all of the formulas in pd theory are transformed to solve the following equation 3 ρ u x t h x f u x t u x t x x d v x b x t where h x is the domain of integration within the horizon of the material point x u is the displacement vector of the material point x and ρ is the mass density the vector is a pairwise force density function defined as the force per unit volume that the material point at exerts on the material point at x for an object composed of micro elastic materials the constitutive function of pd can be expressed as follows 4 f η ξ ξ η ξ η f ξ η ξ ξ η the pairwise forces are regarded as interactions between pairs of material points as a continuum to ensure a function does not violate newton s third law of motion the pairwise force density function must obey the linear and angular admissibility conditions which are as follows 5 f η ξ f η ξ η ξ 6 η ξ f η ξ 0 when a bond is deformed beyond a predetermined value it is judged to be a failure and can never be recovered for the prototype micro elastic brittle pmb material the bond force can be expressed as follows 7 f y t ξ g s t ξ μ t ξ where g is the linear scalar valued function defined by 8 g s c s s where c is a constant for linear elastic isotropic material c can be obtained in terms of the bulk modulus k and the horizon δ as follows 9 c 18 k π δ 4 when the poisson s ratio is setting as υ 1 4 the bulk coefficient could be calculated as the following formula 10 k 2 e 3 when a bond fails the bond force of pairs of material points comes to zero and this can be expressed by μ which is a history dependent scalar valued function 11 μ t ξ 1 i f s c s t ξ s t f o r a l l 0 t t 0 o t h e r w i s e where s c represents for the negative compressive stretches s t represents for the positive tensile stretches a quantity known as local damage at a point is proposed to describe the level of failure of the material which can be quantified as follows 12 ϕ x t 1 h x u x t ξ d v ξ h x d v ξ where x is now included as an argument of μ as a reminder that it is a function of position in the body and 0 ϕ 1 with 0 representing virgin material and 1 representing complete disconnection of a point from all points it initially interacted with silling 2005 2 2 pmb model for ice material a complete numerical simulation of ice material with another material was difficult to conduct because the physical properties of ice are affected significantly by temperature salinity porosity and other external factors and the focus of the present study is on the damage process of the ice and not on its specific properties due to the fact it can exhibit a verity of behaviors ranging from ductile to brittle as a function of the strain rate in compression as illustrated in fig 2 carney kelly et al 2006 hail ice impacts are high speed events occurring at velocities greater than 25 m s with strain rates over 10 1 s 1 kim and keune 2007 additionally it was found that ice material would exhibit brittle behavior when the strain rate is greater than 10 3 s 1 as for the propeller ice interaction it could hardly find any relevant research on the strain rate for ice under blade cutting but we could obtain many relevant study about the strain rate of ice for ice ship interaction generally interaction rates during vessel breaking ice events are high and consequently the strain rates are above 10 3 s 1 and the ice deformation process can be considered elastic derradji aouat 2003 von bock und polach and molyneux 2017 huang et al 2018 note that the relevant velocity between ice and ship is ranging from 0 168 m s 0 42 m s in the study of huang et al 2018 for the present study the linear velocity of the tip of the propeller is often high the relative velocity between the ice and blade is 0 45 m s when the rotational speed is setting as 5rps and the ice would show elastic and brittle character under the cutting process so we think it is suitable to simulate ice material with the pmb model for the high speed impacting process as well as the ice propeller interaction process the parameter setting especially the critical stretch setting is significant for our study in our study the elastic modulus was e 1 8 gpa and the density was 900 kg m3 poisson s ratio was 0 25 the material horizon is chosen as δ 3 015δx erdogan madenci erkan oterkus 2014 the critical bond stretch s 0 can be derived by considering the energy release rate when bonds break to completely separate the body into two halves across a fracture surface as shown in fig 4 all bonds that initially connect particles in the opposite halves need to break the energy in each unit fracture area needed to completely separate the body into two halves is the energy release rate g 0 which is a measurable value for a material let w 0 ξ denote the work required to break a single bond for the microelastic material 13 w 0 ξ 0 s 0 c ξ s ξ d s c ξ s 0 2 ξ 2 ξ ξ the work g 0 required to break all the bonds per unit fracture area is the found form 14 g 0 0 δ 0 2 π z δ 0 cos 1 z ξ c ξ s 0 2 ξ 2 ξ 2 sin φ d φ d ξ d θ dz after evaluation of these integrals the energy per unit fracture area for complete separation of the two halves of the body is found because the energy release rate is a measurable quantity for materials eq 14 allows s 0 to be evaluated under the assumptions of complete separation of the fracture surfaces and of the absence of other dissipative mechanisms near the crack tip solving eq 14 for s 0 leads to 15 s 0 5 π g 0 18 e δ g 0 is a material constant that reflects the resistance of a material to crack propagation the energy release rate g 0 can be derived from fracture mechanics g 0 can be expressed as 16 g 0 k i d 2 e where k i d is fracture toughness which reflects the resistance of a material to brittle fracture and can be measured experimentally liu et all 1979 the fracture toughness can therefore be used to calculate s 0 as 17 s 0 5 π k i d 2 18 e 2 δ the equation of the critical bond stretch s 0 refers to the work of qing 2018 which has considered the effect of the distance between particles on the bond elastic stiffness and the calculating results is larger 0 02 times than the original results obtained from the work of silling and askari 2005 the fracture toughness of ice k i d is 185 knm 2 3 at a very low temperature of 46 c as shown in fig 4 the bond force represents stress and the bond stretch represents strain the primary fracture mode is tensile failure because ice is a brittle material and has compression strength that is 3 5 times its tensile strength s t s 0 is the critical bond stretch and s c 5 s 0 is the critical bond compression liu et al 2018 see fig 3 if the bond stretch exceeds s t in the tensile case or s c in the compressive case the bond would be broken and the bond force is vanished the time step of the calculation was set at δ t 0 0348 ms the time step size is chosen referring to the study of yu k b 2011 in his study the time step size was limited as δ t β s a f e ξ min c k max we set the safety factor as β s a f e 0 5 finally we calculated the time step δ t 0 00348 m s 2 3 ice sphere impacting test in order to verify the feasibility of the bond based peridynamics method for simulating the dynamic mechanical behavior of sea ice with a high impacting speed a comparative analysis for ice impacting behavior between experimental results and numerical simulations is done our team independently built an ice impact test platform see fig 5 the platform used compressed gas to push the spherical ice body at a high velocity to impact the end of the transmission bar at a high speed which make the transmission bar undergoes a minor deformation and the minor deformation extends toward another end of the transmission and could be measured by the strain gauge attached near the bar end and we could obtain voltage signals in the oscillograph and the voltage signals could be converted into impacting forces through the following formulas shan et al 2000 18 f e a u g k in the formula f represents the impacting load of ice sphere unit n e represents the elastic modulus of ice material unit n m2 a is the cross sectional area of the transmission bar unit m2 u is an the voltage value recorded by the oscilloscope unit v k represents the resistance sensitivity coefficient in this paper k 2 g is the proportional coefficient of the voltage signal into the force signal unit v 1 a high speed camera was also installed in front of the observation box and images of the entire impact and damage process of the spherical ice bodies were obtained the real graph of the testing platform is shown in fig 5 and to aid understanding the concept map is shown as well the various parts of the launcher are shown below fig 6 3 1 the air chamber power part 3 2 the barrel part 3 3 the velocity measurement part 3 4 the observation box part 3 5 the transmission stress rod part 3 6 the damper absorption device part 3 7 the gun carrier part 3 8 the base bracket part in order to verify the accuracy of the experiments carried out in this study the results of our experiments were compared with tippmann s experimental results trippmann et al 2013 and the repeatability of the experiments were also compared as shown in fig 7 to ensure the same test conditions the diameter of the ice sphere was 60 mm and the impact speed was 60 m s which were the same parameters as tippmann s test the analysis shows that the three groups of impact loads obtained in this study were very close but the peak loads of the three groups were slightly smaller than those of the tippmann s test results after analysis we concluded that this might have been caused by the difference in the tested ice sphere production process because of the limitation of the test conditions the test in this study did not ionize the water body before making an ice sphere as tippmann s tests did as a result the purity of the ice sphere was not as high as that of the tippmann s tests sample and the impact load obtained was also slightly less than that of the tippmann s test however judging from the overall trend of the load curve and the corresponding time scale of the peak and valley points of the load the test in this study has a high degree of coincidence with tippmann s tests in addition the results of the three groups of repetitive tests in this paper are essentially the same which indirectly proves that the test carried out in this study has high stability and accuracy 2 4 verification of peridynamics in modeling ice failure parameter settings especially the critical stretch are a significant problem in the simulated model established by peridynamics a detailed introduction to each parameter setting in our model is presented in table 1 to ensure the reliability of the calculation results grid convergence analysis was conducted to guide the selection of an appropriate material point spacing the spherical ice particles were discretized into points with spacing of d 30 d 40 d 50 where d is the diameter of the ice spheres the impacting velocity of the ice spheres is 60 ms 1 the critical stretches is calculated by eq 18 note that the critical stretches for propeller ice simulating is different when the particle spacing is changed fig 8 shows the whole process of impact damage with different particle spacings to ensure the simulated model produce regular geometric spheres we established a finite element model of ice based on the icem software and then extracted the finite element nodes and replaced them with pd particles the red ice structure indicates that the strength is destroyed with deeper colors indicating a greater degree of damage to the ice material the simulated model can reveal the damage to the ice spheres with different spacing as the particle spacing decreases the crack propagation on the sphere surface is simulated more clearly when the particle spacing is set to d s 50 the propagation of longitudinal cracks and the generation of transverse cracks on the sphere surface is reasonably accurate fig 9 shows the impact time history curves with the different mesh spacing the predicted curve is in good agreement with the test curve both results show the same tendency with the load increasing rapidly to the peak value after 0 1 ms and then decreasing slowly from 0 1 to 0 6 ms the load increases rapidly to the peak value because the whole sphere body deforms as an elastomer in the initial contact stage when the elastic deformation of the ice body reaches a certain degree cracks occur at the bottom of the ice sphere and then rapidly diffuse outward the descending gradient of the load curve is larger than the ascending gradient this is because the costing time of the whole damage process is much longer than the elastic deformation process for the particle spacing of δ x d s 30 δ x d s 40 δ x d s 50 the impact load curves are relative close to each other the average value of impacting load for different particle spacing is changing from 4 6 kn to 5 41 kn and the average value of the tested load is 5 12 kn the maximum value of impacting load for different particle spacings is changing from 12 15 kn to 13 25 kn and the maximum value of the tested load is 13 01 kn it can be seen that the magnitude and variation trend of the simulated load are very close to the test value besides good agreements between experimental results and predicted results were observed see fig 9 thus it could be concluded the current numerical method can obtain stable and reliable results in predicting ice dynamics damage process fig 10 illustrates the contrast between the simulation results obtained with peridynamics method and the experimental results of this study the particle spacing was set as δ x d s 50 the diameter of the ice sphere was 60 mm and the impacted velocity was 60 m s from the figure we can see that the simulation results are very similar to the experimental phenomena in predicting the crushing process of the ice sphere as can be seen in fig 10 a b the volume of the simulated ice sphere would deform elastically in the vertical direction cracks first appear in the impacting bottom area in the ice sphere body and immediately extend to the lower hemisphere when the cracks diffuse to the hemisphere plane the diffusion of crack is hindered it can be seen that the hemisphere plane was the dividing line between the lower hemisphere and the upper hemisphere and the damage of the lower hemisphere was more severe than the upper hemisphere we could even observe the surface of the upper hemisphere being very smooth at a time of 80 ms after that time a few cracks continued to spread to the upper hemisphere finally the upper and lower hemispheres were destroyed in different ways the lower hemisphere was fragmented while the upper hemisphere was destroyed in massive chunks it can be seen that peridynamics is very good at predicting the crack growth on the surface of the ice sphere which further prove peridynamics method is appropriate for simulating the mechanical damage process of ice 3 geometry and numerical setup for the propeller ice milling models numerical simulations were carried out on a model of a full scale propeller the chosen propeller had a similar design to the four blade r class propeller walker 1966 and the blades were thickened for safe operation in ice the diameter of the propeller was d 0 3 m and the diameter of the hub was d h 0 09 m the pitch to diameter ratio p d was 0 76 to deal with the complex shape of the propeller blade we established the propeller model using the panel mode method and divided its surface into several small quadrilateral panels the numbers and layout of the chordwise and radial intervals had to be properly chosen in order to approximate the actual shape of a propeller blade fig 11 shows the surface mesh of the propeller 3 1 propeller ice contact model with the propeller model and the ice model established it was very essential to combine the two models together with the help of the contact discrimination theory we briefly introduced the key part of the contact model in our established work c wang et al 2018 and still use the contact model in the study of this paper as we focused on the analysis of the shadowing effect it is found that the shadowing effect played a role between different propellers as well as the different blades of a whole propeller thus a single propeller ice contact model was developed to investigate the shadowing effect between the individual blades of the propeller additionally a three propeller ice contact model was developed to investigate the effect due to separate propellers the ice block used is shown in fig 12 a and was a cuboid with a length of l i 0 5d a width of w i 0 75d and a thickness of h i 0 25d this ice block is illustrated in fig 12 b is also a cuboid with a length of l i 0 5d a width of w i 3 5d and a thickness of h i 0 15d the center distance of hub of propellers 1 and 3 is 0 2 m in the x direction and 0 3 m in the y direction see fig 12 propellers 1 and 2 are symmetrical in the y direction with a distance of 0 6 m 3 2 the parameter setting for ice material in propeller ice interaction model the particle spacing is set as δx 0 0075 m for both models and the cube ice is simulated by ice model with material number of 40 60 20 in three dimensional direction for single propeller ice milling model as for the three propeller ice milling model the material number is setting as 40 280 12 we had described the ice material model in the section 2 2 and 2 3 however note that the critical stretches for propeller ice simulating is different from the values for ice sphere impacting simulating due to the differences for the material point spacing the material point spacing in the propeller ice interaction is δ x 0 0075 m while the value in the ice impacting model is set as δ x 0 0015 m the values for material point spacing in propeller ice simulating is larger than the value in the sphere impacting model due to the fact that the total computation work would increase rapidly when the spacing amount increase for the propeller ice interaction model especially for the three propeller ice milling model now the number of the material point amount for three propellers milling model is 134400 the total time steps for one working condition is set as 20 000 and the total cpu time for each working condition is about 60 h the parameters settings for ice material in propeller ice interaction model are summed up shown as table 2 4 a verification study to the propeller ice contact model to verify the accuracy of the integrated propeller ice interaction model numerically simulated results are compared with the model experiments conducted in the iot s ice tank by wang et al 2005 a comparison study was done by comparing the experimental results with the results from the numerical simulations using the interaction model the propeller diameter was d 0 3 m rotational speed n 5 rps cutting depth c h 35 mm and ice block speed v 0 5 m s a schematic of the model test system used for the experiments is shown in fig 13 a and a single propeller ice bond based peroidynamic numerical simulation is shown in fig 13 b fig 14 shows the comparison of contact force and moment for the main blade between calculation and experiment for the contact model the ice block was initially placed 0 6 m in front of the propeller using a total of 0 12 s before the main blade contacted the ice block as the rational speed is setting as n 5 rps the ice load of main blade will have 5 peaks within 1s which is also well reflected by the test results and numerical prediction results in fig 14 besides it is observed from the test results that a small amount of load occurs due to the hydrodynamic load during the time span when the main blade is not in contact with the ice however the influence of the sea water is not accounted for with the present model in generally although there are differences between the simulated and experimental results the ice load magnitudes trends and peak loads are in reasonable agreement and this could prove the accuracy of the numerical model established in this paper 5 the shadowing effect of different propellers 5 1 analysis of three propellers ice milling working conditions this study carried out a series of numerical calculation based on the propeller ice contact model in order to determine the influences between three propellers cutting ice blocks for these bond based peridynamic numerical simulations the sea ice speed was v 0 3 m s and the rotational speed of the propeller was n 5 rps damage to the ice block and the ice load acting on each propeller in the x y and z directions are shown in fig 15 and 16 it is also observed from fig 16 that the loading produced by the ice in contact with propeller 3 appears first and the loads on propeller 1 and propeller 2 appear approximately 300 ms later as expected due to the offset of the propellers from fig 15 it is observed that three similar ice free trajectories were formed by the propeller after cutting for the three propeller milling condition however no cracks propagated or extended between the three propeller cutting areas indicating the multi propeller cutting of sea ice is independent of each propeller for this particular case this also means that the influence of the shadowing effect between the different propellers had essentially no influence on this configuration when the transverse distances between the aft two propellers are far away from the centerline of the forward propeller from fig 16 a c and d it is observed that the ice loads acting on the propellers have a periodicity of approximately 50 ms for a rotational speed of 5 rps fig 16 b d and f shows the characteristic curve for f x f y f z this illustrates the maximum load produced from the ice contacting the propeller blades in the x direction is 187 n and is approximately three times that acting in the y and z directions considering that the propeller ice milling process of propellers 1 2 and 3 are independent of each other the load versus time curves for all three propellers are quite similar thus for convenience only ice loads acting on propellers 1 and 3 are considered in the following sections 5 2 the shadowing effect of the front propeller to the after propeller in fig 17 bond based peridynamic numerical simulations for the three propeller ice process are shown for an advance speed of 0 5 m s the changes in propeller ice loading in the x direction are shown in fig 18 and in fig 19 as fig 19 shows the load acting on propeller 3 exhibits a decay in both the amplitude and average value of the loads after 500 ms and the decay trend happens due to the influence of the after propeller 1 2 cutting ice besides the failure mode around propeller 3 with an ice groove behind it is different than that for propellers 1 and 2 the ice encountered by propeller 3 was damaged and broken into small pieces however as shown in fig 17 propellers 1 and 2 cut the ice into large pieces this result illustrates a shadowing effect especially between the front and rear propellers where the front propeller causes significant disturbances in the ice milling by the rear propellers to illustrate the influence of the shadowing effect between propellers more directly the transverse distance between each propeller was changed and the distance was reduced bond based peridynamic simulated results are shown in fig 20 for transverse distances of 0 6 and 0 5 m the results are as follows fig 20 shows the propeller ice milling process with different propeller arrangements the rotational speed is 5 rps and the advanced speed is 0 2 m s it can be observed that undamaged ice between the trajectory of propellers 1 and 2 and propeller 3 still exist which means that the interaction process of propeller 3 and the sea ice will not affect the cutting processes of propeller 1 and propeller 2 from another perspective it can be observed the load propeller 1 sustained is very similar to the load propeller 3 sustained see fig 21 and 22 it means that the shadowing effect would not occur in this condition however when the transverse distance between propellers 1 and 3 is reduced to 0 5 m the damaged areas around propellers 1 and 2 and the ice breaking areas of propeller 3 merge into a single damaged area shown in fig 21 the ice load acting on propeller 3 is greater than that of propeller 1 more specifically the average load acting on propeller 3 varies between 103 0 n and 132 1 n the average load acting on propeller 1 varies between 70 7 and 98 7 n furthermore the maximum load acting on propeller 3 varies between 52 9 and 61 1 n whereas the maximum load acting on propeller 1 varies between 41 2 and 51 6 n it means that shadowing effect show great influence in this condition thus here it is concluded that if the rear propellers are located closer to the centerline of the hull the shadowing effect acting on the rear propellers will be great causing the loading from the ice contact to be less for the rear propellers this study has revealed that the shadowing effect between different propellers is due to ice damage sustained during the ice milling by the forward propeller blade in order to better explain the shadowing effect we conducted deeper research on the shadowing effect of the single propeller ice milling process focused on the influence of the forward propeller blade cutting process on the aft propeller blade cutting process moreover we conducted a more thorough systematic analysis of the causes of the shadowing effect discussed in the following sections 6 the shadowing effect of different blades of one propeller 6 1 verification of the shadowing effect between different blades of one propeller to more directly illustrate the shadowing effects between the individual blades of a single propeller a bond based peridynamic numerical simulation with a zero advance coefficient is employed the rotational speed of the propeller was taken to be n 5 m s and the ice block had a cuboid shape with a height of 120 mm thickness of 60 mm and width of 200 mm in fig 23 dynamic results are shown for the four propeller blades cutting ice block in fig 24 force versus time is shown for the four blade propeller with a zero advance speed here it is shown that the fist blade experiences the largest load amplitude followed by the three following blades with a continual decrease in load amplitude for the case of a zero advance speed the load amplitude was 1090 1 n for the first blade 554 9 n for the second blade 105 7 n for the third blade and 1 8 n for the fourth blade we could analysis this phenomenon is caused by the shadowing effect which implies the damaged ice from the fist blade exhibits the largest propeller ice force contact value and due to the shadowing effects the following blades continually exhibit reducing propeller ice force contact values numerical simulations in fig 23 show that the first blade damages the ice and ejects it producing empty volumes and the contacting area between ice and aft blade decreased note that the propeller blade surface contacting the ice has a positive value with the ice loads acting on the propeller hence the decreased contacting area between ice and aft blades would lead to the load the aft blade sustained decreased this process is illustrated in fig 23 where it is shown that before the last blade contacts the ice the ice block divides into two sections so that the last blade has minimal contact with the ice resulting in the load of the fourth blade decreased to zero 6 2 the causing reason of shadow effect fig 25 displays the real map model map and concept map for the propeller ice contact process it can be seen that the model map shows a great similarity to the real situation verifying the accuracy of the established model in this paper in order to explain the cause of the shadowing effect more conveniently this paper puts forward a concept map to describe the propeller ice contact model as shown in fig 25 d the axial length of the damaged ice is s and the axial length measured between the first blade and second blade is l the shadowed area indicates the damaged area of the ice block if the length l was less than s this indicated that the aft blade had contact the damaged ice caused by the forward blade so the shadowing effect influenced the propeller blade contact process furthermore if the length l continued to reduce and the contacts of both the front blade and back blade with the ice are close so the damage degree of the ice contacts with the aft blade were more severe which made the influence of shadowing effect on the propeller ice contact more severe on the other side as shown in fig 25 c if the length l was larger than s the ice the aft blade contacted was not destroyed so the shadowing effect could hardly influence the contacting process this also explained why the influence of the shadow effect was the most sever under a zero advance speed condition under the working condition of a zero advance speed the length l was close to zero but the length s remained essentially constant so the ice damage for the aft blade contact with the ice is the most severe note that when the advance speed increased the distance between the forward and aft blade contacts with the ice increase and the probability for the aft blade encountered with damaged ice decrease so the influence of shadow effect also decreased in general whether shadow effect would influence the contact process depended on the comparative sizes of length l and s 6 3 shadow coefficient from the above analysis we can see that the influence of the shadowing coefficient on the propeller ice contact force decreases with an increase of the advance speed and the influence of the shadowing effect was generally described using a shadowing effect coefficient wang et al 2007 used the ratio between the shadowing area and the blade area at the maximum blade section in contact with the ice to define the shadow effect as formula 18 shows 19 c s a s a e in the formula c s represents shadowing coefficient a s represents the shadowing area of the baled a e represents the whole area of the blade however for projectile ice contact problems there is a change due to the contact position of the blade with the ice and the maximum blade section with the ice also changes causing an uncertainty of the maximum blade section in contact with the ice that increases the difficulty in determining the shadowing coefficient when the cutting depth was set to 10 15 and 35 mm the blade area at the maximum blade section in contact with the ice would change to a section located 0 09 m 0 085 m and 0 065 m from the hub chang et al 2017 the shadow coefficient formula could only reflect the most severe degree of the shadow effect but the shadow effect influenced the entire process therefore the existing formula was not complete enough to reflect the degree of the shadow effect for the entire process and it was necessary to put forward another shadow coefficient formula this paper combines the concept of an ice force attenuation coefficient for an offshore platform for the cause of the shadowing effect and put forward another shadowing coefficient formula for propeller ice interaction wang et al 2016 with the proposed shadow coefficient when a blade encounters part of the path from the previous blade the ice load on the blade decreases therefore if s is less than l the next blade will not encounter any ice and the shadowing effect will be negligible when s is larger than l the next blade will encounter damaged ice furthermore as the length l decreases further and the initial locations of the front and rear blades are both in contact with the ice causing the shadow coefficient to increase considering these factors this paper proposes a new shadowing coefficient formula as follows 20 c s 0 s l 1 l s s l in the above formula s represents the axial length of the damaged ice area and l represents the initial axial distance of the forward and aft blades in contact with the ice the formula of l is as follows 21 l v z n j d z where v represents the ice block speed d is the diameter of the propeller j is the advance coefficient and z is the number of propeller blades the value of s depends on the milling angle α the advance coefficient j to calculate the length of s some propeller ice contact concepts must be defined fig 26 shows the concept map of the propeller ice contact α is the milling angle that corresponding to the depth of the cut β is the center age of the fan shaped area and γ is the angle between the blade bulbar and the fan arc the degree of γ depends on the cutting depth the paddle disk surface ratio and the number of blades compared with α the values of β and γ are small hence we use a correction factor to describe γ as shown in the following formulas 22 α β 2 γ β 1 e 23 e π a e c h z a o r 24 β 2 arccos r c h r in the formula above c h is the maximum cutting depth a e a o 1 represents the disk ratio of the blade using eq 24 through 22 gives the milling angle α in eq 25 a new formula can be obtained 25 α 2 arccos r c h r 1 π a e c h z a o r in the calculation it can be seen that s increases with the increase of α and decreases with the increase of j so we put forward the calculation formula of s as shown below 26 s s 0 α j α 0 j 0 in the formula s0 represents the axial length of the damaged ice area under standard working conditions and α 0 j 0 represents the ratio of the milling angle to the advance coefficient under the standard working conditions due to the fact the impact of the ice loads on the structure consists of periodic effects of loading and unloading a damage zone was proposed by sodhi and morris 1984 to quantify the distance either the ice or structure moves for each loading cycle due to the repetitive nature of the ice forces they can be characterized by determining a dominant frequency in which the ice forces vary thus the force data was transformed into the frequency domain using a fast fourier transform fft method the formula for is given by eq 27 27 s 0 v f in the formula above f is the structures natural frequency subjected to the ice forces and v is the relative velocity of the ice and the structure given by eq 28 28 v v 2 n π d 2 combining eqs 28 and 26 gives the shadowing effect coefficient in eq 29 29 c s 0 s l 1 α 0 f j 2 d j 0 α z v 2 n π d 2 s l in order to calculate the shadow coefficient it is necessary to calculate the characteristic frequencies of the ice loads hence we conducted an analysis of the frequencies of the ice loads under the standard working conditions the standard working condition in this study was selected to be the same as the condition for the model test conducted by the iot of canada wang et al 2005 the diameter of the propeller blade was set as d 0 3 m the cutting depth was set as c h 0 35 m the advance coefficient was set as j 0 3 and α 0 j 0 3 17 the ice block dimensions were a length of l i 200 mm width of w i 88 mm and thickness h i 66 mm the time series curve of the ice loads and the frequency curve obtained using fft fast fourier transformation sun et al 2018 method are depicted in fig 27 from fig 28 values for the shadow coefficient from wang et al 2005 and this study are plotted as a function the advance coefficient it can be seen that the shadow coefficient established in this paper could predict the influence degree of the shadow effect on the propeller ice contact process under different advance coefficients well although the calculation result was slightly larger than the model test result but the total variation trend the shadow effect predicted in this study coincide well with the results obtained from wang besides the zero point of the shadowing effect in our paper and in the study of wang occurred under the same working condition of the advanced coefficient j 0 45 it could be concluded from fig 28 that shadowing coefficient gradually increased with the decrease of the advance coefficient j and reached a maximum value with an advance coefficient of j 0 and then went to zero at j 0 45 and continued to remain at zero as the advance coefficient was continually increased as the advanced coefficient increased the initial distance of the forward and aft blades in contact with the ice increased so the influence degree of the shadow coefficient on the propeller ice contact also decreased under the working condition of an advance coefficient of 0 45 the aft blade was hardly in contact with the damaged ice and the shadow effect had no influence on the propeller ice contact so the advance coefficient was zero the formula used in this paper reflects the influence degree for the whole propeller ice contact process and this formula can directly calculate the shadow coefficient with the parameters for cutting depth and advanced coefficient confirmed 6 4 mechanism analysis for shadowing effect we further explore the physical mechanisms defining the shadowing effect on the ice loading of a propeller blade this was accomplished by studying the variations of ice loads acting on both the front and back of the blades with different shadowing coefficients the speed coefficients were set to 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 therefore by using the front formula established in this paper the shadow coefficients related to the three advanced coefficients were 0 82 0 4 and 0 the cutting depth was set to c h 35 m the front formula from eq 28 was employed to obtain the shadowing coefficients related to three separate advance velocities bond based peridynamic numerical simulations corresponding to the three advance coefficients are shown in fig 29 it can be seen that as the advance coefficients increased the damaged degree of the blade caused by the ice decreased additionally the axial distances of the contact locations for the front blade and rear blade in contact with the ice were closer and the influence of the shadowing coefficients on the contact process decreased in fig 30 a ice loads versus time are shown for three different advances shadowing coefficients fig 30 b d shows the time series of ice loads for the blade back and blade face sustained under different shadowing coefficients it is observed in fig 30 a that the ice loads acting on the blade are negative for j 0 2 but when j 0 4 the front half of the ice loads on the blade were always positive while the rear half ice loads on the blade were always negative for j 0 6 the ice loads on the blades were always negative the direction of ice loads varied as the advance coefficients changed this was caused by the shadowing effect because the blade trimming occurred towards the back direction the shadowing effect affected the blade face more severely than the blade back hence ice loads acting over the entire blade tended to change from negative to positive as the advance coefficient increased more specifically for j 0 2 a large contact area between the blade face and ice was shadowed because the front blade cut a large groove area in the ice block causing the contact area between the ice and the blade face to be much smaller than the back of the blade and subjecting the blade to a negative load for j 0 6 a small internal volume of ice was cut from the ice block and the shadowed area for the blade surface was quite small making the shadowing effect negligible however as the ice block moved forward and a forward load was applied to the propeller blade for j 0 4 the shadowed area of the blade surface was neither big nor small and the ice loads were influenced by both the shadowing effect and the forward motion of the ice block causing the direction of milling loads to change reciprocally between positive and negative it is therefore concluded that the shadowing effect had a negative correlation with the advance coefficient j all of these factors caused the influence of the shadow effect to be small therefore we can conclude that the shadow effect was negatively correlated with the advance coefficient of the ice block this study found that the shadow effect would affect the blade face more severely this was because the stoss end in this paper was set as the blade back a different stoss end would lead to a difference in the influence degree of the shadow effect for blade face and the blade back 7 conclusion in this paper we have established two numerical solution models that were coded in fortran and based on the bond peridynamics theory we have also numerically studied the shadowing effect between the front and the after propellers for multi propeller ice milling conditions as well as the shadowing effect between the front and the after propeller blades of single propeller ice milling conditions the following conclusions are proposed 1 this paper established a propeller ice contact model based on peridynamics from which the prediction of ice loads was obtained hence we compared the model test result with the numerical prediction result both results show a high degree of anastomosis indicating the applicability of the numerical calculation method established in this paper 2 the analysis shows that the shadow effect would only take effect when the axial length l was smaller than the axial length s of the shadowing area the strength of the ice for the after blade contact was damaged by the front blade during the entire milling process 3 the shadow effect would have a severe influence on the contacting process with a low shadow coefficient and if the advance coefficient increased the influence of shadow effect would decrease until it diminished additionally the shadow effect mainly affected the stoss end 4 a new shadow coefficient formula has been proposed in this paper based on a study of the cause of the shadow coefficients and an investigation of the predecessors the numerical simulation results show that the new formula can predict the influence of the shadow effect on the propeller ice contact the study in this paper only considers the shadowing effect under the conditions of the propeller milling of level ice for irregularly shaped ice and broken ice conditions further research need to be conducted in addition the new formula of the shadowing coefficient needs more numerical results and test data in order to be modified and improved the numerical model established in this paper considers the propeller as a rigid body a more accurate propeller ice contact model should be established which takes into account the structural deformation in the propeller blade acknowledgements the research was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant

22277,during research on the propeller ice contact process it was found that there is a shadowing effect that has a significant influence on the propeller loading the shadowing effect was observed to occur with both staggered configurations of multi propellers along with the separate blades of single propellers the shadowing effect causes the load from the ice to decrease on the aft propellers or a following blade compared to the blade currently in contact with the ice two numerical simulation models based on the peridynamics method have been established in order to study shadowing effect for both forward and aft multi propeller ice configurations as well as individual blades of a single propeller the influence mechanism of the shadowing effect on the sea ice failure mode along with the loads acting on the propellers are examined in this paper additionally a new analytical shadowing effect coefficient on the ratio of the front and back contacts divided by the axial length of the damaged ice is put forward based the results show that the shadowing effects are well modeled by both peridynamic numerical simulations and the analytical shadowing coefficient keywords propeller ice

the problem of the collision of the ships propeller or propellers with sea ice e g williams et al 1992 cowper et al 1992 browne 1997 has always been a topic of significant interest it has been found that for low values of the advanced coefficient values j the loads acting on the forward and aft propeller blades exhibit significant differences this is due to the fact the ice resistance acting on the aft propeller blades are decreased due to the prior damage from the forward propeller blades this phenomenon is referred to as the shadowing effect wang et al 2005 and does not always have an effect depending on the specific external working conditions thus a study into the shadowing effect will provide further details regarding the contact of a propeller with ice currently very little research exits in open literature regarding the shadowing effect with water vessel engineering and for the most part the shadowing effect is concerned mainly with offshore platforms katok et al 1994 carried out the first experiment on a model to obtain shadowing coefficients for vertical and cone platforms subjected to ice flows in different directions based on the study of the four leg structure of the bohai jz20 2 oil and gas operation area timoc et al 1992 did experiments and analyzed the shadowing effect associated with the effects of ice loads acting on four leg structures wang et al 2016 employed the discrete element method dem to study the shadowing effect associated with ice flow loads acting on a multi pile vertebra platform in different directions and additionally proposed a new shadowing coefficient equation for determining the influence of this effect for this type of structure however the shadowing effect for a propeller in contact with ice is different in the research of polar propeller wang et al 2005 carried out a series of model tests of the pod propeller in the ice tank of the iot institute for ocean technology according to the test results it was concluded that shadowing would have an effect on propeller ice loading and a shadowing effect coefficient was proposed that neglected the blade thickness based on peridynamics ye et al 2017 developed a propeller ice contact model to study this interaction using this work wang et al 2018 considered propeller ice milling conditions and studied the influence of advance speeds contact positions propeller rotation speeds and different sizes of ice structures in the study it is determined that the shadowing effect influences the damage to ice blocks in many cases however the shadowing effect was not specifically investigated in general previous research on the shadowing effect of propeller has mainly explained the simple concept but not focused on the cause and the mechanism of the effect hence in order to study the mechanism of the shadowing effect during propeller ice interaction it is necessary to carry out a more in depth study based on the theory of peridynamics silling and askari 2005 silling et al 2007 this study establishes two predictive bond based peridynamic numerical simulation techniques to examine the shadowing effect associated with both front and aft propellers for multi propeller ice milling conditions along with the shadowing effect due to individual blades of a single propeller ice subjected to milling conditions the focus of the study is to reveal the cause and the mechanisms of the shadowing effect of the propeller ice contacting process 2 peridynamics theory and method proof 2 1 peridynamics theory the traditional continuum mechanics theory is based on a continuum hypothesis and this theory has singularities in solving the discontinuous problems of differential equation in abstract spaces therefore the traditional continuum mechanics theory is not suitable for use in solving the propeller ice contact problem because many discontinuous problems occur during the ice crushing process such as damage fracturing cracking and so on peridynamics is a new meshless method based on continuous medium theory in which a continuum is discretized into a series of material points with finite volume and finite mass this method accounts for the affecting force of the material points in the near field range but it does not account for the continuity or discontinuity of the displacement field the peridynamics method shows great adaptability in handling many discontinuous problems silling and askari 2005 2007 in peridynamics theory more account is taken into to focus on the interaction between the two material points which would be expressed by a bond somewhat like a spring in this theory there exists positive number δ which represents for the radius of the horizon of the material point as shown in fig 1 to describe the mechanical properties of the material points in the domain the relative positions between the two material points are defined as ξ x x and the relative displacements at time t are defined as η u x t u x t so the vector ξ η is the relative position of the two interacting points at t the action of the bond between the material points changes with the deformation of the material which is indicated by the elongation of the bonds 1 s ξ η ξ y ξ ξ 2 y ξ η y x t y x t y x x the key aspect of pd theory is the basic equation representing the displacement and force of the material points all of the formulas in pd theory are transformed to solve the following equation 3 ρ u x t h x f u x t u x t x x d v x b x t where h x is the domain of integration within the horizon of the material point x u is the displacement vector of the material point x and ρ is the mass density the vector is a pairwise force density function defined as the force per unit volume that the material point at exerts on the material point at x for an object composed of micro elastic materials the constitutive function of pd can be expressed as follows 4 f η ξ ξ η ξ η f ξ η ξ ξ η the pairwise forces are regarded as interactions between pairs of material points as a continuum to ensure a function does not violate newton s third law of motion the pairwise force density function must obey the linear and angular admissibility conditions which are as follows 5 f η ξ f η ξ η ξ 6 η ξ f η ξ 0 when a bond is deformed beyond a predetermined value it is judged to be a failure and can never be recovered for the prototype micro elastic brittle pmb material the bond force can be expressed as follows 7 f y t ξ g s t ξ μ t ξ where g is the linear scalar valued function defined by 8 g s c s s where c is a constant for linear elastic isotropic material c can be obtained in terms of the bulk modulus k and the horizon δ as follows 9 c 18 k π δ 4 when the poisson s ratio is setting as υ 1 4 the bulk coefficient could be calculated as the following formula 10 k 2 e 3 when a bond fails the bond force of pairs of material points comes to zero and this can be expressed by μ which is a history dependent scalar valued function 11 μ t ξ 1 i f s c s t ξ s t f o r a l l 0 t t 0 o t h e r w i s e where s c represents for the negative compressive stretches s t represents for the positive tensile stretches a quantity known as local damage at a point is proposed to describe the level of failure of the material which can be quantified as follows 12 ϕ x t 1 h x u x t ξ d v ξ h x d v ξ where x is now included as an argument of μ as a reminder that it is a function of position in the body and 0 ϕ 1 with 0 representing virgin material and 1 representing complete disconnection of a point from all points it initially interacted with silling 2005 2 2 pmb model for ice material a complete numerical simulation of ice material with another material was difficult to conduct because the physical properties of ice are affected significantly by temperature salinity porosity and other external factors and the focus of the present study is on the damage process of the ice and not on its specific properties due to the fact it can exhibit a verity of behaviors ranging from ductile to brittle as a function of the strain rate in compression as illustrated in fig 2 carney kelly et al 2006 hail ice impacts are high speed events occurring at velocities greater than 25 m s with strain rates over 10 1 s 1 kim and keune 2007 additionally it was found that ice material would exhibit brittle behavior when the strain rate is greater than 10 3 s 1 as for the propeller ice interaction it could hardly find any relevant research on the strain rate for ice under blade cutting but we could obtain many relevant study about the strain rate of ice for ice ship interaction generally interaction rates during vessel breaking ice events are high and consequently the strain rates are above 10 3 s 1 and the ice deformation process can be considered elastic derradji aouat 2003 von bock und polach and molyneux 2017 huang et al 2018 note that the relevant velocity between ice and ship is ranging from 0 168 m s 0 42 m s in the study of huang et al 2018 for the present study the linear velocity of the tip of the propeller is often high the relative velocity between the ice and blade is 0 45 m s when the rotational speed is setting as 5rps and the ice would show elastic and brittle character under the cutting process so we think it is suitable to simulate ice material with the pmb model for the high speed impacting process as well as the ice propeller interaction process the parameter setting especially the critical stretch setting is significant for our study in our study the elastic modulus was e 1 8 gpa and the density was 900 kg m3 poisson s ratio was 0 25 the material horizon is chosen as δ 3 015δx erdogan madenci erkan oterkus 2014 the critical bond stretch s 0 can be derived by considering the energy release rate when bonds break to completely separate the body into two halves across a fracture surface as shown in fig 4 all bonds that initially connect particles in the opposite halves need to break the energy in each unit fracture area needed to completely separate the body into two halves is the energy release rate g 0 which is a measurable value for a material let w 0 ξ denote the work required to break a single bond for the microelastic material 13 w 0 ξ 0 s 0 c ξ s ξ d s c ξ s 0 2 ξ 2 ξ ξ the work g 0 required to break all the bonds per unit fracture area is the found form 14 g 0 0 δ 0 2 π z δ 0 cos 1 z ξ c ξ s 0 2 ξ 2 ξ 2 sin φ d φ d ξ d θ dz after evaluation of these integrals the energy per unit fracture area for complete separation of the two halves of the body is found because the energy release rate is a measurable quantity for materials eq 14 allows s 0 to be evaluated under the assumptions of complete separation of the fracture surfaces and of the absence of other dissipative mechanisms near the crack tip solving eq 14 for s 0 leads to 15 s 0 5 π g 0 18 e δ g 0 is a material constant that reflects the resistance of a material to crack propagation the energy release rate g 0 can be derived from fracture mechanics g 0 can be expressed as 16 g 0 k i d 2 e where k i d is fracture toughness which reflects the resistance of a material to brittle fracture and can be measured experimentally liu et all 1979 the fracture toughness can therefore be used to calculate s 0 as 17 s 0 5 π k i d 2 18 e 2 δ the equation of the critical bond stretch s 0 refers to the work of qing 2018 which has considered the effect of the distance between particles on the bond elastic stiffness and the calculating results is larger 0 02 times than the original results obtained from the work of silling and askari 2005 the fracture toughness of ice k i d is 185 knm 2 3 at a very low temperature of 46 c as shown in fig 4 the bond force represents stress and the bond stretch represents strain the primary fracture mode is tensile failure because ice is a brittle material and has compression strength that is 3 5 times its tensile strength s t s 0 is the critical bond stretch and s c 5 s 0 is the critical bond compression liu et al 2018 see fig 3 if the bond stretch exceeds s t in the tensile case or s c in the compressive case the bond would be broken and the bond force is vanished the time step of the calculation was set at δ t 0 0348 ms the time step size is chosen referring to the study of yu k b 2011 in his study the time step size was limited as δ t β s a f e ξ min c k max we set the safety factor as β s a f e 0 5 finally we calculated the time step δ t 0 00348 m s 2 3 ice sphere impacting test in order to verify the feasibility of the bond based peridynamics method for simulating the dynamic mechanical behavior of sea ice with a high impacting speed a comparative analysis for ice impacting behavior between experimental results and numerical simulations is done our team independently built an ice impact test platform see fig 5 the platform used compressed gas to push the spherical ice body at a high velocity to impact the end of the transmission bar at a high speed which make the transmission bar undergoes a minor deformation and the minor deformation extends toward another end of the transmission and could be measured by the strain gauge attached near the bar end and we could obtain voltage signals in the oscillograph and the voltage signals could be converted into impacting forces through the following formulas shan et al 2000 18 f e a u g k in the formula f represents the impacting load of ice sphere unit n e represents the elastic modulus of ice material unit n m2 a is the cross sectional area of the transmission bar unit m2 u is an the voltage value recorded by the oscilloscope unit v k represents the resistance sensitivity coefficient in this paper k 2 g is the proportional coefficient of the voltage signal into the force signal unit v 1 a high speed camera was also installed in front of the observation box and images of the entire impact and damage process of the spherical ice bodies were obtained the real graph of the testing platform is shown in fig 5 and to aid understanding the concept map is shown as well the various parts of the launcher are shown below fig 6 3 1 the air chamber power part 3 2 the barrel part 3 3 the velocity measurement part 3 4 the observation box part 3 5 the transmission stress rod part 3 6 the damper absorption device part 3 7 the gun carrier part 3 8 the base bracket part in order to verify the accuracy of the experiments carried out in this study the results of our experiments were compared with tippmann s experimental results trippmann et al 2013 and the repeatability of the experiments were also compared as shown in fig 7 to ensure the same test conditions the diameter of the ice sphere was 60 mm and the impact speed was 60 m s which were the same parameters as tippmann s test the analysis shows that the three groups of impact loads obtained in this study were very close but the peak loads of the three groups were slightly smaller than those of the tippmann s test results after analysis we concluded that this might have been caused by the difference in the tested ice sphere production process because of the limitation of the test conditions the test in this study did not ionize the water body before making an ice sphere as tippmann s tests did as a result the purity of the ice sphere was not as high as that of the tippmann s tests sample and the impact load obtained was also slightly less than that of the tippmann s test however judging from the overall trend of the load curve and the corresponding time scale of the peak and valley points of the load the test in this study has a high degree of coincidence with tippmann s tests in addition the results of the three groups of repetitive tests in this paper are essentially the same which indirectly proves that the test carried out in this study has high stability and accuracy 2 4 verification of peridynamics in modeling ice failure parameter settings especially the critical stretch are a significant problem in the simulated model established by peridynamics a detailed introduction to each parameter setting in our model is presented in table 1 to ensure the reliability of the calculation results grid convergence analysis was conducted to guide the selection of an appropriate material point spacing the spherical ice particles were discretized into points with spacing of d 30 d 40 d 50 where d is the diameter of the ice spheres the impacting velocity of the ice spheres is 60 ms 1 the critical stretches is calculated by eq 18 note that the critical stretches for propeller ice simulating is different when the particle spacing is changed fig 8 shows the whole process of impact damage with different particle spacings to ensure the simulated model produce regular geometric spheres we established a finite element model of ice based on the icem software and then extracted the finite element nodes and replaced them with pd particles the red ice structure indicates that the strength is destroyed with deeper colors indicating a greater degree of damage to the ice material the simulated model can reveal the damage to the ice spheres with different spacing as the particle spacing decreases the crack propagation on the sphere surface is simulated more clearly when the particle spacing is set to d s 50 the propagation of longitudinal cracks and the generation of transverse cracks on the sphere surface is reasonably accurate fig 9 shows the impact time history curves with the different mesh spacing the predicted curve is in good agreement with the test curve both results show the same tendency with the load increasing rapidly to the peak value after 0 1 ms and then decreasing slowly from 0 1 to 0 6 ms the load increases rapidly to the peak value because the whole sphere body deforms as an elastomer in the initial contact stage when the elastic deformation of the ice body reaches a certain degree cracks occur at the bottom of the ice sphere and then rapidly diffuse outward the descending gradient of the load curve is larger than the ascending gradient this is because the costing time of the whole damage process is much longer than the elastic deformation process for the particle spacing of δ x d s 30 δ x d s 40 δ x d s 50 the impact load curves are relative close to each other the average value of impacting load for different particle spacing is changing from 4 6 kn to 5 41 kn and the average value of the tested load is 5 12 kn the maximum value of impacting load for different particle spacings is changing from 12 15 kn to 13 25 kn and the maximum value of the tested load is 13 01 kn it can be seen that the magnitude and variation trend of the simulated load are very close to the test value besides good agreements between experimental results and predicted results were observed see fig 9 thus it could be concluded the current numerical method can obtain stable and reliable results in predicting ice dynamics damage process fig 10 illustrates the contrast between the simulation results obtained with peridynamics method and the experimental results of this study the particle spacing was set as δ x d s 50 the diameter of the ice sphere was 60 mm and the impacted velocity was 60 m s from the figure we can see that the simulation results are very similar to the experimental phenomena in predicting the crushing process of the ice sphere as can be seen in fig 10 a b the volume of the simulated ice sphere would deform elastically in the vertical direction cracks first appear in the impacting bottom area in the ice sphere body and immediately extend to the lower hemisphere when the cracks diffuse to the hemisphere plane the diffusion of crack is hindered it can be seen that the hemisphere plane was the dividing line between the lower hemisphere and the upper hemisphere and the damage of the lower hemisphere was more severe than the upper hemisphere we could even observe the surface of the upper hemisphere being very smooth at a time of 80 ms after that time a few cracks continued to spread to the upper hemisphere finally the upper and lower hemispheres were destroyed in different ways the lower hemisphere was fragmented while the upper hemisphere was destroyed in massive chunks it can be seen that peridynamics is very good at predicting the crack growth on the surface of the ice sphere which further prove peridynamics method is appropriate for simulating the mechanical damage process of ice 3 geometry and numerical setup for the propeller ice milling models numerical simulations were carried out on a model of a full scale propeller the chosen propeller had a similar design to the four blade r class propeller walker 1966 and the blades were thickened for safe operation in ice the diameter of the propeller was d 0 3 m and the diameter of the hub was d h 0 09 m the pitch to diameter ratio p d was 0 76 to deal with the complex shape of the propeller blade we established the propeller model using the panel mode method and divided its surface into several small quadrilateral panels the numbers and layout of the chordwise and radial intervals had to be properly chosen in order to approximate the actual shape of a propeller blade fig 11 shows the surface mesh of the propeller 3 1 propeller ice contact model with the propeller model and the ice model established it was very essential to combine the two models together with the help of the contact discrimination theory we briefly introduced the key part of the contact model in our established work c wang et al 2018 and still use the contact model in the study of this paper as we focused on the analysis of the shadowing effect it is found that the shadowing effect played a role between different propellers as well as the different blades of a whole propeller thus a single propeller ice contact model was developed to investigate the shadowing effect between the individual blades of the propeller additionally a three propeller ice contact model was developed to investigate the effect due to separate propellers the ice block used is shown in fig 12 a and was a cuboid with a length of l i 0 5d a width of w i 0 75d and a thickness of h i 0 25d this ice block is illustrated in fig 12 b is also a cuboid with a length of l i 0 5d a width of w i 3 5d and a thickness of h i 0 15d the center distance of hub of propellers 1 and 3 is 0 2 m in the x direction and 0 3 m in the y direction see fig 12 propellers 1 and 2 are symmetrical in the y direction with a distance of 0 6 m 3 2 the parameter setting for ice material in propeller ice interaction model the particle spacing is set as δx 0 0075 m for both models and the cube ice is simulated by ice model with material number of 40 60 20 in three dimensional direction for single propeller ice milling model as for the three propeller ice milling model the material number is setting as 40 280 12 we had described the ice material model in the section 2 2 and 2 3 however note that the critical stretches for propeller ice simulating is different from the values for ice sphere impacting simulating due to the differences for the material point spacing the material point spacing in the propeller ice interaction is δ x 0 0075 m while the value in the ice impacting model is set as δ x 0 0015 m the values for material point spacing in propeller ice simulating is larger than the value in the sphere impacting model due to the fact that the total computation work would increase rapidly when the spacing amount increase for the propeller ice interaction model especially for the three propeller ice milling model now the number of the material point amount for three propellers milling model is 134400 the total time steps for one working condition is set as 20 000 and the total cpu time for each working condition is about 60 h the parameters settings for ice material in propeller ice interaction model are summed up shown as table 2 4 a verification study to the propeller ice contact model to verify the accuracy of the integrated propeller ice interaction model numerically simulated results are compared with the model experiments conducted in the iot s ice tank by wang et al 2005 a comparison study was done by comparing the experimental results with the results from the numerical simulations using the interaction model the propeller diameter was d 0 3 m rotational speed n 5 rps cutting depth c h 35 mm and ice block speed v 0 5 m s a schematic of the model test system used for the experiments is shown in fig 13 a and a single propeller ice bond based peroidynamic numerical simulation is shown in fig 13 b fig 14 shows the comparison of contact force and moment for the main blade between calculation and experiment for the contact model the ice block was initially placed 0 6 m in front of the propeller using a total of 0 12 s before the main blade contacted the ice block as the rational speed is setting as n 5 rps the ice load of main blade will have 5 peaks within 1s which is also well reflected by the test results and numerical prediction results in fig 14 besides it is observed from the test results that a small amount of load occurs due to the hydrodynamic load during the time span when the main blade is not in contact with the ice however the influence of the sea water is not accounted for with the present model in generally although there are differences between the simulated and experimental results the ice load magnitudes trends and peak loads are in reasonable agreement and this could prove the accuracy of the numerical model established in this paper 5 the shadowing effect of different propellers 5 1 analysis of three propellers ice milling working conditions this study carried out a series of numerical calculation based on the propeller ice contact model in order to determine the influences between three propellers cutting ice blocks for these bond based peridynamic numerical simulations the sea ice speed was v 0 3 m s and the rotational speed of the propeller was n 5 rps damage to the ice block and the ice load acting on each propeller in the x y and z directions are shown in fig 15 and 16 it is also observed from fig 16 that the loading produced by the ice in contact with propeller 3 appears first and the loads on propeller 1 and propeller 2 appear approximately 300 ms later as expected due to the offset of the propellers from fig 15 it is observed that three similar ice free trajectories were formed by the propeller after cutting for the three propeller milling condition however no cracks propagated or extended between the three propeller cutting areas indicating the multi propeller cutting of sea ice is independent of each propeller for this particular case this also means that the influence of the shadowing effect between the different propellers had essentially no influence on this configuration when the transverse distances between the aft two propellers are far away from the centerline of the forward propeller from fig 16 a c and d it is observed that the ice loads acting on the propellers have a periodicity of approximately 50 ms for a rotational speed of 5 rps fig 16 b d and f shows the characteristic curve for f x f y f z this illustrates the maximum load produced from the ice contacting the propeller blades in the x direction is 187 n and is approximately three times that acting in the y and z directions considering that the propeller ice milling process of propellers 1 2 and 3 are independent of each other the load versus time curves for all three propellers are quite similar thus for convenience only ice loads acting on propellers 1 and 3 are considered in the following sections 5 2 the shadowing effect of the front propeller to the after propeller in fig 17 bond based peridynamic numerical simulations for the three propeller ice process are shown for an advance speed of 0 5 m s the changes in propeller ice loading in the x direction are shown in fig 18 and in fig 19 as fig 19 shows the load acting on propeller 3 exhibits a decay in both the amplitude and average value of the loads after 500 ms and the decay trend happens due to the influence of the after propeller 1 2 cutting ice besides the failure mode around propeller 3 with an ice groove behind it is different than that for propellers 1 and 2 the ice encountered by propeller 3 was damaged and broken into small pieces however as shown in fig 17 propellers 1 and 2 cut the ice into large pieces this result illustrates a shadowing effect especially between the front and rear propellers where the front propeller causes significant disturbances in the ice milling by the rear propellers to illustrate the influence of the shadowing effect between propellers more directly the transverse distance between each propeller was changed and the distance was reduced bond based peridynamic simulated results are shown in fig 20 for transverse distances of 0 6 and 0 5 m the results are as follows fig 20 shows the propeller ice milling process with different propeller arrangements the rotational speed is 5 rps and the advanced speed is 0 2 m s it can be observed that undamaged ice between the trajectory of propellers 1 and 2 and propeller 3 still exist which means that the interaction process of propeller 3 and the sea ice will not affect the cutting processes of propeller 1 and propeller 2 from another perspective it can be observed the load propeller 1 sustained is very similar to the load propeller 3 sustained see fig 21 and 22 it means that the shadowing effect would not occur in this condition however when the transverse distance between propellers 1 and 3 is reduced to 0 5 m the damaged areas around propellers 1 and 2 and the ice breaking areas of propeller 3 merge into a single damaged area shown in fig 21 the ice load acting on propeller 3 is greater than that of propeller 1 more specifically the average load acting on propeller 3 varies between 103 0 n and 132 1 n the average load acting on propeller 1 varies between 70 7 and 98 7 n furthermore the maximum load acting on propeller 3 varies between 52 9 and 61 1 n whereas the maximum load acting on propeller 1 varies between 41 2 and 51 6 n it means that shadowing effect show great influence in this condition thus here it is concluded that if the rear propellers are located closer to the centerline of the hull the shadowing effect acting on the rear propellers will be great causing the loading from the ice contact to be less for the rear propellers this study has revealed that the shadowing effect between different propellers is due to ice damage sustained during the ice milling by the forward propeller blade in order to better explain the shadowing effect we conducted deeper research on the shadowing effect of the single propeller ice milling process focused on the influence of the forward propeller blade cutting process on the aft propeller blade cutting process moreover we conducted a more thorough systematic analysis of the causes of the shadowing effect discussed in the following sections 6 the shadowing effect of different blades of one propeller 6 1 verification of the shadowing effect between different blades of one propeller to more directly illustrate the shadowing effects between the individual blades of a single propeller a bond based peridynamic numerical simulation with a zero advance coefficient is employed the rotational speed of the propeller was taken to be n 5 m s and the ice block had a cuboid shape with a height of 120 mm thickness of 60 mm and width of 200 mm in fig 23 dynamic results are shown for the four propeller blades cutting ice block in fig 24 force versus time is shown for the four blade propeller with a zero advance speed here it is shown that the fist blade experiences the largest load amplitude followed by the three following blades with a continual decrease in load amplitude for the case of a zero advance speed the load amplitude was 1090 1 n for the first blade 554 9 n for the second blade 105 7 n for the third blade and 1 8 n for the fourth blade we could analysis this phenomenon is caused by the shadowing effect which implies the damaged ice from the fist blade exhibits the largest propeller ice force contact value and due to the shadowing effects the following blades continually exhibit reducing propeller ice force contact values numerical simulations in fig 23 show that the first blade damages the ice and ejects it producing empty volumes and the contacting area between ice and aft blade decreased note that the propeller blade surface contacting the ice has a positive value with the ice loads acting on the propeller hence the decreased contacting area between ice and aft blades would lead to the load the aft blade sustained decreased this process is illustrated in fig 23 where it is shown that before the last blade contacts the ice the ice block divides into two sections so that the last blade has minimal contact with the ice resulting in the load of the fourth blade decreased to zero 6 2 the causing reason of shadow effect fig 25 displays the real map model map and concept map for the propeller ice contact process it can be seen that the model map shows a great similarity to the real situation verifying the accuracy of the established model in this paper in order to explain the cause of the shadowing effect more conveniently this paper puts forward a concept map to describe the propeller ice contact model as shown in fig 25 d the axial length of the damaged ice is s and the axial length measured between the first blade and second blade is l the shadowed area indicates the damaged area of the ice block if the length l was less than s this indicated that the aft blade had contact the damaged ice caused by the forward blade so the shadowing effect influenced the propeller blade contact process furthermore if the length l continued to reduce and the contacts of both the front blade and back blade with the ice are close so the damage degree of the ice contacts with the aft blade were more severe which made the influence of shadowing effect on the propeller ice contact more severe on the other side as shown in fig 25 c if the length l was larger than s the ice the aft blade contacted was not destroyed so the shadowing effect could hardly influence the contacting process this also explained why the influence of the shadow effect was the most sever under a zero advance speed condition under the working condition of a zero advance speed the length l was close to zero but the length s remained essentially constant so the ice damage for the aft blade contact with the ice is the most severe note that when the advance speed increased the distance between the forward and aft blade contacts with the ice increase and the probability for the aft blade encountered with damaged ice decrease so the influence of shadow effect also decreased in general whether shadow effect would influence the contact process depended on the comparative sizes of length l and s 6 3 shadow coefficient from the above analysis we can see that the influence of the shadowing coefficient on the propeller ice contact force decreases with an increase of the advance speed and the influence of the shadowing effect was generally described using a shadowing effect coefficient wang et al 2007 used the ratio between the shadowing area and the blade area at the maximum blade section in contact with the ice to define the shadow effect as formula 18 shows 19 c s a s a e in the formula c s represents shadowing coefficient a s represents the shadowing area of the baled a e represents the whole area of the blade however for projectile ice contact problems there is a change due to the contact position of the blade with the ice and the maximum blade section with the ice also changes causing an uncertainty of the maximum blade section in contact with the ice that increases the difficulty in determining the shadowing coefficient when the cutting depth was set to 10 15 and 35 mm the blade area at the maximum blade section in contact with the ice would change to a section located 0 09 m 0 085 m and 0 065 m from the hub chang et al 2017 the shadow coefficient formula could only reflect the most severe degree of the shadow effect but the shadow effect influenced the entire process therefore the existing formula was not complete enough to reflect the degree of the shadow effect for the entire process and it was necessary to put forward another shadow coefficient formula this paper combines the concept of an ice force attenuation coefficient for an offshore platform for the cause of the shadowing effect and put forward another shadowing coefficient formula for propeller ice interaction wang et al 2016 with the proposed shadow coefficient when a blade encounters part of the path from the previous blade the ice load on the blade decreases therefore if s is less than l the next blade will not encounter any ice and the shadowing effect will be negligible when s is larger than l the next blade will encounter damaged ice furthermore as the length l decreases further and the initial locations of the front and rear blades are both in contact with the ice causing the shadow coefficient to increase considering these factors this paper proposes a new shadowing coefficient formula as follows 20 c s 0 s l 1 l s s l in the above formula s represents the axial length of the damaged ice area and l represents the initial axial distance of the forward and aft blades in contact with the ice the formula of l is as follows 21 l v z n j d z where v represents the ice block speed d is the diameter of the propeller j is the advance coefficient and z is the number of propeller blades the value of s depends on the milling angle α the advance coefficient j to calculate the length of s some propeller ice contact concepts must be defined fig 26 shows the concept map of the propeller ice contact α is the milling angle that corresponding to the depth of the cut β is the center age of the fan shaped area and γ is the angle between the blade bulbar and the fan arc the degree of γ depends on the cutting depth the paddle disk surface ratio and the number of blades compared with α the values of β and γ are small hence we use a correction factor to describe γ as shown in the following formulas 22 α β 2 γ β 1 e 23 e π a e c h z a o r 24 β 2 arccos r c h r in the formula above c h is the maximum cutting depth a e a o 1 represents the disk ratio of the blade using eq 24 through 22 gives the milling angle α in eq 25 a new formula can be obtained 25 α 2 arccos r c h r 1 π a e c h z a o r in the calculation it can be seen that s increases with the increase of α and decreases with the increase of j so we put forward the calculation formula of s as shown below 26 s s 0 α j α 0 j 0 in the formula s0 represents the axial length of the damaged ice area under standard working conditions and α 0 j 0 represents the ratio of the milling angle to the advance coefficient under the standard working conditions due to the fact the impact of the ice loads on the structure consists of periodic effects of loading and unloading a damage zone was proposed by sodhi and morris 1984 to quantify the distance either the ice or structure moves for each loading cycle due to the repetitive nature of the ice forces they can be characterized by determining a dominant frequency in which the ice forces vary thus the force data was transformed into the frequency domain using a fast fourier transform fft method the formula for is given by eq 27 27 s 0 v f in the formula above f is the structures natural frequency subjected to the ice forces and v is the relative velocity of the ice and the structure given by eq 28 28 v v 2 n π d 2 combining eqs 28 and 26 gives the shadowing effect coefficient in eq 29 29 c s 0 s l 1 α 0 f j 2 d j 0 α z v 2 n π d 2 s l in order to calculate the shadow coefficient it is necessary to calculate the characteristic frequencies of the ice loads hence we conducted an analysis of the frequencies of the ice loads under the standard working conditions the standard working condition in this study was selected to be the same as the condition for the model test conducted by the iot of canada wang et al 2005 the diameter of the propeller blade was set as d 0 3 m the cutting depth was set as c h 0 35 m the advance coefficient was set as j 0 3 and α 0 j 0 3 17 the ice block dimensions were a length of l i 200 mm width of w i 88 mm and thickness h i 66 mm the time series curve of the ice loads and the frequency curve obtained using fft fast fourier transformation sun et al 2018 method are depicted in fig 27 from fig 28 values for the shadow coefficient from wang et al 2005 and this study are plotted as a function the advance coefficient it can be seen that the shadow coefficient established in this paper could predict the influence degree of the shadow effect on the propeller ice contact process under different advance coefficients well although the calculation result was slightly larger than the model test result but the total variation trend the shadow effect predicted in this study coincide well with the results obtained from wang besides the zero point of the shadowing effect in our paper and in the study of wang occurred under the same working condition of the advanced coefficient j 0 45 it could be concluded from fig 28 that shadowing coefficient gradually increased with the decrease of the advance coefficient j and reached a maximum value with an advance coefficient of j 0 and then went to zero at j 0 45 and continued to remain at zero as the advance coefficient was continually increased as the advanced coefficient increased the initial distance of the forward and aft blades in contact with the ice increased so the influence degree of the shadow coefficient on the propeller ice contact also decreased under the working condition of an advance coefficient of 0 45 the aft blade was hardly in contact with the damaged ice and the shadow effect had no influence on the propeller ice contact so the advance coefficient was zero the formula used in this paper reflects the influence degree for the whole propeller ice contact process and this formula can directly calculate the shadow coefficient with the parameters for cutting depth and advanced coefficient confirmed 6 4 mechanism analysis for shadowing effect we further explore the physical mechanisms defining the shadowing effect on the ice loading of a propeller blade this was accomplished by studying the variations of ice loads acting on both the front and back of the blades with different shadowing coefficients the speed coefficients were set to 0 2 0 4 and 0 6 therefore by using the front formula established in this paper the shadow coefficients related to the three advanced coefficients were 0 82 0 4 and 0 the cutting depth was set to c h 35 m the front formula from eq 28 was employed to obtain the shadowing coefficients related to three separate advance velocities bond based peridynamic numerical simulations corresponding to the three advance coefficients are shown in fig 29 it can be seen that as the advance coefficients increased the damaged degree of the blade caused by the ice decreased additionally the axial distances of the contact locations for the front blade and rear blade in contact with the ice were closer and the influence of the shadowing coefficients on the contact process decreased in fig 30 a ice loads versus time are shown for three different advances shadowing coefficients fig 30 b d shows the time series of ice loads for the blade back and blade face sustained under different shadowing coefficients it is observed in fig 30 a that the ice loads acting on the blade are negative for j 0 2 but when j 0 4 the front half of the ice loads on the blade were always positive while the rear half ice loads on the blade were always negative for j 0 6 the ice loads on the blades were always negative the direction of ice loads varied as the advance coefficients changed this was caused by the shadowing effect because the blade trimming occurred towards the back direction the shadowing effect affected the blade face more severely than the blade back hence ice loads acting over the entire blade tended to change from negative to positive as the advance coefficient increased more specifically for j 0 2 a large contact area between the blade face and ice was shadowed because the front blade cut a large groove area in the ice block causing the contact area between the ice and the blade face to be much smaller than the back of the blade and subjecting the blade to a negative load for j 0 6 a small internal volume of ice was cut from the ice block and the shadowed area for the blade surface was quite small making the shadowing effect negligible however as the ice block moved forward and a forward load was applied to the propeller blade for j 0 4 the shadowed area of the blade surface was neither big nor small and the ice loads were influenced by both the shadowing effect and the forward motion of the ice block causing the direction of milling loads to change reciprocally between positive and negative it is therefore concluded that the shadowing effect had a negative correlation with the advance coefficient j all of these factors caused the influence of the shadow effect to be small therefore we can conclude that the shadow effect was negatively correlated with the advance coefficient of the ice block this study found that the shadow effect would affect the blade face more severely this was because the stoss end in this paper was set as the blade back a different stoss end would lead to a difference in the influence degree of the shadow effect for blade face and the blade back 7 conclusion in this paper we have established two numerical solution models that were coded in fortran and based on the bond peridynamics theory we have also numerically studied the shadowing effect between the front and the after propellers for multi propeller ice milling conditions as well as the shadowing effect between the front and the after propeller blades of single propeller ice milling conditions the following conclusions are proposed 1 this paper established a propeller ice contact model based on peridynamics from which the prediction of ice loads was obtained hence we compared the model test result with the numerical prediction result both results show a high degree of anastomosis indicating the applicability of the numerical calculation method established in this paper 2 the analysis shows that the shadow effect would only take effect when the axial length l was smaller than the axial length s of the shadowing area the strength of the ice for the after blade contact was damaged by the front blade during the entire milling process 3 the shadow effect would have a severe influence on the contacting process with a low shadow coefficient and if the advance coefficient increased the influence of shadow effect would decrease until it diminished additionally the shadow effect mainly affected the stoss end 4 a new shadow coefficient formula has been proposed in this paper based on a study of the cause of the shadow coefficients and an investigation of the predecessors the numerical simulation results show that the new formula can predict the influence of the shadow effect on the propeller ice contact the study in this paper only considers the shadowing effect under the conditions of the propeller milling of level ice for irregularly shaped ice and broken ice conditions further research need to be conducted in addition the new formula of the shadowing coefficient needs more numerical results and test data in order to be modified and improved the numerical model established in this paper considers the propeller as a rigid body a more accurate propeller ice contact model should be established which takes into account the structural deformation in the propeller blade acknowledgements the research was financially supported by the national natural science foundation of china grant

22278,a new partitioned fluid structure interaction fsi method is proposed for dynamic analysis of offshore structures the main idea of the developed approach is to provide the separation of different components caused by different contributions such as transferred conditions and updated loadings one theoretical development is that separated laplace domain responses can be obtained from the previous responses the other is that the structural responses in time domain can be easily calculated by inverse laplace transform once solutions to the structural responses at the time of interest are obtained the fluid loadings can be updated to consider the impacts of the responses on the geometry of the fluid domain more importantly the proposed method is able to improve the estimation accuracy of the structure responses and hence may provide better updating results of fluid loadings when the fsi mechanism is considered to demonstrate the correctness and accuracy of the approach three numerical examples are used in this paper the first example is a single degree of freedom dof system subject to an irregular dynamic loading the computation results show that the system responses at previous time steps can be successfully separated into typical components that correspond to different contributions such as transferred conditions and updated loadings the system responses at current time obtained by combining previous responses are in a good agreement with analytical results and those obtained by the newmark β method then the second example of a four dof lumped system is explored to indicate the superiority of the proposed method over the newmark β method in terms of accuracy finally in the third example of an elastic upright cantilever beam in water results show that the developed method has the ability to calculate dynamic responses with high precision when solving fsi problems which implies a potential application in ocean engineering keywords fluid structure interaction response separation laplace domain offshore structures 1 introduction the fluid structure interaction fsi phenomena has been found in a wide variety of engineering applications such as aerospace biomedical mechanical civil engineering and ocean engineering typical examples include the wing flutter in aircraft slone et al 2004 arterial modelling in human body taylor et al 1998 elliott et al 2017 and dynamics of coastal and offshore structures mattis et al 2015 yang et al 2012a extensive efforts have been made in the development of fsi modelling technologies benra et al 2011 however how to model the fsi in an engineering system with sufficient accuracy still remains an unsolved problem the fsi phenomena have been attracting considerable attentions in structural dynamics the fluid flow will add loading to deform the structure while the structural response will in turn affect the geometry of the fluid domain and the fluid flow therefore it is necessary to investigate the mutual effect caused by the interaction of fluid flow and structure in the structural dynamics a complete review of existing modelling techniques for general fsi problems was given by dowell and hall 2001 various physical models describing fluid time dependent motions were introduced in details and then a discussion of the distinction between linear and nonlinear models was performed also the time linearized models and their solutions in either the time or frequency domains were reviewed however due to the complex nature of fsi problems it is often impossible to find analytical solutions alternatively experimental tests and numerical simulations have been used to solve fsi problems because computational fluid dynamics cfd technology is able to simulate fluid structure interactions with comparable accuracy with experimental results many numerical solvers have been developed to deal with fsi modelling and simulation sigrist 2015 in general numerical methods can be categorized into monolithic and partitioned methods in monolithic methods grids for the interaction domain are generated in both the temporal and spatial domains since only a single solution equation needs to be solved this fully coupled approach works well in strong fsi analysis michler et al 2004 walhorn et al 2005 recently langer and yang 2018 employed a monolithic approach to investigate fsi problems with different hyperelastic models in an all at once manner the numerical simulations demonstrated high computational efficiency however the monolithic method is not flexible in coding modularization in contrast to the monolithic approach the partitioned method assumes that two different domains one for structure and the other one for fluid are used in fsi problems solving the interaction only occurs on the contact surface thus the independent algorithms and discretization methods can be applied to solve equations of fsi in each domain of the fluid and structure the code modularity of the partitioned method is enhanced significantly but an additional coupling algorithm is required to connect the two separate domains this approach can be found in many engineering subjects such as analysis of coupled wave ship or ocean platform motion and flow induced oil pipe vibration designs furthermore three types of partitioned fsi issues were defined by zienkiewicz and bettess 1978 large relative motion between the fluid and structure impulsive short time interactions and long term interactions the first type of interactions include coupled flow wing vibrations vortex induced oscillations etc underwater explosion and wave slamming klaseboer et al 2005 cao et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 fit in the second class of problems and hydroelastic motion of ships or marine structures subject to ocean wave loads are the examples in the third class obviously the partitioned approach is paid more attention due to the consideration of the coupling iteration which has not been considered in the isolated approach in addition the partitioned method can be easily implemented in existing solvers as a result the partitioned method is widely used in fsi problems liu et al 2014 mayr et al 2018 in the area of marine engineering the complexity of offshore structures coupled with fsi environment challenges the development of robust

implicit mps koshizuka and oka 1996 and smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph gingold and monaghan 1977 libersky et al 1993 gray et al 2001 have been applied to a wide number of fsi problems fourey et

slamming and sloshing with elastic baffles hwang et al 2014 2015 2016 the coupling scheme in the proposed partitioned method adopted the integration of pressure at the fluid structure interface the analysis results indicated good sensitivity of the fsi solver to slight fluctuations in the pressure field furthermore the latest development in sph correlated research can be found in khayyer et al 2017 and wu et al 2018 where several key issues for the development of reliable fully lagrangian particle based solvers have been discussed however literature review suggests that most of existing fsi researches focus on either finding better numerical solvers in the fluid domain or establishing more suitable fsi algorithms in other words the responses of structures are usually calculated by solving the system dynamics equations through methods of central differences newmark and wilson theta bathe 2016 it is questionable whether these numerical methods always provide solutions with sufficient accuracy to the structure responses unfortunately the time step resolution used in these numerical methods such as newmark may greatly influence the precision of the solution craig and kurdila 2006 how to improve the calculation accuracy of the structural dynamics using appropriate treatments on the time step resolution is still a challenging task in order to address the aforementioned challenge a novel partitioned method based on separation of responses is proposed in this paper this new method is based on the assumption that the motion equations of the offshore platforms between time steps are continuous functions and hence can be transformed into the laplace domain the contributions of this research can be described as follows 1 in the separation of the estimated response components at previous time steps the physical meaning of each component is explained by the fluids theory and the fsi phenomenon 2 the fluid loadings in the fsi environment can be updated at each time step to improve the estimation accuracy of the structure responses three numerical examples will be examined to evaluate the correctness and accuracy of the proposed fsi method which includes a single degree of freedom sdof system subject to an irregular dynamic loading a 4 dof lumped system and an elastic upright cantilever beam in water 2 preliminaries 2 1 laplace transform the laplace transform is mathematically described by the following integral 1 y s 0 y t e s t d t where s is a complex variable and y s is called the laplace transform of y t with a real argument t t 0 the inverse laplace transform is expressed in the form of the complex integral as follows 2 y t 1 2 π i lim t τ i t τ i t e s t y s d s i 1 where τ is a real number and the contour path of integration locates in the region of convergence of y s 2 2 average acceleration method given initial conditions of x 0 and x 0 the governing equation of a sdof linear system subject to an external loading f t was given by clough and penzien 1993 3 m x c x k x f t in which m k and c are the constant values of mass stiffness and damping respectively and x t and x t are the first and second order time derivatives of x t respectively among procedures for performing numerical integration of second order differential equations one of the most common is the average acceleration method the acceleration in the time between t i to t i 1 is taken as the average of the initial and final values of the acceleration that is 4 x τ 1 2 x τ x τ 1 integration of eq 4 twice gives 5 x i 1 x i δ t i 2 x i x i 1 and 6 x i 1 x i x i δ t i δ t i 2 4 x i x i 1 it is straightforward to use the previously computed values x i and x i and the incremental quantities δ f i δ x i and δ x i when coding the integration problems where δ f i f i 1 f i is defined and the similar equations for δ x i and δ x i then eq 6 can be solved for δ x i and eqs 5 and 6 can be combined to give δ x i as follows 7 δ x i 4 δ t i 2 δ x i x i δ t i 2 x i and 8 δ x i 2 δ t i δ x i 2 x i since eq 3 is satisfied at both t i and t i 1 we can form the following incremental equation of motion 9 m δ x i c δ x i k δ x i δ f i then the estimated displacement for time t t i 1 is given by the following 10 x i 1 x i δ x i and the velocity is 11 x i 1 x i δ x i the acceleration at time t i can be obtained from the equation of motion 12 x i m 1 f i c x i k x i 3 fluid structure interaction mechanisms at each time step 3 1 hydrodynamic loading on small scale members the morison formula is a semi theoretical and empirical formulation which determines the wave load on a small scale member it includes two terms inertia force and velocity force 13 f f i f d where f i represents the inertia force and f d is the velocity force thus the formulas can be rewritten as follows 14 f i c m ρ π d 2 4 u and 15 f d c d ρ 2 d u u where c m and c d represent the coefficients of inertia force and velocity force respectively ρ is the water density d is the member diameter u is the velocity of the water particle and u represents the acceleration of the water particle hypothesis is made that u and x are collinear if the small scale member vibrates in the fluid the modified morison equation can be written as 16 f c d ρ 2 d u x u x ρ π d 2 4 u c m 1 ρ π d 2 4 u x 3 2 equations of motion of structures employing a finite element approach the governing equation of an offshore structure can be represented below 17 m x t c x t k x t f t where m c and k are matrices with dimensions of n 1 and n is the number of dofs of the structure one notes that m is a combination of system mass and added mass caused by surrounded fluid 3 3 coupling mechanisms to consider the fluid structure interactions between the structure and external loadings the governing equations for the n dof linear viscous damping system can be derived as 18 m x t c x t k x t f x t u t x t u t u t where f x t u t x t u t u t are the external loadings which are a function of the fluid velocities u t fluid accelerations u t and structural velocities x t at the points where the wave loadings are computed because the fluid structure interaction is a physical phenomenon that appears in the whole dynamic process of offshore structures eq 18 can be written at time t k as 19 m x t k c x t k k x t k f t k where x t k x t k t k k δ t δ t t k 1 t k k 1 2 n k and n k is the number of discrete points of f t k in contrast to the traditional incremental method of solving eq 9 the proposed method attempts to estimate the transferred response at time t k 1 t k δ t i e x t k 1 directly from the known responses x t k x t k and f t k similar to the definition of initial conditions in structural dynamics which are values of evolving variables at some point in time for example t 0 in this paper the displacement x t k and velocity x t k at time t t k are defined by the conditions of eq 19 at time t k accordingly x t k 1 is then regarded as a transferred influence from the previous time results x t k x t k and f t k 4 fluid structure interaction analysis of offshore structures based on separation of transferred responses to realize the academic idea described above we expect to iteratively estimate response x t k 1 caused by previous conditions x t k and x t k and the external loadings however two challenges arise the first is which domain should be used to separate the effects corresponding to the conditions and updated external loadings the second is how to ensure the correctness of the transferred conditions at time t k 1 4 1 starting response estimation under the assumption that the system is subject to initial conditions x t k x 0 and x t k x 0 substituting the first value f t 0 into eq 18 yields 20 x t 1 m 1 f t 1 c x t 1 k x t 1 the responses of a system described by m k and c at time t 1 can easily be obtained by employing eq 20 but the actual difficulty lies in estimating responses for the next times t k where k 2 3 n k 4 2 time lag response estimation transferred from previous conditions to separate effects corresponding to the conditions and the updated external loadings we first define a new time variable t to represent the time duration of t t k t k 1 because t is normally a very small range we assume that responses including x t x t and x t within t k t k 1 are all continuous functions in the following studies if the external loadings are neglected then eq 18 can be written as 21 m x t c x t k x t 0 to apply the laplace transform on eq 21 one obtains 22 m s 2 x s s x t k x t k c s x s x t k k x s 0 rearranging the above equation and replacing x s with x i s yields 23 m s 2 c s k x i s m x t k s m x t k c x t k in which x i s is called the response caused by conditions at previous time t k including displacements x t k and velocities x t k considering that the righthand side of eq 23 has two different orders of variables eq 23 is rewritten as 24 m s 2 c s k x i s s f s f h in which 25 f s m x t k and 26 f h m x t k c x t k where f s and f h are both vectors with a dimension of n 1 accordingly x i s can also be divided into two parts which are denoted x i s s and x i h s respectively and satisfy 27 x i s x i s s x i h s in the following we define x i s s as the contribution of the s term and x i h s as the contribution of the hybrid term by comparing eq 24 to eq 27 one obtains 28 x i s s m s 2 c s k 1 s f s it is noted that in eq 28 no analytical inverse laplace transform of the function s f s exists therefore the response x i s t cannot be obtained directly in use of eq 2 however such response at the qth position kreyszig 1999 can be determined as follows 29 x i q s s d q s d s 1 p 1 n x i q p s s where d s m s 2 c s k and d q s is the determinant obtained from d s s in which the qth column is replaced by the entries s f s one should note that the mass matrix m must be an invertible square matrix thus 30 x i q s s 1 p q d q p s d s 1 in which d q p s is obtained by deleting the pth row and qth column simultaneously the roots of the denominator d s s in eq 30 are only poles denoted as η l s of the system described by m k and c and they can be approximated using the state space form as follows 31 a 0 i m 1 k m 1 c the roots of numerator d q p s are calculated using the modified matrices m q p c q p and k q p which are obtained by deleting the pth row and qth column of m c and k respectively however one should note that there are altogether 2 n 1 zeros τ n s and the first one τ 1 s 0 the reader can find a brief procedure in the appendix referring to hu et al 2016b once the poles η l s and zeros τ n s are obtained eq 30 can be rewritten as 32 x i q p s s κ q p s n 1 2 n 1 s τ n s l 1 2 n 1 s τ l s where κ q p s 1 p q m q p m 1 σ q s here σ q s is the qth element of f s the final purpose of this article is to obtain time domain responses of a coupled system x i q p s t by implementing the inverse laplace transform of x i q p s s therefore eq 32 can be rewritten in the following form 33 x i q p s s i 2 n β i s s η i s where 34 β i s lim s β i s x i q p s s similar to eq 32 one can obtain 35 x i q p h s κ q p h n 1 2 n 1 s τ n h l 1 2 n 1 s η l h l 2 n β l s s η l s where 36 β i h lim s β i h x i q p h s therefore by substituting eqs 33 and 34 into eq 27 one can obtain the following solution of eq 27 37 x i q p s l 2 n β l i s η l i where β l i β l s β l h and η l i η l s η l h applying the inverse laplace transform to the above equation one has 38 x i q p t l 2 n β l i e η l i t but one should note that t in eq 38 is only one time step defined by δ t from eq 38 one can then determine the corresponding velocity x i q p t as 39 x i q p t l 2 n β l i η l i e η l i t iteratively calculating x i q p t and x i q p t for p 1 2 n and q 1 2 n the accelerations can be determined by 40 x i t m 1 c x i t k x i t 4 3 time lag response estimation caused by external loadings in this section we will focus on estimating responses denoted as x f t k 1 at time t k 1 caused by updated external loadings f t rewriting eq 18 in the time duration t t k t k 1 yields 41 m x f t c x f t k x f t f where f represents the external loadings within time t k t k 1 in eq 41 one also should note where f at time t k 1 is a result of recalculating the external loadings by considering the influences of transferred velocities and accelerations at time t k 1 which takes into account the effects on the geometry of the fluid domain and the fluid flow because of the dynamic response or deformation of the structure transforming eq 41 into the laplace domain by assuming conditions at time t k are x t k 0 and x t k 0 one obtains 42 x f s m s 2 c s k 1 f s δ t where f s is a vector that has values of updated external loadings at time t k when a load is imposed on the pth position the system response at the qth position can be written as 43 x q p f s μ s 2 c s k 1 σ f s where σ f s is a real value of f s δ t at the pth position comparing the above equation to eq 34 one can conclude that eq 43 can also be converted to 44 x q p f s κ q p f l 1 2 n 1 s τ l f l 1 2 n s η l f l 2 n β l f s η l f where 45 β l f lim s η l s x q p f s and η l f η l i comparing eq 42 to eq 43 one can conclude that the value of response x q p f s will be very small compared with x i q p f s when a very small time interval δ t is used however when a rough δ t is employed x q p f s can not be neglected 4 4 response estimation of the coupled system based on the above derivations one can find that the response in time duration t is a combination of eq 37 and eq 44 as follows 46 x q p s l 2 n β l f s η l f l 2 n β l i s η l i for simplification eq 46 can be further rewritten as 47 x q p s l 2 n β l s η l where β l β l f β l i and η l η l f η l i therefore the displacement for time t k 1 can be obtained by implementing the inverse laplace transform of eq 47 as follows 48 x q p t k 1 l 2 n β l e η l t from eqs 47 and 48 one can conclude that these two equations constitute a strictly laplace transform pair and thus the estimated results at time t k 1 are exactly the true effects caused by conditions x t k and x t k and the external loadings then the second challenge mentioned previously is solved likewise velocity is estimated by 49 x q p t k 1 l 2 n β l η l e η l t one can also estimate accelerations x t k 1 of the system by referring to eq 12 4 5 scheme of the proposed method the nine step process is given below to describe the proposed methods 1 the matrices k c and m are given as well as the initial conditions x 0 and x 0 2 the force vector f in eq 19 at time t 0 s is then calculated 3 accelerations for the starting point t t 1 0 s are calculated using eq 20 4 the response caused by the s term is estimated poles η l s and τ n s are calculated from eq 31 and κ q p s is obtained from 1 p q m q p m 1 σ q s substituting κ q p s η l s and τ n s into eq 32 residue β l s can be obtained by using eq 34 5 the response caused by the hybrid term is estimated the same procedure used to obtain κ q p s can be used to calculate κ q p h let τ n h be equal to the part of τ n s here n 2 3 2 n 1 and η l s η l h then residue β l h is obtained by using eqs 35 and 36 6 the external loadings are updated external loadings are regenerated in terms of the transferred displacements velocities and or accelerations of the structure at time t 2 δ t 7 the contribution of updated external loadings is estimated let η l s η l f residue β l f is obtained by employing eqs 44 and 45 8 the time domain responses are estimated let t 0 δ t response x q p t k 1 is estimated by employing eq 48 9 steps 4 8 are iteratively implemented and the responses of the system considering the effect of fluid structure interactions are estimated 5 example 1 a sdof system the purpose of this example is to illustrate the procedure and demonstrate its performance by comparing the results of the proposed method with those from analytical or typically used numerical techniques for simplification a sdof system with the mass m 10 kg stiffness k 40 n m and damping c 1 n m is considered these values are used to model a lower damping system to represent practical engineering structures specifically the system has a damping factor ς c 2 k m 0 0250 natural frequency ω n k m 2 rad s and damped frequency ω d ω n 1 ς 2 1 9994 rad s in the following three scenarios will be studied in the first the responses of the proposed method will be compared with analytical solutions caused by only non zero initial conditions to show the performance of the approach for transient response estimation the second will demonstrate the capability of steady state response estimation when the system is subjected to a harmonic loading in addition to comparisons with analytical results the third scenario aims to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method which general numerical techniques deal with the convolution integral 5 1 scenario 1 transient response comparison of the proposed method with the analytical solution to validate the proposed method for transient response estimation the analytical result of the system subject to non zero initial conditions x 0 and x 0 will be calculated by 50 x 1 1 t e ς ω n t x 0 cos ω d t x 0 ς ω n x 0 ω d sin ω d t from eq 50 the analytical result free response can easily be obtained when initial conditions x 0 and x 0 are both determined specially x 0 0 05 m and x 0 0 15 m s are randomly employed as discussed in the first step of the scheme of the proposed method the acceleration of the starting point t 0 s can be calculated using eq 20 referring to step 3 it is x 0 0 2150 m s2 we first take the estimation of the responses at time t δ t 0 02 s as an example as discussed in steps 4 and 5 substituting x 0 0 12 and x 0 0 25 into eq 25 and eq 26 reveals that f s 0 5000 and f h 1 5500 employing step 4 yields residues β l s 0 0250 0 0006i and β l h 0 0000 0 0388i before implementing step 8 the poles of the system should be estimated from eq 31 values of 0 0500 1 9994i obtained therefore the time domain responses of the system at t 0 02 s can be calculated by using eq 49 yielding a value of 0 0530 m iteratively implementing steps 4 8 produces estimated responses with a time duration of 20 s as shown in fig 1 which also includes analytical solutions obtained using eq 50 it is noted that the transient responses calculated by the developed method match very well with the analytical ones to further study the performance of the proposed method when a coarser time step is used the second challenge mentioned previously δ t is set to 1 s to calculate the transient responses based on the same considerations used to obtain fig 1 a comparison of the estimated displacements and velocities is shown in fig 2 which also shows good consistence of the estimated responses to quantify the consistence of the two estimated lines in fig 1 the correlation coefficient is calculated by using the matlab code corrcoef resulting in a value of 1 0000 for fig 2 a the reasons that the results match so well are that the estimation of transient responses is not limited to the selected time step which can be demonstrated by referring to eq 38 5 2 scenario 2 steady state response comparison in this section the steady state responses of the system are calculated using the proposed method the system is assumed to vibrate starting from the state of rest i e initial conditions x 0 and x 0 are both zeros to enable a comparison with the analytical solutions a periodic loading is synthesized and imposed on the system via the following 51 f 0 t p 0 cos ω t where p 0 is a constant representing amplitude and ω is the frequency of the loading the total response analytical solution due to excitation f 0 t can be calculated by 52 y a t u 0 1 ρ 2 cos ω t a 1 cos ω n t a 2 sin ω n t in which u 0 p 0 k ρ ω ω n and a 1 and a 2 are constants to be determined by the initial conditions x 0 and x 0 substituting the pre set values of p 0 k x 0 and x 0 one obtains u 0 0 0050 ρ 1 5000 a 2 0 0040 and a 2 2 5915 10 4 respectively the calculated analytical solutions displacement and velocity obtained by implementing eq 52 and its first derivative with the time step δ t 0 02 s used in fig 1 are plotted as blue solid lines in fig 3 in contrast to the process used to obtain fig 1 eq 44 must also be calculated because of the non zero values of σ f s in eq 43 to enable a comparison with the procedure used to obtain fig 1 here we also take the estimation of the responses at time t δ t 0 02 s as an example considering the unchange system mass stiffness and damping the poles will remain at 0 0500 1 9994 i from eqs 34 and 36 the estimated residues β l s β l h 0 at time t 0 02 s due to the zero initial conditions in contrast to zero residues β l s β l h the estimated residue β l f 0 0 1 10 3 i via eq 45 thus the steady state response at time t 0 02 s can be obtained by using eq 48 yielding a value of 0 3995 10 3 m iteratively implementing eq 48 the displacement and velocity of the system subject to the harmonic loading are plotted by the red dashed lines in fig 3 the results demonstrate the correctness of the proposed method for steady state response estimation and the capacity can be further demonstrated by the calculated correlation coefficient between the estimated displacement and the analytical solution which is 0 9994 5 3 scenario 3 total response comparison when the system is subjected to a general excitation the above two scenarios clearly demonstrate the correctness of the proposed method for the estimation of transient and steady state responses in this section a much more complicated case will be discussed to show the capacity of the proposed method for dealing with the issue of fsi to do so the fluid loading f t is synthesized by using the following formula 53 f t k n 1 3 b n cos 2 π f n t k θ k c d x k x k c m x k where the parameters f n b n and θ n in the above equation are listed in table 1 the first term simulates the imposed dynamic loading which ignores the influence of vibrated structures the second and third terms are used to consider the interactions between the external loading and the system for which c d and c m are the coefficients here one should note that the acceleration of the fluid particle is replaced by the structure acceleration x k to consider the influence of the change in fluid particle acceleration specifically we arbitrarily set c d 1 25 and c m 2 50 in this example in fig 4 the time interval δ t is equal to 0 02 s and a time period of 10 s for the simulations is considered the excitation load f t obtained by the proposed method is compared with the one by just considering the velocity and acceleration of fluid particles in the uncoupled analysis it can be seen that an effect would be acted on the external loadings by the consideration of the fluid structure interactions however when a system is subjected to general dynamic loadings the steady state solutions are usually represented by the corresponding convolution terms as a result numerical techniques such as newmark β method is used during the estimation of forced responses in addition to consider the more practical case in engineering that the system may not vibrate initially at rest so x 0 0 05 m and x 0 0 15 m s are used in the first step of the scheme by implementing the proposed method based on the same considerations used to obtain fig 1 we take an estimation of the responses at time t δ t 0 02 s as an example setting δ t 0 02 s ensures the accuracy of the estimated results by using the newmark β method as discussed in steps 4 and 5 substituting x 0 0 05 and x 0 0 15 into eq 25 and eq 26 yields f s 0 5000 and f h 1 5500 in terms of eqs 38 44 and 48 one can obtain the estimated displacement x i 1 1 δ t 0 0533 m x i 1 1 δ t 0 1809 m s and x i 1 1 δ t 1 3665 m s2 iteratively implementing steps 4 8 the responses of the system considering the effect of the fsi can then be estimated table 2 lists the estimated responses at the first five estimated points using the developed approach in terms of the displacement velocity and acceleration in fig 5 the estimated responses with a time duration of 20 s are compared with the results calculated by the newmark β method in which γ 1 2 and β 1 4 are considered it can be observed that the results obtained by the proposed method are in good agreement with the one by the newmark β method 5 4 advantages of the proposed method another remaining question is the advantage of the proposed method compared with typically used step by step procedures such as the newmark β method numerical methods are occasionally significantly influenced by the time interval δ t used and the selection of the time interval is often affected by three factors 1 the rate of change of the load 2 the complexity of the nonlinear damping and stiffness properties and 3 the period of vibration the time interval must be sufficiently short so that all of these factors are reliably represented thus a rough time interval δ t 0 4 s is adopted to estimate the system responses because it is difficult to conclude which method is better if only possible discrepancies of the estimated results obtained by implementing the approach and the newmark β method are considered the time responses of the dynamic system to arbitrary loading are also calculated as a reference by employing the matlab function lsim gupta 2014 the code is based on the state space model and a precondition of using this code is that the input signal should be undersampled specifically a time interval smaller than 0 5 s is required when using lsim in this example which is also why the time interval δ t 0 4 s is used above following the same procedure used to obtain fig 5 comparisons of the system responses by the proposed method newmark β method and matlab function lsim are given in fig 6 the results by using the matlab function lsim are denoted as state space in the legend of fig 6 because it is based on the theory of conversion from a physical model to a state space model as shown in fig 6 the responses obtained using the newmark β method are significantly smaller than those obtained using the matlab function lsim sindicating that the proposed method outperforms the typically used newmark β when a rough time interval is used 6 example 2 a 4 dof system in this example a 4 dof lumped system is tested to demonstrate the ability of the propose method in solving a problem of a mdof system the mass stiffness and damping matrices of the system are given as follows 54 m 1200 0 0 0 0 850 0 0 0 0 4125 0 0 0 0 125000 55 k 1 10 8 0 3100 0 0100 0 0 0 0100 0 0700 0 0600 0 5118 0 0 0600 0 1200 0 0 0 5118 0 8 7313 56 c 6000 6000 0 0 6000 24000 18000 153500 0 18000 36000 0 0 153500 0 2619400 four frequencies in an eigen analysis are obtained 3 1350 10 7067 18 2791 and 25 5659 hz for simplification each applied external loading imposed on each dof of the system is also simulated by 57 f t δ 1 u x u x δ 2 u δ 3 u x where u 0 25 cos 0 0806 1 2566t and u 0 3341 sin 0 0806 1 2566t are used to simulate the velocity and acceleration of water particles δ 1 δ 2 and δ 3 are the coefficients of the three terms specifically δ 1 8 5 δ 2 5 5 and δ 3 2 55 respectively setting δ t 0 0001 s the simulated loading can be obtained as shown in fig 7 with a time duration of 10 s the setting of δ t 0 0001s is not arbitrary but a careful choice based on multiple trials with different δ t values to ensure that newmark β method can provide sufficiently accurate results in the simulations 6 1 response estimation when the system is not initially at rest in this example matlab code rand is applied to randomly generate the non zero initial conditions the obtained initial displacement vector is x 0 0 9528 0 7041 0 9539 0 5982 10 5 and the velocity vector is x 0 0 8407 0 4428 0 8368 0 5187 10 5 the generated values are all multiplied by 10 5 to ensure that the resultant responses are compatible with those obtained with the external loadings during the process of step 4 it should be noted that the pth row and qth column of matrices m c and k must be simultaneously deleted for the estimation of η l s and τ n s using eq 31 for example when p 1 and q 2 the estimated τ n s are 0 6 109 1666 67 1 0478 83 5700i and 0 4364 53 9342i and the poles η l s are 0 29 160 92i 2 05 114 68i 0 7 67 26i and 0 11 19 69i via eqs 32 and 34 residues β l s 106 are 0 3490 0 0461i 0 2507 0 0304i 0 0292 0 0016i and 0 0692 0 0011i respectively based on the same procedure used to obtain fig 5 the responses of the second dof can be obtained as shown in fig 8 which reveals remarkably good consistency of the responses by the proposed and newmark β methods 6 2 investigation of the accuracy of the proposed method as with any numerical integration method the accuracy of the newmark β method depends on the length of the time increment δ t consequently errors of the estimated responses will be produced when the rough time interval δ t is used in contrast to this step by step procedure the proposed method employs laplace transform pairs based on the estimated poles and residues corresponding to transferred conditions and updated loadings in other words the response estimation between each time step is a continuous transformation and not a numerical approximation therefore one may predict that the proposed method will provide a better accuracy of response estimation to enable the comparison of results between the proposed and newmark β methods δ t 0 001s is assigned in fig 8 when δ t 0 0001 s and δ t 0 001 s are applied the responses obtained by newmark β method are shown in fig 9 the results reveal that δ t 0 0001 s is sufficiently accurate for newmark β method to estimate the system responses therefore the results by newmark β method with δ t 0 0001 s are used as a criterion in the following studies in order to investigate the performance of the proposed method a comparison of the estimated displacements with the time t 0 2 is given in fig 10 it is noted that there exists obvious discrepancies between the displacement predicted by the newmark β method with δ t 0 01 s and the other two curves whereas the proposed method provides better results even when the rough time interval is used meanwhile a standard deviation comparison between the newmark β and the proposed methods with the increment δ t 0 01s is drawn in fig 11 it can be seen that the convergence of the proposed method is much better than that of the newmark β method which means the proposed method has a great advantage to obtain the response within a rough time interval 6 3 computational performance of the proposed method in addition to the accuracy of response estimation computational performance is an important concern for a coupled dynamic analysis method in the following we will focus on the computational performance of the proposed method as discussed in fig 9 when δ t 0 0001 s both newmark β and the proposed methods can provide accurate estimations of the responses even considering the fluid structure interaction therefore we will retain δ t 0 0001 s but the time duration of the response estimation changes from 1 to 10 s the recorded cpu times for both methods are shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the newmark β method requires less cpu time for the same number of iterations e g the newmark β method requires only 80 05 s for 40000 iterations whereas the proposed method requires 577 51 s thus the newmark β method greatly outperforms the proposed method in computational efficiency in the proposed method the residues corresponding to the transferred conditions are required and updated loadings must be estimated iteratively which takes the majority of the cpu time as a greatly refined time interval is not required for the proposed method as shown in fig 10 the time consuming process of residue estimation can be overcome by using a rough time interval for example rather than maintaining a constant time duration fig 12 the consumed cpu time is recorded when different δ t values are used for the 1 s response estimation as listed in table 3 the proposed method only requires 1 3040 s to reach nearly the same accuracy with δ t 0 01 s whereas the newmark β method requires δ t 0 0001 s to ensure the accuracy of the response estimation and takes 28 4283 s 7 example 3 an elastic cylinder in water an elastic upright cantilever beam in water water depth 10 m shown in fig 13 is utilized to evaluate the accuracy of the developed method the system is modelled with uniform beam elements for each node of beam elements two translational and one rotational dofs are assumed the beam has a length of 12 m and its circular section is 1 25 m in diameter and 22 mm in thickness young s modulus is 2 1 1011 pa and the mass density is 7850 kg m3 the cross sectional moment of inertia is 1 6004 10 2 m4 based on the research craig 1981 the element stiffness matrix k n and mass matrix m n can be easily obtained the global damping matrix has the form c n 1 3 γ n c n where c n has a scaled form of k n and is assumed to be c n 10 5 k n applying airy s linear wave theory wu et al 2019 water particle kinematics can be evaluated the assumption is that a wave height h is small as compared with its wave length l and depth d for simplification a regular wave will be taken into account specifically the wave height is 0 6 m and the wave period is 10 s according to morison s equation the intensity of the wave force per unit length is given as follows 58 f h t 0 5 ρ ω c d d u x u x 0 25 π d 2 ρ ω c m u 0 25 π d 2 c m 1 ρ ω x the last term in the equation is the added mass fig 14 presents the calculated velocity and acceleration of water particles at elevations of 1 and 0 m as shown in fig 13 harmonic wave loadings will be generated and thus the traditional fourier transform can be used to convert the wave loadings to the frequency domain in addition based on the fact that s i ω s where ω s is the frequency of the structure eq 47 can also be transformed from the laplace domain to the frequency domain therefore frequency domain responses can be estimated even if non zero initial conditions exist liu et al 2016b 2016a 2019 in this example we assume the cylinder is initially at rest following the procedure used to obtain fig 5 the dynamic responses of the cylinder subjected to wave forces can be obtained by eq 58 where c d 1 0 and c m 1 2 fig 15 presents a comparison of the coupled and uncoupled loadings which exhibit significant discrepancy because of the introduced velocities and accelerations of the cylinder the estimated responses at the top of the cylinder in the translational direction are shown in fig 16 a c where the time interval δ t 1 10 4 s is used as shown in fig 16 there is a good agreement for the estimated displacements but not for the velocities and accelerations the reason is as shown in fig 10 the newmark β method is often affected by the time interval used which can be further demonstrated by recalculating the responses with δ t 1 10 5 s as shown in fig 17 the zoomed part t 0 0 02 s in general the proposed method can provide dynamic responses with a high level of accuracy when considering the fluid structure interaction and researchers can also easily combine their works by replacing eq 5 because the proposed method is a partitioned fsi technique 8 conclusions a new fsi method for offshore structures is proposed in this paper which divides the laplace domain responses of the structure into three different parts i e the contributions of the s term the hybrid term and original external loadings respectively the keys to the success of the approach are 1 the conversion of these three different contributions to a form of complex exponentials in the laplace domain will facilitate their transformation to the time domain using the inverse laplace transform and 2 the fact that the three parts share the same poles the most important observations are that the analytical laplace domain responses of the structure is not restrained from the simple inputs and the impacts of vibrational structures on the surrounding fluids can be considered at each time step as well from the three numerical examples used the following three conclusions can be drawn 1 the responses caused by the transferred conditions and updated loadings can be separated successfully and their combination is simply the targeted response of the system 2 compared with the traditional fsi method which often solves equations of motion of the structure by numerical schemes such as the newmark β method the proposed approach provides more accurate estimations of responses even when a rough time interval is used because of the existence of laplace transform pairs of the three separated contributions 3 during the recalculation of the wave loadings at each time step more suitable wave theories can be employed to provide a more accurate estimation of the wave loadings in general the proposed method can provide highly precise and accurate response estimations for 2 or 3 dimensional fixed structures at each time step only if the motion equations can be represented by eq 17 accordingly wave loadings can also be estimated more reasonably which implies a better representation of the physical fsi phenomenon for offshore structures at this stage the proposed method cannot be used for floating structures because the motion equations of a floating structure normally include a convolution term to consider the radiation forces caused by these structures due to the advantage of the proposed method which is not as strictly limited with respect to the time interval as the widely used newmark β and wilson θ method the issue of unstable behavior of traditional partitioned methods can be expected to improve to accomplish this improvement our future work will first focus on the study of transfer functions of floating structures and then extend the proposed method to deal with floating structures declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

22278,a new partitioned fluid structure interaction fsi method is proposed for dynamic analysis of offshore structures the main idea of the developed approach is to provide the separation of different components caused by different contributions such as transferred conditions and updated loadings one theoretical development is that separated laplace domain responses can be obtained from the previous responses the other is that the structural responses in time domain can be easily calculated by inverse laplace transform once solutions to the structural responses at the time of interest are obtained the fluid loadings can be updated to consider the impacts of the responses on the geometry of the fluid domain more importantly the proposed method is able to improve the estimation accuracy of the structure responses and hence may provide better updating results of fluid loadings when the fsi mechanism is considered to demonstrate the correctness and accuracy of the approach three numerical examples are used in this paper the first example is a single degree of freedom dof system subject to an irregular dynamic loading the computation results show that the system responses at previous time steps can be successfully separated into typical components that correspond to different contributions such as transferred conditions and updated loadings the system responses at current time obtained by combining previous responses are in a good agreement with analytical results and those obtained by the newmark β method then the second example of a four dof lumped system is explored to indicate the superiority of the proposed method over the newmark β method in terms of accuracy finally in the third example of an elastic upright cantilever beam in water results show that the developed method has the ability to calculate dynamic responses with high precision when solving fsi problems which implies a potential application in ocean engineering keywords fluid structure interaction response separation laplace domain offshore structures 1 introduction the fluid structure interaction fsi phenomena has been found in a wide variety of engineering applications such as aerospace biomedical mechanical civil engineering and ocean engineering typical examples include the wing flutter in aircraft slone et al 2004 arterial modelling in human body taylor et al 1998 elliott et al 2017 and dynamics of coastal and offshore structures mattis et al 2015 yang et al 2012a extensive efforts have been made in the development of fsi modelling technologies benra et al 2011 however how to model the fsi in an engineering system with sufficient accuracy still remains an unsolved problem the fsi phenomena have been attracting considerable attentions in structural dynamics the fluid flow will add loading to deform the structure while the structural response will in turn affect the geometry of the fluid domain and the fluid flow therefore it is necessary to investigate the mutual effect caused by the interaction of fluid flow and structure in the structural dynamics a complete review of existing modelling techniques for general fsi problems was given by dowell and hall 2001 various physical models describing fluid time dependent motions were introduced in details and then a discussion of the distinction between linear and nonlinear models was performed also the time linearized models and their solutions in either the time or frequency domains were reviewed however due to the complex nature of fsi problems it is often impossible to find analytical solutions alternatively experimental tests and numerical simulations have been used to solve fsi problems because computational fluid dynamics cfd technology is able to simulate fluid structure interactions with comparable accuracy with experimental results many numerical solvers have been developed to deal with fsi modelling and simulation sigrist 2015 in general numerical methods can be categorized into monolithic and partitioned methods in monolithic methods grids for the interaction domain are generated in both the temporal and spatial domains since only a single solution equation needs to be solved this fully coupled approach works well in strong fsi analysis michler et al 2004 walhorn et al 2005 recently langer and yang 2018 employed a monolithic approach to investigate fsi problems with different hyperelastic models in an all at once manner the numerical simulations demonstrated high computational efficiency however the monolithic method is not flexible in coding modularization in contrast to the monolithic approach the partitioned method assumes that two different domains one for structure and the other one for fluid are used in fsi problems solving the interaction only occurs on the contact surface thus the independent algorithms and discretization methods can be applied to solve equations of fsi in each domain of the fluid and structure the code modularity of the partitioned method is enhanced significantly but an additional coupling algorithm is required to connect the two separate domains this approach can be found in many engineering subjects such as analysis of coupled wave ship or ocean platform motion and flow induced oil pipe vibration designs furthermore three types of partitioned fsi issues were defined by zienkiewicz and bettess 1978 large relative motion between the fluid and structure impulsive short time interactions and long term interactions the first type of interactions include coupled flow wing vibrations vortex induced oscillations etc underwater explosion and wave slamming klaseboer et al 2005 cao et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 fit in the second class of problems and hydroelastic motion of ships or marine structures subject to ocean wave loads are the examples in the third class obviously the partitioned approach is paid more attention due to the consideration of the coupling iteration which has not been considered in the isolated approach in addition the partitioned method can be easily implemented in existing solvers as a result the partitioned method is widely used in fsi problems liu et al 2014 mayr et al 2018 in the area of marine engineering the complexity of offshore structures coupled with fsi environment challenges the development of robust numerical solvers liu et al 2016a b 2017 lataillade et al 2017 anagnostopoulos 1982 studied time domain solutions to the fixed platform under extreme wave loadings in random directional seas and found that the fsi degree increased with dynamic amplification as discussed by chaplin et al 2005 and hover et al 1997 fsi occurring in marine risers played an important role in the stability of marine structures chaplin et al 2005 described measurements of the vortex induced vibration viv of a model vertical tension riser in a stepped current to improve knowledge of the viv physics of risers cui et al 2014 numerically investigated the viv of two elastically connected side by side circular cylinders in a steady flow lim and xiao 2016 investigated the fundamental physics of complex fsi by a one way coupling fsi gravity based structure gbs the simulation results showed that the weak coupling system was more flexible and also parameters and algorithms to address the fsi problem are developed for gbs applicable to offshore platforms ferras et al 2017 assessed the fsi during hydraulic transients in straight pipeline systems fixed to anchor blocks valuable insights have been added into the knowledge and understanding of fsi with anchor block inertia and dry friction in straight pipelines hu et al 2016a proposed a simple based implicit method sbmim for the strong coupling of fluid and structure the results demonstrated that sbmim has the ability to efficiently solve the navier stokes equations of fluid habchi et al 2013 developed a partitioned approach based fsi solver using a block gauss seidel implicit scheme the analysis results showed that the developed fsi solver can accurately present the interactions between the flow and structures chen et al 2016 developed a fsi algorithm for two way strong interactions between fluid and solid with an emphasis on floating bodies since particle based methods can perfectly solve large deformation problems moving particle semi implicit mps koshizuka and oka 1996 and smoothed particle hydrodynamics sph gingold and monaghan 1977 libersky et al 1993 gray et al 2001 have been applied to a wide number of fsi problems fourey et al 2010 and yang et al 2012b applied a combination of the particle based and finite element methods for structure dynamics simulations recently shao et al 2013 developed a fully explicit particle method to solve fsi problems using mps and hamiltonian mps hwang et al 2014 applied a fully lagrangian mps based fsi solver to a set of ocean engineering applications such as simple hydroelastic slamming and sloshing with elastic baffles hwang et al 2014 2015 2016 the coupling scheme in the proposed partitioned method adopted the integration of pressure at the fluid structure interface the analysis results indicated good sensitivity of the fsi solver to slight fluctuations in the pressure field furthermore the latest development in sph correlated research can be found in khayyer et al 2017 and wu et al 2018 where several key issues for the development of reliable fully lagrangian particle based solvers have been discussed however literature review suggests that most of existing fsi researches focus on either finding better numerical solvers in the fluid domain or establishing more suitable fsi algorithms in other words the responses of structures are usually calculated by solving the system dynamics equations through methods of central differences newmark and wilson theta bathe 2016 it is questionable whether these numerical methods always provide solutions with sufficient accuracy to the structure responses unfortunately the time step resolution used in these numerical methods such as newmark may greatly influence the precision of the solution craig and kurdila 2006 how to improve the calculation accuracy of the structural dynamics using appropriate treatments on the time step resolution is still a challenging task in order to address the aforementioned challenge a novel partitioned method based on separation of responses is proposed in this paper this new method is based on the assumption that the motion equations of the offshore platforms between time steps are continuous functions and hence can be transformed into the laplace domain the contributions of this research can be described as follows 1 in the separation of the estimated response components at previous time steps the physical meaning of each component is explained by the fluids theory and the fsi phenomenon 2 the fluid loadings in the fsi environment can be updated at each time step to improve the estimation accuracy of the structure responses three numerical examples will be examined to evaluate the correctness and accuracy of the proposed fsi method which includes a single degree of freedom sdof system subject to an irregular dynamic loading a 4 dof lumped system and an elastic upright cantilever beam in water 2 preliminaries 2 1 laplace transform the laplace transform is mathematically described by the following integral 1 y s 0 y t e s t d t where s is a complex variable and y s is called the laplace transform of y t with a real argument t t 0 the inverse laplace transform is expressed in the form of the complex integral as follows 2 y t 1 2 π i lim t τ i t τ i t e s t y s d s i 1 where τ is a real number and the contour path of integration locates in the region of convergence of y s 2 2 average acceleration method given initial conditions of x 0 and x 0 the governing equation of a sdof linear system subject to an external loading f t was given by clough and penzien 1993 3 m x c x k x f t in which m k and c are the constant values of mass stiffness and damping respectively and x t and x t are the first and second order time derivatives of x t respectively among procedures for performing numerical integration of second order differential equations one of the most common is the average acceleration method the acceleration in the time between t i to t i 1 is taken as the average of the initial and final values of the acceleration that is 4 x τ 1 2 x τ x τ 1 integration of eq 4 twice gives 5 x i 1 x i δ t i 2 x i x i 1 and 6 x i 1 x i x i δ t i δ t i 2 4 x i x i 1 it is straightforward to use the previously computed values x i and x i and the incremental quantities δ f i δ x i and δ x i when coding the integration problems where δ f i f i 1 f i is defined and the similar equations for δ x i and δ x i then eq 6 can be solved for δ x i and eqs 5 and 6 can be combined to give δ x i as follows 7 δ x i 4 δ t i 2 δ x i x i δ t i 2 x i and 8 δ x i 2 δ t i δ x i 2 x i since eq 3 is satisfied at both t i and t i 1 we can form the following incremental equation of motion 9 m δ x i c δ x i k δ x i δ f i then the estimated displacement for time t t i 1 is given by the following 10 x i 1 x i δ x i and the velocity is 11 x i 1 x i δ x i the acceleration at time t i can be obtained from the equation of motion 12 x i m 1 f i c x i k x i 3 fluid structure interaction mechanisms at each time step 3 1 hydrodynamic loading on small scale members the morison formula is a semi theoretical and empirical formulation which determines the wave load on a small scale member it includes two terms inertia force and velocity force 13 f f i f d where f i represents the inertia force and f d is the velocity force thus the formulas can be rewritten as follows 14 f i c m ρ π d 2 4 u and 15 f d c d ρ 2 d u u where c m and c d represent the coefficients of inertia force and velocity force respectively ρ is the water density d is the member diameter u is the velocity of the water particle and u represents the acceleration of the water particle hypothesis is made that u and x are collinear if the small scale member vibrates in the fluid the modified morison equation can be written as 16 f c d ρ 2 d u x u x ρ π d 2 4 u c m 1 ρ π d 2 4 u x 3 2 equations of motion of structures employing a finite element approach the governing equation of an offshore structure can be represented below 17 m x t c x t k x t f t where m c and k are matrices with dimensions of n 1 and n is the number of dofs of the structure one notes that m is a combination of system mass and added mass caused by surrounded fluid 3 3 coupling mechanisms to consider the fluid structure interactions between the structure and external loadings the governing equations for the n dof linear viscous damping system can be derived as 18 m x t c x t k x t f x t u t x t u t u t where f x t u t x t u t u t are the external loadings which are a function of the fluid velocities u t fluid accelerations u t and structural velocities x t at the points where the wave loadings are computed because the fluid structure interaction is a physical phenomenon that appears in the whole dynamic process of offshore structures eq 18 can be written at time t k as 19 m x t k c x t k k x t k f t k where x t k x t k t k k δ t δ t t k 1 t k k 1 2 n k and n k is the number of discrete points of f t k in contrast to the traditional incremental method of solving eq 9 the proposed method attempts to estimate the transferred response at time t k 1 t k δ t i e x t k 1 directly from the known responses x t k x t k and f t k similar to the definition of initial conditions in structural dynamics which are values of evolving variables at some point in time for example t 0 in this paper the displacement x t k and velocity x t k at time t t k are defined by the conditions of eq 19 at time t k accordingly x t k 1 is then regarded as a transferred influence from the previous time results x t k x t k and f t k 4 fluid structure interaction analysis of offshore structures based on separation of transferred responses to realize the academic idea described above we expect to iteratively estimate response x t k 1 caused by previous conditions x t k and x t k and the external loadings however two challenges arise the first is which domain should be used to separate the effects corresponding to the conditions and updated external loadings the second is how to ensure the correctness of the transferred conditions at time t k 1 4 1 starting response estimation under the assumption that the system is subject to initial conditions x t k x 0 and x t k x 0 substituting the first value f t 0 into eq 18 yields 20 x t 1 m 1 f t 1 c x t 1 k x t 1 the responses of a system described by m k and c at time t 1 can easily be obtained by employing eq 20 but the actual difficulty lies in estimating responses for the next times t k where k 2 3 n k 4 2 time lag response estimation transferred from previous conditions to separate effects corresponding to the conditions and the updated external loadings we first define a new time variable t to represent the time duration of t t k t k 1 because t is normally a very small range we assume that responses including x t x t and x t within t k t k 1 are all continuous functions in the following studies if the external loadings are neglected then eq 18 can be written as 21 m x t c x t k x t 0 to apply the laplace transform on eq 21 one obtains 22 m s 2 x s s x t k x t k c s x s x t k k x s 0 rearranging the above equation and replacing x s with x i s yields 23 m s 2 c s k x i s m x t k s m x t k c x t k in which x i s is called the response caused by conditions at previous time t k including displacements x t k and velocities x t k considering that the righthand side of eq 23 has two different orders of variables eq 23 is rewritten as 24 m s 2 c s k x i s s f s f h in which 25 f s m x t k and 26 f h m x t k c x t k where f s and f h are both vectors with a dimension of n 1 accordingly x i s can also be divided into two parts which are denoted x i s s and x i h s respectively and satisfy 27 x i s x i s s x i h s in the following we define x i s s as the contribution of the s term and x i h s as the contribution of the hybrid term by comparing eq 24 to eq 27 one obtains 28 x i s s m s 2 c s k 1 s f s it is noted that in eq 28 no analytical inverse laplace transform of the function s f s exists therefore the response x i s t cannot be obtained directly in use of eq 2 however such response at the qth position kreyszig 1999 can be determined as follows 29 x i q s s d q s d s 1 p 1 n x i q p s s where d s m s 2 c s k and d q s is the determinant obtained from d s s in which the qth column is replaced by the entries s f s one should note that the mass matrix m must be an invertible square matrix thus 30 x i q s s 1 p q d q p s d s 1 in which d q p s is obtained by deleting the pth row and qth column simultaneously the roots of the denominator d s s in eq 30 are only poles denoted as η l s of the system described by m k and c and they can be approximated using the state space form as follows 31 a 0 i m 1 k m 1 c the roots of numerator d q p s are calculated using the modified matrices m q p c q p and k q p which are obtained by deleting the pth row and qth column of m c and k respectively however one should note that there are altogether 2 n 1 zeros τ n s and the first one τ 1 s 0 the reader can find a brief procedure in the appendix referring to hu et al 2016b once the poles η l s and zeros τ n s are obtained eq 30 can be rewritten as 32 x i q p s s κ q p s n 1 2 n 1 s τ n s l 1 2 n 1 s τ l s where κ q p s 1 p q m q p m 1 σ q s here σ q s is the qth element of f s the final purpose of this article is to obtain time domain responses of a coupled system x i q p s t by implementing the inverse laplace transform of x i q p s s therefore eq 32 can be rewritten in the following form 33 x i q p s s i 2 n β i s s η i s where 34 β i s lim s β i s x i q p s s similar to eq 32 one can obtain 35 x i q p h s κ q p h n 1 2 n 1 s τ n h l 1 2 n 1 s η l h l 2 n β l s s η l s where 36 β i h lim s β i h x i q p h s therefore by substituting eqs 33 and 34 into eq 27 one can obtain the following solution of eq 27 37 x i q p s l 2 n β l i s η l i where β l i β l s β l h and η l i η l s η l h applying the inverse laplace transform to the above equation one has 38 x i q p t l 2 n β l i e η l i t but one should note that t in eq 38 is only one time step defined by δ t from eq 38 one can then determine the corresponding velocity x i q p t as 39 x i q p t l 2 n β l i η l i e η l i t iteratively calculating x i q p t and x i q p t for p 1 2 n and q 1 2 n the accelerations can be determined by 40 x i t m 1 c x i t k x i t 4 3 time lag response estimation caused by external loadings in this section we will focus on estimating responses denoted as x f t k 1 at time t k 1 caused by updated external loadings f t rewriting eq 18 in the time duration t t k t k 1 yields 41 m x f t c x f t k x f t f where f represents the external loadings within time t k t k 1 in eq 41 one also should note where f at time t k 1 is a result of recalculating the external loadings by considering the influences of transferred velocities and accelerations at time t k 1 which takes into account the effects on the geometry of the fluid domain and the fluid flow because of the dynamic response or deformation of the structure transforming eq 41 into the laplace domain by assuming conditions at time t k are x t k 0 and x t k 0 one obtains 42 x f s m s 2 c s k 1 f s δ t where f s is a vector that has values of updated external loadings at time t k when a load is imposed on the pth position the system response at the qth position can be written as 43 x q p f s μ s 2 c s k 1 σ f s where σ f s is a real value of f s δ t at the pth position comparing the above equation to eq 34 one can conclude that eq 43 can also be converted to 44 x q p f s κ q p f l 1 2 n 1 s τ l f l 1 2 n s η l f l 2 n β l f s η l f where 45 β l f lim s η l s x q p f s and η l f η l i comparing eq 42 to eq 43 one can conclude that the value of response x q p f s will be very small compared with x i q p f s when a very small time interval δ t is used however when a rough δ t is employed x q p f s can not be neglected 4 4 response estimation of the coupled system based on the above derivations one can find that the response in time duration t is a combination of eq 37 and eq 44 as follows 46 x q p s l 2 n β l f s η l f l 2 n β l i s η l i for simplification eq 46 can be further rewritten as 47 x q p s l 2 n β l s η l where β l β l f β l i and η l η l f η l i therefore the displacement for time t k 1 can be obtained by implementing the inverse laplace transform of eq 47 as follows 48 x q p t k 1 l 2 n β l e η l t from eqs 47 and 48 one can conclude that these two equations constitute a strictly laplace transform pair and thus the estimated results at time t k 1 are exactly the true effects caused by conditions x t k and x t k and the external loadings then the second challenge mentioned previously is solved likewise velocity is estimated by 49 x q p t k 1 l 2 n β l η l e η l t one can also estimate accelerations x t k 1 of the system by referring to eq 12 4 5 scheme of the proposed method the nine step process is given below to describe the proposed methods 1 the matrices k c and m are given as well as the initial conditions x 0 and x 0 2 the force vector f in eq 19 at time t 0 s is then calculated 3 accelerations for the starting point t t 1 0 s are calculated using eq 20 4 the response caused by the s term is estimated poles η l s and τ n s are calculated from eq 31 and κ q p s is obtained from 1 p q m q p m 1 σ q s substituting κ q p s η l s and τ n s into eq 32 residue β l s can be obtained by using eq 34 5 the response caused by the hybrid term is estimated the same procedure used to obtain κ q p s can be used to calculate κ q p h let τ n h be equal to the part of τ n s here n 2 3 2 n 1 and η l s η l h then residue β l h is obtained by using eqs 35 and 36 6 the external loadings are updated external loadings are regenerated in terms of the transferred displacements velocities and or accelerations of the structure at time t 2 δ t 7 the contribution of updated external loadings is estimated let η l s η l f residue β l f is obtained by employing eqs 44 and 45 8 the time domain responses are estimated let t 0 δ t response x q p t k 1 is estimated by employing eq 48 9 steps 4 8 are iteratively implemented and the responses of the system considering the effect of fluid structure interactions are estimated 5 example 1 a sdof system the purpose of this example is to illustrate the procedure and demonstrate its performance by comparing the results of the proposed method with those from analytical or typically used numerical techniques for simplification a sdof system with the mass m 10 kg stiffness k 40 n m and damping c 1 n m is considered these values are used to model a lower damping system to represent practical engineering structures specifically the system has a damping factor ς c 2 k m 0 0250 natural frequency ω n k m 2 rad s and damped frequency ω d ω n 1 ς 2 1 9994 rad s in the following three scenarios will be studied in the first the responses of the proposed method will be compared with analytical solutions caused by only non zero initial conditions to show the performance of the approach for transient response estimation the second will demonstrate the capability of steady state response estimation when the system is subjected to a harmonic loading in addition to comparisons with analytical results the third scenario aims to demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed method which general numerical techniques deal with the convolution integral 5 1 scenario 1 transient response comparison of the proposed method with the analytical solution to validate the proposed method for transient response estimation the analytical result of the system subject to non zero initial conditions x 0 and x 0 will be calculated by 50 x 1 1 t e ς ω n t x 0 cos ω d t x 0 ς ω n x 0 ω d sin ω d t from eq 50 the analytical result free response can easily be obtained when initial conditions x 0 and x 0 are both determined specially x 0 0 05 m and x 0 0 15 m s are randomly employed as discussed in the first step of the scheme of the proposed method the acceleration of the starting point t 0 s can be calculated using eq 20 referring to step 3 it is x 0 0 2150 m s2 we first take the estimation of the responses at time t δ t 0 02 s as an example as discussed in steps 4 and 5 substituting x 0 0 12 and x 0 0 25 into eq 25 and eq 26 reveals that f s 0 5000 and f h 1 5500 employing step 4 yields residues β l s 0 0250 0 0006i and β l h 0 0000 0 0388i before implementing step 8 the poles of the system should be estimated from eq 31 values of 0 0500 1 9994i obtained therefore the time domain responses of the system at t 0 02 s can be calculated by using eq 49 yielding a value of 0 0530 m iteratively implementing steps 4 8 produces estimated responses with a time duration of 20 s as shown in fig 1 which also includes analytical solutions obtained using eq 50 it is noted that the transient responses calculated by the developed method match very well with the analytical ones to further study the performance of the proposed method when a coarser time step is used the second challenge mentioned previously δ t is set to 1 s to calculate the transient responses based on the same considerations used to obtain fig 1 a comparison of the estimated displacements and velocities is shown in fig 2 which also shows good consistence of the estimated responses to quantify the consistence of the two estimated lines in fig 1 the correlation coefficient is calculated by using the matlab code corrcoef resulting in a value of 1 0000 for fig 2 a the reasons that the results match so well are that the estimation of transient responses is not limited to the selected time step which can be demonstrated by referring to eq 38 5 2 scenario 2 steady state response comparison in this section the steady state responses of the system are calculated using the proposed method the system is assumed to vibrate starting from the state of rest i e initial conditions x 0 and x 0 are both zeros to enable a comparison with the analytical solutions a periodic loading is synthesized and imposed on the system via the following 51 f 0 t p 0 cos ω t where p 0 is a constant representing amplitude and ω is the frequency of the loading the total response analytical solution due to excitation f 0 t can be calculated by 52 y a t u 0 1 ρ 2 cos ω t a 1 cos ω n t a 2 sin ω n t in which u 0 p 0 k ρ ω ω n and a 1 and a 2 are constants to be determined by the initial conditions x 0 and x 0 substituting the pre set values of p 0 k x 0 and x 0 one obtains u 0 0 0050 ρ 1 5000 a 2 0 0040 and a 2 2 5915 10 4 respectively the calculated analytical solutions displacement and velocity obtained by implementing eq 52 and its first derivative with the time step δ t 0 02 s used in fig 1 are plotted as blue solid lines in fig 3 in contrast to the process used to obtain fig 1 eq 44 must also be calculated because of the non zero values of σ f s in eq 43 to enable a comparison with the procedure used to obtain fig 1 here we also take the estimation of the responses at time t δ t 0 02 s as an example considering the unchange system mass stiffness and damping the poles will remain at 0 0500 1 9994 i from eqs 34 and 36 the estimated residues β l s β l h 0 at time t 0 02 s due to the zero initial conditions in contrast to zero residues β l s β l h the estimated residue β l f 0 0 1 10 3 i via eq 45 thus the steady state response at time t 0 02 s can be obtained by using eq 48 yielding a value of 0 3995 10 3 m iteratively implementing eq 48 the displacement and velocity of the system subject to the harmonic loading are plotted by the red dashed lines in fig 3 the results demonstrate the correctness of the proposed method for steady state response estimation and the capacity can be further demonstrated by the calculated correlation coefficient between the estimated displacement and the analytical solution which is 0 9994 5 3 scenario 3 total response comparison when the system is subjected to a general excitation the above two scenarios clearly demonstrate the correctness of the proposed method for the estimation of transient and steady state responses in this section a much more complicated case will be discussed to show the capacity of the proposed method for dealing with the issue of fsi to do so the fluid loading f t is synthesized by using the following formula 53 f t k n 1 3 b n cos 2 π f n t k θ k c d x k x k c m x k where the parameters f n b n and θ n in the above equation are listed in table 1 the first term simulates the imposed dynamic loading which ignores the influence of vibrated structures the second and third terms are used to consider the interactions between the external loading and the system for which c d and c m are the coefficients here one should note that the acceleration of the fluid particle is replaced by the structure acceleration x k to consider the influence of the change in fluid particle acceleration specifically we arbitrarily set c d 1 25 and c m 2 50 in this example in fig 4 the time interval δ t is equal to 0 02 s and a time period of 10 s for the simulations is considered the excitation load f t obtained by the proposed method is compared with the one by just considering the velocity and acceleration of fluid particles in the uncoupled analysis it can be seen that an effect would be acted on the external loadings by the consideration of the fluid structure interactions however when a system is subjected to general dynamic loadings the steady state solutions are usually represented by the corresponding convolution terms as a result numerical techniques such as newmark β method is used during the estimation of forced responses in addition to consider the more practical case in engineering that the system may not vibrate initially at rest so x 0 0 05 m and x 0 0 15 m s are used in the first step of the scheme by implementing the proposed method based on the same considerations used to obtain fig 1 we take an estimation of the responses at time t δ t 0 02 s as an example setting δ t 0 02 s ensures the accuracy of the estimated results by using the newmark β method as discussed in steps 4 and 5 substituting x 0 0 05 and x 0 0 15 into eq 25 and eq 26 yields f s 0 5000 and f h 1 5500 in terms of eqs 38 44 and 48 one can obtain the estimated displacement x i 1 1 δ t 0 0533 m x i 1 1 δ t 0 1809 m s and x i 1 1 δ t 1 3665 m s2 iteratively implementing steps 4 8 the responses of the system considering the effect of the fsi can then be estimated table 2 lists the estimated responses at the first five estimated points using the developed approach in terms of the displacement velocity and acceleration in fig 5 the estimated responses with a time duration of 20 s are compared with the results calculated by the newmark β method in which γ 1 2 and β 1 4 are considered it can be observed that the results obtained by the proposed method are in good agreement with the one by the newmark β method 5 4 advantages of the proposed method another remaining question is the advantage of the proposed method compared with typically used step by step procedures such as the newmark β method numerical methods are occasionally significantly influenced by the time interval δ t used and the selection of the time interval is often affected by three factors 1 the rate of change of the load 2 the complexity of the nonlinear damping and stiffness properties and 3 the period of vibration the time interval must be sufficiently short so that all of these factors are reliably represented thus a rough time interval δ t 0 4 s is adopted to estimate the system responses because it is difficult to conclude which method is better if only possible discrepancies of the estimated results obtained by implementing the approach and the newmark β method are considered the time responses of the dynamic system to arbitrary loading are also calculated as a reference by employing the matlab function lsim gupta 2014 the code is based on the state space model and a precondition of using this code is that the input signal should be undersampled specifically a time interval smaller than 0 5 s is required when using lsim in this example which is also why the time interval δ t 0 4 s is used above following the same procedure used to obtain fig 5 comparisons of the system responses by the proposed method newmark β method and matlab function lsim are given in fig 6 the results by using the matlab function lsim are denoted as state space in the legend of fig 6 because it is based on the theory of conversion from a physical model to a state space model as shown in fig 6 the responses obtained using the newmark β method are significantly smaller than those obtained using the matlab function lsim sindicating that the proposed method outperforms the typically used newmark β when a rough time interval is used 6 example 2 a 4 dof system in this example a 4 dof lumped system is tested to demonstrate the ability of the propose method in solving a problem of a mdof system the mass stiffness and damping matrices of the system are given as follows 54 m 1200 0 0 0 0 850 0 0 0 0 4125 0 0 0 0 125000 55 k 1 10 8 0 3100 0 0100 0 0 0 0100 0 0700 0 0600 0 5118 0 0 0600 0 1200 0 0 0 5118 0 8 7313 56 c 6000 6000 0 0 6000 24000 18000 153500 0 18000 36000 0 0 153500 0 2619400 four frequencies in an eigen analysis are obtained 3 1350 10 7067 18 2791 and 25 5659 hz for simplification each applied external loading imposed on each dof of the system is also simulated by 57 f t δ 1 u x u x δ 2 u δ 3 u x where u 0 25 cos 0 0806 1 2566t and u 0 3341 sin 0 0806 1 2566t are used to simulate the velocity and acceleration of water particles δ 1 δ 2 and δ 3 are the coefficients of the three terms specifically δ 1 8 5 δ 2 5 5 and δ 3 2 55 respectively setting δ t 0 0001 s the simulated loading can be obtained as shown in fig 7 with a time duration of 10 s the setting of δ t 0 0001s is not arbitrary but a careful choice based on multiple trials with different δ t values to ensure that newmark β method can provide sufficiently accurate results in the simulations 6 1 response estimation when the system is not initially at rest in this example matlab code rand is applied to randomly generate the non zero initial conditions the obtained initial displacement vector is x 0 0 9528 0 7041 0 9539 0 5982 10 5 and the velocity vector is x 0 0 8407 0 4428 0 8368 0 5187 10 5 the generated values are all multiplied by 10 5 to ensure that the resultant responses are compatible with those obtained with the external loadings during the process of step 4 it should be noted that the pth row and qth column of matrices m c and k must be simultaneously deleted for the estimation of η l s and τ n s using eq 31 for example when p 1 and q 2 the estimated τ n s are 0 6 109 1666 67 1 0478 83 5700i and 0 4364 53 9342i and the poles η l s are 0 29 160 92i 2 05 114 68i 0 7 67 26i and 0 11 19 69i via eqs 32 and 34 residues β l s 106 are 0 3490 0 0461i 0 2507 0 0304i 0 0292 0 0016i and 0 0692 0 0011i respectively based on the same procedure used to obtain fig 5 the responses of the second dof can be obtained as shown in fig 8 which reveals remarkably good consistency of the responses by the proposed and newmark β methods 6 2 investigation of the accuracy of the proposed method as with any numerical integration method the accuracy of the newmark β method depends on the length of the time increment δ t consequently errors of the estimated responses will be produced when the rough time interval δ t is used in contrast to this step by step procedure the proposed method employs laplace transform pairs based on the estimated poles and residues corresponding to transferred conditions and updated loadings in other words the response estimation between each time step is a continuous transformation and not a numerical approximation therefore one may predict that the proposed method will provide a better accuracy of response estimation to enable the comparison of results between the proposed and newmark β methods δ t 0 001s is assigned in fig 8 when δ t 0 0001 s and δ t 0 001 s are applied the responses obtained by newmark β method are shown in fig 9 the results reveal that δ t 0 0001 s is sufficiently accurate for newmark β method to estimate the system responses therefore the results by newmark β method with δ t 0 0001 s are used as a criterion in the following studies in order to investigate the performance of the proposed method a comparison of the estimated displacements with the time t 0 2 is given in fig 10 it is noted that there exists obvious discrepancies between the displacement predicted by the newmark β method with δ t 0 01 s and the other two curves whereas the proposed method provides better results even when the rough time interval is used meanwhile a standard deviation comparison between the newmark β and the proposed methods with the increment δ t 0 01s is drawn in fig 11 it can be seen that the convergence of the proposed method is much better than that of the newmark β method which means the proposed method has a great advantage to obtain the response within a rough time interval 6 3 computational performance of the proposed method in addition to the accuracy of response estimation computational performance is an important concern for a coupled dynamic analysis method in the following we will focus on the computational performance of the proposed method as discussed in fig 9 when δ t 0 0001 s both newmark β and the proposed methods can provide accurate estimations of the responses even considering the fluid structure interaction therefore we will retain δ t 0 0001 s but the time duration of the response estimation changes from 1 to 10 s the recorded cpu times for both methods are shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 the newmark β method requires less cpu time for the same number of iterations e g the newmark β method requires only 80 05 s for 40000 iterations whereas the proposed method requires 577 51 s thus the newmark β method greatly outperforms the proposed method in computational efficiency in the proposed method the residues corresponding to the transferred conditions are required and updated loadings must be estimated iteratively which takes the majority of the cpu time as a greatly refined time interval is not required for the proposed method as shown in fig 10 the time consuming process of residue estimation can be overcome by using a rough time interval for example rather than maintaining a constant time duration fig 12 the consumed cpu time is recorded when different δ t values are used for the 1 s response estimation as listed in table 3 the proposed method only requires 1 3040 s to reach nearly the same accuracy with δ t 0 01 s whereas the newmark β method requires δ t 0 0001 s to ensure the accuracy of the response estimation and takes 28 4283 s 7 example 3 an elastic cylinder in water an elastic upright cantilever beam in water water depth 10 m shown in fig 13 is utilized to evaluate the accuracy of the developed method the system is modelled with uniform beam elements for each node of beam elements two translational and one rotational dofs are assumed the beam has a length of 12 m and its circular section is 1 25 m in diameter and 22 mm in thickness young s modulus is 2 1 1011 pa and the mass density is 7850 kg m3 the cross sectional moment of inertia is 1 6004 10 2 m4 based on the research craig 1981 the element stiffness matrix k n and mass matrix m n can be easily obtained the global damping matrix has the form c n 1 3 γ n c n where c n has a scaled form of k n and is assumed to be c n 10 5 k n applying airy s linear wave theory wu et al 2019 water particle kinematics can be evaluated the assumption is that a wave height h is small as compared with its wave length l and depth d for simplification a regular wave will be taken into account specifically the wave height is 0 6 m and the wave period is 10 s according to morison s equation the intensity of the wave force per unit length is given as follows 58 f h t 0 5 ρ ω c d d u x u x 0 25 π d 2 ρ ω c m u 0 25 π d 2 c m 1 ρ ω x the last term in the equation is the added mass fig 14 presents the calculated velocity and acceleration of water particles at elevations of 1 and 0 m as shown in fig 13 harmonic wave loadings will be generated and thus the traditional fourier transform can be used to convert the wave loadings to the frequency domain in addition based on the fact that s i ω s where ω s is the frequency of the structure eq 47 can also be transformed from the laplace domain to the frequency domain therefore frequency domain responses can be estimated even if non zero initial conditions exist liu et al 2016b 2016a 2019 in this example we assume the cylinder is initially at rest following the procedure used to obtain fig 5 the dynamic responses of the cylinder subjected to wave forces can be obtained by eq 58 where c d 1 0 and c m 1 2 fig 15 presents a comparison of the coupled and uncoupled loadings which exhibit significant discrepancy because of the introduced velocities and accelerations of the cylinder the estimated responses at the top of the cylinder in the translational direction are shown in fig 16 a c where the time interval δ t 1 10 4 s is used as shown in fig 16 there is a good agreement for the estimated displacements but not for the velocities and accelerations the reason is as shown in fig 10 the newmark β method is often affected by the time interval used which can be further demonstrated by recalculating the responses with δ t 1 10 5 s as shown in fig 17 the zoomed part t 0 0 02 s in general the proposed method can provide dynamic responses with a high level of accuracy when considering the fluid structure interaction and researchers can also easily combine their works by replacing eq 5 because the proposed method is a partitioned fsi technique 8 conclusions a new fsi method for offshore structures is proposed in this paper which divides the laplace domain responses of the structure into three different parts i e the contributions of the s term the hybrid term and original external loadings respectively the keys to the success of the approach are 1 the conversion of these three different contributions to a form of complex exponentials in the laplace domain will facilitate their transformation to the time domain using the inverse laplace transform and 2 the fact that the three parts share the same poles the most important observations are that the analytical laplace domain responses of the structure is not restrained from the simple inputs and the impacts of vibrational structures on the surrounding fluids can be considered at each time step as well from the three numerical examples used the following three conclusions can be drawn 1 the responses caused by the transferred conditions and updated loadings can be separated successfully and their combination is simply the targeted response of the system 2 compared with the traditional fsi method which often solves equations of motion of the structure by numerical schemes such as the newmark β method the proposed approach provides more accurate estimations of responses even when a rough time interval is used because of the existence of laplace transform pairs of the three separated contributions 3 during the recalculation of the wave loadings at each time step more suitable wave theories can be employed to provide a more accurate estimation of the wave loadings in general the proposed method can provide highly precise and accurate response estimations for 2 or 3 dimensional fixed structures at each time step only if the motion equations can be represented by eq 17 accordingly wave loadings can also be estimated more reasonably which implies a better representation of the physical fsi phenomenon for offshore structures at this stage the proposed method cannot be used for floating structures because the motion equations of a floating structure normally include a convolution term to consider the radiation forces caused by these structures due to the advantage of the proposed method which is not as strictly limited with respect to the time interval as the widely used newmark β and wilson θ method the issue of unstable behavior of traditional partitioned methods can be expected to improve to accomplish this improvement our future work will first focus on the study of transfer functions of floating structures and then extend the proposed method to deal with floating structures declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared

22279,passenger evacuation under ship fires is very complex and largely uncertain for ship design conducting an uncertainty analysis of passenger travel time requires a large number of evacuation simulations which is very time consuming this work proposed a new method to quantify the uncertainty of passenger travel time based on a surrogate model which is constructed by the polynomial chaos expansion with the nested sampling technique to illustrate the application of the proposed method a case of a 3 storey passenger ship with different functional zones is presented the results demonstrated that the proposed method can be employed to quantify passenger travel time uncertainty with the acceptable accuracy specifically travel time approximately follows the normal distribution under uniform distributions of input parameters safety factor of travel time cannot be regarded as a deterministic value while it is significantly affected by its safety level the parametric sensitivity analysis results suggested that for restaurant and retail zone the initial passenger density plays a leading role in the safety evacuation compared with other zones while it is ignorable for bar zone and general area this surrogate based uncertainty analysis method of travel time can provide a tool to facilitate passenger evacuation design under ship fires keywords ship fires evacuation time travel time safety factor polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model 1 introduction large passenger ships especially for luxury cruise ships carry a large number of passengers according to statistics fire has been regarded as one of the most common disasters for passenger ships konovessis and vassalos 2008 baalisampang et al 2018 once fire occurs it is mandatory to evacuate all passengers aboard to assembly stations as soon as possible the time from the start of movement to all passengers reaching the assembly stations is defined as passenger travel time imo 2016 which occupies a large proportion of passenger evacuation time for large passenger ship and luxury cruise ships there are so many different functional zones such as passenger cabins wine bars shopping malls restaurants and so on there are some rules on the safety designs of these functional zones specified in the international code for fire safety systems fss code imo 2001 however the initial locations of passengers are highly random due to the sudden fires and the randomness of human behaviors which make the initial passenger density in different functional zones significantly uncertain in order to carry out a cost effective fire protection design of ships the uncertainty of travel time should be quantified with considering the uncertainties of the initial passenger density in different functional zones the study on passenger evacuation time under ships has been widely carried out by many scholars the latest guideline on evacuation analysis msc 1 circ 1533 imo 2016 provided a simplified and an advanced evacuation analysis methods in this simplified evacuation analysis passengers are considered as fluid flow and its advantage is fast in computational speed and used easily cho et al 2016 however the fluid flow cannot present fully the passenger movement characteristics under ships to address this problem as an alternative the advanced evacuation analysis is proposed based on microscopic or mesoscopic evacuation models which can consider the human behavior and its characteristics such as maritime exodus gwynne et al 2003 aeneas meyer könig et al 2007 odigo pradillon 2004 evi vassalos et al 2002b and imex park et al 2004 to characterize the human behavior galea and deere et al galea et al 2011 2014a 2014b deere et al 2012 conducted a series of fullscale passenger evacuation experiments in three different types of passenger ships by means of the data collection systems and the starting location end location response time and travel time of passengers were collected deere et al 2006 suggested the distribution of passenger response time has a more significant effect on evacuation time whose uncertainty cannot be omitted sarshar et al 2013 adopted a bayesian network model to analyze evacuation time under ship fires which lacked a quantitative analysis besides ping et al 2018a combined the bayesian method and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process ahp method to calculate the probability level of successful escape evacuation and rescue on the offshore platform to deal with uncertainties associated with passenger evacuation with the acceptable computational cost there are 4 typical evacuation scenarios are considered in the latest evacuation analysis guideline msc 1 circ 1533 and the safety factor of 1 25 is recommended to address the uncertainty of passenger evacuation analysis while it has not been validated yet what s more ping et al 2018b attempted to adopt a safety factor of 1 25 to deal with the uncertainties associated with evacuation time of crews on an offshore platform monte carlo simulation as a conventional uncertainty quantification method is widely applied in evacuation analysis and ship fires in the past decades vassalos et al 2002a combined computationally inexpensive mesoscopic evacuation model and monte carlo simulation to develop the ship passenger evacuation simulation tool evi to quantify evacuation time uncertainty resulting from random human behavior wu et al 2018 adopted the monte carlo simulation method to develop a probabilistic model of fatality estimation under ship fires to reduce the computational burden grandison et al 2017 proposed a convergence test method for the confidence interval of evacuation time to determine the number of repeated simulations for an evacuation scenario coupled with the monte carlo sampling wang et al 2013 proposed the available safety egress time uncertainty calculation model under ship fires with considering the uncertainty of fire scenario salem 2016 adopted the monte carlo simulation and the two zone fire model cfast to quantify uncertainties in fire consequence calculation since large passenger ships or cruise ships carry a great number of passengers it is time consuming to use the complex computer evacuation model to perform one evacuation simulation however the uncertainty analysis method of coupling evacuation model and monte carlo sampling required a great number of samples due to its slower convergent rate matala 2008 to reduce the number of evaluation samples for uncertainty analysis polynomial chaos expansion proposed by wiener 1938 has been successfully applied to uncertainty analysis of occupant evacuation time under building fires xie et al 2013 2016 as mentioned above it can be easily seen that evacuation time of passengers under ship fires should be studied with consideration of uncertain evacuation scenarios however the relevant study is few and there are some limitations in safety factor and monte carlo simulation for the treatment of uncertainties in passenger evacuation travel time is an important part of evacuation time and the purpose of our work is to quantify the uncertainty of travel time caused by the initial passenger density in different zones of passenger ships with the minimum computational cost in this paper a method coupling the polynomial chaos expansion with nested sparse sampling technique is proposed to establish the surrogate model of passenger travel time afterwards the uncertainty and parametric sensitivity of travel time are also addressed there are 4 sections organized in this paper section 2 presents the uncertainty and parametric sensitivity analysis method of passenger travel time under ship fires based on polynomial chaos expansion with the nested sparse sampling method section 3 carries out a case study for a real passenger ship using the proposed method in section 2 the distribution of travel time is obtained and the functional zones significantly affecting passenger travel time are also identified finally some conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 methodology non intrusive polynomial chaos expansion methods have been widely adopted by many researchers hadigol and doostan 2017 the gauss quadrature is a popular sampling strategy for the non intrusive polynomial chaos expansion techniques ng gauss quadrature points can achieve the algebraic accuracy of degree of 2ng 1 for a univariate numerical integration however the number of optimum samples increases significantly with the number of dimensions n which is called as the curse of dimensionality in order to solve this problem a sparse grid quadrature rule proposed by smolyak 1963 is introduced to determine the optimum sample points for multidimensional variables however it is difficult to give the appropriate degree for polynomial chaos expansion of the output which may result in wasting samples due to the unnestedness of gauss quadrature points in order to solve this problem the nested sampling method based on the kronrod patterson rule kronrod 1965 patterson 1968 is employed to determine one dimensional nested samples and then the smolyak rule is applied to obtain the multidimensional nested samples by means of the sparse combination of multiple one dimensional samples afterwards the polynomial chaos expansion of travel time can be constructed with the orthogonal polynomial basis and then the uncertainty and parametric sensitivity of travel time can be achieved with the inexpensive computational cost based on the monte carlo simulation of polynomial chaos expansion of travel time based on the nested sparse sampling technique the flowchart for uncertainty and parametric sensitivity analysis of travel time under passenger ship fires is presented in fig 1 2 1 uncertainty characterization of input parameters due to the randomness of initial locations of passengers the population density in different functional zones are considered as stochastic for large passenger ships and cruise ships according to the international fss code imo 2001 the maximum capacity of passengers is designed to be 0 5 persons m2 for public places and the number of seats for seating zone moreover the population density is generally assumed to be smaller than 1 9 persons m2 for engineering design nelson 2007 thus we assume that the initial population density in different functional zones of passenger ships denoted as x 1 x 2 x n follows uniform distributions in a range of 0 2 0 persons m2 for public places except for seating zones as shown in fig 2 for convenience of calculation the distribution of the initial passenger density for public places except for seating zones is normalized using the following linear transformation 1 ξ i 3 x i 1 i 1 2 n for the seating zone in passenger ships the number of initial passengers is regarded to follow the uniform distribution in a range from 0 to the corresponding number of seats the initial passenger density can be calculated by the number of passengers divided by the net area of seating zone then the initial passenger density in the seating zone is normalized with the mean 0 and standard deviation 1 2 2 polynomial chaos expansion of travel time the passenger travel time under ship fires can be obtained by performing computer evacuation simulation tool such as pathfinder thunderhead engineering 2017 which is an agent based continuous evacuation model thornton et al 2011 travel time y influenced by n independent initial passenger density parameters x 1 x 2 x n can be expressed as follows 2 y f x ξ x x 1 x 2 x n where ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n is the set of the normalized initial density parameters of x x 1 x 2 x n based on the polynomial chaos theory polynomial chaos representation of y can be given by wiener 1938 3 y i 0 α i φ i ξ ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n where α i are the polynomial chaos expansion coefficients φ i ξ are multidimensional orthonormal polynomial basis on ξ in order to calculate travel time the series expansion of y in equation 3 should be truncated to a certain degree d which can be written as 4 y i 0 p 1 α i φ i ξ p n d n d according to equation 4 it can be seen that α i and φ i need to be solved to estimate y due to the independence of input parameters the multivariate orthonormal polynomial can be computed as the product of univariate orthonormal polynomials thus in order to determine φ i the univariate orthonormal polynomial basis should be constructed according to the orthogonality of the polynomial basis oladyshkin and nowak 2012 proposed a method for constructing the univariate orthogonal polynomial basis with arbitrary distribution the coefficients β 0 j β 1 j β j 1 j β j j for the univariate orthogonal polynomial of degree j on the random variable ξ i denoted by φ j ξ i can be calculated by oladyshkin and nowak 2012 5 μ 0 μ 1 μ j μ 1 μ 2 μ j 1 μ j 1 μ j μ 2 j 1 0 0 1 β 0 j β 1 j β j 1 j β j j 0 0 0 1 μ j ω ξ i j p ξ i d ξ i where u k

function of variable ξ i due to the more useful properties of orthonormal polynomial basis φ j ξ i is normalized by sudret 2008 6 ψ j ξ i 1 φ j φ j ξ i φ j 2 φ j ξ i 2 p ξ i d ξ i the next step is to calculate the polynomial chaos expansion coefficients α i which can be computed by intrusive and non intrusive methods herzog et al 2008 for the intrusive methods the original computer codes for the output solver are required to be modified which is difficult to conduct due to the closed source softwares the non intrusive methods consider the output as a black box model thus the original codes of commercial softwares are not required to be modified in non intrusive methods to solve the polynomial chaos expansion coefficients the regression and projection methods are widely used in the non intrusive methods the fundamental theory of the regression method is a least square method and the projection method can utilize the property of orthonormal polynomial basis thus the projection method of the non intrusive methods is adopted to calculate α i in this paper in the projection method the left and right terms of equation 4 are both multiplied by φ j ξ and integrated over p ξ and the following expression can be generated sudret 2008 7 y φ j ξ p ξ d ξ φ j ξ i 0 p 1 α i φ i ξ p ξ d ξ there is a more useful property for orthonormal polynomial basis φ ξ which can be described by oladyshkin and nowak 2012 8 φ i ξ φ j ξ ρ ξ d ξ 1 j i 0 j i combining equation 7 with 8 α i can be derived as follows sudret 2008 9 α i y φ i ξ p ξ d ξ 2 3 nested sampling method based on gauss kronrod patterson rule to estimate the equation 9 the most straightforward method is the monte carlo simulation however this approach requires a great number of samples to achieve a more accurate estimation matala 2008 in order to reduce the number of evaluation samples gauss kronrod patterson quadrature rule is adopted to estimate α i in equation 9 according to gauss quadrature scheme the optimum quadrature points are the roots of the orthogonal polynomial of a certain degree d abramowitz and stegun 1970 the corresponding weights of gauss quadrature points can be calculated according to the gauss quadrature rule golub and welsch 1969 due to the unnestedness of guassian quadrature points the nested sampling method based on the kronrod patterson rule is used in this paper for n gauss quadrature points of univariate quadrature n 1 optimum quadrature points are added with the algebraic accuracy level of integrand at least 3n 1 according to the kronrod rule kronrod 1965 patterson 1968 further developed the kronrod univariate quadrature rule by adding p quadrature points which makes the algebraic accuracy level of integrand be n 2p 1 besides a delayed increase method for determining optimum quadrature points was proposed by petras 2003 for uniformly distributed stochastic variable the steps for univariate quadrature points and weights of based on gauss kronrod patterson quadrature rule are given as follows step 1 for extension sequence s 0 the n s initial quadrature points are calculated by gauss quadrature scheme and the number of initial quadrature points is n s 1 step 2 for extension sequence s s 1 the n s 1 optimum quadrature points can be added according to kronrod patterson rule and the number of optimum quadrature points is n s 2 s 1 1 step 3 the weights of the optimum quadrature points for extension sequence s s 1 can also be calculated according to the kronrod patterson rule step 4 repeat the steps 2 and 3 to obtain the optimum samples and weights for the desired extension sequence s according to the steps above we determine the number of sample points n s 1 3 7 15 for uniformly distributed parameters the sample points and corresponding weights can also be obtained at http www sparse grids de based on gauss kronrod patterson rule the flowchart for the determination of optimum quadrature points of the univariate quadrature is shown in fig 3 2 4 sparse grid sampling for multivariate quadrature the quadrature points and weights from gauss kronrod patterson rule can be used to deal with the one dimension quadrature for multidimensional quadrature the number of quadrature points is the product of the number of each dimensional quadrature points i e full tensor product which will be great for high dimensional quadrature in order to reduce the number of quadrature points with the higher computational efficiency the sparse grid quadrature is proposed by smolyak in 1963 smolyak 1963 for the smolyak quadrature rule at the accuracy level l the optimum quadrature points for n dimensional quadrature are required to comply with the following conditions ahlfeld et al 2016 10 ξ p s l l 1 m l n ξ 1 m 1 ξ 2 m 2 ξ n

smolyak algorithm at the accuracy level l the weight for the d n th quadrature point on n dimensional quadrature can be calculated as heiss and winschel 2008 11 w d n l 1 n m n 1 l n m w 1 i 1 w 2 i 2 w n i n d n 1 2 p s i 1 1 2 m 1 i n 1 1 2 m n 1 i n 1 2 m n where w d n l is the weight of the d n th sample for n dimensional quadrature at the accuracy level l w 1 i 1 w 2 i 2 w n i n are respectively the weights of the i 1 th i 2 th i n th sample of ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n 1 ξ n thus α i in equation 9 can be calculated as follows sudret 2008 12 α i d n 1 p s y ξ d n φ i ξ d n w d n l where ξ d n is the d n th quadrature point for n dimensional quadrature y ξ d n is the average travel time for one evacuation scenario with ξ d n which is repeated simulations 10 times by the stochastic computer evacuation model pathfinder in this paper thunderhead engineering 2017 2 5 the estimation for uncertainty and parametric sensitivity of travel time in order to evaluate the uncertainty of y resulting from the initial passenger density its mean e y and standard deviation std y should be obtained the mean of y can be calculated by 13 e y y x ξ p x ξ d ξ based on equation 4 equation 13 can be rewritten as 14 e y i 0 p 1 α i φ i ξ p x ξ d ξ due to the orthonormal property of φ i ξ i 0 p 1 e y is the coefficient of constant term of polynomial chaos expansion of y which is given by sudret 2008 15 e y a 0 based on the definition of the standard deviation the standard deviation of y can be calculated as 16 std y i 0 p 1 α i φ i ξ a 0 2 p x ξ d ξ combined with the orthonormal properties of φ i std y can calculated by 17 std y i 1 p 1 α i 2 the probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf of y can be analyzed statistically by the results from the monte carlo simulation of the polynomial chaos expansion of y whose computational cost can be ignored moreover the sensitivity of y with the uncertain the initial passenger density parameters in different functional zones of ships can also be analytically calculated according to sobol s decomposition sobol 1993 polynomial chaos expansion of y in equation 4 can be rewritten as 18 y α 0 i 1 n α i φ i ξ i

2 α 123 n 2 std y 2 i 1 2 n where st i is the total sensitivity index of x i 3 case study and analysis 3 1 case description in order to illustrate the proposed method evacuation analysis of a real 3 story passenger ship with 10 stairs is used as a case galea et al 2012 whose floor plan is presented in fig 4 there are 6 different functional zones in this passenger ship including bar general area retail seating restaurant and locker zone bars are located on decks 1 and 2 general area is located on decks 1 and 2 retail is located on deck 1 seating zone is located on decks 2 and 3 restaurant is located on deck 2 and locker zone is located on deck 1 connected to assembly station c there are 4 assembly stations the assembly stations a b and c are located on deck 1 and assembly station d is located on deck 2 there are 10 stairs in this passenger ship 1m wide stair 1 and 1m wide stair 5 2 7m wide stair 2 and 2 7m wide stair 6 2 7m wide stair 3 and 2 7m wide stair 7 2 7m wide stair 4 and 2 7m wide stair 8 2 7m wide stair 6 and 2 7m wide stair 9 2 7m wide stair 7 and 1 2m wide stair 10 are respectively connected the passengers are distributed randomly in different functional zones and the demographic distribution of the population is consistent with the specification of the imo guidelines imo 2016 due to the randomness and complexity of human behavior the initial passenger density in the different zones is uncertain according to the description in section 2 1 the initial passenger density in each functional zone follows the uniform distribution as shown in table 1 the fire is assumed to occur in retail zone on deck 1 and the entrance to the assembly station a is available for passenger evacuation the travel time is the time from the start of passenger movement to all the passengers reaching assembly stations and its samples are simulated by the computer evacuation model pathfinder with the passenger response time of 0 s in this paper 3 2 calculated results the orthogonal polynomial basis can be obtained based on equation 5 which can be normalized by equation 6 based on the smolyak algorithm 51 input and output samples are required for the gauss kronrod patterson quadrature rule at the accuracy level 3 with 5 stochastic variables which can estimate accurately α i for polynomial chaos expansion of the degree less than 3 the input samples and corresponding weights can be calculated by combining the gauss kronrod patterson rule in section 2 3 and smolyak algorithm in section 2 4 the output samples of travel time can be obtained by performing the computer evacuation simulation tool pathfinder with specified samples of the initial passenger density once the input and output samples as well as corresponding weights are obtained at the accuracy level 3 α i in equation 12 for the 1st degree and 2nd degree expansion of passenger travel time under ship fires can be obtained accurately in order to test the convergence of the 2nd degree expansion of y the monte carlo simulation for the 1st and 2nd degree expansion of y are performed with 1000 latin hypercube sampling lhs samples of x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 and the corresponding 1000 samples of y can be obtained then the relative error of 1000 samples of y between the 1st and 2nd expansions can be used to measure their difference and the pdf histogram and cdf curve of their relative error are shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be seen that the relative error of y is larger than the acceptable range 0 15 0 15 in general engineering application cuesta et al 2016 thus in order to obtain a more accurate estimation the 3rd degree expansion of y should be constructed to construct the 3rd degree expansion of y another 100 input samples are required according to the gauss kronrod patterson quadrature rule with smolyak algorithm at the accuracy level 4 thus 151 input and output samples as well as the corresponding weights are required which can estimate accurately α i for polynomial chaos expansion of the degree smaller than 4 the pdf histogram and cdf curve of the relative error of y between the 2nd and 3rd degree expansion at the accuracy level 4 are obtained as shown in fig 6 from fig 6 it can be seen that the relative error of y between the 2nd and 3rd degree expansion is distributed in the acceptable range 0 15 0 15 with a 95 2 probability level thus the 3rd degree expansion can be regarded as convergent in this case which can be used as the surrogate model of y the 3rd degree polynomial chaos expansion requires 151 samples smaller than 45 for the full tensor product technique according to the analysis above the number of evaluations for smolyak method and full tensor product are listed in table 2 from table 2 it can be seen that the smolyak method can significantly reduce the number of evaluation samples whose computational efficiency increases by 85 3 compared with the full tensor product furthermore in order to compare the 3rd degree expansion of y and pathfinder the 3rd degree expansion of y and pathfinder are implemented with 50 lhs input samples of the initial passenger density in 5 different functional zones based on 50 lhs travel time samples the pdf histogram and cdf curve of the relative error of y between the 3rd degree polynomial chaos expansion and pathfinder are shown in fig 7 from fig 7 it can be seen that the probability level of the relative error of travel time in this acceptable range 0 15 0 15 is 86 for the 3rd degree polynomial chaos expansion which is regarded as acceptable in this case thus the convergent 3rd degree expansion of y can be used as the surrogate model of travel time which requires 151 samples based on the results from the monte carlo simulation of the 3rd degree polynomial chaos expansion of y with 1000 lhs samples the pdf and cdf of travel time are presented in fig 8 from fig 8 it can be seen that the mean and standard deviation of travel time are 351 2 s and 102 5 s respectively and the range of travel time is 138 6 497 7 s with the 95 confidence interval according to ang and cornell 1974 the safety level of travel time can be represented by its cumulative distribution function in this paper thus the travel time at any safety level and the safety level for a certain travel time can be determined from fig 8 b which is useful to improve the evacuation safety design of passenger ships for example as the acceptable safety level is 97 5 the value of travel time should be taken as 497 7 s if travel time is 138 6 s its safety level is 2 5 moreover a normal distribution is adopted to fit passenger travel time which suggests that travel time follows approximately the normal distribution in this case as shown in fig 8 a furthermore safety factor is taken as 1 25 in msc 1 circ 1533 by considering model omissions assumptions and the limited benchmark evacuation scenarios imo 2016 similar to the safety factor in msc 1 circ 1533 safety factor of travel time in this paper can be calculated by the ratio of travel time at a certain safety level to the base travel time notarianni and parry 2016 herein the base travel time is calculated under the conditions of the initial passenger density of 0 5 persons m2 in the public zones and the number of passengers in seating zones equal to the number of seats fig 9 presents the safety factor at different safety levels based on the monte carlo simulation results from the surrogate model of travel time which is used to deal with the uncertainties of the initial passenger density in different functional zones in this case from fig 9 it can be seen that the safety factor of travel time increases with its safety level as for the safety level of 95 the safety factor of travel time is 2 15 when the safety factor is 1 25 the corresponding safety level of travel time is 27 3 thus in ship fire protection design the safety factor should be determined prudently at a certain acceptable safety level from equation 19 it can be seen that the main sensitivity index s i can be used to measure the contribution of the uncertainty of x i to the output uncertainty without the mutual effects of other parameters the total sensitivity index st i can be used to measure the total contribution of the uncertainty of x i on the output uncertainty including the mutual interaction of other parameters according to equation 20 in order to study the effect of the uncertainty of the initial passenger density on travel time in different functional zones s i and st i can be obtained analytically based on the 3rd polynomial chaos expansion of y and the parametric sensitivity results of travel time are shown in fig 10 according to the main sensitivity index s i the rank of the importance of the initial passenger density in different zones is x 5 x 2 x 1 x 3 x 4 which shows that uncertainties of x 5 in restaurant zone and x 2 in retail zone have more significant effects on passenger travel time without considering the effects of the initial passenger density in the other zones fig 10 indicates that the uncertainties of x 1 in bar zone x 3 in seating zone and x 4 in general area have less effects on passenger travel time without considering the effects of the initial passenger density in other zones moreover according to the total sensitivity index st i it can be found that the rank of the importance of the initial passenger density in different functional zones is x 5 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 4 from fig 10 which suggests that the uncertainties of x 5 in restaurant zone and x 2 in retail zone have more significant effects on passenger evacuation with considering the effects of the initial passenger density in other zones and x 3 in seating zone has a less significant effect on passenger travel time in ships in addition the uncertainties of x 1 in bar zone and x 4 in general area can be ignored which displays that there is no significant crowd congestion for bar zone and general area 3 3 discussion generally travel time increases monotonically with the increase of the initial passenger density however it can be found the travel times in this case follow roughly the normal distribution when the initial passenger density are distributed uniformly in different functional zones the reason is that there are mutual interactions between the passengers in different functional zones for example some passengers in seating zone and general area on deck 2 may evacuation to assembly d by the same entrance through the sensitivity analysis results it can be seen that x 5 in restaurant zone and x 2 in retail zone should be determined prudently in evacuation design for ship fires this can be explained that the net area of restaurant zone and retail zones are respectively 580 767 m2 and 574 622 m2 which are larger with 0 1162 passengers and 0 1149 passengers the entrance width of assembly stations a and d for the passengers in retail and restaurant are both 2 65 m the worst case of the entrance width to assembly stations for every 100 persons in restaurant and retail zone are both approximately 0 23 m which is much smaller than 1 0 m specified in international fss code imo 2001 thus it can be found that the smaller entrance width to assembly stations a and d can lead to crowd congestion in retail and restaurant zones additionally it can be seen that the mutual interaction of x 3 in seating zone with those of other functional zones cannot be ignored by the comparison of the main and total sensitivity index in fig 10 some passengers in seating zone and general area on deck 2 merge together with the aim of evacuating to assembly station d moreover some passengers in seating zone on deck 3 may evacuate through stair 9 stair 6 and stair 2 to get to deck 1 and then enter the assembly b or c which makes the travel distance of passengers in seating zone on deck 3 longer thus it can be seen that the uncertainty of x 3 in seating zone has a certain contribution to the uncertainty of travel time with considering the effects of the passengers in other functional zones furthermore the uncertainties of x 1 in bar zone and x 4 in general area can be ignored the net total area of bar zone and general area are respectively 300 6360 m2 and 152 5746 m2 which are not larger the travel distance of passengers in bar zone and general area to the entrance of assembly stations are shorter with large entrance width the general area on deck 1 is also connected to the assembly station a and b with the 8 62 m entrance width and the general area on deck 2 is directly connected to the assembly station d with a 2 65 m entrance width besides the general area on deck 2 and on deck 1 is connected by stair 6 and stair 2 with a 2 7 m width it can be seen that the entrance width of the assembly stations for general area is wide enough besides bar zones are directly connected to the general area thus the x 1 in bar zone and x 4 in general area have less effects on travel time in this case it should be noted that there are some limitations in this work the proposed method coupling polynomial chaos expansion with nested sampling requires all input parameters to be independent moreover travel time and safety factor are associated with the distribution types and distribution parameters of stochastic input variables which should be given more attention in our future work to provide a general safety factor in evacuation analysis of passenger ships besides the effect of fire products such as smoke and high temperature et al on passenger evacuation in ships has not yet been addressed which will be analyzed in the future work 4 conclusions based on polynomial chaos expansion with the nested sampling technique a method aiming to quantify the uncertainty of passenger travel time is presented with the reduced greatly number of evaluation samples the surrogate model of passenger travel time is verified by 50 lhs test samples from the computer evacuation model to illustrate the application of the proposed method a case study of evacuation analysis for a 3 storey passenger ship is presented some conclusions are summarized as follows firstly polynomial chaos expansion with the nested sampling method can be used to deal with the uncertainty of travel time for the performance based fire protection design of ships whose advantage is that the fewer evaluation samples is required to deal with the uncertainties in multiple random parameters in this case its computational efficiency has increased by 85 3 compared with full tensor product secondly the uncertainty of travel time affected by the initial passenger density in different zones is significant travel times follow approximately the normal distribution under uniformly distributed input parameters and the safety factor is highly related to its safety level whose distribution is dominated by the distribution types and distribution parameters of random input parameters thirdly the sensitivity of travel time to the initial passenger density depends on evacuation area and exit width the uncertainty of the initial passenger density in restaurant zone and retail zone have more significant effects on passenger evacuation which should be determined prudently for bar zone and general area the uncertainty of the initial passenger density can be negligible

22279,passenger evacuation under ship fires is very complex and largely uncertain for ship design conducting an uncertainty analysis of passenger travel time requires a large number of evacuation simulations which is very time consuming this work proposed a new method to quantify the uncertainty of passenger travel time based on a surrogate model which is constructed by the polynomial chaos expansion with the nested sampling technique to illustrate the application of the proposed method a case of a 3 storey passenger ship with different functional zones is presented the results demonstrated that the proposed method can be employed to quantify passenger travel time uncertainty with the acceptable accuracy specifically travel time approximately follows the normal distribution under uniform distributions of input parameters safety factor of travel time cannot be regarded as a deterministic value while it is significantly affected by its safety level the parametric sensitivity analysis results suggested that for restaurant and retail zone the initial passenger density plays a leading role in the safety evacuation compared with other zones while it is ignorable for bar zone and general area this surrogate based uncertainty analysis method of travel time can provide a tool to facilitate passenger evacuation design under ship fires keywords ship fires evacuation time travel time safety factor polynomial chaos expansion surrogate model 1 introduction large passenger ships especially for luxury cruise ships carry a large number of passengers according to statistics fire has been regarded as one of the most common disasters for passenger ships konovessis and vassalos 2008 baalisampang et al 2018 once fire occurs it is mandatory to evacuate all passengers aboard to assembly stations as soon as possible the time from the start of movement to all passengers reaching the assembly stations is defined as passenger travel time imo 2016 which occupies a large proportion of passenger evacuation time for large passenger ship and luxury cruise ships there are so many different functional zones such as passenger cabins wine bars shopping malls restaurants and so on there are some rules on the safety designs of these functional zones specified in the international code for fire safety systems fss code imo 2001 however the initial locations of passengers are highly random due to the sudden fires and the randomness of human behaviors which make the initial passenger density in different functional zones significantly uncertain in order to carry out a cost effective fire protection design of ships the uncertainty of travel time should be quantified with considering the uncertainties of the initial passenger density in different functional zones the study on passenger evacuation time under ships has been widely carried out by many scholars the latest guideline on evacuation analysis msc 1 circ 1533 imo 2016 provided a simplified and an advanced evacuation analysis methods in this simplified evacuation analysis passengers are considered as fluid flow and its advantage is fast in computational speed and used easily cho et al 2016 however the fluid flow cannot present fully the passenger movement characteristics under ships to address this problem as an alternative the advanced evacuation analysis is proposed based on microscopic or mesoscopic evacuation models which can consider the human behavior and its characteristics such as maritime exodus gwynne et al 2003 aeneas meyer könig et al 2007 odigo pradillon 2004 evi vassalos et al 2002b and imex park et al 2004 to characterize the human behavior galea and deere et al galea et al 2011 2014a 2014b deere et al 2012 conducted a series of fullscale passenger evacuation experiments in three different types of passenger ships by means of the data collection systems and the starting location end location response time and travel time of passengers were collected deere et al 2006 suggested the distribution of passenger response time has a more significant effect on evacuation time whose uncertainty cannot be omitted sarshar et al 2013 adopted a bayesian network model to analyze evacuation time under ship fires which lacked a quantitative analysis besides ping et al 2018a combined the bayesian method and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process ahp method to calculate the probability level of successful escape evacuation and rescue on the offshore platform to deal with uncertainties associated with passenger evacuation with the acceptable computational cost there are 4 typical evacuation scenarios are considered in the latest evacuation analysis guideline msc 1 circ 1533 and the safety factor of 1 25 is recommended to address the uncertainty of passenger evacuation analysis while it has not been validated yet what s more ping et al 2018b attempted to adopt a safety factor of 1 25 to deal with the uncertainties associated with evacuation time of crews on an offshore platform monte carlo simulation as a conventional uncertainty quantification method is widely applied in evacuation analysis and ship fires in the past decades vassalos et al 2002a combined computationally inexpensive mesoscopic evacuation model and monte carlo simulation to develop the ship passenger evacuation simulation tool evi to quantify evacuation time uncertainty resulting from random human behavior wu et al 2018 adopted the monte carlo simulation method to develop a probabilistic model of fatality estimation under ship fires to reduce the computational burden grandison et al 2017 proposed a convergence test method for the confidence interval of evacuation time to determine the number of repeated simulations for an evacuation scenario coupled with the monte carlo sampling wang et al 2013 proposed the available safety egress time uncertainty calculation model under ship fires with considering the uncertainty of fire scenario salem 2016 adopted the monte carlo simulation and the two zone fire model cfast to quantify uncertainties in fire consequence calculation since large passenger ships or cruise ships carry a great number of passengers it is time consuming to use the complex computer evacuation model to perform one evacuation simulation however the uncertainty analysis method of coupling evacuation model and monte carlo sampling required a great number of samples due to its slower convergent rate matala 2008 to reduce the number of evaluation samples for uncertainty analysis polynomial chaos expansion proposed by wiener 1938 has been successfully applied to uncertainty analysis of occupant evacuation time under building fires xie et al 2013 2016 as mentioned above it can be easily seen that evacuation time of passengers under ship fires should be studied with consideration of uncertain evacuation scenarios however the relevant study is few and there are some limitations in safety factor and monte carlo simulation for the treatment of uncertainties in passenger evacuation travel time is an important part of evacuation time and the purpose of our work is to quantify the uncertainty of travel time caused by the initial passenger density in different zones of passenger ships with the minimum computational cost in this paper a method coupling the polynomial chaos expansion with nested sparse sampling technique is proposed to establish the surrogate model of passenger travel time afterwards the uncertainty and parametric sensitivity of travel time are also addressed there are 4 sections organized in this paper section 2 presents the uncertainty and parametric sensitivity analysis method of passenger travel time under ship fires based on polynomial chaos expansion with the nested sparse sampling method section 3 carries out a case study for a real passenger ship using the proposed method in section 2 the distribution of travel time is obtained and the functional zones significantly affecting passenger travel time are also identified finally some conclusions are summarized in section 4 2 methodology non intrusive polynomial chaos expansion methods have been widely adopted by many researchers hadigol and doostan 2017 the gauss quadrature is a popular sampling strategy for the non intrusive polynomial chaos expansion techniques ng gauss quadrature points can achieve the algebraic accuracy of degree of 2ng 1 for a univariate numerical integration however the number of optimum samples increases significantly with the number of dimensions n which is called as the curse of dimensionality in order to solve this problem a sparse grid quadrature rule proposed by smolyak 1963 is introduced to determine the optimum sample points for multidimensional variables however it is difficult to give the appropriate degree for polynomial chaos expansion of the output which may result in wasting samples due to the unnestedness of gauss quadrature points in order to solve this problem the nested sampling method based on the kronrod patterson rule kronrod 1965 patterson 1968 is employed to determine one dimensional nested samples and then the smolyak rule is applied to obtain the multidimensional nested samples by means of the sparse combination of multiple one dimensional samples afterwards the polynomial chaos expansion of travel time can be constructed with the orthogonal polynomial basis and then the uncertainty and parametric sensitivity of travel time can be achieved with the inexpensive computational cost based on the monte carlo simulation of polynomial chaos expansion of travel time based on the nested sparse sampling technique the flowchart for uncertainty and parametric sensitivity analysis of travel time under passenger ship fires is presented in fig 1 2 1 uncertainty characterization of input parameters due to the randomness of initial locations of passengers the population density in different functional zones are considered as stochastic for large passenger ships and cruise ships according to the international fss code imo 2001 the maximum capacity of passengers is designed to be 0 5 persons m2 for public places and the number of seats for seating zone moreover the population density is generally assumed to be smaller than 1 9 persons m2 for engineering design nelson 2007 thus we assume that the initial population density in different functional zones of passenger ships denoted as x 1 x 2 x n follows uniform distributions in a range of 0 2 0 persons m2 for public places except for seating zones as shown in fig 2 for convenience of calculation the distribution of the initial passenger density for public places except for seating zones is normalized using the following linear transformation 1 ξ i 3 x i 1 i 1 2 n for the seating zone in passenger ships the number of initial passengers is regarded to follow the uniform distribution in a range from 0 to the corresponding number of seats the initial passenger density can be calculated by the number of passengers divided by the net area of seating zone then the initial passenger density in the seating zone is normalized with the mean 0 and standard deviation 1 2 2 polynomial chaos expansion of travel time the passenger travel time under ship fires can be obtained by performing computer evacuation simulation tool such as pathfinder thunderhead engineering 2017 which is an agent based continuous evacuation model thornton et al 2011 travel time y influenced by n independent initial passenger density parameters x 1 x 2 x n can be expressed as follows 2 y f x ξ x x 1 x 2 x n where ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n is the set of the normalized initial density parameters of x x 1 x 2 x n based on the polynomial chaos theory polynomial chaos representation of y can be given by wiener 1938 3 y i 0 α i φ i ξ ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n where α i are the polynomial chaos expansion coefficients φ i ξ are multidimensional orthonormal polynomial basis on ξ in order to calculate travel time the series expansion of y in equation 3 should be truncated to a certain degree d which can be written as 4 y i 0 p 1 α i φ i ξ p n d n d according to equation 4 it can be seen that α i and φ i need to be solved to estimate y due to the independence of input parameters the multivariate orthonormal polynomial can be computed as the product of univariate orthonormal polynomials thus in order to determine φ i the univariate orthonormal polynomial basis should be constructed according to the orthogonality of the polynomial basis oladyshkin and nowak 2012 proposed a method for constructing the univariate orthogonal polynomial basis with arbitrary distribution the coefficients β 0 j β 1 j β j 1 j β j j for the univariate orthogonal polynomial of degree j on the random variable ξ i denoted by φ j ξ i can be calculated by oladyshkin and nowak 2012 5 μ 0 μ 1 μ j μ 1 μ 2 μ j 1 μ j 1 μ j μ 2 j 1 0 0 1 β 0 j β 1 j β j 1 j β j j 0 0 0 1 μ j ω ξ i j p ξ i d ξ i where u k

function of variable ξ i due to the more useful properties of orthonormal polynomial basis φ j ξ i is normalized by sudret 2008 6 ψ j ξ i 1 φ j φ j ξ i φ j 2 φ j ξ i 2 p ξ i d ξ i the next step is to calculate the polynomial chaos expansion coefficients α i which can be computed by intrusive and non intrusive methods herzog et al 2008 for the intrusive methods the original computer codes for the output solver are required to be modified which is difficult to conduct due to the closed source softwares the non intrusive methods consider the output as a black box model thus the original codes of commercial softwares are not required to be modified in non intrusive methods to solve the polynomial chaos expansion coefficients the regression and projection methods are widely used in the non intrusive methods the fundamental theory of the regression method is a least square method and the projection method can utilize the property of orthonormal polynomial basis thus the projection method of the non intrusive methods is adopted to calculate α i in this paper in the projection method the left and right terms of equation 4 are both multiplied by φ j ξ and integrated over p ξ and the following expression can be generated sudret 2008 7 y φ j ξ p ξ d ξ φ j ξ i 0 p 1 α i φ i ξ p ξ d ξ there is a more useful property for orthonormal polynomial basis φ ξ which can be described by oladyshkin and nowak 2012 8 φ i ξ φ j ξ ρ ξ d ξ 1 j i 0 j i combining equation 7 with 8 α i can be derived as follows sudret 2008 9 α i y φ i ξ p ξ d ξ 2 3 nested sampling method based on gauss kronrod patterson rule to estimate the equation 9 the most straightforward method is the monte carlo simulation however this approach requires a great number of samples to achieve a more accurate estimation matala 2008 in order to reduce the number of evaluation samples gauss kronrod patterson quadrature rule is adopted to estimate α i in equation 9 according to gauss quadrature scheme the optimum quadrature points are the roots of the orthogonal polynomial of a certain degree d abramowitz and stegun 1970 the corresponding weights of gauss quadrature points can be calculated according to the gauss quadrature rule golub and welsch 1969 due to the unnestedness of guassian quadrature points the nested sampling method based on the kronrod patterson rule is used in this paper for n gauss quadrature points of univariate quadrature n 1 optimum quadrature points are added with the algebraic accuracy level of integrand at least 3n 1 according to the kronrod rule kronrod 1965 patterson 1968 further developed the kronrod univariate quadrature rule by adding p quadrature points which makes the algebraic accuracy level of integrand be n 2p 1 besides a delayed increase method for determining optimum quadrature points was proposed by petras 2003 for uniformly distributed stochastic variable the steps for univariate quadrature points and weights of based on gauss kronrod patterson quadrature rule are given as follows step 1 for extension sequence s 0 the n s initial quadrature points are calculated by gauss quadrature scheme and the number of initial quadrature points is n s 1 step 2 for extension sequence s s 1 the n s 1 optimum quadrature points can be added according to kronrod patterson rule and the number of optimum quadrature points is n s 2 s 1 1 step 3 the weights of the optimum quadrature points for extension sequence s s 1 can also be calculated according to the kronrod patterson rule step 4 repeat the steps 2 and 3 to obtain the optimum samples and weights for the desired extension sequence s according to the steps above we determine the number of sample points n s 1 3 7 15 for uniformly distributed parameters the sample points and corresponding weights can also be obtained at http www sparse grids de based on gauss kronrod patterson rule the flowchart for the determination of optimum quadrature points of the univariate quadrature is shown in fig 3 2 4 sparse grid sampling for multivariate quadrature the quadrature points and weights from gauss kronrod patterson rule can be used to deal with the one dimension quadrature for multidimensional quadrature the number of quadrature points is the product of the number of each dimensional quadrature points i e full tensor product which will be great for high dimensional quadrature in order to reduce the number of quadrature points with the higher computational efficiency the sparse grid quadrature is proposed by smolyak in 1963 smolyak 1963 for the smolyak quadrature rule at the accuracy level l the optimum quadrature points for n dimensional quadrature are required to comply with the following conditions ahlfeld et al 2016 10 ξ p s l l 1 m l n ξ 1 m 1 ξ 2 m 2 ξ n

smolyak algorithm at the accuracy level l the weight for the d n th quadrature point on n dimensional quadrature can be calculated as heiss and winschel 2008 11 w d n l 1 n m n 1 l n m w 1 i 1 w 2 i 2 w n i n d n 1 2 p s i 1 1 2 m 1 i n 1 1 2 m n 1 i n 1 2 m n where w d n l is the weight of the d n th sample for n dimensional quadrature at the accuracy level l w 1 i 1 w 2 i 2 w n i n are respectively the weights of the i 1 th i 2 th i n th sample of ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ n 1 ξ n thus α i in equation 9 can be calculated as follows sudret 2008 12 α i d n 1 p s y ξ d n φ i ξ d n w d n l where ξ d n is the d n th quadrature point for n dimensional quadrature y ξ d n is the average travel time for one evacuation scenario with ξ d n which is repeated simulations 10 times by the stochastic computer evacuation model pathfinder in this paper thunderhead engineering 2017 2 5 the estimation for uncertainty and parametric sensitivity of travel time in order to evaluate the uncertainty of y resulting from the initial passenger density its mean e y and standard deviation std y should be obtained the mean of y can be calculated by 13 e y y x ξ p x ξ d ξ based on equation 4 equation 13 can be rewritten as 14 e y i 0 p 1 α i φ i ξ p x ξ d ξ due to the orthonormal property of φ i ξ i 0 p 1 e y is the coefficient of constant term of polynomial chaos expansion of y which is given by sudret 2008 15 e y a 0 based on the definition of the standard deviation the standard deviation of y can be calculated as 16 std y i 0 p 1 α i φ i ξ a 0 2 p x ξ d ξ combined with the orthonormal properties of φ i std y can calculated by 17 std y i 1 p 1 α i 2 the probability density function pdf and cumulative distribution function cdf of y can be analyzed statistically by the results from the monte carlo simulation of the polynomial chaos expansion of y whose computational cost can be ignored moreover the sensitivity of y with the uncertain the initial passenger density parameters in different functional zones of ships can also be analytically calculated according to sobol s decomposition sobol 1993 polynomial chaos expansion of y in equation 4 can be rewritten as 18 y α 0 i 1 n α i φ i ξ i

2 α 123 n 2 std y 2 i 1 2 n where st i is the total sensitivity index of x i 3 case study and analysis 3 1 case description in order to illustrate the proposed method evacuation analysis of a real 3 story passenger ship with 10 stairs is used as a case galea et al 2012 whose floor plan is presented in fig 4 there are 6 different functional zones in this passenger ship including bar general area retail seating restaurant and locker zone bars are located on decks 1 and 2 general area is located on decks 1 and 2 retail is located on deck 1 seating zone is located on decks 2 and 3 restaurant is located on deck 2 and locker zone is located on deck 1 connected to assembly station c there are 4 assembly stations the assembly stations a b and c are located on deck 1 and assembly station d is located on deck 2 there are 10 stairs in this passenger ship 1m wide stair 1 and 1m wide stair 5 2 7m wide stair 2 and 2 7m wide stair 6 2 7m wide stair 3 and 2 7m wide stair 7 2 7m wide stair 4 and 2 7m wide stair 8 2 7m wide stair 6 and 2 7m wide stair 9 2 7m wide stair 7 and 1 2m wide stair 10 are respectively connected the passengers are distributed randomly in different functional zones and the demographic distribution of the population is consistent with the specification of the imo guidelines imo 2016 due to the randomness and complexity of human behavior the initial passenger density in the different zones is uncertain according to the description in section 2 1 the initial passenger density in each functional zone follows the uniform distribution as shown in table 1 the fire is assumed to occur in retail zone on deck 1 and the entrance to the assembly station a is available for passenger evacuation the travel time is the time from the start of passenger movement to all the passengers reaching assembly stations and its samples are simulated by the computer evacuation model pathfinder with the passenger response time of 0 s in this paper 3 2 calculated results the orthogonal polynomial basis can be obtained based on equation 5 which can be normalized by equation 6 based on the smolyak algorithm 51 input and output samples are required for the gauss kronrod patterson quadrature rule at the accuracy level 3 with 5 stochastic variables which can estimate accurately α i for polynomial chaos expansion of the degree less than 3 the input samples and corresponding weights can be calculated by combining the gauss kronrod patterson rule in section 2 3 and smolyak algorithm in section 2 4 the output samples of travel time can be obtained by performing the computer evacuation simulation tool pathfinder with specified samples of the initial passenger density once the input and output samples as well as corresponding weights are obtained at the accuracy level 3 α i in equation 12 for the 1st degree and 2nd degree expansion of passenger travel time under ship fires can be obtained accurately in order to test the convergence of the 2nd degree expansion of y the monte carlo simulation for the 1st and 2nd degree expansion of y are performed with 1000 latin hypercube sampling lhs samples of x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 and the corresponding 1000 samples of y can be obtained then the relative error of 1000 samples of y between the 1st and 2nd expansions can be used to measure their difference and the pdf histogram and cdf curve of their relative error are shown in fig 5 from fig 5 it can be seen that the relative error of y is larger than the acceptable range 0 15 0 15 in general engineering application cuesta et al 2016 thus in order to obtain a more accurate estimation the 3rd degree expansion of y should be constructed to construct the 3rd degree expansion of y another 100 input samples are required according to the gauss kronrod patterson quadrature rule with smolyak algorithm at the accuracy level 4 thus 151 input and output samples as well as the corresponding weights are required which can estimate accurately α i for polynomial chaos expansion of the degree smaller than 4 the pdf histogram and cdf curve of the relative error of y between the 2nd and 3rd degree expansion at the accuracy level 4 are obtained as shown in fig 6 from fig 6 it can be seen that the relative error of y between the 2nd and 3rd degree expansion is distributed in the acceptable range 0 15 0 15 with a 95 2 probability level thus the 3rd degree expansion can be regarded as convergent in this case which can be used as the surrogate model of y the 3rd degree polynomial chaos expansion requires 151 samples smaller than 45 for the full tensor product technique according to the analysis above the number of evaluations for smolyak method and full tensor product are listed in table 2 from table 2 it can be seen that the smolyak method can significantly reduce the number of evaluation samples whose computational efficiency increases by 85 3 compared with the full tensor product furthermore in order to compare the 3rd degree expansion of y and pathfinder the 3rd degree expansion of y and pathfinder are implemented with 50 lhs input samples of the initial passenger density in 5 different functional zones based on 50 lhs travel time samples the pdf histogram and cdf curve of the relative error of y between the 3rd degree polynomial chaos expansion and pathfinder are shown in fig 7 from fig 7 it can be seen that the probability level of the relative error of travel time in this acceptable range 0 15 0 15 is 86 for the 3rd degree polynomial chaos expansion which is regarded as acceptable in this case thus the convergent 3rd degree expansion of y can be used as the surrogate model of travel time which requires 151 samples based on the results from the monte carlo simulation of the 3rd degree polynomial chaos expansion of y with 1000 lhs samples the pdf and cdf of travel time are presented in fig 8 from fig 8 it can be seen that the mean and standard deviation of travel time are 351 2 s and 102 5 s respectively and the range of travel time is 138 6 497 7 s with the 95 confidence interval according to ang and cornell 1974 the safety level of travel time can be represented by its cumulative distribution function in this paper thus the travel time at any safety level and the safety level for a certain travel time can be determined from fig 8 b which is useful to improve the evacuation safety design of passenger ships for example as the acceptable safety level is 97 5 the value of travel time should be taken as 497 7 s if travel time is 138 6 s its safety level is 2 5 moreover a normal distribution is adopted to fit passenger travel time which suggests that travel time follows approximately the normal distribution in this case as shown in fig 8 a furthermore safety factor is taken as 1 25 in msc 1 circ 1533 by considering model omissions assumptions and the limited benchmark evacuation scenarios imo 2016 similar to the safety factor in msc 1 circ 1533 safety factor of travel time in this paper can be calculated by the ratio of travel time at a certain safety level to the base travel time notarianni and parry 2016 herein the base travel time is calculated under the conditions of the initial passenger density of 0 5 persons m2 in the public zones and the number of passengers in seating zones equal to the number of seats fig 9 presents the safety factor at different safety levels based on the monte carlo simulation results from the surrogate model of travel time which is used to deal with the uncertainties of the initial passenger density in different functional zones in this case from fig 9 it can be seen that the safety factor of travel time increases with its safety level as for the safety level of 95 the safety factor of travel time is 2 15 when the safety factor is 1 25 the corresponding safety level of travel time is 27 3 thus in ship fire protection design the safety factor should be determined prudently at a certain acceptable safety level from equation 19 it can be seen that the main sensitivity index s i can be used to measure the contribution of the uncertainty of x i to the output uncertainty without the mutual effects of other parameters the total sensitivity index st i can be used to measure the total contribution of the uncertainty of x i on the output uncertainty including the mutual interaction of other parameters according to equation 20 in order to study the effect of the uncertainty of the initial passenger density on travel time in different functional zones s i and st i can be obtained analytically based on the 3rd polynomial chaos expansion of y and the parametric sensitivity results of travel time are shown in fig 10 according to the main sensitivity index s i the rank of the importance of the initial passenger density in different zones is x 5 x 2 x 1 x 3 x 4 which shows that uncertainties of x 5 in restaurant zone and x 2 in retail zone have more significant effects on passenger travel time without considering the effects of the initial passenger density in the other zones fig 10 indicates that the uncertainties of x 1 in bar zone x 3 in seating zone and x 4 in general area have less effects on passenger travel time without considering the effects of the initial passenger density in other zones moreover according to the total sensitivity index st i it can be found that the rank of the importance of the initial passenger density in different functional zones is x 5 x 2 x 3 x 1 x 4 from fig 10 which suggests that the uncertainties of x 5 in restaurant zone and x 2 in retail zone have more significant effects on passenger evacuation with considering the effects of the initial passenger density in other zones and x 3 in seating zone has a less significant effect on passenger travel time in ships in addition the uncertainties of x 1 in bar zone and x 4 in general area can be ignored which displays that there is no significant crowd congestion for bar zone and general area 3 3 discussion generally travel time increases monotonically with the increase of the initial passenger density however it can be found the travel times in this case follow roughly the normal distribution when the initial passenger density are distributed uniformly in different functional zones the reason is that there are mutual interactions between the passengers in different functional zones for example some passengers in seating zone and general area on deck 2 may evacuation to assembly d by the same entrance through the sensitivity analysis results it can be seen that x 5 in restaurant zone and x 2 in retail zone should be determined prudently in evacuation design for ship fires this can be explained that the net area of restaurant zone and retail zones are respectively 580 767 m2 and 574 622 m2 which are larger with 0 1162 passengers and 0 1149 passengers the entrance width of assembly stations a and d for the passengers in retail and restaurant are both 2 65 m the worst case of the entrance width to assembly stations for every 100 persons in restaurant and retail zone are both approximately 0 23 m which is much smaller than 1 0 m specified in international fss code imo 2001 thus it can be found that the smaller entrance width to assembly stations a and d can lead to crowd congestion in retail and restaurant zones additionally it can be seen that the mutual interaction of x 3 in seating zone with those of other functional zones cannot be ignored by the comparison of the main and total sensitivity index in fig 10 some passengers in seating zone and general area on deck 2 merge together with the aim of evacuating to assembly station d moreover some passengers in seating zone on deck 3 may evacuate through stair 9 stair 6 and stair 2 to get to deck 1 and then enter the assembly b or c which makes the travel distance of passengers in seating zone on deck 3 longer thus it can be seen that the uncertainty of x 3 in seating zone has a certain contribution to the uncertainty of travel time with considering the effects of the passengers in other functional zones furthermore the uncertainties of x 1 in bar zone and x 4 in general area can be ignored the net total area of bar zone and general area are respectively 300 6360 m2 and 152 5746 m2 which are not larger the travel distance of passengers in bar zone and general area to the entrance of assembly stations are shorter with large entrance width the general area on deck 1 is also connected to the assembly station a and b with the 8 62 m entrance width and the general area on deck 2 is directly connected to the assembly station d with a 2 65 m entrance width besides the general area on deck 2 and on deck 1 is connected by stair 6 and stair 2 with a 2 7 m width it can be seen that the entrance width of the assembly stations for general area is wide enough besides bar zones are directly connected to the general area thus the x 1 in bar zone and x 4 in general area have less effects on travel time in this case it should be noted that there are some limitations in this work the proposed method coupling polynomial chaos expansion with nested sampling requires all input parameters to be independent moreover travel time and safety factor are associated with the distribution types and distribution parameters of stochastic input variables which should be given more attention in our future work to provide a general safety factor in evacuation analysis of passenger ships besides the effect of fire products such as smoke and high temperature et al on passenger evacuation in ships has not yet been addressed which will be analyzed in the future work 4 conclusions based on polynomial chaos expansion with the nested sampling technique a method aiming to quantify the uncertainty of passenger travel time is presented with the reduced greatly number of evaluation samples the surrogate model of passenger travel time is verified by 50 lhs test samples from the computer evacuation model to illustrate the application of the proposed method a case study of evacuation analysis for a 3 storey passenger ship is presented some conclusions are summarized as follows firstly polynomial chaos expansion with the nested sampling method can be used to deal with the uncertainty of travel time for the performance based fire protection design of ships whose advantage is that the fewer evaluation samples is required to deal with the uncertainties in multiple random parameters in this case its computational efficiency has increased by 85 3 compared with full tensor product secondly the uncertainty of travel time affected by the initial passenger density in different zones is significant travel times follow approximately the normal distribution under uniformly distributed input parameters and the safety factor is highly related to its safety level whose distribution is dominated by the distribution types and distribution parameters of random input parameters thirdly the sensitivity of travel time to the initial passenger density depends on evacuation area and exit width the uncertainty of the initial passenger density in restaurant zone and retail zone have more significant effects on passenger evacuation which should be determined prudently for bar zone and general area the uncertainty of the initial passenger density can be negligible
