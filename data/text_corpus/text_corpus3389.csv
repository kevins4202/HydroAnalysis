16945,rivers play an important role in global water and carbon cycling but there are still large uncertainties concerning evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis here we combined measurements of water chemistry isotopic compositions i e δ d w δ 18 o w δ 13 c dic and 14 c dic and geographic characteristics i e river width to elucidate in stream hydrological and biogeochemical processes across rivers in hainan island china the results showed that dissolved inorganic carbon dic in river waters was largely of modern origin with about 95 from contemporary biogenic sources based on an isotopic mass balance of 14 c dic significant evaporation and aquatic primary production co occurred in these tropical rivers with large amounts of water and dic being rapidly turned over in the water column altering the water cycle and the carbon balance high rates of evaporation and aquatic primary production were observed in the headwater segments with narrow river width but broad available reactive surface area at the air water interface the asymmetric aquatic photosynthesis at different river segments caused the spatial heterogeneities of dissolved solutes the results suggest that the available reactive area at the water air interface is responsible for synchronous water loss and dissolved carbon evolution in flat tropical rivers this study provides evidence that intense evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis mainly occurred in headwater segments which has implications for understanding global carbon cycling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon cycling aquatic photosynthesis evaporation tropical rivers headwaters 1 introduction rivers are important not only for global material transportation meybeck 1982 and as integrators of terrestrial biogeochemical processes jenerette and lal 2005 lu et al 2014 but also as biogeochemical reactors cole et al 2007 dornblaser and striegl 2015 mayorga et al 2005 the river system works as a network for water and carbon transportation but the amount of terrestrial carbon entering rivers and the internal cycling pathways remain elusive abril and borges 2019 aufdenkampe et al 2011 cole et al 2007 wehrli 2013 only approximately one third of the continental precipitation and one sixth of the carbon exported from land reach the oceans ferguson et al 2007 wehrli 2013 in order to decipher global water and carbon cycling through river systems knowledge of in stream processes and the internal cycling mechanisms of carbon and water is necessary the spatial heterogeneity of the water cycle is recorded by changes in the isotopic compositions of water δ 18 o w and δ d w across continents dansgaard 1964 which provides potential fingerprints for exploring complex hydrological and ecological processes bailey et al 2018 hu et al 2018 thermodynamic arguments indicate that regional imbalances in precipitation p and evaporation e vary with changing global temperature bailey et al 2018 shaping the δ 18 o w and δ d w of inland waters hu et al 2018 therefore changes in δ 18 o w and δ d w can be used to quantify water sources and monitor the evaporation effect on the water cycle moreover the water cycle exerts a significant role on carbon cycling which can be ascribed to the coupling of vapor release and dissolved inorganic carbon dic processing i e photosysthesis and co2 outgassing ferguson and veizer 2007 lee and veizer 2003 zhong et al 2020a there are several sources and sinks for dic in rivers which greatly affect dic dynamics alling et al 2012 campeau et al 2017 doctor et al 2008 li et al 2010 marwick et al 2015 marx et al 2017 polsenaere and abril 2012 venkiteswaran et al 2014 zhong et al 2018 these processes cannot be identified from dic concentrations alone but the stable isotopic composition of dic δ 13 c dic offers additional information to constrain the extent of carbon losses in river networks alling et al 2012 li et al 2010 samanta et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 although there are differences in the extent of isotope fractionation between co2 outgassing and aquatic primary production the loss of dic generally leads to isotopically heavier carbon in the water column alling et al 2012 doctor et al 2008 mook et al 1974 conversely addition of dic through organic carbon oc mineralization and or input of soil respired co2 results in isotopically light carbon in areas dominated by c3 plants alling et al 2012 campeau et al 2017 li et al 2010 zhong et al 2018 however the δ 13 c signatures of different natural sources may overlap which can mask the true sources marwick et al 2015 in combination with stable carbon isotopes radiocarbon 14c adds temporal resolution allowing further understanding of carbon sources in aquatic environments marwick et al 2015 indeed radiocarbon analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon 14 c dic has been widely applied to understand sources and processes affecting dic in river systems blattmann et al 2019 lu et al 2014 marwick et al 2015 mayorga et al 2005 raymond et al 2004 together the relative changes in δ 13 c dic and 14 c dic can provide valuable fingerprints to elucidate biogeochemical processes gross primary productivity gpp is known to be an important regulator of carbon cycling in inland waters maintaining the balance between organic and inorganic carbon gao et al 2021 the gpp also affects the burial of biological oc that contributes to sequestration of atmospheric co2 working as the biological carbon pump liu et al 2017 yi et al 2021 although aquatic photosynthesis plays an important role in carbon cycling for many systems its controls remain largely unclear gao et al 2021 and references therein one of the potential controls is the geomorphology of the stream channel e g river width and depth which causes differences of available reactive surface area allen et al 2018 however the effects of geomorphology on water and carbon cycling remain elusive many studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying spatiotemporal patterns in water and carbon cycling across stream and river networks bouillon et al 2009 hu et al 2018 zhong et al 2020b however these processes have in most cases been investigated separately in this study the chemical and isotopic compositions were combined to elucidate patterns in the cycling of water and carbon in productive tropical rivers accordingly we first analyzed the hydrological and biogeochemical processes and then calculated the water loss by evaporation and the carbon assimilation through aquatic photosynthesis we were then able to link hydrological and biogeochemical processes with river width to analyze the effects of geographic characteristics thereby we generate a methodology to unravel the linkage between hydrological and carbon processes in tropical river networks 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hainan island is located in the south china sea and is the second largest island in china with an area of 3 54 104 km2 wang and du 2016 fig 1 the climate is tropical oceanic and monsoonal with a mean annual temperature of 25 c the annual precipitation on hainan island ranges between 1200 mm and 2200 mm with an average of 1774 mm pradhan et al 2016 distinct dry november april and wet may october seasons occur with about 80 of the total precipitation falling during the latter period ma et al 2007 the lithology of the island is mainly composed of silicate rocks with extensive occurrence of basalt in the north of the island while the south of the island is characterized by granite the vegetation on the island is dominated by c3 plants herbeck et al 2011 pradhan et al 2016 2 2 sample collection and analysis we collected water samples from the rivers of hainan island during two weeks during the dry season in january 2018 samples were collected from 78 sampling sites distributed around the island fig 1 samples were collected from the shore and at a depth of 50 cm below the water surface samples were stored temporally in acid washed low density polyethylene plastic bags and filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filters within 24 h of collection water temperature t electrical conductivity ec ph and chlorophyll chl a were determined in situ with a multi parameter profiler ysi exo total alkalinity alk was determined by titration using 0 02 mol l hydrochloric acid within 24 h zhong et al 2018 the dic concentrations were calculated using mass action relationships with alk concentrations t and ph clark and fritz 1997 major cations and dissolved silicate si were subsequently measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc were determined using an aurora 1030 w toc analyzer oi analytical usa with duplicates within 1 5 which we take to represent analytical uncertainty the stable isotopic compositions of water were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer picarro l2140 i usa whose values were reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow the stable isotopic compositions for oxygen and hydrogen δ18ow and δdw were reported using standard delta values δ with an uncertainty of 0 3 1σ and 1 1σ for δ18ow and δdw respectively for isotopic determinations of dic 2 ml 85 phosphoric acid was added to convert all dic to co2 which was then extracted and purified using a vacuum system and gentle stirring by a bar magnet li et al 2010 zhong et al 2018 after purification δ13cdic measurements were performed on a finnigan mat 253 plus mass spectrometer which was calibrated relative to the vienna pee dee belemnite standard with an uncertainty of 0 1 for analysis of δ14cdic the purified co2 was graphitized using the sealed tube zinc reduction method of xu et al 2007 and xu et al 2013 the δ14cdic was measured using 0 5 mv accelerator mass spectrometry dong et al 2018 where the δ 14 c d i c values were corrected for istotopic fractionation both machine and graphitization induced using the ams on line δ13c values xu et al 2007 all laboratory analyses were conducted in the institute of surface earth system sciences school of earth system science tianjin university china 2 3 theoretical background 2 3 1 evaporation estimation using the deuterium excess d excess dual isotope system method catchment water balance can be used to estimate evapotranspiration wisler and brater 1959 according to 1 e t p r δ s p where et represents evapotranspiration p is precipitation r is runoff and δ s represents the recharge by groundwater and glacier melt water although et values can be estimated from this mass balance eq 1 meaningful results require the method to be applied over a long time scale e g a full hydrological year the dual isotope system method d excess was introduced dansgaard 1964 based on the evaporation component evolved by rayleigh processes clark and fritz 1997 the d excess was deduced from the global meteoric water line gmwl and defined by dansgaard 1964 as 2 d excess δ d w 8 δ 18 o w d excess is unrelated to the stable isotopic composition of precipitation and reflects differences in humidity between evaporation and the vapor source clark and fritz 1997 li et al 2014 zhong et al 2020a the d excess in river waters reflects the degree of evaporation and low d excess values accompany an intense evaporation ratio dansgaard 1964 during the evaporation processes the water experiences rayleigh fractionation clark and fritz 1997 hu et al 2018 3 r s r 0 s f α 1 4 d e x c e s s δ 0 1000 f α 1 1000 δ d 0 1000 f α d 1 8 δ 18 o 0 1000 f α 18 o 1 7000 where rs and r0s represent the d h or 18o 16o ratios for the initial and final status respectively f is the residual fraction of water 0 represents the initial status δd0 and δ18o0 denote the initial water isotopic compositions and α is the fractionation factor between the product and the reactant α is the sum of the kinetic factor δ ε and the equilibrium fractionation factor ε 5 α ε δ ε where ε is temperature dependent t in kelvin according to 6 1 0 3 ln ε d 24 844 10 6 t 2 76 248 10 3 t 52 612 7 1 0 3 ln ε 18 o 1 137 10 6 t 2 0 4156 10 3 t 2 0667 where δ ε is determined as 8 δ ε d 12 5 1 h 1000 9 δ ε 18 o 14 2 1 h 1000 where h is the relative humidity the d excess has been shown to be independent of δd0 and δ18o0 at certain t and h conditions huang et al 2012 zhong et al 2020a accordingly the d excess method has great benefits for investigating evaporation hu et al 2018 zhong et al 2020a based on the uniform oceanic vapor source for the entire hainan island the d excess method was applied to constrain the amount of evaporation eq 4 hu et al 2018 zhong et al 2020a 2 3 2 the isotopic mass balance equation of dic in this study we used 14c values of atmospheric co2 collected at luhuitou i e 4 6 2 9 to 31 8 2 8 hainan island niu et al 2016 as the contemporary carbon end member we further assumed that carbonate rocks were 14c free and that weathering of carbonate containing minerals or bedrock would result in observed 14cdic values being lower than contemporary atmospheric co2 marwick et al 2015 mayorga et al 2005 voss et al 2017 when co2 outgassing occurs from oversaturated waters co2 transfer can be considered as uni directional alling et al 2012 as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 in all rivers of the current study was oversaturated in co2 relative to the atmosphere any invasion of atmospheric co2 to the river water was neglected mayorga et al 2005 zhong et al 2017 since 14c was fractionation corrected by δ13c co2 outgassing and primary production did not shift the 14c values of riverine dic marwick et al 2015 zeng et al 2010 because the biogenic and carbonate sources have distinct isotope ratios an isotopic mass balance equation i e a two end member model was used to constrain the contribution of each source 10 δ 14 c d i c δ 14 c b i o f b i o δ 14 c c a r b f c a r b where 14cbio and 14ccarb are the 14c values of contemporary biogenic carbon and carbonate respectively fbio and fcarb are the proportions of carbon in the bulk dic pool from contemporary biogenic and carbonate sources respectively 2 3 3 loss of dic through co2 outgassing and primary production co2 outgassing and aquatic photosynthesis cause isotopic fractionation of the river dic alling et al 2012 campeau et al 2017 li et al 2010 polsenaere and abril 2012 samanta et al 2015 venkiteswaran et al 2014 the remaining dic and δ13cdic values after co2 outgassing and primary production can be given according to 11 dic final f dic i 12 δ 13 c f i n a l δ 13 c i 10 3 α c o 2 1 l n f where dic final and dic i represent the final and initial dic concentrations respectively δ13cfinal and δ13ci are the final and initial δ13cdic values respectively the fractionation factor α co2 for co2 outgassing is temperature dependent and can be estimated using the following equation rau et al 1996 samanta et al 2015 13 α c o 2 1 23 644 9701 5 t 1000 as hco3 is the main component of dic in the rivers of hainan island due to the neutral ph zhong et al 2018 and references therein we mainly focused on the transformation of hco3 to co2 in this study co2 outgassing was likely underestimated since the fractionation between dissolved and gaseous co2 was ignored for primary production we used a α co2 of 0 976 following alling et al 2012 and samanta et al 2015 c3 plant material from hainan island has a stable carbon isotopic ratio of about 27 3 herbeck et al 2011 based on the study of pradhan et al 2016 we assumed that the δ13c of soil co2 was 21 8 on hainan island after considering an isotopic fractionation of 4 4 during co2 diffusion cerling et al 1991 3 results 3 1 water chemistry in hainan island rivers the river water temperature varied widely from 16 7 to 28 0 c during the sampling campaign across the hainan rivers table 1 the ph varied by more than two ph units across all river sites from 6 2 to 8 6 table 1 the do changed from 4 5 to 12 3 mg l with an average of 8 2 mg l table 1 the chl a concentration varied from undetectable to 24 3 μg l with an average of 4 7 μg l table 1 major ions also showed significant spatial variations from 2 9 to 18 4 mg l for ca2 1 0 to 10 9 mg l for na and 1 8 to 6 4 mg l for dissolved si table 1 the ca2 na molar ratios ranged from 0 1 to 0 9 with an average of 0 4 the si na molar ratios varied in a wide range from 0 2 to 1 8 alk ranged from 0 24 to 1 58 mmol l but the dic concentrations were much higher ranging from 0 41 to 1 85 mmol l table 1 all rivers were oversaturated in co2 with pco2 of 450 to 4140 μatm the doc concentration varied greatly ranging from 0 8 to 8 1 mg l with an average of 2 4 mg l table 1 3 2 the river water isotopic compositions of water and dic on hainan island although all the sampling sites in this study were located over a narrow altitude range i e 0 and 248 m a s l the water isotopic compositions of the rivers showed significant spatial variations ranging from 54 8 to 20 9 for δdw and from 8 5 to 3 5 for δ18ow table 1 throughout the island the d excess values varied in a wide range from 3 2 to 13 6 the δ13cdic values also varied largely from 14 1 to 5 2 with an average of 9 7 table 1 the 14cdic values ranged between 59 and 28 across the sampled rivers n 13 table 1 showing a mainly modern origin of river dic 3 3 calculation of water and dic loss in the river network of hainan island following the d excesses approach river waters were found to be highly affected by evaporation with a maximum evaporation rate of up to 38 of the riverine initial water the isotopic mass balance equation for dic eq 10 implies that the contribution of carbonate dead carbon to the dic pool was about 5 in other words about 95 of the dic was derived from contemporary biogenic sources e g c3 plants based on the sources of dic defined above the initial δ13cdic of the rivers was taken to be approximately 20 7 the δ13c values of the remaining dic would be fractionated by rayleigh distillation through co2 outgassing and primary production eq 12 in this study we estimated the river dic loss using the rayleigh fractionation model through co2 outgassing and primary production eq 11 respectively if only primary production was assumed to occur in the aquatic systems about 41 to 80 of the initial riverine dic was fixed by primary production if only co2 outgassing was considered in the rivers 19 to 45 of dic was removed by co2 outgassing 4 discussion 4 1 the carbon biogeochemical processes in river networks the dic in the rivers of hainan island was generally 13c enriched and of contemporary origin and further matched many observations made at the global scale i e 749 to 179 fig 2 a marwick et al 2015 silicate minerals are widely distributed in the study area with weathering driven by soil co2 causing biologic sourced dic mostly contemporary 14cdic values verified dominance of silicate weathering in the river basins with soil respiration being the dominant carbon source for dic voss et al 2017 the river dic concentrations on hainan island were generally lower than most global large rivers i e averaging 1 81 mmol l from gaillardet et al 1999 consistent with the relative importance of silicate weathering for dic production however carbonate minerals are characterized by rapid dissolution kinetics and trace amounts of carbonate minerals can affect the dic gaillardet et al 2019 and references therein ca2 na ratios represent the relative elemental ratio between carbonate and silicate weathering gaillardet et al 2019 zhong et al 2017 showing the mixing effects of carbonate and silicate weathering a negative relationship was observed between 14cdic and ca2 na ratios fig 2b indicating that the observed dic with 14c depleted values was supported by carbonate weathering although trace amounts of carbonate minerals occur we cannot neglect the effects of carbonate weathering on dic concentrations and isotopes multiple biogeochemical processes affect the dic pool of rivers and δ13cdic is often used to constrain aquatic carbon cycling alling et al 2012 zhong et al 2018 moreover chl a can be used as a proxy of aquatic primary production in this study δ13cdic and chl a were positively related across the rivers of hainan island fig 3 aquatic photosynthesis preferentially absorbs lighter 12c resulting in a 13c enriched dic pool alling et al 2012 meanwhile aquatic primary production generates oc which is also subsequently degraded causing the positive relationship between doc and chl a fig 4 a stedmon and markager 2005 na and si derive mainly from silicate weathering and the si na ratios largely represent the behavior of si as na can be considered conservative zhong et al 2017 after na and si are released from primary mineral dissolution si na values can be shifted by multiple si biogeochemical processes dissolved si can readily be assimilated by primary producers humborg et al 1997 and secondary mineral precipitation zhong et al 2017 both of which decrease the ratios of si na in the water column we interpret the positive relationship between doc and chl a fig 4a combined with the inverse relationship between doc and si na fig 4b as the effect of aquatic primary production the influence of aquatic primary production on the dic pool was further displayed by the positive relationship between δ13cdic and do fig 4c as do is produced during photosynthesis interpreting riverine δ13cdic solely using its direct values but without considering ph could lead to false interpretation of the carbon sources campeau et al 2017 the ph is closely connected to the speciation of dic while δ13cdic could be adjusted for the effect of ph on dic species by driving the unique δ13c value campeau et al 2017 zolkos et al 2020 there was a positive relationship between ph and δ13cdic fig 4d induced by shifting the compositions of dic species although some species of phytoplankton can use hco3 as a carbon source tortell et al 1997 co2 is regarded as the main carbon source for primary production alling et al 2012 as co2 is fixed by primary production it could induce both increasing ph and δ13cdic alling et al 2012 a relationship that was observed in the rivers of the current study fig 4d the overall effect of oc mineralization which would generate dic with δ13c values close to the source material was offset by co2 outgassing and primary production in these rivers as shown by the observed 13c enriched dic co2 outgassing requires an excess of co2 in relation to the atmosphere while primary production can fix dic during under saturated conditions hence there is a competition between primary production and co2 outgassing that can influence the carbon balance in aquatic systems demars et al 2016 the positive relationship between δ13cdic and chl a indicated that primary production was important in regulating spatial dic patterns in the current study fig 3 although it was difficult to separate the processes of co2 outgassing and primary production alling et al 2012 we believe that primary production has a dominant control on dic dynamics in these tropical rivers based on the high chl a concentrations observed in this study 4 2 co occurring evaporation and primary production in river networks river water evaporation and aquatic primary production co occurred in the hainan island rivers which was evident from the negative relationship between d excess and chl a fig 5 the availability and transport of water throughout the river network mediates the biogeochemical processing of carbon directly and indirectly jenerette and lal 2005 hydrological processes directly mediate the river carbon pool by controlling the mobilization of different carbon sources and through evaporation that cause enrichment of the river carbon concentrations jenerette and lal 2005 zhong et al 2018 2020a in addition to the direct influences carbon processing varies substantially in response to hydrological changes jenerette and lal 2005 carbon fixation by aquatic photosynthesis showed high spatial heterogeneity likely due to the variable light availability and water residence time across the river network yi et al 2021 consequently changes in water evaporation co occurred with changes in aquatic photosynthesis across the hainan island river networks during primary production some of the dic will be assimilated and converted into oc alling et al 2012 and hence there was a negative power law relationship between d excess and doc fig 6 a likewise a positive correlation was displayed between d excess and si na which was affected by aquatic photosynthesis fig 6b the co occurrence of both high rates of evaporation and primary production was further promoted by high temperature and water air exposure duvert et al 2018 4 3 headwaters as an important driver on evaporation and aquatic primary production the spatial relationships of river width versus d excess and δ13cdic were convergent with increasing river width i e large variability in narrow rivers and decreasing variability as the rivers become wider figs 7 a and 7b the d excess and δ13cdic at downstream locations were largely affected by the mixing of different headwater segments hence the downstream reaches did not display the same variability as they integrate water of different sources abbott et al 2018 the complex interplay of physical chemical and biological processes in headwaters and the connecting catchments are known to cause high chemical variability in space allen et al 2018 beckman and wohl 2014 marx et al 2017 many hydrological and biogeochemical processes are related to the geometric features of streams and rivers allen et al 2018 for hydrological and biogeochemical processes the available reactive surface water area could have a primary control on spatial heterogeneity across the landscape headwaters are of particular significance for fluvial carbon dynamics and are considered as biogeochemical reactors and hotpots for various processes allen et al 2018 beckman and wohl 2014 shallow river depths induce broad reactive surface water areas in the headwater segments raymond et al 2012 which relates stream geometry to in stream processes e g evaporation co2 outgassing and photosynthesis based on the hydraulic geometry scaling theory the width and depth at all scales versus discharge show power functions raymond et al 2012 along with the increase in strahler stream order i e the flow direction allen et al 2018 the river depth becomes deeper and the available reactive surface area becomes reduced fig 7c raymond et al 2012 accordingly the available reactive surface water area is large in the headwaters which allows biogeochemical processing through high contact areas beckman and wohl 2014 headwater segments constitute large portions of the available reactive surface area within a river network the high reactive surface area promotes physical and biogeochemical processes including evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis controlled by sunlight and air exposure water flow velocity and transit time could affect evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis and relative low water flow velocity and long transit time mainly occurred in the downstream segments however the river depth is much deeper in the downstream segments which causes intense evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis in the surface water but limited processing in the bottom water therefore we suggest that the asymmetric water and dic loss are mainly attributed to the available reactive surface area at the water air interface in headwater segments which outpaces the downstream locations consistent with the results of allen et al 2018 5 conclusions and perspectives this study revealed patterns of in stream processes related to water and carbon cycling in tropical rivers the results showed that strong evaporation and photosynthesis occurred in the river network of hainan island the dic contained predominantly contemporary carbon of biological origin with a relatively minor contribution of geogenic carbon from carbonate weathering the positive relationship between δ13cdic and chl a indicates that aquatic primary production had a strong influence on dic due to the effects of reactive surface water area at the water air interface evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis co occurred in the hainan island rivers occurring mainly in the headwater segments the relationships between river width and d excess and δ13cdic were convergent and downstream mixing of the various water sources were responsible for this pattern the results of this study provide a foundation to unravel the linkage between water and carbon cycling in tropical river networks flat topography and high temperature cause intense evaporation and photosynthesis in addition we infer that rapid carbon cycling i e aquatic photosynthesis in the river networks plays an important role in global carbon cycling however it remains intractable to separate quantitatively the relative roles of co2 outgassing and photosynthesis with the current data this in turn highlights the need for detailed studies that separate the roles of co2 outgassing and photosynthesis in tropical headwater segments credit authorship contribution statement jun

16945,rivers play an important role in global water and carbon cycling but there are still large uncertainties concerning evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis here we combined measurements of water chemistry isotopic compositions i e δ d w δ 18 o w δ 13 c dic and 14 c dic and geographic characteristics i e river width to elucidate in stream hydrological and biogeochemical processes across rivers in hainan island china the results showed that dissolved inorganic carbon dic in river waters was largely of modern origin with about 95 from contemporary biogenic sources based on an isotopic mass balance of 14 c dic significant evaporation and aquatic primary production co occurred in these tropical rivers with large amounts of water and dic being rapidly turned over in the water column altering the water cycle and the carbon balance high rates of evaporation and aquatic primary production were observed in the headwater segments with narrow river width but broad available reactive surface area at the air water interface the asymmetric aquatic photosynthesis at different river segments caused the spatial heterogeneities of dissolved solutes the results suggest that the available reactive area at the water air interface is responsible for synchronous water loss and dissolved carbon evolution in flat tropical rivers this study provides evidence that intense evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis mainly occurred in headwater segments which has implications for understanding global carbon cycling graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords carbon cycling aquatic photosynthesis evaporation tropical rivers headwaters 1 introduction rivers are important not only for global material transportation meybeck 1982 and as integrators of terrestrial biogeochemical processes jenerette and lal 2005 lu et al 2014 but also as biogeochemical reactors cole et al 2007 dornblaser and striegl 2015 mayorga et al 2005 the river system works as a network for water and carbon transportation but the amount of terrestrial carbon entering rivers and the internal cycling pathways remain elusive abril and borges 2019 aufdenkampe et al 2011 cole et al 2007 wehrli 2013 only approximately one third of the continental precipitation and one sixth of the carbon exported from land reach the oceans ferguson et al 2007 wehrli 2013 in order to decipher global water and carbon cycling through river systems knowledge of in stream processes and the internal cycling mechanisms of carbon and water is necessary the spatial heterogeneity of the water cycle is recorded by changes in the isotopic compositions of water δ 18 o w and δ d w across continents dansgaard 1964 which provides potential fingerprints for exploring complex hydrological and ecological processes bailey et al 2018 hu et al 2018 thermodynamic arguments indicate that regional imbalances in precipitation p and evaporation e vary with changing global temperature bailey et al 2018 shaping the δ 18 o w and δ d w of inland waters hu et al 2018 therefore changes in δ 18 o w and δ d w can be used to quantify water sources and monitor the evaporation effect on the water cycle moreover the water cycle exerts a significant role on carbon cycling which can be ascribed to the coupling of vapor release and dissolved inorganic carbon dic processing i e photosysthesis and co2 outgassing ferguson and veizer 2007 lee and veizer 2003 zhong et al 2020a there are several sources and sinks for dic in rivers which greatly affect dic dynamics alling et al 2012 campeau et al 2017 doctor et al 2008 li et al 2010 marwick et al 2015 marx et al 2017 polsenaere and abril 2012 venkiteswaran et al 2014 zhong et al 2018 these processes cannot be identified from dic concentrations alone but the stable isotopic composition of dic δ 13 c dic offers additional information to constrain the extent of carbon losses in river networks alling et al 2012 li et al 2010 samanta et al 2015 zhong et al 2018 although there are differences in the extent of isotope fractionation between co2 outgassing and aquatic primary production the loss of dic generally leads to isotopically heavier carbon in the water column alling et al 2012 doctor et al 2008 mook et al 1974 conversely addition of dic through organic carbon oc mineralization and or input of soil respired co2 results in isotopically light carbon in areas dominated by c3 plants alling et al 2012 campeau et al 2017 li et al 2010 zhong et al 2018 however the δ 13 c signatures of different natural sources may overlap which can mask the true sources marwick et al 2015 in combination with stable carbon isotopes radiocarbon 14c adds temporal resolution allowing further understanding of carbon sources in aquatic environments marwick et al 2015 indeed radiocarbon analysis of dissolved inorganic carbon 14 c dic has been widely applied to understand sources and processes affecting dic in river systems blattmann et al 2019 lu et al 2014 marwick et al 2015 mayorga et al 2005 raymond et al 2004 together the relative changes in δ 13 c dic and 14 c dic can provide valuable fingerprints to elucidate biogeochemical processes gross primary productivity gpp is known to be an important regulator of carbon cycling in inland waters maintaining the balance between organic and inorganic carbon gao et al 2021 the gpp also affects the burial of biological oc that contributes to sequestration of atmospheric co2 working as the biological carbon pump liu et al 2017 yi et al 2021 although aquatic photosynthesis plays an important role in carbon cycling for many systems its controls remain largely unclear gao et al 2021 and references therein one of the potential controls is the geomorphology of the stream channel e g river width and depth which causes differences of available reactive surface area allen et al 2018 however the effects of geomorphology on water and carbon cycling remain elusive many studies have investigated the mechanisms underlying spatiotemporal patterns in water and carbon cycling across stream and river networks bouillon et al 2009 hu et al 2018 zhong et al 2020b however these processes have in most cases been investigated separately in this study the chemical and isotopic compositions were combined to elucidate patterns in the cycling of water and carbon in productive tropical rivers accordingly we first analyzed the hydrological and biogeochemical processes and then calculated the water loss by evaporation and the carbon assimilation through aquatic photosynthesis we were then able to link hydrological and biogeochemical processes with river width to analyze the effects of geographic characteristics thereby we generate a methodology to unravel the linkage between hydrological and carbon processes in tropical river networks 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area hainan island is located in the south china sea and is the second largest island in china with an area of 3 54 104 km2 wang and du 2016 fig 1 the climate is tropical oceanic and monsoonal with a mean annual temperature of 25 c the annual precipitation on hainan island ranges between 1200 mm and 2200 mm with an average of 1774 mm pradhan et al 2016 distinct dry november april and wet may october seasons occur with about 80 of the total precipitation falling during the latter period ma et al 2007 the lithology of the island is mainly composed of silicate rocks with extensive occurrence of basalt in the north of the island while the south of the island is characterized by granite the vegetation on the island is dominated by c3 plants herbeck et al 2011 pradhan et al 2016 2 2 sample collection and analysis we collected water samples from the rivers of hainan island during two weeks during the dry season in january 2018 samples were collected from 78 sampling sites distributed around the island fig 1 samples were collected from the shore and at a depth of 50 cm below the water surface samples were stored temporally in acid washed low density polyethylene plastic bags and filtered through 0 22 μm cellulose acetate filters within 24 h of collection water temperature t electrical conductivity ec ph and chlorophyll chl a were determined in situ with a multi parameter profiler ysi exo total alkalinity alk was determined by titration using 0 02 mol l hydrochloric acid within 24 h zhong et al 2018 the dic concentrations were calculated using mass action relationships with alk concentrations t and ph clark and fritz 1997 major cations and dissolved silicate si were subsequently measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry concentrations of dissolved organic carbon doc were determined using an aurora 1030 w toc analyzer oi analytical usa with duplicates within 1 5 which we take to represent analytical uncertainty the stable isotopic compositions of water were analyzed using a liquid water isotope analyzer picarro l2140 i usa whose values were reported relative to vienna standard mean ocean water v smow the stable isotopic compositions for oxygen and hydrogen δ18ow and δdw were reported using standard delta values δ with an uncertainty of 0 3 1σ and 1 1σ for δ18ow and δdw respectively for isotopic determinations of dic 2 ml 85 phosphoric acid was added to convert all dic to co2 which was then extracted and purified using a vacuum system and gentle stirring by a bar magnet li et al 2010 zhong et al 2018 after purification δ13cdic measurements were performed on a finnigan mat 253 plus mass spectrometer which was calibrated relative to the vienna pee dee belemnite standard with an uncertainty of 0 1 for analysis of δ14cdic the purified co2 was graphitized using the sealed tube zinc reduction method of xu et al 2007 and xu et al 2013 the δ14cdic was measured using 0 5 mv accelerator mass spectrometry dong et al 2018 where the δ 14 c d i c values were corrected for istotopic fractionation both machine and graphitization induced using the ams on line δ13c values xu et al 2007 all laboratory analyses were conducted in the institute of surface earth system sciences school of earth system science tianjin university china 2 3 theoretical background 2 3 1 evaporation estimation using the deuterium excess d excess dual isotope system method catchment water balance can be used to estimate evapotranspiration wisler and brater 1959 according to 1 e t p r δ s p where et represents evapotranspiration p is precipitation r is runoff and δ s represents the recharge by groundwater and glacier melt water although et values can be estimated from this mass balance eq 1 meaningful results require the method to be applied over a long time scale e g a full hydrological year the dual isotope system method d excess was introduced dansgaard 1964 based on the evaporation component evolved by rayleigh processes clark and fritz 1997 the d excess was deduced from the global meteoric water line gmwl and defined by dansgaard 1964 as 2 d excess δ d w 8 δ 18 o w d excess is unrelated to the stable isotopic composition of precipitation and reflects differences in humidity between evaporation and the vapor source clark and fritz 1997 li et al 2014 zhong et al 2020a the d excess in river waters reflects the degree of evaporation and low d excess values accompany an intense evaporation ratio dansgaard 1964 during the evaporation processes the water experiences rayleigh fractionation clark and fritz 1997 hu et al 2018 3 r s r 0 s f α 1 4 d e x c e s s δ 0 1000 f α 1 1000 δ d 0 1000 f α d 1 8 δ 18 o 0 1000 f α 18 o 1 7000 where rs and r0s represent the d h or 18o 16o ratios for the initial and final status respectively f is the residual fraction of water 0 represents the initial status δd0 and δ18o0 denote the initial water isotopic compositions and α is the fractionation factor between the product and the reactant α is the sum of the kinetic factor δ ε and the equilibrium fractionation factor ε 5 α ε δ ε where ε is temperature dependent t in kelvin according to 6 1 0 3 ln ε d 24 844 10 6 t 2 76 248 10 3 t 52 612 7 1 0 3 ln ε 18 o 1 137 10 6 t 2 0 4156 10 3 t 2 0667 where δ ε is determined as 8 δ ε d 12 5 1 h

accordingly the d excess method has great benefits for investigating evaporation hu et al 2018 zhong et al 2020a based on the uniform oceanic vapor source for the entire hainan island the d excess method was applied to constrain the amount of evaporation eq 4 hu et al 2018 zhong et al 2020a 2 3 2 the isotopic mass balance equation of dic in this study we used 14c values of atmospheric co2 collected at luhuitou i e 4 6 2 9 to 31 8 2 8 hainan island niu et al 2016 as the contemporary carbon end member we further assumed that carbonate rocks were 14c free and that weathering of carbonate containing minerals or bedrock would result in observed 14cdic values being lower than contemporary atmospheric co2 marwick et al 2015 mayorga et al 2005 voss et al 2017 when co2 outgassing occurs from oversaturated waters co2 transfer can be considered as uni directional alling et al 2012 as the partial pressure of carbon dioxide pco2 in all rivers of the current study was oversaturated in co2 relative to the atmosphere any invasion of atmospheric co2 to the river water was neglected mayorga et al 2005 zhong et al 2017 since 14c was fractionation corrected by δ13c co2 outgassing and primary production did not shift the 14c values of riverine dic marwick et al 2015 zeng et al 2010 because the biogenic and carbonate sources have distinct isotope ratios an isotopic mass balance equation i e a two end member model was used to constrain the contribution of each source 10 δ 14 c d i c δ 14 c b i o f b i o δ 14 c c a r b f c a r b where 14cbio and 14ccarb are the 14c values of contemporary biogenic carbon and carbonate respectively fbio and fcarb are the proportions of carbon in the bulk dic pool from contemporary biogenic and carbonate sources respectively 2 3 3 loss of dic through co2 outgassing and primary production co2 outgassing and aquatic photosynthesis cause isotopic fractionation of the river dic alling et al 2012 campeau et al 2017 li et al 2010 polsenaere and abril 2012 samanta et al 2015 venkiteswaran et al 2014 the remaining dic and δ13cdic values after co2 outgassing and primary production can be given according to 11 dic final f dic i 12 δ 13 c f i n a l δ 13 c i 10 3 α c o 2 1 l n f where dic final and dic i represent the final and initial dic concentrations respectively δ13cfinal and δ13ci are the final and initial δ13cdic values respectively the fractionation factor α co2 for co2 outgassing is temperature dependent and can be estimated using the following equation rau et al 1996 samanta et al 2015 13 α c o 2 1 23 644 9701 5 t 1000 as hco3 is the main component of dic in the rivers of hainan island due to the neutral ph zhong et al 2018 and references therein we mainly focused on the transformation of hco3 to co2 in this study co2 outgassing was likely underestimated since the fractionation between dissolved and gaseous co2 was ignored for primary production we used a α co2 of 0 976 following alling et al 2012 and samanta et al 2015 c3 plant material from hainan island has a stable carbon isotopic ratio of about 27 3 herbeck et al 2011 based on the study of pradhan et al 2016 we assumed that the δ13c of soil co2 was 21 8 on hainan island after considering an isotopic fractionation of 4 4 during co2 diffusion cerling et al 1991 3 results 3 1 water chemistry in hainan island rivers the river water temperature varied widely from 16 7 to 28 0 c during the sampling campaign across the hainan rivers table 1 the ph varied by more than two ph units across all river sites from 6 2 to 8 6 table 1 the do changed from 4 5 to 12 3 mg l with an average of 8 2 mg l table 1 the chl a concentration varied from undetectable to 24 3 μg l with an average of 4 7 μg l table 1 major ions also showed significant spatial variations from 2 9 to 18 4 mg l for ca2 1 0 to 10 9 mg l for na and 1 8 to 6 4 mg l for dissolved si table 1 the ca2 na molar ratios ranged from 0 1 to 0 9 with an average of 0 4 the si na molar ratios varied in a wide range from 0 2 to 1 8 alk ranged from 0 24 to 1 58 mmol l but the dic concentrations were much higher ranging from 0 41 to 1 85 mmol l table 1 all rivers were oversaturated in co2 with pco2 of 450 to 4140 μatm the doc concentration varied greatly ranging from 0 8 to 8 1 mg l with an average of 2 4 mg l table 1 3 2 the river water isotopic compositions of water and dic on hainan island although all the sampling sites in this study were located over a narrow altitude range i e 0 and 248 m a s l the water isotopic compositions of the rivers showed significant spatial variations ranging from 54 8 to 20 9 for δdw and from 8 5 to 3 5 for δ18ow table 1 throughout the island the d excess values varied in a wide range from 3 2 to 13 6 the δ13cdic values also varied largely from 14 1 to 5 2 with an average of 9 7 table 1 the 14cdic values ranged between 59 and 28 across the sampled rivers n 13 table 1 showing a mainly modern origin of river dic 3 3 calculation of water and dic loss in the river network of hainan island following the d excesses approach river waters were found to be highly affected by evaporation with a maximum evaporation rate of up to 38 of the riverine initial water the isotopic mass balance equation for dic eq 10 implies that the contribution of carbonate dead carbon to the dic pool was about 5 in other words about 95 of the dic was derived from contemporary biogenic sources e g c3 plants based on the sources of dic defined above the initial δ13cdic of the rivers was taken to be approximately 20 7 the δ13c values of the remaining dic would be fractionated by rayleigh distillation through co2 outgassing and primary production eq 12 in this study we estimated the river dic loss using the rayleigh fractionation model through co2 outgassing and primary production eq 11 respectively if only primary production was assumed to occur in the aquatic systems about 41 to 80 of the initial riverine dic was fixed by primary production if only co2 outgassing was considered in the rivers 19 to 45 of dic was removed by co2 outgassing 4 discussion 4 1 the carbon biogeochemical processes in river networks the dic in the rivers of hainan island was generally 13c enriched and of contemporary origin and further matched many observations made at the global scale i e 749 to 179 fig 2 a marwick et al 2015 silicate minerals are widely distributed in the study area with weathering driven by soil co2 causing biologic sourced dic mostly contemporary 14cdic values verified dominance of silicate weathering in the river basins with soil respiration being the dominant carbon source for dic voss et al 2017 the river dic concentrations on hainan island were generally lower than most global large rivers i e averaging 1 81 mmol l from gaillardet et al 1999 consistent with the relative importance of silicate weathering for dic production however carbonate minerals are characterized by rapid dissolution kinetics and trace amounts of carbonate minerals can affect the dic gaillardet et al 2019 and references therein ca2 na ratios represent the relative elemental ratio between carbonate and silicate weathering gaillardet et al 2019 zhong et al 2017 showing the mixing effects of carbonate and silicate weathering a negative relationship was observed between 14cdic and ca2 na ratios fig 2b indicating that the observed dic with 14c depleted values was supported by carbonate weathering although trace amounts of carbonate minerals occur we cannot neglect the effects of carbonate weathering on dic concentrations and isotopes multiple biogeochemical processes affect the dic pool of rivers and δ13cdic is often used to constrain aquatic carbon cycling alling et al 2012 zhong et al 2018 moreover chl a can be used as a proxy of aquatic primary production in this study δ13cdic and chl a were positively related across the rivers of hainan island fig 3 aquatic photosynthesis preferentially absorbs lighter 12c resulting in a 13c enriched dic pool alling et al 2012 meanwhile aquatic primary production generates oc which is also subsequently degraded causing the positive relationship between doc and chl a fig 4 a stedmon and markager 2005 na and si derive mainly from silicate weathering and the si na ratios largely represent the behavior of si as na can be considered conservative zhong et al 2017 after na and si are released from primary mineral dissolution si na values can be shifted by multiple si biogeochemical processes dissolved si can readily be assimilated by primary producers humborg et al 1997 and secondary mineral precipitation zhong et al 2017 both of which decrease the ratios of si na in the water column we interpret the positive relationship between doc and chl a fig 4a combined with the inverse relationship between doc and si na fig 4b as the effect of aquatic primary production the influence of aquatic primary production on the dic pool was further displayed by the positive relationship between δ13cdic and do fig 4c as do is produced during photosynthesis interpreting riverine δ13cdic solely using its direct values but without considering ph could lead to false interpretation of the carbon sources campeau et al 2017 the ph is closely connected to the speciation of dic while δ13cdic could be adjusted for the effect of ph on dic species by driving the unique δ13c value campeau et al 2017 zolkos et al 2020 there was a positive relationship between ph and δ13cdic fig 4d induced by shifting the compositions of dic species although some species of phytoplankton can use hco3 as a carbon source tortell et al 1997 co2 is regarded as the main carbon source for primary production alling et al 2012 as co2 is fixed by primary production it could induce both increasing ph and δ13cdic alling et al 2012 a relationship that was observed in the rivers of the current study fig 4d the overall effect of oc mineralization which would generate dic with δ13c values close to the source material was offset by co2 outgassing and primary production in these rivers as shown by the observed 13c enriched dic co2 outgassing requires an excess of co2 in relation to the atmosphere while primary production can fix dic during under saturated conditions hence there is a competition between primary production and co2 outgassing that can influence the carbon balance in aquatic systems demars et al 2016 the positive relationship between δ13cdic and chl a indicated that primary production was important in regulating spatial dic patterns in the current study fig 3 although it was difficult to separate the processes of co2 outgassing and primary production alling et al 2012 we believe that primary production has a dominant control on dic dynamics in these tropical rivers based on the high chl a concentrations observed in this study 4 2 co occurring evaporation and primary production in river networks river water evaporation and aquatic primary production co occurred in the hainan island rivers which was evident from the negative relationship between d excess and chl a fig 5 the availability and transport of water throughout the river network mediates the biogeochemical processing of carbon directly and indirectly jenerette and lal 2005 hydrological processes directly mediate the river carbon pool by controlling the mobilization of different carbon sources and through evaporation that cause enrichment of the river carbon concentrations jenerette and lal 2005 zhong et al 2018 2020a in addition to the direct influences carbon processing varies substantially in response to hydrological changes jenerette and lal 2005 carbon fixation by aquatic photosynthesis showed high spatial heterogeneity likely due to the variable light availability and water residence time across the river network yi et al 2021 consequently changes in water evaporation co occurred with changes in aquatic photosynthesis across the hainan island river networks during primary production some of the dic will be assimilated and converted into oc alling et al 2012 and hence there was a negative power law relationship between d excess and doc fig 6 a likewise a positive correlation was displayed between d excess and si na which was affected by aquatic photosynthesis fig 6b the co occurrence of both high rates of evaporation and primary production was further promoted by high temperature and water air exposure duvert et al 2018 4 3 headwaters as an important driver on evaporation and aquatic primary production the spatial relationships of river width versus d excess and δ13cdic were convergent with increasing river width i e large variability in narrow rivers and decreasing variability as the rivers become wider figs 7 a and 7b the d excess and δ13cdic at downstream locations were largely affected by the mixing of different headwater segments hence the downstream reaches did not display the same variability as they integrate water of different sources abbott et al 2018 the complex interplay of physical chemical and biological processes in headwaters and the connecting catchments are known to cause high chemical variability in space allen et al 2018 beckman and wohl 2014 marx et al 2017 many hydrological and biogeochemical processes are related to the geometric features of streams and rivers allen et al 2018 for hydrological and biogeochemical processes the available reactive surface water area could have a primary control on spatial heterogeneity across the landscape headwaters are of particular significance for fluvial carbon dynamics and are considered as biogeochemical reactors and hotpots for various processes allen et al 2018 beckman and wohl 2014 shallow river depths induce broad reactive surface water areas in the headwater segments raymond et al 2012 which relates stream geometry to in stream processes e g evaporation co2 outgassing and photosynthesis based on the hydraulic geometry scaling theory the width and depth at all scales versus discharge show power functions raymond et al 2012 along with the increase in strahler stream order i e the flow direction allen et al 2018 the river depth becomes deeper and the available reactive surface area becomes reduced fig 7c raymond et al 2012 accordingly the available reactive surface water area is large in the headwaters which allows biogeochemical processing through high contact areas beckman and wohl 2014 headwater segments constitute large portions of the available reactive surface area within a river network the high reactive surface area promotes physical and biogeochemical processes including evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis controlled by sunlight and air exposure water flow velocity and transit time could affect evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis and relative low water flow velocity and long transit time mainly occurred in the downstream segments however the river depth is much deeper in the downstream segments which causes intense evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis in the surface water but limited processing in the bottom water therefore we suggest that the asymmetric water and dic loss are mainly attributed to the available reactive surface area at the water air interface in headwater segments which outpaces the downstream locations consistent with the results of allen et al 2018 5 conclusions and perspectives this study revealed patterns of in stream processes related to water and carbon cycling in tropical rivers the results showed that strong evaporation and photosynthesis occurred in the river network of hainan island the dic contained predominantly contemporary carbon of biological origin with a relatively minor contribution of geogenic carbon from carbonate weathering the positive relationship between δ13cdic and chl a indicates that aquatic primary production had a strong influence on dic due to the effects of reactive surface water area at the water air interface evaporation and aquatic photosynthesis co occurred in the hainan island rivers occurring mainly in the headwater segments the relationships between river width and d excess and δ13cdic were convergent and downstream mixing of the various water sources were responsible for this pattern the results of this study provide a foundation to unravel the linkage between water and carbon cycling in tropical river networks flat topography and high temperature cause intense evaporation and photosynthesis in addition we infer that rapid carbon cycling i e aquatic photosynthesis in the river networks plays an important role in global carbon cycling however it remains intractable to separate quantitatively the relative roles of co2 outgassing and photosynthesis with the current data this in turn highlights the need for detailed studies that separate the roles of co2 outgassing and photosynthesis in tropical headwater segments credit authorship contribution statement jun

16946,the optimal operation and functional stability of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp strongly depend on the properties of its microbial community however a knowledge gap remains regarding the seasonal dynamics of microbial community properties especially phylogenetic group based assembly and co occurrence patterns accordingly in this study influent and activated sludge as samples were weekly collected from 2 full scale wwtps for one year 89 influent and 103 as samples in total and examined by high throughput illumina miseq sequencing the results suggested that the microbial community diversity and composition in the influent fluctuated substantially with season while those in the as had a relatively more stable pattern throughout the year the phylogenetic group based assembly mechanisms of as community were identified by using infer community assembly mechanisms by phylogenetic bin based null model icamp the results showed that drift accounted for the largest proportion 52 8 while homogeneous selection 18 2 was the most important deterministic process deterministic processes dominated in 47 microbial groups bins which were also found 40 in the as core taxa dataset moreover the results suggested that nitrospira were more susceptible to stochastic processes in winter which may provide a possible explanation for nitrification failure in winter network analysis results suggested that the network structure of the as community could be more stable in summer and autumn in addition there were no identical keystone taxa found in different networks constructed from different plants sources and seasons which supported the context dependency theory the results of this study deepened our understanding of the microbial ecology in as systems and provided a foundation for further studies on the community regulation strategy of wwtps graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial community assembly wastewater treatment plant seasonal dynamic 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps which mostly use the activated sludge as process play a critical role in the protection of our environment and human health ju and zhang 2015 as harbors a highly complex microbial community and heavily relies on it for the degradation of organic matter nutrient removal and wastewater detoxification wagner and loy 2002 thus the functional stability of wwtps depends largely on the microbial community in as wagner and loy 2002 falk song et al 2009 griffin and wells 2017 zhang et al 2020 previous studies have revealed the repeated and predictable seasonal patterns of microbial community in natural ecosystems such as lakes shade et al 2007 and oceans fuhrman et al 2006 for wwtps the seasonality of the microbial community in as has attracted the interest of environmental microbiologists griffin and wells 2017 johnston and behrens 2020 petrovski et al 2020 previously some researchers performed long term studies on the dynamics of microbial community structure in as systems by using different types of conventional molecular tools for example by using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp successive shifts in as bacterial community structure were revealed through a weekly sampling campaign for one year wells et al 2011 and flowers et al used automated ribosomal intergenic spacer region analysis arisa to investigate the repeated seasonal pattern of overall community succession in an enhanced biological phosphorus removal plant throughout a two year sampling study flowers cadkin et al 2013 however given limitations due to pcr bias or low throughput the taxonomic information and microbial community diversity could be underestimated in recent years the high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna amplicons has greatly deepened our understanding of microbial community dynamics in as a previous study indicated that seasonal variation had a stronger impact on the as bacterial community than any other variation zhang et al 2018 temperature and dietary habits could be the most important factors leading to community dynamics ju et al 2014 petrovski et al 2020 in addition the dynamics of some key functional groups such as nitrifying bacteria were thoroughly investigated in a 55 week sampling campaign johnston et al 2019 moreover jiang et al highlighted the importance of biotic associations in controlling the bacterial communities in as jiang et al 2018a and they captured the high resolution overall view of community dynamics especially the bacteria involved in sludge bulking and foaming by using a long term and intensively sampled dataset jiang et al 2018b these studies revealed the detailed dynamic patterns of microbial diversity and community composition in the as system which provided a sound foundation for us to explore the dynamics of as community assembly mechanisms and co occurrence patterns the study of co occurrence patterns will provide us with new insight into the as system and improve our understanding of the microbial community beyond those with simple diversity and composition jiang et al 2018b shi et al 2016 deng et al 2012 regarding community assembly mechanisms there have been intensive debates about this longstanding issue tilman 2004 ning et al 2020 at present it is generally accepted that both deterministic processes including homogeneous selection and heterogeneous selection and stochastic processes including homogenizing dispersal dispersal limitation and drift contribute to the assembly of the as microbial community wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however some studies have reported contrasting results regarding the relative importance of these processes in controlling as community assembly griffin et al monitored six as bioreactors for 1 year and found that the communities were highly synchronized at the individual otu broad phylogenetic affiliation and community wide scale temperature was the most important driver of the variations in alpha and beta diversity thus they indicated that the communities were highly controlled by deterministic processes griffin and wells 2017 a similar reactor synchrony was found by johnston et al johnston et al 2019 however recent global survey data wu et al 2019 indicated that stochastic processes were more important in as community assembly which was consistent with our previous findings in china zhang et al 2020 sun et al 2020 in addition previous studies have had major limitations because the assembly mechanisms were evaluated at the whole community level however it was indicated that the actions of the assembly processes were typically at the genotype or population level rather than at the whole community level ofiteru et al 2010 ning et al 2020 different microorganisms respond differently to environmental changes such as temperature srt and biodegradability zhang et al 2020 sun et al 2020 johnston and behrens 2020 thus it is reasonable to assume that different microorganism groups in as would possess differentiated assembly mechanisms however as only a few studies focus on this topic there is still a knowledge gap remains regarding the phylogenetic group based as assembly mechanisms recently ning et al proposed a new framework named infer community assembly mechanisms by phylogenetic bin based null model icamp which considers assembly mechanisms at the level of individual taxa lineages rather than the whole community ning et al 2020 icamp showed high accuracy and sensitivity on a simulated community and it showed high effectiveness and robustness in grassland microbial communities ning et al 2020 this framework provides us with a powerful tool to investigate the assembly mechanisms of different microorganism groups in the as system in this study influent and as samples were weekly collected from two full scale wwtps for one year 89 influent and 103 as samples in total high throughput 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing and multiple bioinformatics methods were used to reveal the seasonal dynamics of microbial community diversity composition phylogenetic group based assembly and co occurrence patterns this study will help to deepen our understanding of the microbial ecology in as systems and it provides a foundation for further studies on the community regulation strategy of wwtps 2

bxh and different sources influent and as these groups were abbreviated as 1 samples from the influent of gbd in different seasons gbd inf spr gbd inf sum gbd inf aut and gbd inf win 2 samples from the activated sludge of gbd in different seasons gbd as spr gbd as sum gbd as aut and gbd as win 3 samples from the influent of bxh in different seasons bxh inf spr bxh inf sum bxh inf aut and bxh inf win and 4 samples from the activated sludge of bxh in different seasons bxh as spr bxh as sum bxh as aut and bxh as win permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test the differences among groups richness shannon wiener h and inverse simpson indices were used to evaluate the alpha diversity of the microbial communities pielou s j index was used to investigate the evenness of the microbial communities to identify the seasonal community succession patterns the relative abundance data of all samples were ordinated by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis with bray curtis distance the microbial community composition was visualized by circos krzywinski et al 2009 the diversity indices nmds dissimilarity matrix and mantel test were performed in r version 3 4 4 using the vegan package dixon 2003 version 3 2 the infer community assembly mechanisms by phylogenetic bin based null model icamp was used to investigate the assembly mechanisms of different microorganism groups ning et al 2020 the r code for icamp was available as an open source r package icamp which can be downloaded from the comprehensive r archive network cran https cran r project org and the custom scripts for icamp were available from github https github com daliangning icamp1 by using icamp five assembly mechanisms of different microorganism groups called bins were identified including homogeneous selection hos heterogeneous selection hes dispersal limitation dl homogenizing dispersal hd and drift dr a detailed explanation of these mechanisms can be found in a previous study zhou and ning 2017 besides the seasonality induced changes in hos and dr were investigated in this study and a change was defined as a positive value if the relative contribution of hos or dr was higher in summer than in winter microbial ecological networks were constructed by using the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline menap http ieg2 ou edu mena to reveal the possible co occurrence patterns among microorganisms zhou et al 2010 deng et al 2012 during the network construction procedure only those otus detected in more than 85 of the samples were kept to eliminate unrepresentative otus and reduce complexity to identify the keystone taxa the following simplified classification was established i peripheral nodes zi 2 5 pi 0 62 i e zi indicates within module connectivities and pi indicates among module connectivities which possessed only a few links that were almost always associated with nodes within their modules ii connectors zi 2 5 pi 0 62 which were highly connected to several modules iii module hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 which were highly connected to numerous microbes in their own modules and iv network hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 which acted as both module hubs and connectors for each network 100 corresponding random networks were generated with the same network size and average number of links the z test was then used to investigate the differences in the topological parameters between the constructed networks and the random networks to ensure that the ecological networks were non random 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal dynamics of microbial community diversity it was demonstrated that the functions and stability of wastewater treatment systems were determined by the diversity and composition of as communities jousset et al 2017 and wwtps with higher alpha diversity could be more stable sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 to determine how the alpha diversity of as and influent communities changed across seasons key diversity indices of these samples including richness shannon wiener index h pielou s evenness index j and inverse simpson s index were calculated to reveal their seasonal dynamic patterns as shown in fig 1 richness represented the number of observed species and ranged from 904 gbd inf spr to 5606 gbd inf aut in these samples the shannon wiener index considering both the richness and relative abundance of each species varied from 2 90 bxh inf spr to 7 32 gbd inf aut in these time series samples besides the pielou s evenness index ranged from 0 40 bxh inf spr to 0 85 gbd inf aut and the inverse simpson diversity index varied from 3 46 bxh inf spr to 284 53 bxh inf spr the results showed that the microbial diversity of influent samples fluctuated dramatically across time points moreover the maximum and minimum values of each index all appeared in influent samples for example the maximum and minimum values of the inverse simpson diversity index all occurred in bxh spring influent samples this result was not surprising because the characteristics of influent wastewater are related to people s living habits such as eating habits and shower frequency and production activities in different seasons which are not subject to artificial control and fluctuate frequently martin and vanrolleghem 2014 chen et al 2019 petrovski et al 2020 thus the microbial community could be affected by dramatic changes in substrates such as cod mantel test r 0 205 p 0 001 and nitrate n mantel test r 0 509 p 0 001 while in as samples the microbial diversity was relatively stable in different seasons here the wwtps performance was also determined as shown in figures s1 s3 the system performance was relatively stable in terms of cod ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen removal and almost all of the effluent quality indices met the discharge standard during the sampling period the performance of these two full scale wwtps was generally stable throughout the year which may partially be attributed to the relatively stable microbial diversity in as however the diversity of the as community in summer was still significantly higher than that in winter t test gbd p 0 01 bxh p 0 05 previous studies indicated that temperature was an important driver of repeatable seasonal alpha diversity patterns accompanied by population synchrony and shifts in broad phylogenetic abundance flowers cad kin et al 2013 griffin and wells 2017 in this study a similar sinusoidal temperature pattern was also observed figure s4 therefore the significant difference in as microbial diversity between summer and winter could be at least partly attributed to the changes in temperature mantel test r 0 289 p 0 001 collectively these results suggested that the microbial diversity in the influent fluctuated substantially with season while as had a relatively more stable diversity pattern throughout the year 3 2 seasonal dynamics of microbial community composition to better understand the structure of microbial community the taxonomic affiliation at the phylum or class for proteobacteria level was visualized by circos fig 2 figure s5 7 firmicutes bacteroidetes beta gamma and epsilon proteobacteria were the most dominant phyla or classes in the influent samples in addition the composition of influent communities varied greatly in different seasons which may be attributed to sharp fluctuations in the influent characteristics martin and vanrolleghem 2014 zheng et al 2019 petrovski et al 2020 in the as community the composition was more seasonally stable than that in the influent community consistent with previous studies xia et al 2018 sun et al 2020 the most dominant phyla or classes in the as community were alpha beta gamma delta proteobacteria actinobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae and planctomycetes however even though the composition of as community was similar in different seasons the results of permanova suggested significant p 0 001 differences among them as shown in table s3 there were significant differences among almost all groups except for some influent groups p 0 05 the results suggested that the as community might have seasonal succession patterns therefore to explore the overall community dynamics the community data were ordinated by nmds as shown in fig 3 all samples were clearly clustered into four groups gbd influent gbd activated sludge bxh influent and bxh activated sludge the results showed that there were significant differences between the influent and as communities moreover the distance between gbd inf and bxh inf was closer than that of gbd as and bxh as indicating that the difference between the as community was greater than that of the influent community which could be related to the different wastewater treatment processes in addition there were no seasonal succession patterns in influent communities but a continual succession was found i e the continuous variation of influent samples in the nmds figure which could be attributed to the irregular changes in influent characteristics while in as communities a clear seasonal succession pattern of microbial community structure was found i e the communities from spring and winter were closer in the nmds figure which was due to the similar organic and nutrient removal functions performed by the as systems throughout the year as indicated by previous studies seasonal variation would only shift the microbial community structures but not enough to change the functional genes griffin and wells 2017 liu et al 2019 besides as one of the most important factors influencing the community structure temperature p 0 001 was more similar in winter and spring figure s4 thus it was reasonable that as communities exhibited seasonal succession patterns to understand which microorganisms were responsible for the differences in the seasonal as community the top 50 dominant genera accounting for 20 8 73 7 of the relative abundance were investigated besides their putative functions were identified by using the midas 3 database nierychlo et al 2020 as shown in figure s8 the abundance of some genera was significantly different among seasons for example for the top 15 genera the abundances of ferruginibacter p 0 001 nitrospira p 0 001 dechloromonas p 0 001 zoogloea p 0 01 aridibacter p 0 001 phaeodactylibacter p 0 001 and gemmobacter p 0 001 were significantly different between summer and winter whereas terrimonas dokdonella nitrosomonas chryseolinea lewinella arenimonas comamonas and gp4 had no significant differences the in situ physiology of ferruginibacter in activated sludge has not been determined nierychlo et al 2020 and aridibacter were reported to metabolize a variety of monomeric sugars organic acids and complex proteinaceous substrates in wastewater nierychlo et al 2020 nitrospira are considered to be the most common and abundant nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in wwtps daims et al 2001 and dechloromonas are able to assimilate vfas with nitrite as the electron acceptor under anoxic conditions playing a role in denitrification ginige keller et al 2005 mcilroy et al 2016 however even though the abundance of nitrospira and dechloromonas was significantly different between seasons the nitrogen removal performance of full scale wwtps was relatively stable throughout the year figure s3 indicating that there might have been nitrogen removal functional redundancy in the system besides zoogloea were the abundant denitrifier in as system and its overgrowth suggested the occurrence of non viscous bulking larsen et al 2008 therefore the significantly higher abundance of zoogloea may suggest higher risks of sludge bulking in winter in summary the results here revealed the dominant phyla or classes in influent and as samples the seasonal succession patterns of as community and the seasonal dynamics of dominant genera in as samples 3 3 assembly mechanisms across different phylogenetic groups in as given that the microbial diversity and community composition were seasonally dynamic we further investigated the driving forces that shaped the community structure i e the community assembly mechanisms the community assembly mechanism is one of the most compelling questions in ecology and it is the theoretical basis for regulation of the as community via the operational parameters of wwtps zhou and ning 2017 zhang et al 2020 ning et al 2020 previous studies have indicated that assembly mechanisms mainly include deterministic and stochastic processes the deterministic processes were divided into homogeneous selection hos and heterogeneous selection hes while the stochastic processes included dispersal limitation dl homogenizing dispersal hd and drift dr zhou and ning 2017 the whole community based as assembly mechanism studies have demonstrated some controversy especially in answering the question of whether deterministic or stochastic processes are predominant and based on these controversial results griffin and wells 2017 johnston et al 2019 wu et al 2019 we hypothesized that some phylogenetic groups were under strong selection whereas others could be under strong drift however this type of difference cannot be discerned by whole community based metrics in this study the assembly mechanisms of different microorganism groups called bins in as were investigated by using our newly developed tool icamp ning et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to distinguish the assembly mechanisms of different microorganisms in as the 33 411 observed otus were divided into 337 phylogenetic bins and the assembly mechanisms of these bins were shown in fig 4 more detailed information can be found in supplementary 2 overall drift accounted for the largest proportion of the assembly mechanisms dr 52 8 followed by dispersal limitation dl 22 1 and homogeneous selection hos 18 2 while homogenizing dispersal hd 5 3 and heterogeneous selection hes 1 6 accounted for smaller proportions the deterministic processes dominated in 47 bins 13 9 of the bin numbers and 36 3 of the relative abundance and the stochastic processes dominated in 290 bins 86 1 of the bin numbers and 63 7 of the relative abundance drift was found to be the most important stochastic process and is referred to as an inherent stochastic process encompassing birth death and reproduction zhou and ning 2017 the results indicated the importance of stochastic processes in shaping the as microbial community with an average stochasticity of approximately 75 and this value was very similar to the global survey data published by the global water microbiome consortium wu et al 2019 we further investigated these stochastic predominant bins most of them were affiliated to proteobacteria 37 2 mainly alpha beta gamma and delta proteobacteria firmicutes 12 1 bacteroidetes 10 0 actinobacteria 7 2 and acidobacteria 4 5 wwtps are inherently open systems ofiteru et al 2010 that continuously receive wastewater which favors microorganism immigration from the influent influent is an important source for the as community mclellan et al 2010 zheng and wen 2019 and some non growing bacteria which entering the system with influent may also had influence on the as community as previously demonstrated for anaerobic digesters in wwtps jiang et al 2021 thus it is not surprising that so many phylogenetic groups in as were primarily influenced by stochastic processes many long term studies have found that the community structure is affected by short term appeared otus called transient intermediate taxa jiang et al 2018b johnston et al 2019 zheng and wen 2019 we speculated that these short term appeared otus were mainly influenced by stochastic processes however more data are needed to support this hypothesis deterministic processes mainly homogeneous selection were predominant in 47 bins homogeneous selection refers to selection under homogeneous abiotic and biotic environmental conditions leading to more similar structures among communities zhou and ning 2017 the results here indicated that these bins were selected under the selection pressure of wwtps the taxonomic information of these 47 bins was summarized in table s4 overall they were mostly affiliated to actinobacteria alpha proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and nitrospirae then the putative functions of these bins were identified by the midas 3 database nierychlo et al 2020 as shown in fig 5 most of them 22 out of 47 were aerobic heterotrophs indicating that they may play an important role in organic degradation and nutrient removal chemoautotrophs or mixtrophs were also observed seven out of 47 bins were identified as positive or variable for nitrite reduction indicating that they were putative denitrifiers nierychlo et al 2020 nob phosphorus accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao were also observed in these deterministic predominant bins however there were very few of them as shown in fig 5 most metabolic properties of these bins were not assessed we believe that these microorganism groups which can be selected by the deterministic processes in wwtps are of great significance and may be the basis for future regulation of activated sludge communities further researches are needed to identify their functions based on the frequency and relative abundance the core taxa in as have been studied on spatial saunders et al 2016 wu et al 2019 or temporal scales griffin and wells 2017 jiang et al 2018a however some inconsistencies still exist twenty eight otus were defined as the core bacterial community in our previous global survey in which nitrospira was the most important nob wu et al 2019 nonetheless a recently published study found that there were no members of the genus nitrospira in the studied system and the authors extended the definition of the core microbiome johnston and behrens 2020 to some extent the definition of core taxa was plant specific besides a previous study suggested that there should be no shared taxa between wwtps if the sampling period was long enough jiang et al 2018a nevertheless we still hypothesized that there were core taxa in wwtps considering that the wwtps performed similar nutrient removal functions anywhere and at any time moreover we further hypothesized that the assembly mechanisms of these core taxa should be deterministically dominated in this way they can exist under the selection pressure of wwtps to test this hypothesis two local core taxa datasets were collated as shown in table s5 the dataset 1 contains 29 core taxa relative abundance 0 1 and frequency 80 of our large scale spatial as samples zhang et al 2020 and temporal as samples this study from china dataset 2 contains the core taxa 28 otus of our previous global survey wu et al 2019 as shown in fig 5 19 out of 47 40 deterministic dominated bins were found in core taxa dataset 1 or 2 in addition 14 out of 47 bins were found in dataset 1 and 8 out of 47 bins were found in dataset 2 there were 3 bins found in both dataset 1 and 2 bin 248 bin 285 and bin 289 and their taxonomic information was summarized in table s4 bin 248 was identified as nitrospira which is considered to be the most common and abundant nob in wwtps nierychlo et al 2020 bin 285 was identified as dokdonella which is only known as an aerobic heterotroph and its in situ functions have not been studied nierychlo et al 2020 bin 289 was identified as sideroxydans affiliated to family comamonadaceae which is little known to us on the whole the results here suggested that approximately 40 of the deterministic dominated bins were the core taxa in wwtps and they might contribute to as functions future studies are needed to investigate whether and how we can use these bins to regulate the as community and functions of wwtps as mentioned above hos was the main contributor to deterministic processes while dr accounted for the largest proportion of stochastic processes thus as shown in fig 4 c and d we further investigated the seasonal changes in hos and dr overall the hos and dr process were significantly different between summer and winter t test p 0 001 there were 136 out of 337 bins that had higher dr in winter than summer the negative outer value in figure while 134 out of 337 bins showed higher hos in summer the positive inner value in figure previous studies have revealed that seasonality significantly influences the microbial diversity and community composition in as and in this study the results suggested that the assembly mechanisms were also affected by seasonality it is worth noting that nitrospira showed a lower hos in winter and the seasonality induced change in hos was 25 7 the results suggested that nitrospira were more susceptible to stochastic processes in winter which may affect population abundance considering that nitrification failure mainly occurs in winter johnston et al 2019 the results here may provide a possible explanation from the assembly mechanism perspective 3 4 seasonal dynamics of microbial co occurrence patterns as one of the deterministic processes microbial co occurrence patterns were reported to be the most important driver shaping community assembly ju and zhang 2015 accordingly 16 networks were constructed with the same threshold value of 0 990 it was suggested that the network structures were non random and unlikely to appear due to chance as indicated by the significant differences between empirical networks and their 100 corresponding random networks which had identical network sizes and average number of links table s6 s21 as shown in fig 6 tables 1 and 2 the influent networks differed greatly from the as networks especially in spring and winter influent assemblages formed larger networks with more nodes and links than as networks which increased the density of connections in the influent community and created more complex network patterns moreover the topological parameters of the influent networks tables 1 2 changed dramatically compared to those of the as networks studies have indicated that nutrients are important drivers of network structures in microbiological systems foster et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 therefore changes in environmental conditions such as cod concentration can contribute to the dynamics of network structure considering that the influent cod concentration varied greatly in different seasons figure s1 it is not difficult to understand that the structure of influent networks also changed greatly with the seasons the as networks had more stable seasonal topological parameters over time than the influent networks tables 1 and 2 which may be related to the stable function of the as community over time interestingly the network had smaller but more numerous modules in summer and autumn and more complex modules in spring and winter fig 6 in networks a module is a group of otus that are highly self connected but has much fewer connections with otus outside the group deng et al 2012 previous studies indicated that microbes within the same module may perform similar functions from the perspective of network topological structure more small modules could make the network more stable if they could work simultaneously deng et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the results were reasonable given that nutrients were important drivers of network structures shi et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 the seasonal patterns of as network modules could be a result of varying cod concentrations i e nutrients across the sampling time in fact our results indicated that the cod concentrations of gbd p 0 01 and bxh p 0 02 were significantly higher in spring and winter than in summer and autumn thus these variations may induce more complex network structures in spring and winter altogether the results here reported the undocumented seasonal dynamics of network topological parameters of long term intensively sampled influent and as community from full scale wwtps and demonstrated that the as network structures could be more stable in summer and autumn different nodes played distinct roles in the network developed from microbial abundance data previous studies indicated that keystone taxa possess disproportionately more important roles in maintaining network structure than other microorganisms in a network and the disappearance of these putative keystone taxa may cause networks to disassemble shi et al 2016 faust and raes 2012 as shown in fig 7 some otus were identified as module hubs or connectors in these ecological networks briefly most of these keystone taxa were affiliated to proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes more detailed taxonomic information was listed in table s22 we found that only two identified keystone taxa repeatedly appeared and no taxa acted as either a module hub or connector in different networks as the environmental conditions changed over time these results support the context dependency theory power et al 1996 which means that the keystone taxa can only play crucial roles under certain environmental conditions besides the as system is considered to be a highly functional redundant system vuono et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 thus different microorganisms may play the same ecological role over time which may explain the unique keystone taxa detected in different as networks interestingly we found that the shannon wiener index was significantly negatively correlated with network connectivity links in both influent and as samples figure s9 we assume that the lower temperature could act as a strong environmental filter for community assembly thus in spring and winter lower temperature would promote the development of niches populated by dominant microorganisms which would lead to decreased diversity and more complex co occurrence patterns over time due to shared niches the negatively correlated relationship between diversity and network connectivity highlights the significance of investigating co occurrence among microorganisms as they are important dimensions of community organization uncaptured by univariate diversity metrics shi et al 2016 zhou et al 2010 4 conclusion the analysis of the microbial community of 89 influent and 103 as time series samples from two full scale wwtps led to the following conclusions the microbial community diversity and composition in the influent fluctuated substantially with season while those in the as had a relatively more stable pattern throughout the year firmicutes bacteroidetes beta gamma and epsilon proteobacteria were the most dominant phyla or classes in influent samples while alpha beta gamma delta proteobacteria actinobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi and nitrospirae predominated in as samples drift accounted for the largest proportion of the phylogenetic group based assembly mechanisms 52 8 while homogeneous selection 18 2 was the most important deterministic process deterministic processes dominated in 47 microbial groups bins which were also found 40 in the as core taxa dataset moreover the results suggested that nitrospira were more susceptible to stochastic processes in winter which may provide a possible explanation for nitrification failure in winter in addition network analysis results suggested that the network structure of the as community could be more stable in summer and autumn there were no identical keystone taxa found in different networks which supported the context dependency theory network complexity was negatively correlated with diversity indicating that community organization was not captured by univariate diversity metrics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

16946,the optimal operation and functional stability of a wastewater treatment plant wwtp strongly depend on the properties of its microbial community however a knowledge gap remains regarding the seasonal dynamics of microbial community properties especially phylogenetic group based assembly and co occurrence patterns accordingly in this study influent and activated sludge as samples were weekly collected from 2 full scale wwtps for one year 89 influent and 103 as samples in total and examined by high throughput illumina miseq sequencing the results suggested that the microbial community diversity and composition in the influent fluctuated substantially with season while those in the as had a relatively more stable pattern throughout the year the phylogenetic group based assembly mechanisms of as community were identified by using infer community assembly mechanisms by phylogenetic bin based null model icamp the results showed that drift accounted for the largest proportion 52 8 while homogeneous selection 18 2 was the most important deterministic process deterministic processes dominated in 47 microbial groups bins which were also found 40 in the as core taxa dataset moreover the results suggested that nitrospira were more susceptible to stochastic processes in winter which may provide a possible explanation for nitrification failure in winter network analysis results suggested that the network structure of the as community could be more stable in summer and autumn in addition there were no identical keystone taxa found in different networks constructed from different plants sources and seasons which supported the context dependency theory the results of this study deepened our understanding of the microbial ecology in as systems and provided a foundation for further studies on the community regulation strategy of wwtps graphic abstract image graphical abstract keywords microbial community assembly wastewater treatment plant seasonal dynamic 1 introduction wastewater treatment plants wwtps which mostly use the activated sludge as process play a critical role in the protection of our environment and human health ju and zhang 2015 as harbors a highly complex microbial community and heavily relies on it for the degradation of organic matter nutrient removal and wastewater detoxification wagner and loy 2002 thus the functional stability of wwtps depends largely on the microbial community in as wagner and loy 2002 falk song et al 2009 griffin and wells 2017 zhang et al 2020 previous studies have revealed the repeated and predictable seasonal patterns of microbial community in natural ecosystems such as lakes shade et al 2007 and oceans fuhrman et al 2006 for wwtps the seasonality of the microbial community in as has attracted the interest of environmental microbiologists griffin and wells 2017 johnston and behrens 2020 petrovski et al 2020 previously some researchers performed long term studies on the dynamics of microbial community structure in as systems by using different types of conventional molecular tools for example by using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism t rflp successive shifts in as bacterial community structure were revealed through a weekly sampling campaign for one year wells et al 2011 and flowers et al used automated ribosomal intergenic spacer region analysis arisa to investigate the repeated seasonal pattern of overall community succession in an enhanced biological phosphorus removal plant throughout a two year sampling study flowers cadkin et al 2013 however given limitations due to pcr bias or low throughput the taxonomic information and microbial community diversity could be underestimated in recent years the high throughput sequencing of 16s rrna amplicons has greatly deepened our understanding of microbial community dynamics in as a previous study indicated that seasonal variation had a stronger impact on the as bacterial community than any other variation zhang et al 2018 temperature and dietary habits could be the most important factors leading to community dynamics ju et al 2014 petrovski et al 2020 in addition the dynamics of some key functional groups such as nitrifying bacteria were thoroughly investigated in a 55 week sampling campaign johnston et al 2019 moreover jiang et al highlighted the importance of biotic associations in controlling the bacterial communities in as jiang et al 2018a and they captured the high resolution overall view of community dynamics especially the bacteria involved in sludge bulking and foaming by using a long term and intensively sampled dataset jiang et al 2018b these studies revealed the detailed dynamic patterns of microbial diversity and community composition in the as system which provided a sound foundation for us to explore the dynamics of as community assembly mechanisms and co occurrence patterns the study of co occurrence patterns will provide us with new insight into the as system and improve our understanding of the microbial community beyond those with simple diversity and composition jiang et al 2018b shi et al 2016 deng et al 2012 regarding community assembly mechanisms there have been intensive debates about this longstanding issue tilman 2004 ning et al 2020 at present it is generally accepted that both deterministic processes including homogeneous selection and heterogeneous selection and stochastic processes including homogenizing dispersal dispersal limitation and drift contribute to the assembly of the as microbial community wu et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 however some studies have reported contrasting results regarding the relative importance of these processes in controlling as community assembly griffin et al monitored six as bioreactors for 1 year and found that the communities were highly synchronized at the individual otu broad phylogenetic affiliation and community wide scale temperature was the most important driver of the variations in alpha and beta diversity thus they indicated that the communities were highly controlled by deterministic processes griffin and wells 2017 a similar reactor synchrony was found by johnston et al johnston et al 2019 however recent global survey data wu et al 2019 indicated that stochastic processes were more important in as community assembly which was consistent with our previous findings in china zhang et al 2020 sun et al 2020 in addition previous studies have had major limitations because the assembly mechanisms were evaluated at the whole community level however it was indicated that the actions of the assembly processes were typically at the genotype or population level rather than at the whole community level ofiteru et al 2010 ning et al 2020 different microorganisms respond differently to environmental changes such as temperature srt and biodegradability zhang et al 2020 sun et al 2020 johnston and behrens 2020 thus it is reasonable to assume that different microorganism groups in as would possess differentiated assembly mechanisms however as only a few studies focus on this topic there is still a knowledge gap remains regarding the phylogenetic group based as assembly mechanisms recently ning et al proposed a new framework named infer community assembly mechanisms by phylogenetic bin based null model icamp which considers assembly mechanisms at the level of individual taxa lineages rather than the whole community ning et al 2020 icamp showed high accuracy and sensitivity on a simulated community and it showed high effectiveness and robustness in grassland microbial communities ning et al 2020 this framework provides us with a powerful tool to investigate the assembly mechanisms of different microorganism

amplicon sequencing and multiple bioinformatics methods were used to reveal the seasonal dynamics of microbial community diversity composition phylogenetic group based assembly and co occurrence patterns this study will help to deepen our understanding of the microbial ecology in as systems and it provides a foundation for further studies on the community regulation strategy of wwtps 2 materials and methods 2 1 wwtps and sampling influent and as samples were collected between january 2015 and january 2016 from two full scale wwtps abbreviated as gbd and bxh in beijing china gbd

combined as a single time point as sample temperature ph conductivity and dissolved oxygen do of the influent and as samples were determined in situ by using a multi parameter water quality measuring

analysis pipeline http ieg3 rccc ou edu 8081 the detailed sequence processing procedure was summarized in text s2 after assembling and quality filtering a total of 9 151 618 high quality sequences were obtained from the whole sequencing dataset which were clustered into 33 411 operational taxonomic units otus to reduce errors and perform a relatively fair comparison among all samples the sequence number in each sample was rarefied to the same depth 30 000 sequences per sample except for four samples 2 influent samples and 2 as samples for these four samples unrarefied sequences were retained table s2 all 192 samples were divided into 16 groups based on different seasons spring march may summer june august autumn september november winter december february different plants gbd and bxh and different sources influent and as these groups were abbreviated as 1 samples from the influent of gbd in different seasons gbd inf spr gbd inf sum gbd inf aut and gbd inf win 2 samples from the activated sludge of gbd in different seasons gbd as spr gbd as sum gbd as aut and gbd as win 3 samples from the influent of bxh in different seasons bxh inf spr bxh inf sum bxh inf aut and bxh inf win and 4 samples from the activated sludge of bxh in different seasons bxh as spr bxh as sum bxh as aut and bxh as win permutational multivariate analysis of variance permanova was used to test the differences among groups richness shannon wiener h and inverse simpson indices were used to evaluate the alpha diversity of the microbial communities pielou s j index was used to investigate the evenness of the microbial communities to identify the seasonal community succession patterns the relative abundance data of all samples were ordinated by nonmetric multidimensional scaling nmds analysis with bray curtis distance the microbial community composition was visualized by circos krzywinski et al 2009 the diversity indices nmds dissimilarity matrix and mantel test were performed in r version 3 4 4 using the vegan package dixon 2003 version 3 2 the infer community assembly mechanisms by phylogenetic bin based null model icamp was used to investigate the assembly mechanisms of different microorganism groups ning et al 2020 the r code for icamp was available as an open source r package icamp which can be downloaded from the comprehensive r archive network cran https cran r project org and the custom scripts for icamp were available from github https github com daliangning icamp1 by using icamp five assembly mechanisms of different microorganism groups called bins were identified including homogeneous selection hos heterogeneous selection hes dispersal limitation dl homogenizing dispersal hd and drift dr a detailed explanation of these mechanisms can be found in a previous study zhou and ning 2017 besides the seasonality induced changes in hos and dr were investigated in this study and a change was defined as a positive value if the relative contribution of hos or dr was higher in summer than in winter microbial ecological networks were constructed by using the molecular ecological network analysis pipeline menap http ieg2 ou edu mena to reveal the possible co occurrence patterns among microorganisms zhou et al 2010 deng et al 2012 during the network construction procedure only those otus detected in more than 85 of the samples were kept to eliminate unrepresentative otus and reduce complexity to identify the keystone taxa the following simplified classification was established i peripheral nodes zi 2 5 pi 0 62 i e zi indicates within module connectivities and pi indicates among module connectivities which possessed only a few links that were almost always associated with nodes within their modules ii connectors zi 2 5 pi 0 62 which were highly connected to several modules iii module hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 which were highly connected to numerous microbes in their own modules and iv network hubs zi 2 5 pi 0 62 which acted as both module hubs and connectors for each network 100 corresponding random networks were generated with the same network size and average number of links the z test was then used to investigate the differences in the topological parameters between the constructed networks and the random networks to ensure that the ecological networks were non random 3 results and discussion 3 1 seasonal dynamics of microbial community diversity it was demonstrated that the functions and stability of wastewater treatment systems were determined by the diversity and composition of as communities jousset et al 2017 and wwtps with higher alpha diversity could be more stable sun et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 to determine how the alpha diversity of as and influent communities changed across seasons key diversity indices of these samples including richness shannon wiener index h pielou s evenness index j and inverse simpson s index were calculated to reveal their seasonal dynamic patterns as shown in fig 1 richness represented the number of observed species and ranged from 904 gbd inf spr to 5606 gbd inf aut in these samples the shannon wiener index considering both the richness and relative abundance of each species varied from 2 90 bxh inf spr to 7 32 gbd inf aut in these time series samples besides the pielou s evenness index ranged from 0 40 bxh inf spr to 0 85 gbd inf aut and the inverse simpson diversity index varied from 3 46 bxh inf spr to 284 53 bxh inf spr the results showed that the microbial diversity of influent samples fluctuated dramatically across time points moreover the maximum and minimum values of each index all appeared in influent samples for example the maximum and minimum values of the inverse simpson diversity index all occurred in bxh spring influent samples this result was not surprising because the characteristics of influent wastewater are related to people s living habits such as eating habits and shower frequency and production activities in different seasons which are not subject to artificial control and fluctuate frequently martin and vanrolleghem 2014 chen et al 2019 petrovski et al 2020 thus the microbial community could be affected by dramatic changes in substrates such as cod mantel test r 0 205 p 0 001 and nitrate n mantel test r 0 509 p 0 001 while in as samples the microbial diversity was relatively stable in different seasons here the wwtps performance was also determined as shown in figures s1 s3 the system performance was relatively stable in terms of cod ammonia nitrogen and total nitrogen removal and almost all of the effluent quality indices met the discharge standard during the sampling period the performance of these two full scale wwtps was generally stable throughout the year which may partially be attributed to the relatively stable microbial diversity in as however the diversity of the as community in summer was still significantly higher than that in winter t test gbd p 0 01 bxh p 0 05 previous studies indicated that temperature was an important driver of repeatable seasonal alpha diversity patterns accompanied by population synchrony and shifts in broad phylogenetic abundance flowers cad kin et al 2013 griffin and wells 2017 in this study a similar sinusoidal temperature pattern was also observed figure s4 therefore the significant difference in as microbial diversity between summer and winter could be at least partly attributed to the changes in temperature mantel test r 0 289 p 0 001 collectively these results suggested that the microbial diversity in the influent fluctuated substantially with season while as had a relatively more stable diversity pattern throughout the year 3 2 seasonal dynamics of microbial community composition to better understand the structure of microbial community the taxonomic affiliation at the phylum or class for proteobacteria level was visualized by circos fig 2 figure s5 7 firmicutes bacteroidetes beta gamma and epsilon proteobacteria were the most dominant phyla or classes in the influent samples in addition the composition of influent communities varied greatly in different seasons which may be attributed to sharp fluctuations in the influent characteristics martin and vanrolleghem 2014 zheng et al 2019 petrovski et al 2020 in the as community the composition was more seasonally stable than that in the influent community consistent with previous studies xia et al 2018 sun et al 2020 the most dominant phyla or classes in the as community were alpha beta gamma delta proteobacteria actinobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi nitrospirae and planctomycetes however even though the composition of as community was similar in different seasons the results of permanova suggested significant p 0 001 differences among them as shown in table s3 there were significant differences among almost all groups except for some influent groups p 0 05 the results suggested that the as community might have seasonal succession patterns therefore to explore the overall community dynamics the community data were ordinated by nmds as shown in fig 3 all samples were clearly clustered into four groups gbd influent gbd activated sludge bxh influent and bxh activated sludge the results showed that there were significant differences between the influent and as communities moreover the distance between gbd inf and bxh inf was closer than that of gbd as and bxh as indicating that the difference between the as community was greater than that of the influent community which could be related to the different wastewater treatment processes in addition there were no seasonal succession patterns in influent communities but a continual succession was found i e the continuous variation of influent samples in the nmds figure which could be attributed to the irregular changes in influent characteristics while in as communities a clear seasonal succession pattern of microbial community structure was found i e the communities from spring and winter were closer in the nmds figure which was due to the similar organic and nutrient removal functions performed by the as systems throughout the year as indicated by previous studies seasonal variation would only shift the microbial community structures but not enough to change the functional genes griffin and wells 2017 liu et al 2019 besides as one of the most important factors influencing the community structure temperature p 0 001 was more similar in winter and spring figure s4 thus it was reasonable that as communities exhibited seasonal succession patterns to understand which microorganisms were responsible for the differences in the seasonal as community the top 50 dominant genera accounting for 20 8 73 7 of the relative abundance were investigated besides their putative functions were identified by using the midas 3 database nierychlo et al 2020 as shown in figure s8 the abundance of some genera was significantly different among seasons for example for the top 15 genera the abundances of ferruginibacter p 0 001 nitrospira p 0 001 dechloromonas p 0 001 zoogloea p 0 01 aridibacter p 0 001 phaeodactylibacter p 0 001 and gemmobacter p 0 001 were significantly different between summer and winter whereas terrimonas dokdonella nitrosomonas chryseolinea lewinella arenimonas comamonas and gp4 had no significant differences the in situ physiology of ferruginibacter in activated sludge has not been determined nierychlo et al 2020 and aridibacter were reported to metabolize a variety of monomeric sugars organic acids and complex proteinaceous substrates in wastewater nierychlo et al 2020 nitrospira are considered to be the most common and abundant nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob in wwtps daims et al 2001 and dechloromonas are able to assimilate vfas with nitrite as the electron acceptor under anoxic conditions playing a role in denitrification ginige keller et al 2005 mcilroy et al 2016 however even though the abundance of nitrospira and dechloromonas was significantly different between seasons the nitrogen removal performance of full scale wwtps was relatively stable throughout the year figure s3 indicating that there might have been nitrogen removal functional redundancy in the system besides zoogloea were the abundant denitrifier in as system and its overgrowth suggested the occurrence of non viscous bulking larsen et al 2008 therefore the significantly higher abundance of zoogloea may suggest higher risks of sludge bulking in winter in summary the results here revealed the dominant phyla or classes in influent and as samples the seasonal succession patterns of as community and the seasonal dynamics of dominant genera in as samples 3 3 assembly mechanisms across different phylogenetic groups in as given that the microbial diversity and community composition were seasonally dynamic we further investigated the driving forces that shaped the community structure i e the community assembly mechanisms the community assembly mechanism is one of the most compelling questions in ecology and it is the theoretical basis for regulation of the as community via the operational parameters of wwtps zhou and ning 2017 zhang et al 2020 ning et al 2020 previous studies have indicated that assembly mechanisms mainly include deterministic and stochastic processes the deterministic processes were divided into homogeneous selection hos and heterogeneous selection hes while the stochastic processes included dispersal limitation dl homogenizing dispersal hd and drift dr zhou and ning 2017 the whole community based as assembly mechanism studies have demonstrated some controversy especially in answering the question of whether deterministic or stochastic processes are predominant and based on these controversial results griffin and wells 2017 johnston et al 2019 wu et al 2019 we hypothesized that some phylogenetic groups were under strong selection whereas others could be under strong drift however this type of difference cannot be discerned by whole community based metrics in this study the assembly mechanisms of different microorganism groups called bins in as were investigated by using our newly developed tool icamp ning et al 2020 to the best of our knowledge this is the first attempt to distinguish the assembly mechanisms of different microorganisms in as the 33 411 observed otus were divided into 337 phylogenetic bins and the assembly mechanisms of these bins were shown in fig 4 more detailed information can be found in supplementary 2 overall drift accounted for the largest proportion of the assembly mechanisms dr 52 8 followed by dispersal limitation dl 22 1 and homogeneous selection hos 18 2 while homogenizing dispersal hd 5 3 and heterogeneous selection hes 1 6 accounted for smaller proportions the deterministic processes dominated in 47 bins 13 9 of the bin numbers and 36 3 of the relative abundance and the stochastic processes dominated in 290 bins 86 1 of the bin numbers and 63 7 of the relative abundance drift was found to be the most important stochastic process and is referred to as an inherent stochastic process encompassing birth death and reproduction zhou and ning 2017 the results indicated the importance of stochastic processes in shaping the as microbial community with an average stochasticity of approximately 75 and this value was very similar to the global survey data published by the global water microbiome consortium wu et al 2019 we further investigated these stochastic predominant bins most of them were affiliated to proteobacteria 37 2 mainly alpha beta gamma and delta proteobacteria firmicutes 12 1 bacteroidetes 10 0 actinobacteria 7 2 and acidobacteria 4 5 wwtps are inherently open systems ofiteru et al 2010 that continuously receive wastewater which favors microorganism immigration from the influent influent is an important source for the as community mclellan et al 2010 zheng and wen 2019 and some non growing bacteria which entering the system with influent may also had influence on the as community as previously demonstrated for anaerobic digesters in wwtps jiang et al 2021 thus it is not surprising that so many phylogenetic groups in as were primarily influenced by stochastic processes many long term studies have found that the community structure is affected by short term appeared otus called transient intermediate taxa jiang et al 2018b johnston et al 2019 zheng and wen 2019 we speculated that these short term appeared otus were mainly influenced by stochastic processes however more data are needed to support this hypothesis deterministic processes mainly homogeneous selection were predominant in 47 bins homogeneous selection refers to selection under homogeneous abiotic and biotic environmental conditions leading to more similar structures among communities zhou and ning 2017 the results here indicated that these bins were selected under the selection pressure of wwtps the taxonomic information of these 47 bins was summarized in table s4 overall they were mostly affiliated to actinobacteria alpha proteobacteria firmicutes bacteroidetes and nitrospirae then the putative functions of these bins were identified by the midas 3 database nierychlo et al 2020 as shown in fig 5 most of them 22 out of 47 were aerobic heterotrophs indicating that they may play an important role in organic degradation and nutrient removal chemoautotrophs or mixtrophs were also observed seven out of 47 bins were identified as positive or variable for nitrite reduction indicating that they were putative denitrifiers nierychlo et al 2020 nob phosphorus accumulating organisms pao and glycogen accumulating organisms gao were also observed in these deterministic predominant bins however there were very few of them as shown in fig 5 most metabolic properties of these bins were not assessed we believe that these microorganism groups which can be selected by the deterministic processes in wwtps are of great significance and may be the basis for future regulation of activated sludge communities further researches are needed to identify their functions based on the frequency and relative abundance the core taxa in as have been studied on spatial saunders et al 2016 wu et al 2019 or temporal scales griffin and wells 2017 jiang et al 2018a however some inconsistencies still exist twenty eight otus were defined as the core bacterial community in our previous global survey in which nitrospira was the most important nob wu et al 2019 nonetheless a recently published study found that there were no members of the genus nitrospira in the studied system and the authors extended the definition of the core microbiome johnston and behrens 2020 to some extent the definition of core taxa was plant specific besides a previous study suggested that there should be no shared taxa between wwtps if the sampling period was long enough jiang et al 2018a nevertheless we still hypothesized that there were core taxa in wwtps considering that the wwtps performed similar nutrient removal functions anywhere and at any time moreover we further hypothesized that the assembly mechanisms of these core taxa should be deterministically dominated in this way they can exist under the selection pressure of wwtps to test this hypothesis two local core taxa datasets were collated as shown in table s5 the dataset 1 contains 29 core taxa relative abundance 0 1 and frequency 80 of our large scale spatial as samples zhang et al 2020 and temporal as samples this study from china dataset 2 contains the core taxa 28 otus of our previous global survey wu et al 2019 as shown in fig 5 19 out of 47 40 deterministic dominated bins were found in core taxa dataset 1 or 2 in addition 14 out of 47 bins were found in dataset 1 and 8 out of 47 bins were found in dataset 2 there were 3 bins found in both dataset 1 and 2 bin 248 bin 285 and bin 289 and their taxonomic information was summarized in table s4 bin 248 was identified as nitrospira which is considered to be the most common and abundant nob in wwtps nierychlo et al 2020 bin 285 was identified as dokdonella which is only known as an aerobic heterotroph and its in situ functions have not been studied nierychlo et al 2020 bin 289 was identified as sideroxydans affiliated to family comamonadaceae which is little known to us on the whole the results here suggested that approximately 40 of the deterministic dominated bins were the core taxa in wwtps and they might contribute to as functions future studies are needed to investigate whether and how we can use these bins to regulate the as community and functions of wwtps as mentioned above hos was the main contributor to deterministic processes while dr accounted for the largest proportion of stochastic processes thus as shown in fig 4 c and d we further investigated the seasonal changes in hos and dr overall the hos and dr process were significantly different between summer and winter t test p 0 001 there were 136 out of 337 bins that had higher dr in winter than summer the negative outer value in figure while 134 out of 337 bins showed higher hos in summer the positive inner value in figure previous studies have revealed that seasonality significantly influences the microbial diversity and community composition in as and in this study the results suggested that the assembly mechanisms were also affected by seasonality it is worth noting that nitrospira showed a lower hos in winter and the seasonality induced change in hos was 25 7 the results suggested that nitrospira were more susceptible to stochastic processes in winter which may affect population abundance considering that nitrification failure mainly occurs in winter johnston et al 2019 the results here may provide a possible explanation from the assembly mechanism perspective 3 4 seasonal dynamics of microbial co occurrence patterns as one of the deterministic processes microbial co occurrence patterns were reported to be the most important driver shaping community assembly ju and zhang 2015 accordingly 16 networks were constructed with the same threshold value of 0 990 it was suggested that the network structures were non random and unlikely to appear due to chance as indicated by the significant differences between empirical networks and their 100 corresponding random networks which had identical network sizes and average number of links table s6 s21 as shown in fig 6 tables 1 and 2 the influent networks differed greatly from the as networks especially in spring and winter influent assemblages formed larger networks with more nodes and links than as networks which increased the density of connections in the influent community and created more complex network patterns moreover the topological parameters of the influent networks tables 1 2 changed dramatically compared to those of the as networks studies have indicated that nutrients are important drivers of network structures in microbiological systems foster et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 therefore changes in environmental conditions such as cod concentration can contribute to the dynamics of network structure considering that the influent cod concentration varied greatly in different seasons figure s1 it is not difficult to understand that the structure of influent networks also changed greatly with the seasons the as networks had more stable seasonal topological parameters over time than the influent networks tables 1 and 2 which may be related to the stable function of the as community over time interestingly the network had smaller but more numerous modules in summer and autumn and more complex modules in spring and winter fig 6 in networks a module is a group of otus that are highly self connected but has much fewer connections with otus outside the group deng et al 2012 previous studies indicated that microbes within the same module may perform similar functions from the perspective of network topological structure more small modules could make the network more stable if they could work simultaneously deng et al 2012 zhang et al 2020 the results were reasonable given that nutrients were important drivers of network structures shi et al 2016 zhang et al 2020 the seasonal patterns of as network modules could be a result of varying cod concentrations i e nutrients across the sampling time in fact our results indicated that the cod concentrations of gbd p 0 01 and bxh p 0 02 were significantly higher in spring and winter than in summer and autumn thus these variations may induce more complex network structures in spring and winter altogether the results here reported the undocumented seasonal dynamics of network topological parameters of long term intensively sampled influent and as community from full scale wwtps and demonstrated that the as network structures could be more stable in summer and autumn different nodes played distinct roles in the network developed from microbial abundance data previous studies indicated that keystone taxa possess disproportionately more important roles in maintaining network structure than other microorganisms in a network and the disappearance of these putative keystone taxa may cause networks to disassemble shi et al 2016 faust and raes 2012 as shown in fig 7 some otus were identified as module hubs or connectors in these ecological networks briefly most of these keystone taxa were affiliated to proteobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes more detailed taxonomic information was listed in table s22 we found that only two identified keystone taxa repeatedly appeared and no taxa acted as either a module hub or connector in different networks as the environmental conditions changed over time these results support the context dependency theory power et al 1996 which means that the keystone taxa can only play crucial roles under certain environmental conditions besides the as system is considered to be a highly functional redundant system vuono et al 2015 zhang et al 2020 thus different microorganisms may play the same ecological role over time which may explain the unique keystone taxa detected in different as networks interestingly we found that the shannon wiener index was significantly negatively correlated with network connectivity links in both influent and as samples figure s9 we assume that the lower temperature could act as a strong environmental filter for community assembly thus in spring and winter lower temperature would promote the development of niches populated by dominant microorganisms which would lead to decreased diversity and more complex co occurrence patterns over time due to shared niches the negatively correlated relationship between diversity and network connectivity highlights the significance of investigating co occurrence among microorganisms as they are important dimensions of community organization uncaptured by univariate diversity metrics shi et al 2016 zhou et al 2010 4 conclusion the analysis of the microbial community of 89 influent and 103 as time series samples from two full scale wwtps led to the following conclusions the microbial community diversity and composition in the influent fluctuated substantially with season while those in the as had a relatively more stable pattern throughout the year firmicutes bacteroidetes beta gamma and epsilon proteobacteria were the most dominant phyla or classes in influent samples while alpha beta gamma delta proteobacteria actinobacteria acidobacteria chloroflexi and nitrospirae predominated in as samples drift accounted for the largest proportion of the phylogenetic group based assembly mechanisms 52 8 while homogeneous selection 18 2 was the most important deterministic process deterministic processes dominated in 47 microbial groups bins which were also found 40 in the as core taxa dataset moreover the results suggested that nitrospira were more susceptible to stochastic processes in winter which may provide a possible explanation for nitrification failure in winter in addition network analysis results suggested that the network structure of the as community could be more stable in summer and autumn there were no identical keystone taxa found in different networks which supported the context dependency theory network complexity was negatively correlated with diversity indicating that community organization was not captured by univariate diversity metrics declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work

16947,the increasing amount of data on biofilter treatment performance over the past decade has made it possible to use data driven approaches to explore the relationships between biofilter performance and a range of input variables the knowledge gap lies in lack of models to predict the biofilter performance considering both design and operational variables especially for heavy metals in this study we tested three machine learning ml approaches namely multilinear regression mlr artificial neural network nn and random forest rf to predict biofilter outflow concentrations of heavy metals cd cr cu fe ni pb and zn using a range of design and operational factors as input variables the results show that rf performed relatively better than other two models with median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 995 0 317 0 762 0 636 0 726 0 896 and 0 656 for cd cr cu fe ni pb and zn respectively during model training however all the models were less accurate during model validation with the better performance found for cd average nse 0 964 zn 0 530 and ni 0 393 and poorer performance observed for cu 0 219 pb 0 058 fe 0 054 and cr 0 062 infiltration rate ir and inflow concentration cin were sensitive to all pollutants removal in biofilters the ratio of system size to catchment size was also found to be important for zn ni and cd while ponding depth was an important variable for cd based on thousands of hypothetical design and operational scenarios generated using raw data the best ml models were used to predict the biofilter outflow concentrations and estimate the risk quotient rq values with regards to reuse of treated stormwater for various purposes results suggest that biofilters were able to reduce health risks associated with heavy metals in stormwater and therefore produce reliable water fit for reuses such as irrigation swimming and toilet flushing modelling results showed that biofiltration did not meet the requirements for drinking when cd contamination exists explorative analysis also demonstrated how the key operational and design variables can be optimised to further reduce the health risks that can be fit for drinking purposes i e rq value 1 keywords stormwater bioretention raingardens data driven models stormwater harvesting decision tree feature selection 1 introduction heavy metals have been frequently detected in runoff

infiltration basins with media filters and vegetations have been extensively studied for their effective performance in removing suspend solids and nutrients bratieres et al 2008 micropollutant zhang et al 2014 microorganisms chandrasena et al 2019 and heavy metals read et al 2008 zinger et al 2013 for example davis et al 2003 observed over 90 removal of pb zn and cu in biofilters with effluent cu and pb levels mostly 5 µg l and zn 25 µg l nevertheless treatment performance is often inconsistent and varies to different biofilter designs literature also suggests conflicting results read et al 2008 found that vegetation did not significantly impact the effectiveness of biofilters in reducing the metal concentrations while feng et al 2012 reported that plant species were important for fe al and cr removal by mature biofilters moreover many studies suggest that most metals can be captured in the top layers of filter regardless of the type of media trenouth and gharabaghi 2015 hermawan et al 2019 while other studies found that media type was one of the most significant factors for metal removal feng et al 2012 lim et al 2015 blecken et al 2009b also observed that cu removal can be enhanced substantially by including a submerged zone sz in the design of biofilters but they found that the impact on other metals zn and pb is very small these conflicting findings indicate that further exploration of how these design factors affect heavy metal removal is needed the performance of stormwater biofiltration systems can also be largely affected by the operational conditions e g antecedent dry weather periods adwp inflow volume inflow concentrations etc feng et al 2012 tested the impact of inflow volume loading rate and inflow pollutant concentrations c in on the removal of metals in stormwater biofilters and the results suggest that inflow volume had varying impacts on metal removal while c in had no influence this contradicts to blecken et al 2009b s findings in which positive linear relationships were observed between cin and outflow concentrations extended adwp can also negatively impact the system performance although metal removal still remains relatively high and this can be improved by introducing sz blecken et al 2009a nevertheless compared to the design characteristics less research has been taken on the influence of operational conditions on metal removal despite the close links observed between operational conditions and system performance for traditional stormwater pollutants afrooz and boehm 2017 more research is particularly important if treated stormwater is to be reused as it informs ideas of how a well designed biofilter can be maintained to provide reliable water while keeping risks caused by heavy metals low although the risk to human from stormwater pollution caused by heavy metals was previously assessed based on their pollution levels ma et al 2016 there are few studies investigating how these risks could be reduced by stormwater biofilters relevant studies have been done to quantify the ability of biofilters in reducing the risks caused by microorganisms based on hypothetical treatment trains with assumptions of average pollutant reduction rates e g 1 log pathogen reduction for an average or well performing biofilter murphy et al 2017 accordingly the results from these studies often do not represent the capabilities of biofilter systems in reducing risks during real time system operation this has mainly been due to the lack of treatment data and therefore the impact of operational conditions on risk controls by stormwater biofilter has never been considered models that can predict biofilter treatment performance based on system designs and real time operations can be a great fit for such purposes the existing conceptual models e g swmm rossman 2017 or process based models randelovic et al 2016 are not designed to interface with real time data and cannot produce adaptive predictions to reflect changing operational conditions on the other hand data driven models enable the real time interaction with operational data e g kerkez et al 2016 and they can also assess how a biofilter can control health risks associated with heavy metals under various system designs and operations only recently data driven modelling also referred to as machine learning ml approaches have been applied in several biofilter studies to analyse the relationship between system design and performance based on biofilter treatment data the majority of these studies focus on the hydraulic performance e g captured runoff volume by khan et al 2013 using multiple linear regression outflow discharge rates by yang and chui 2019 using neural networks sporadic studies have investigated pollutant treatment performance e g mcnett et al 2011 investigated the correlation between inflow and outflow of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations of biofilters using 12 general linear models glms and field data collected from 11 bioretention cells wang et al 2019 collected 182 recorded samples of biofilters including design features and control variables and then used multiple linear regression mlr algorithms to identify the optimal biofilter design based on removal efficiency of total suspended solid tss tn and tp all these studies only focus on traditional stormwater pollutants not taking into much consideration heavy metals for which there is far less data and the impact of operational conditions yet only one study by zhang et al 2021 based on a data driven approach investigated how a range of different stormwater design characteristics and operational conditions impact nutrients removal the aim of this study is to develop data driven models for prediction of metal removal in stormwater biofilters by considering both system design and operational conditions the objectives are to 1 gather a literature dataset from previous research and test three machine learning models i e multiple linear regression mlr artificial neural network nn and random forest rf algorithms for the prediction of effluent heavy metal concentrations 2 investigate the importance of various biofilter design and operational variables on heavy metal removal in biofilters based on various feature selection methods of the machine learning models and 3 assess the human health risks associated with the heavy metals in biofilter outflows under various designs and operational conditions to the authors knowledge this is also the first study that includes operational variables in a data driven approach to predict the performance of stormwater biofilters in heavy metal removal and risk control the results of which could be applied to further optimise the system operation to ensure a low risk from stormwater 2 methodology fig 1 illustrates the overall methodology of this study it consists of 1 dataset creation and preparation e g transformation section 2 1 that aim to evaluate the data collected from various sources literature in this case 2 ml testing section 2 2 that contains the introduction of three ml models preliminary testing transformation model structures etc as well as robust testing methods 3 feature selection section 2 3 that investigates the importance of design and operational variables in heavy metal removal and 4 explorative risk assessment section 2 4 based on hypothetical biofilter design and operational scenarios generated using the best ml models 2 1 creation of dataset variable selection the impact of various design and operational variables on performance of stormwater biofilters has been widely reported in the literature e g blecken et al 2009a feng et al 2012 mohanty and boehm 2014 lim et al 2015 afrooz and boehm 2017 table 1 summarises the design and operational variables suggested in the literature database formation data was collected following the steps 1 searching literature through web of science by using topics of raingardens or stormwater biofilter or stormwater retention to find stormwater biofilter studies from 1993 to 2019 this led to a total of 742 results then 2 manually looking into the title abstracts and keywords of all these papers to shortlist the studies that reported heavy metal removal this resulted in a total of 88 papers 3 carefully reading through each paper to select the papers that reported all the variables included in table 1 this step was also assisted with going through references of each paper to find any relevant studies that were missing from the first step of search this led to a final list of 22 paper including 7 papers in which the authors have raw data the full list of publications available in supplementary information si and lastly 4 thoroughly reading through each paper to extract the biofilter performance data for seven heavy metals cd cr cu fe ni pb and zn for inflow and outflow concentrations only the data that can represent the event mean concentration emc were recorded in cases when only removal rates were reported the outflow concentrations were calculated by the authors to be added into the database due to the scarcity of the performance data on heavy metals we also tried to visually retrieve the data from the figures in the literature by manually measuring the length of the point indicating concentrations to the axis and benchmarking against the axis scale the initial dataset included a total of 1716 points however the data points that do not contain the full list of the design and operational variables table 1 were excluded leading to a total of 1347 effective data points this was then divided into seven sub datasets one for each metal 156 232 points for different metals summary statistics of each sub dataset is given in table s1 of the si the creation of dataset based on literature studies was also practiced in previous studies on using a data driven approach to predict biofilter performance wang et al 2019 data pre processing the non numeric design variables e g presence of vegetation submerged zone were encoded into binary values 1 for presence and 0 for non presence although some vegetation are effective while some are ineffective e g feng et al 2012 not all the reviewed studies investigated this and it was simply classified as two categories with without vegetation across the reviewed papers a wide range of media types were used in this study these were grouped into three types media with high organic matter which may have high absorbance potential but has a risk of leaching out nutrients assigned a nominal value 0 media mixed with top soil often practiced in field assigned a nominal value 1 and sandy media reported to have effective performance assigned a nominal value 2 before testing probability plots histograms for all the pollutants were developed for an overview of the data and the normality was assessed most data do not follow normal distribution and are predominantly right skewed which as they come from multiple sources of literature was expected therefore z score normalisation and log transformation of the data were performed and the transformed datasets as well as the raw datasets were firstly tested as described in the next section 2 2 machine learning ml model development and testing 2 2 1 brief introduction of the ml approaches three different machine learning ml approaches were applied in this study to predict stormwater biofilter outflow concentrations by using the eleven design and operational variables table 1 the first approach was the multiple linear regression mlr model which is a common ml approach that has been used mostly by researchers in stormwater biofilter studies to predict the system performance e g khan et al 2013 and wang et al 2019 the second approach was artificial neural networks nn which have been used previously to simulate hydrologic performance of green infrastructure e g yang and chui 2019 however have not been applied to test stormwater biofilter treatment performance nn is a black box approach as it does not reveal what it does or how it does it the third ml approach used was random forest rf it is an ensemble method that trains several decision trees in parallel with bootstrapping followed by aggregation jointly referred to as bagging method breiman 2001 and has been applied in previous stormwater research to identify first flush phenomenon perera et al 2019 unlike the decision tree method which uses all the available data and the best variable to split the data at each tree node according to a criterion to measure the quality of a split each node in rf is split using the best amongst a subset of variables randomly chosen at the node on the other hand an individual decision tree in the random forest is uniquely constructed by subset of training dataset using different subsets of available variables by aggregating many decision trees in the forest rf can limit the over fitting as well as variance and error due to bias and therefore yields more useful results in addition rf has embedded feature selection function to identify the relative importance of each variable by determining how often it appears in each tree and where it appears in the tree variables that appear higher in the tree are given more importance thus rf is regarded as a white box approach which was applied in this study to identify the relative importance of design and operational variables to the biofilter performance 2 2 2 model construction training and validation preliminary testing was done both to investigate the necessity of transforming the raw data for mlr comparing the performance of the models when raw data z score transformed data and log transformed data were used and also to determine the structure and parameters used in the nn and rf models the statsmodel module in python 3 programming language was used to set up the mlr model and the ordinary least square regression was used to fit the model parameters the neural network was built by the dense layer from keras with the tensorflow library a basic nn model was structured with 11 nodes in the input layer i e 11 variables and one node in the output layer i e outflow concentrations adam was selected as the optimiser of the nn which generates the individual learning rates for different parameters using a large number of neurons and hidden layers can lead to over fitting conversely selecting smaller network size will limit its ability to learn the non linear and complex relationships within the data thus preliminary testing was done to determine the other parameters of the nn e g number of hidden layers 1 2 and hidden nodes 2 8 activation function relu tanh and number of epochs 500 10 000 the initial ranges of these parameters were selected using a trial and error method to cover the possible size of the network so it was large enough to see both over and under fitting it was decided after the preliminary testing to set a single hidden layer epochs number of 2000 and the activation function as tanh since it always outperformed relu for the applied dataset in nn only the z scheme normalised data was used because previous studies have suggested that normalised data can generally speed up the learning process and lead to faster convergence the random forest rf model was constructed by using the randomforestregressor module in the scikit learn package pedregosa et al 2011 similarly preliminary testing was done to determine key parameters i e number of trees n estimator from 20 500 criterion mean square error or mean absolute error maximum tree depth max depth from 1 20 and the number of features to consider when looking for the best split max features auto or sqrt or log2 of total number of input variables except for max depth which varied based on pollutant type from 3 to 7 all other parameters were observed to not be sensitive for the model performance during training and validation and thus default values were chosen rf is based on decision trees which are not sensitive to the data scaling kotu and deshpande 2019 thus no data transformation was done for rf during these preliminary testing 80 of data from the full datasets were randomly selected for model training and the remaining 20 for model validation the error evaluation of the model was achieved by calculating the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse was also used to assess the model robustness in previous biofilter modelling studies e g process based models randelovic et al 2016 and data driven models zhang et al 2021 although nse is sensitive to high values in this case concentrations krause et al 2005 it was suitable for this study as high concentrations are of concern with regards to the potential health risks it shall be noted preliminary testing was also done to include other error metrics e g r2 and mean square error and significant correlations were found between nse and these metrics pearson correlation r 0 82 p 0 01 and accordingly there was no difference in selecting the suitable model structure and parameters therefore only nse was used in the full model testing due to the high variability and limited number of data points in the raw dataset preliminary testing was also done to determine the use of n fold training and validation n 10 20 50 100 200 500 and 1000 method based on nn models it was found that the model performance was quite unstable e g the range of nse maximum nse values did not stabilise unless at least 100 fold training and validation was used therefore it was decided to use 100 fold training and validation approach in the robust testing robust testing a 100 fold training and validation was applied to fit and rigorously test all the three models for all the heavy metals i e repeat the training and validation as explained in preliminary testing i e 80 20 split 100 times 2 3 selection of the important design and operational variables the importance of key design and operational variables was investigated as previous studies often show biases of different types of ml methods for feature selection e g greenland et al 1986 strobl et al 2007 therefore to ensure the robustness of feature selection results it was decided to apply four different feature selection approaches in investigating the important design and operational variables firstly by using the mlr which was trained using the normalised data the regression coefficients p values estimated from training allowed us to learn which variables have a significant influence i e p 0 05 on the outflow concentrations those bigger regression coefficients indicated a larger impact schielzeth 2010 secondly the feature selection function of rf was used to identify the relative importance of design and operational variables to biofilter performance when training a tree it is possible to compute how much each variable decreases the impurity the more a variable decreases the impurity the more important this variable is by estimating the mean decrease in impurity mdi across all the trees in rf and across the 100 fold iterations the final importance and ranking of the variable was determined this approach has been used in previous stormwater studies to identify the factors of first flush perera et al 2019 the second approach computes feature selection using a training set hence it does not reflect the impact of a feature in the prediction performance and can inflate the importance of numerical features therefore a third approach was selected which uses permutation importance function of rf sklearn inspection permutation importance altmann et al 2010 in this approach the performance of rf was initially evaluated by using all design and operational variables baseline metrics then a variable from the validation set is permuted and the metric is evaluated again the permutation importance is then defined to be the difference between the baseline metric and metric estimated after permutating the variable lastly boruta an all relevant feature selection method kursa and rudnicki 2010 was also applied in this study using the borutapy package in python 3 this method tries to find all features carrying information usable for prediction rather than finding a possibly compact subset of features on which some classifier regressor has a minimal error instead of ranking the features it gives confirmed tentative rejected features that are respectively important unsure unimportant to the dependent features to illustrate the importance of the variables the number of times that a variable was selected as the top three ranked feature or the confirmed features in boruta were counted then comparisons of the results were presented to investigate how important features varied across a different pollutants and b different methods as shown in fig 3 2 4 explorative risk assessment risk assessment procedure in this study was performed in four steps 1 hazard identification 2 exposure assessment 3 dose response assessment and 4 risk characterisation the risk assessment of this part was done only for cd zn and ni which based on the robust model testing section 2 2 had best performance the results are presented in section 3 1 1 hazard identification this was the process to estimate the heavy metal concentrations in biofilter effluent by using the best ml models for each metal based on the robust testing as the input to ml models a total of 10 000 different hypothetical designs and operational conditions were generated by randomly sampling the values of all design and operational variables as in table 1 from uniform distributions for numerical variables informed by the range of the raw dataset fig s1 of si the inter relationships of all the variables were checked using the pearson correlation and no significant and strong correlations were found r values were always below 0 04 for the significant correlations it should be noted that although each variable in the raw data did not follow normal uniform distributions this study tried to generate a large number of scenarios for the explorative modelling table s3 of the supplementary information presents the summary statistics of the input variables as well as the predicted outflow concentrations and removal rates 2 exposure assessment this was the assessment of the risk to human health through various exposure pathways associated with the reuse of stormwater as shown in table 2 with the volume of water ingested per event and exposure frequency for each exposure pathway taken from relevant references similar exposure pathways were also used by murphy et al 2017 to estimate risks caused by campylobacter during stormwater reuse chronic daily intake cdi through ingestion per unit body weight mg kg day can be calculated using eq 1 as proposed in usepa 1989 and also applied in previous studies by ma et al 2016 while this study only focuses on the accidental ingestions which pose the highest risk to human other pathways like dermal contact could also be included in future studies e g ma et al 2016 1 cdi c ir ef ed bw at c mg l measured predicted concentration of heavy metals in inflow or outflow of biofilter ir l event water ingestion rate volume intake during each event ef event person year exposure frequency as in table 2 ed exposure period years exposure duration 70 years for an adult bw kg body weight 70 kg for an adult at days average lifespan 25 550 days for an adult 3 dose response assessment this was to determine reference dose rfd mg kg day which is the usepa defined maximum acceptable dose above which people is susceptible to toxic substances similar to the predicted no effect concentration pnec as used in australian guidelines nhmrc 2011 iris 2020 the rfd values are summarized in table s2 of si for all metals 4 risk characterisation health risk is characterised as risk quotient rq which is calculated as per eq 2 the approach has been commonly used to estimate human risks associated with heavy metals and organic micropollutants etchepare and van der hoek 2015 ma et al 2016 2 r q c d i r f d rq 1 indicates heavy metals in stormwater can pose risk to human health while hi 1 indicates that they are not of concern the rq values in both biofilter inflow i e untreated stormwater and outflow were estimated in this study which enables the authors to assess whether stormwater biofilters can produce reusable water for various pathways and how the design and operational conditions can influence the risks which subsequently can allow real time control of risks 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of ml models results from preliminary testing revealed all the pollutants were insensitive to three data pre processing methods i e raw data z score transformation and log transformation except for cu figure s1 and s2 in si for cu the best performance was achieved when using the z score transformed and log transformed data nse train 0 40 and nse validation 0 15 and the worst performance was observed when using the raw dataset of cu nse train 0 20 and nse validation 0 as such it is recommended that the raw data should be transformed before being fed into the relevant ml models e g nn comparing the three ml models mlr nn and rf based on robust testing results training phase fig 2 rf models were found to be the best in simulating outflow concentrations of most pollutants e g cd median nse 0 995 cr 0 317 cu 0 762 fe 0 636 ni 0 726 zn 0 896 and pb 0 656 moreover rf models produced the smallest interquartile ranges of training nse values showing its relatively higher robustness mlr models generally performed worse than the other two models with the lowest nse during training in regard to validation all ml models became less stable due to the higher variability in nse results across 100 simulations taking cu for example a worse predictive ability was found median nse dropped to 0 267 and the interquartile range of nse in validation was 13 5 times larger than that in training for the rf model fig 2 these models performance varied across different pollutants best fits were observed for cd ni and zn with their median nse values validation phase of 0 964 0 393 and 0 530 respectively across all models their interquartile box ranges were also mostly in positive nse values models for cu showed lower predictive abilities median nse validation 0 095 0 297 with the nn being the best model for cu nse validation 0 297 these models had the worst prediction outcomes when they were applied to datasets of cr fe pb pollutants since the validation nses were lower than 0 1 and were often negative however the rf model still performed relatively better with positive median nse values for cr whereas mlr did best for pb the whole interquartile had positive nse values the variations in model performance for different pollutant types were also reported in previous studies on process based detailed models for a typical stormwater biofilter design randelovic et al 2016 e g nse 0 575 in training and nse 0 545 in validation for glyphosate and nse 0 511 in training and nse 0 285 in validation for simazine nevertheless for some metals in this study i e cr cu fe and pb the differences of nse between the model training and validation were very large average nsetraining 0 59 and nsevalidation 0 04 indicating potential over fitting and poor generalisation issues this might be due to the large variances in the original dataset which was collected from multiple studies that were conducted under very different conditions for example cin of cu varied from 2 1 to 570 µg l and ir varied from 11 to 1178 mm hr across all studies the inclusion of both binary values for some parameters while others are continuous may induce imbalance to the dataset and have potential impact on the model performance however further testing needs to be done to confirm this impact previous data driven studies on stormwater biofilter attempted to use data from similar experiments to reduce the noise in original dataset e g zhang et al 2021 the purpose of this study however was to capture how these vast different conditions can impact the system performance detailed in the next section a previous biofilter data driven modelling study by wang et al 2019 limited the number of records taken from each publication to avoid dependency on one or several studies due to the scarcity of biofilter treatment performance data in heavy metals especially when considering the availability of both design and operational variables the same method was not adopted in this study i e all the available data from each study was taken this may potentially impact the model performance due to the imbalance between datasets from different studies however for other metals i e cd zn and ni the ml models had relatively good performance i e average nsetraining 0 79 and nsevalidation 0 63 showing good level of generalisation this further confirms the necessity of conducting rigorous testing e g 100 fold training and validation to ensure the robustness of the ml models and use of the reliable model in future applications e g only the models for well performing metals cd zn and ni were used in the risk assessment 3 2 key design and operational variables on biofilter performance the results from feature selection fig 3 show that overall ir and cin are most important to all pollutants i e they were most frequently selected as top 3 features across all the selection methods these findings correlate with a recent study by zhang et al 2021 who found that ir and cin are the two most important operational variables that influence nutrients outflow concentrations from stormwater biofilters based on statistical models lower ir corresponds to the higher retention that has been previously found to improve metal removal as it provides more contact between media and metal ions hermawan et al 2019 inflow concentrations c in however were previously found to have less or no influence on outflow concentrations in experimental studies feng et al 2012 which contradicts this study as well as a previous study by blecken et al 2009b who observed a positive relationship between inflow concentration and overall mean outflow concentrations this is a very interesting and important finding the impact of c in on treatment performance during experimental studies are often investigated by dosing a spike of pollution over several events or a short period of time e g feng et al 2012 which may not be able to completely change the microbial communities of the system and thus the biofilter will still buffer these short spikes well and deliver a good treatment nevertheless we believe that a different cin entering biofilter systems over a long period can affect the treatment which was evidenced in both this study and the study by blecken et al 2009b with four sampling events that had varied cin the ratio of system size to catchment size was also found to be important for zn ni and cd fig 3 this differed from wang et al 2019 s study in which they found the ratio had little effect on cu pb and zn removal in this study a similar variable inflow flux was found to have little impact to the system performance which is also different from the previous laboratory study by feng et al 2012 who found the inflow volume had varying impacts on metal removal e g negatively correlated to cu and pb outflow concentrations positively correlated to fe al and cr outflow concentrations due to the different reactivity of these metals often inflow flux volume is related to the size of the biofilter i e ratio however they impact the system performance in different ways for example oversized or undersized systems always suffer from prolonged drying or extreme wetting conditions that can challenge the system over long term periods and negatively impact the system health on the other hand inflow flux is an operational parameter that varies depending on different rain events and is less likely to incur a long term impact on the system performance indeed laboratory studies are often relatively short e g up to one year to cover the seasonal effects feng et al 2012 making it difficult to investigate these long term effects nevertheless the data driven approach has demonstrated its ability in investigating the performance of different systems from multiple studies that are exposed to different inflow flux conditions in a long term other design and operational variables are relatively less important and the importance of each variable does vary across specific types of heavy metal depending on the type of feature selection methods for example the sz presence is only regarded as the top 3 important feature to all pollutants based on the mlr fig 3 which agrees with the previous study by blecken et al 2009b who found the presence of a sz can enhance heavy metal removal the impact of ponding depth has not been specifically investigated in biofilter studies and this study shows that it is an important factor for cd and cu removal the vegetation species were observed to be important for pb as top 3 feature suggested by three methods and for ni and fe as top 3 feature suggested by just one method indeed the contradictory results have been often observed in literature regarding the impact of vegetation types e g read et al 2008 observed that vegetation species did not significantly impact metal concentrations fe ni al cu pb zn while feng et al 2012 reported that vegetation was important for fe al and cr removal but had no impact on pb cu zn in this study filter media type and depth were also found to not be important at all for all the pollutants it was however found to be one of the significant factors for treatment of metals in the biofilter feng et al 2012 and lim et al 2015 3 3 investigation of biofilters in controlling the health risks the estimated rq values show that raw stormwater i e biofilter inflow contains heavy metals at levels that can cause human health risks when used directly for drinking rq 1 0 for cd but can be safely used in all other pathways fig 4 the rq plot for ni can be found in figure s3 of the si the health risks can be effectively reduced through biofilter treatment with decreased rq values estimated for all conditions fig 4 the effectiveness of biofilters in removing heavy metals are also reported in previous studies that approximately over 90 of cu zn pb can be removed hatt et al 2007 sun and davis 2007 feng et al 2012 also observed that all metals in biofilter outflow met standards for irrigation and except for fe and al other metals cu cr zn and pb were also satisfactorily removed with regards to drinking water quality standards based on the assessment of thousands of hypothetical system design and operational conditions using ml approaches the current study provides new evidence from a health risk perspective to show that biofilters can produce reliable water with low risk to all different exposure pathways except drinking when considering the contamination by cd nevertheless as suggested by feng et al 2012 if the treated water is to be used for drinking the optimisation of biofilters designs are still needed to improve the system performance this study shows that this could be done through the optimisation of not just the system design but more importantly also the operational conditions as the risks posed by cd were of concern after biofilter treatment the impact of the top three key design and operational variables identified in the previous section i e cin ratio and ponding depth were further explored with the estimated rq values plotted against various ranges of these variables in fig 5 as shown these factors have very clear impacts on the health risks associated with the biofilter outflow for example cin was found to be positively correlated to the rq values estimated from outflow concentrations pearson correlation r 0 529 p 0 05 and the interquartile ranges of rq can be managed to be lower than 1 0 if cin is maintained under 120 µg l similar observations were also acquired with regards to design ponding depth and ratio of the system the values of which can be set at 0 28 m and 3 75 respectively to maintain a low potential of health risks i e rq 1 associated with the reuse of stormwater after biofilter treatment in this way the ml models can be used as a predictive tool for assessing health risks 4 conclusions previous literature on how biofilter design and operational conditions influence heavy metal removal often report conflicting findings and the human health risks associated with heavy metals in stormwater biofilter outflows and how different designs and operational variables influence the risks were not well researched this study applied three machine learning ml approaches multilinear regression mlr neural network nn and random forest rf for the first time to predict the performance of stormwater biofilters in removing heavy metal and controlling the associated human health risks it was also able to provide additional understanding of how biofilter designs as well as the operational conditions influence the biofilter outflow heavy metal concentrations and the associated risks based on a range of studies i e covering various design and operational conditions the key findings are robustness testing showed that rf remained highly robust and outperformed the other two models during the training phase average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 995 cd 0 317 cr 0 762 cu 0 636 fe 0 726 ni 0 896 zn and 0 656 pb however in the validation phase all models became less stable with the better performance found for cd average nse 0 964 zn 0 530 and ni 0 393 and poorer performance observed for cu 0 219 pb 0 058 fe 0 054 and cr 0 062 based on feature selection analysis ir and cin were found to be important variables for all metals and the ratio of system size and catchment size was also found to be important for zn ni and cd ponding depth was observed to be an important design variable for cd and cu other design and operational variables are relatively less important and the importance of each variable changes for specific type of heavy metal explorative risk assessment showed stormwater biofilters were able to reduce health risks associated with heavy metals and produce reliable water fit for different purpose of reuse with the exception for drinking when considering cd contamination further analysis also demonstrated how the key operational and design variables can be optimised to further reduce the health risks that can be fit for drinking purposes i e risk quotient value 1 the results of this study can potentially be used in the future for controlling of the risks associated with stormwater harvesting treated by biofilters during a real time monitoring set up as part of the internet of things water treatment it should be noted however that the models were developed with limited data improvement of the models in the future studies can be achieved with more data this study did not assess the ecological risks of heavy metals to the environment which could also be undertaken in the future declaration of

16947,the increasing amount of data on biofilter treatment performance over the past decade has made it possible to use data driven approaches to explore the relationships between biofilter performance and a range of input variables the knowledge gap lies in lack of models to predict the biofilter performance considering both design and operational variables especially for heavy metals in this study we tested three machine learning ml approaches namely multilinear regression mlr artificial neural network nn and random forest rf to predict biofilter outflow concentrations of heavy metals cd cr cu fe ni pb and zn using a range of design and operational factors as input variables the results show that rf performed relatively better than other two models with median nash sutcliffe efficiency nse values of 0 995 0 317 0 762 0 636 0 726 0 896 and 0 656 for cd cr cu fe ni pb and zn respectively during model training however all the models were less accurate during model validation with the better performance found for cd average nse 0 964 zn 0 530 and ni 0 393 and poorer performance observed for cu 0 219 pb 0 058 fe 0 054 and cr 0 062 infiltration rate ir and inflow concentration cin were sensitive to all pollutants removal in biofilters the ratio of system size to catchment size was also found to be important for zn ni and cd while ponding depth was an important variable for cd based on thousands of hypothetical design and operational scenarios generated using raw data the best ml models were used to predict the biofilter outflow concentrations and estimate the risk quotient rq values with regards to reuse of treated stormwater for various purposes results suggest that biofilters were able to reduce health risks associated with heavy metals in stormwater and therefore produce reliable water fit for reuses such as irrigation swimming and toilet flushing modelling results showed that biofiltration did not meet the requirements for drinking when cd contamination exists explorative analysis also demonstrated how the key operational and design variables can be optimised to further reduce the health risks that can be fit for drinking purposes i e rq value 1 keywords stormwater bioretention raingardens data driven models stormwater harvesting decision tree feature selection 1 introduction heavy metals have been frequently detected in runoff samples collected from various catchments göbel et al 2007 francey et al 2010 they are mainly sourced from relevant industries metal dye and paint industries buildings particularly from metal roofs traffic activities e g tires petrol additives etc sansalone and buchberger 1997 brown and peake 2006 their concentrations vary considerably across different catchments and can often be detected in levels above local drinking water guidelines e g nhmrc 2009 as an important group of priority pollutants zgheib et al 2012 heavy metals can have a detrimental effect on both environment and human health risks christensen et al 2006 ma et al 2016 and thus proper treatment is needed before its discharge or reuse stormwater biofilters also known as bioretentions or raingardens designed as infiltration basins with media filters and vegetations have been extensively studied for their effective performance in removing suspend solids and nutrients bratieres et al 2008 micropollutant zhang et al 2014 microorganisms chandrasena et al 2019 and heavy metals read et al 2008 zinger et al 2013 for example davis et al 2003 observed over 90 removal of pb zn and cu in biofilters with effluent cu and pb levels mostly 5 µg l and zn 25 µg l nevertheless treatment performance is often inconsistent and varies to different biofilter designs literature also suggests conflicting results read et al 2008 found that vegetation did not significantly impact the effectiveness of biofilters in reducing the metal concentrations while feng et al 2012 reported that plant species were important for fe al and cr removal by mature biofilters moreover many studies suggest that most metals can be captured in the top layers of filter regardless of the type of media trenouth and gharabaghi 2015 hermawan et al 2019 while other studies found that media type was one of the most significant factors for metal removal feng et al 2012 lim et al 2015 blecken et al 2009b also observed that cu removal can be enhanced substantially by including a submerged zone sz in the design of biofilters but they found that the impact on other metals zn and pb is very small these conflicting findings indicate that further exploration of how these design factors affect heavy metal removal is needed the performance of stormwater biofiltration systems can also be largely affected by the operational conditions e g antecedent dry weather periods adwp inflow volume inflow concentrations etc feng et al 2012 tested the impact of inflow volume loading rate and inflow pollutant concentrations c in on the removal of metals in stormwater biofilters and the results suggest that inflow volume had varying impacts on metal removal while c in had no influence this contradicts to blecken et al 2009b s findings in which positive linear relationships were observed between cin and outflow concentrations extended adwp can also negatively impact the system performance although metal removal still remains relatively high and this can be improved by introducing sz blecken et al 2009a nevertheless compared to the design characteristics less research has been taken on the influence of operational conditions on metal removal despite the close links observed between operational conditions and system performance for traditional stormwater pollutants afrooz and boehm 2017 more research is particularly important if treated stormwater is to be reused as it informs ideas of how a well designed biofilter can be maintained to provide reliable water while keeping risks caused by heavy metals low although the risk to human from stormwater pollution caused by heavy metals was previously assessed based on their pollution levels ma et al 2016 there are few studies investigating how these risks could be reduced by stormwater biofilters relevant studies have been done to quantify the ability of biofilters in reducing the risks caused by microorganisms based on hypothetical treatment trains with assumptions of average pollutant reduction rates e g 1 log pathogen reduction for an average or well performing biofilter murphy et al 2017 accordingly the results from these studies often do not represent the capabilities of biofilter systems in reducing risks during real time system operation this has mainly been due to the lack of treatment data and therefore the impact of operational conditions on risk controls by stormwater biofilter has never been considered models that can predict biofilter treatment performance based on system designs and real time operations can be a great fit for such purposes the existing conceptual models e g swmm rossman 2017 or process based models randelovic et al 2016 are not designed to interface with real time data and cannot produce adaptive predictions to reflect changing operational conditions on the other hand data driven models enable the real time interaction with operational data e g kerkez et al 2016 and they can also assess how a biofilter can control health risks associated with heavy metals under various system designs and operations only recently data driven modelling also referred to as machine learning ml approaches have been applied in several biofilter studies to analyse the relationship between system design and performance based on biofilter treatment data the majority of these studies focus on the hydraulic performance e g captured runoff volume by khan et al 2013 using multiple linear regression outflow discharge rates by yang and chui 2019 using neural networks sporadic studies have investigated pollutant treatment performance e g mcnett et al 2011 investigated the correlation between inflow and outflow of total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp concentrations of biofilters using 12 general linear models glms and field data collected from 11 bioretention cells wang et al 2019 collected 182 recorded samples of biofilters including design features and control variables and then used multiple linear regression mlr algorithms to identify the optimal biofilter design based on removal efficiency of total suspended solid tss tn and tp all these studies only focus on traditional stormwater pollutants not taking into much consideration heavy metals for which there is far less data and the impact of operational conditions yet only one study by zhang et al 2021 based on a data driven approach investigated how a range of different stormwater design characteristics and operational conditions impact nutrients removal the aim of this study is to develop data driven models for prediction of metal removal in stormwater biofilters by considering both system design and operational conditions the objectives are to 1 gather a literature dataset from previous research and test three machine learning models i e multiple linear regression mlr artificial neural network nn and random forest rf algorithms for the prediction of effluent heavy metal concentrations 2 investigate the importance of various biofilter design and operational variables on heavy metal removal in biofilters based on various feature selection methods of the machine learning models and 3 assess the human health risks associated with the heavy metals in biofilter outflows under various designs and operational conditions to the authors knowledge this is also the first study that includes operational variables in a data driven approach to predict the performance of stormwater biofilters in heavy metal removal and risk control the results of which could be applied to further optimise the system operation to ensure a low risk from stormwater 2 methodology fig 1 illustrates the overall methodology of this study it consists of 1 dataset creation and preparation e g transformation section 2 1 that aim to evaluate the data collected from various sources literature in this case 2 ml testing section 2 2 that contains the introduction of three ml models preliminary testing transformation model structures etc as well as robust testing methods 3 feature selection section 2 3 that investigates the importance of design and operational variables in heavy metal removal and 4 explorative risk assessment section 2 4 based on hypothetical biofilter design and operational scenarios generated using the best ml models 2 1 creation of dataset variable selection the impact of various design and operational variables on performance of stormwater biofilters has been widely reported in the literature e g blecken et al 2009a feng et al 2012 mohanty and boehm 2014 lim et al 2015 afrooz and boehm 2017 table 1 summarises the design and operational variables suggested in the literature database formation data was collected following the steps 1 searching literature through web of science by using topics of raingardens or stormwater biofilter or stormwater retention to find stormwater biofilter studies from 1993 to 2019 this led to a total of 742 results then 2 manually looking into the title abstracts and keywords of all these papers to shortlist the studies that reported heavy metal removal this resulted in a total of 88 papers 3 carefully reading through each paper to select the papers that reported all the variables included in table 1 this step was also assisted with going through references of each paper to find any relevant studies that were missing from the first step of search this led to a final list of 22 paper including 7 papers in which the authors have raw data the full list of publications available in supplementary information si and lastly 4 thoroughly reading through each paper to extract the biofilter performance data for seven heavy metals cd cr cu fe ni pb and zn for inflow and outflow concentrations only the data that can represent the event mean concentration emc were recorded in cases when only removal rates were reported the outflow concentrations were calculated by the authors to be added into the database due to the scarcity of the performance data on heavy metals we also tried to visually retrieve the data from the figures in the literature by manually measuring the length of the point indicating concentrations to the axis and benchmarking against the axis scale the initial dataset included a total of 1716 points however the data points that do not contain the full list of the design and operational variables table 1 were excluded leading to a total of 1347 effective data points this was then divided into seven sub datasets one for each metal 156 232 points for different metals summary statistics of each sub dataset is given in table s1 of the si the creation of dataset based on literature studies was also practiced in previous studies on using a data driven approach to predict biofilter performance wang et al 2019 data pre processing the non numeric design variables e g presence of vegetation submerged zone were encoded into binary values 1 for presence and 0 for non presence although some vegetation are effective while some are ineffective e g feng et al 2012 not all the reviewed studies investigated this and it was simply classified as two categories with without vegetation across the reviewed papers a wide range of media types were used in this study these were grouped into three types media with high organic matter which may have high absorbance potential but has a risk of leaching out nutrients assigned a nominal value 0 media mixed with top soil often practiced in field assigned a nominal value 1 and sandy media reported to have effective performance assigned a nominal value 2 before testing probability plots histograms for all the pollutants were developed for an overview of the data and the normality was assessed most data do not follow normal distribution and are predominantly right skewed which as they come from multiple sources of literature was expected therefore z score normalisation and log transformation of the data were performed and the transformed datasets as well as the raw datasets were firstly tested as described in the next section 2 2 machine learning ml model development and testing 2 2 1 brief introduction of the ml approaches three different machine learning ml approaches were applied in this study to predict stormwater biofilter outflow concentrations by using the eleven design and operational variables table 1 the first approach was the multiple linear regression mlr model which is a common ml approach that has been used mostly by researchers in stormwater biofilter studies to predict the system performance e g khan et al 2013 and wang et al 2019 the second approach was artificial neural networks nn which have been used previously to simulate hydrologic performance of green infrastructure e g yang and chui 2019 however have not been applied to test stormwater biofilter treatment performance nn is a black box approach as it does not reveal what it does or how it does it the third ml approach used was random forest rf it is an ensemble method that trains several decision trees in parallel with bootstrapping followed by aggregation jointly referred to as bagging method breiman 2001 and has been applied in previous stormwater research to identify first flush phenomenon perera et al 2019 unlike the decision tree method which uses all the available data and the best variable to split the data at each tree node according to a criterion to measure the quality of a split each node in rf is split using the best amongst a subset of variables randomly chosen at the node on the other hand an individual decision tree in the random forest is uniquely constructed by subset of training dataset using different subsets of available variables by aggregating many decision trees in the forest rf can limit the over fitting as well as variance and error due to bias and therefore yields more useful results in addition rf has embedded feature selection function to identify the relative importance of each variable by determining how often it appears in each tree and where it appears in the tree variables that appear higher in the tree are given more importance thus rf is regarded as a white box approach which was applied in this study to identify the relative importance of design and operational variables to the biofilter performance 2 2 2 model construction training and validation preliminary testing was done both to investigate the necessity of transforming the raw data for mlr comparing the performance of the models when raw data z score transformed data and log transformed data were used and also to determine the structure and parameters used in the nn and rf models the statsmodel module in python 3 programming language was used to set up the mlr model and the ordinary least square regression was used to fit the model parameters the neural network was built by the dense layer from keras with the tensorflow library a basic nn model was structured with 11 nodes in the input layer i e 11 variables and one node in the output layer i e outflow concentrations adam was selected as the optimiser of the nn which generates the individual learning rates for different parameters using a large number of neurons and hidden layers can lead to over fitting conversely selecting smaller network size will limit its ability to learn the non linear and complex relationships within the data thus preliminary testing was done to determine the other parameters of the nn e g number of hidden layers 1 2 and hidden nodes 2 8 activation function relu tanh and number of epochs 500 10 000 the initial ranges of these parameters were selected using a trial and error method to cover the possible size of the network so it was large enough to see both over and under fitting it was decided after the preliminary testing to set a single hidden layer epochs number of 2000 and the activation function as tanh since it always outperformed relu for the applied dataset in nn only the z scheme normalised data was used because previous studies have suggested that normalised data can generally speed up the learning process and lead to faster convergence the random forest rf model was constructed by using the randomforestregressor module in the scikit learn package pedregosa et al 2011 similarly preliminary testing was done to determine key parameters i e number of trees n estimator from 20 500 criterion mean square error or mean absolute error maximum tree depth max depth from 1 20 and the number of features to consider when looking for the best split max features auto or sqrt or log2 of total number of input variables except for max depth which varied based on pollutant type from 3 to 7 all other parameters were observed to not be sensitive for the model performance during training and validation and thus default values were chosen rf is based on decision trees which are not sensitive to the data scaling kotu and deshpande 2019 thus no data transformation was done for rf during these preliminary testing 80 of data from the full datasets were randomly selected for model training and the remaining 20 for model validation the error evaluation of the model was achieved by calculating the nash sutcliffe efficiency index nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 nse was also used to assess the model robustness in previous biofilter modelling studies e g process based models randelovic et al 2016 and data driven models zhang et al 2021 although nse is sensitive to high values in this case concentrations krause et al 2005 it was suitable for this study as high concentrations are of concern with regards to the potential health risks it shall be noted preliminary testing was also done to include other error metrics e g r2 and mean square error and significant correlations were found between nse and these metrics pearson correlation r 0 82 p 0 01 and accordingly there was no difference in selecting the suitable model structure and parameters therefore only nse was used in the full model testing due to the high variability and limited number of data points in the raw dataset preliminary testing was also done to determine the use of n fold training and validation n 10 20 50 100 200 500 and 1000 method based on nn models it was found that the model performance was quite unstable e g the range of nse maximum nse values did not stabilise unless at least 100 fold training and validation was used therefore it was decided to use 100 fold training and validation approach in the robust testing robust testing a 100 fold training and validation was applied to fit and rigorously test all the three models for all the heavy metals i e repeat the training and validation as explained in preliminary testing i e 80 20 split 100 times 2 3 selection of the important design and operational variables the importance of key design and operational variables was investigated as previous studies often show biases of different types of ml methods for feature selection e g greenland et al 1986 strobl et al 2007 therefore to ensure the robustness of feature selection results it was decided to apply four different feature selection approaches in investigating the important design and operational variables firstly by using the mlr which was trained using the normalised data the regression coefficients p values estimated from training allowed us to learn which variables have a significant influence i e p 0 05 on the outflow concentrations those bigger regression coefficients indicated a larger impact schielzeth 2010 secondly the feature selection function of rf was used to identify the relative importance of design and operational variables to biofilter performance when training a tree it is possible to compute how much each variable decreases the impurity the more a variable decreases the impurity the more important this variable is by estimating the mean decrease in impurity mdi across all the trees in rf and across the 100 fold iterations the final importance and ranking of the variable was determined this approach has been used in previous stormwater studies to identify the factors of first flush perera et al 2019 the second approach computes feature selection using a training set hence it does not reflect the impact of a feature in the prediction performance and can inflate the importance of numerical features therefore a third approach was selected which uses permutation importance function of rf sklearn inspection permutation importance altmann et al 2010 in this approach the performance of rf was initially evaluated by using all design and operational variables baseline metrics then a variable from the validation set is permuted and the metric is evaluated again the permutation importance is then defined to be the difference between the baseline metric and metric estimated after permutating the variable lastly boruta an all relevant feature selection method kursa and rudnicki 2010 was also applied in this study using the borutapy package in python 3 this method tries to find all features carrying information usable for prediction rather than finding a possibly compact subset of features on which some classifier regressor has a minimal error instead of ranking the features it gives confirmed tentative rejected features that are respectively important unsure unimportant to the dependent features to illustrate the importance of the variables the number of times that a variable was selected as the top three ranked feature or the confirmed features in boruta were counted then comparisons of the results were presented to investigate how important features varied across a different pollutants and b different methods as shown in fig 3 2 4 explorative risk assessment risk assessment procedure in this study was performed in four steps 1 hazard identification 2 exposure assessment 3 dose response assessment and 4 risk characterisation the risk assessment of this part was done only for cd zn and ni which based on the robust model testing section 2 2 had best performance the results are presented in section 3 1 1 hazard identification this was the process to estimate the heavy metal concentrations in biofilter effluent by using the best ml models for each metal based on the robust testing as the input to ml models a total of 10 000 different hypothetical designs and operational conditions were generated by randomly sampling the values of all design and operational variables as in table 1 from uniform distributions for numerical variables informed by the range of the raw dataset fig s1 of si the inter relationships of all the variables were checked using the pearson correlation and no significant and strong correlations were found r values were always below 0 04 for the significant correlations it should be noted that although each variable in the raw data did not follow normal uniform distributions this study tried to generate a large number of scenarios for the explorative modelling table s3 of the supplementary information presents the summary statistics of the input variables as well as the predicted outflow concentrations and removal rates 2 exposure assessment this was the assessment of the risk to human health through various exposure pathways associated with the reuse of stormwater as shown in table 2 with the volume of water ingested per event and exposure frequency for each exposure pathway taken from relevant references similar exposure pathways were also used by murphy et al 2017 to estimate risks caused by campylobacter during stormwater reuse chronic daily intake cdi through ingestion per unit body weight mg kg day can be calculated using eq 1 as proposed in usepa 1989 and also applied in previous studies by ma et al 2016 while this study only focuses on the accidental ingestions which pose the highest risk to human other pathways like dermal contact could also be included in future studies e g ma et al 2016 1 cdi c ir ef ed bw at c mg l measured predicted concentration of heavy metals in inflow or outflow of biofilter ir l event water ingestion rate volume intake during each event ef event person year exposure frequency as in table 2 ed exposure period years exposure duration 70 years for an adult bw kg body weight 70 kg for an adult at days average lifespan 25 550 days for an adult 3 dose response assessment this was to determine reference dose rfd mg kg day which is the usepa defined maximum acceptable dose above which people is susceptible to toxic substances similar to the predicted no effect concentration pnec as used in australian guidelines nhmrc 2011 iris 2020 the rfd values are summarized in table s2 of si for all metals 4 risk characterisation health risk is characterised as risk quotient rq which is calculated as per eq 2 the approach has been commonly used to estimate human risks associated with heavy metals and organic micropollutants etchepare and van der hoek 2015 ma et al 2016 2 r q c d i r f d rq 1 indicates heavy metals in stormwater can pose risk to human health while hi 1 indicates that they are not of concern the rq values in both biofilter inflow i e untreated stormwater and outflow were estimated in this study which enables the authors to assess whether stormwater biofilters can produce reusable water for various pathways and how the design and operational conditions can influence the risks which subsequently can allow real time control of risks 3 results and discussion 3 1 overall performance of ml models results from preliminary testing revealed all the pollutants were insensitive to three data pre processing methods i e raw data z score transformation and log transformation except for cu figure s1 and s2 in si for cu the best performance was achieved when using the z score transformed and log transformed data nse train 0 40 and nse validation 0 15 and the worst performance was observed when using the raw dataset of cu nse train 0 20 and nse validation 0 as such it is recommended that the raw data should be transformed before being fed into the relevant ml models e g nn comparing the three ml models mlr nn and rf based on robust testing results training phase fig 2 rf models were found to be the best in simulating outflow concentrations of most pollutants e g cd median nse 0 995 cr 0 317 cu 0 762 fe 0 636 ni 0 726 zn 0 896 and pb 0 656 moreover rf models produced the smallest interquartile ranges of training nse values showing its relatively higher robustness mlr models generally performed worse than the other two models with the lowest nse during training in regard to validation all ml models became less stable due to the higher variability in nse results across 100 simulations taking cu for example a worse predictive ability was found median nse dropped to 0 267 and the interquartile range of nse in validation was 13 5 times larger than that in training for the rf model fig 2 these models performance varied across different pollutants best fits were observed for cd ni and zn with their median nse values validation phase of 0 964 0 393 and 0 530 respectively across all models their interquartile box ranges were also mostly in positive nse values models for cu showed lower predictive abilities median nse validation 0 095 0 297 with the nn being the best model for cu nse validation 0 297 these models had the worst prediction outcomes when they were applied to datasets of cr fe pb pollutants since the validation nses were lower than 0 1 and were often negative however the rf model still performed relatively better with positive median nse values for cr whereas mlr did best for pb the whole interquartile had positive nse values the variations in model performance for different pollutant types were also reported in previous studies on process based detailed models for a typical stormwater biofilter design randelovic et al 2016 e g nse 0 575 in training and nse 0 545 in validation for glyphosate and nse 0 511 in training and nse 0 285 in validation for simazine nevertheless for some metals in this study i e cr cu fe and pb the differences of nse between the model training and validation were very large average nsetraining 0 59 and nsevalidation 0 04 indicating potential over fitting and poor generalisation issues this might be due to the large variances in the original dataset which was collected from multiple studies that were conducted under very different conditions for example cin of cu varied from 2 1 to 570 µg l and ir varied from 11 to 1178 mm hr across all studies the inclusion of both binary values for some parameters while others are continuous may induce imbalance to the dataset and have potential impact on the model performance however further testing needs to be done to confirm this impact previous data driven studies on stormwater biofilter attempted to use data from similar experiments to reduce the noise in original dataset e g zhang et al 2021 the purpose of this study however was to capture how these vast different conditions can impact the system performance detailed in the next section a previous biofilter data driven modelling study by wang et al 2019 limited the number of records taken from each publication to avoid dependency on one or several studies due to the scarcity of biofilter treatment performance data in heavy metals especially when considering the availability of both design and operational variables the same method was not adopted in this study i e all the available data from each study was taken this may potentially impact the model performance due to the imbalance between datasets from different studies however for other metals i e cd zn and ni the ml models had relatively good performance i e average nsetraining 0 79 and nsevalidation 0 63 showing good level of generalisation this further confirms the necessity of conducting rigorous testing e g 100 fold training and validation to ensure the robustness of the ml models and use of the reliable model in future applications e g only the models for well performing metals cd zn and ni were used in the risk assessment 3 2 key design and operational variables on biofilter performance the results from feature selection fig 3 show that overall ir and cin are most important to all pollutants i e they were most frequently selected as top 3 features across all the selection methods these findings correlate with a recent study by zhang et al 2021 who found that ir and cin are the two most important operational variables that influence nutrients outflow concentrations from stormwater biofilters based on statistical models lower ir corresponds to the higher retention that has been previously found to improve metal removal as it provides more contact between media and metal ions hermawan et al 2019 inflow concentrations c in however were previously found to have less or no influence on outflow concentrations in experimental studies feng et al 2012 which contradicts this study as well as a previous study by blecken et al 2009b who observed a positive relationship between inflow concentration and overall mean outflow concentrations this is a very interesting and important finding the impact of c in on treatment performance during experimental studies are often investigated by dosing a spike of pollution over several events or a short period of time e g feng et al 2012 which may not be able to completely change the microbial communities of the system and thus the biofilter will still buffer these short spikes well and deliver a good treatment nevertheless we believe that a different cin entering biofilter systems over a long period can affect the treatment which was evidenced in both this study and the study by blecken et al 2009b with four sampling events that had varied cin the ratio of system size to catchment size was also found to be important for zn ni and cd fig 3 this differed from wang et al 2019 s study in which they found the ratio had little effect on cu pb and zn removal in this study a similar variable inflow flux was found to have little impact to the system performance which is also different from the previous laboratory study by feng et al 2012 who found the inflow volume had varying impacts on metal removal e g negatively correlated to cu and pb outflow concentrations positively correlated to fe al and cr outflow concentrations due to the different reactivity of these metals often inflow flux volume is related to the size of the biofilter i e ratio however they impact the system performance in different ways for example oversized or undersized systems always suffer from prolonged drying or extreme wetting conditions that can challenge the system over long term periods and negatively impact the system health on the other hand inflow flux is an operational parameter that varies depending on different rain events and is less likely to incur a long term impact on the system performance indeed laboratory studies are often relatively short e g up to one year to cover the seasonal effects feng et al 2012 making it difficult to investigate these long term effects nevertheless the data driven approach has demonstrated its ability in investigating the performance of different systems from multiple studies that are exposed to different inflow flux conditions in a long term other design and operational variables are relatively less important and the importance of each variable does vary across specific types of heavy metal depending on the type of feature selection methods for example the sz presence is only regarded as the top 3 important feature to all pollutants based on the mlr fig 3 which agrees with the previous study by blecken et al 2009b who found the presence of a sz can enhance heavy metal removal the impact of ponding depth has not been specifically investigated in biofilter studies and this study shows that it is an important factor for cd and cu removal the vegetation species were observed to be important for pb as top 3 feature suggested by three methods and for ni and fe as top 3 feature suggested by just one method indeed the contradictory results have been often observed in literature regarding the impact of vegetation types e g read et al 2008 observed that vegetation species did not significantly impact metal concentrations fe ni al cu pb zn while feng et al 2012 reported that vegetation was important for fe al and cr removal but had no impact on pb cu zn in this study filter media type and depth were also found to not be important at all for all the pollutants it was however found to be one of the significant factors for treatment of metals in the biofilter feng et al 2012 and lim et al 2015 3 3 investigation of biofilters in controlling the health risks the estimated rq values show that raw stormwater i e biofilter inflow contains heavy metals at levels that can cause human health risks when used directly for drinking rq 1 0 for cd but can be safely used in all other pathways fig 4 the rq plot for ni can be found in figure s3 of the si the health risks can be effectively reduced through biofilter treatment with decreased rq values estimated for all conditions fig 4 the effectiveness of biofilters in removing heavy metals are also reported in previous studies that approximately over 90 of cu zn pb can be removed hatt et al 2007 sun and davis 2007 feng et al 2012 also observed that all metals in biofilter outflow met standards for irrigation and except for fe and al other metals cu cr zn and pb were also satisfactorily removed with regards to drinking water quality standards based on the assessment of thousands of hypothetical system design and operational conditions using ml approaches the current study provides new evidence from a health risk perspective to show that biofilters can produce reliable water with low risk to all different exposure pathways except drinking when considering the contamination by cd nevertheless as suggested by feng et al 2012 if the treated water is to be used for drinking the optimisation of biofilters designs are still needed to improve the system performance this study shows that this could be done through the optimisation of not just the system design but more importantly also the operational conditions as the risks posed by cd were of concern after biofilter treatment the impact of the top three key design and operational variables identified in the previous section i e cin ratio and ponding depth were further explored with the estimated rq values plotted against various ranges of these variables in fig 5 as shown these factors have very clear impacts on the health risks associated with the biofilter outflow for example cin was found to be positively correlated to the rq values estimated from outflow concentrations pearson correlation r 0 529 p 0 05 and the interquartile ranges of rq can be managed to be lower than 1 0 if cin is maintained under 120 µg l similar observations were also acquired with regards to design ponding depth and ratio of the system the values of which can be set at 0 28 m and 3 75 respectively to maintain a low potential of health risks i e rq 1 associated with the reuse of stormwater after biofilter treatment in this way the ml models can be used as a predictive tool for assessing health risks 4 conclusions previous literature on how biofilter design and operational conditions influence heavy metal removal often report conflicting findings and the human health risks associated with heavy metals in stormwater biofilter outflows and how different designs and operational variables influence the risks were not well researched this study applied three machine learning ml approaches multilinear regression mlr neural network nn and random forest rf for the first time to predict the performance of stormwater biofilters in removing heavy metal and controlling the associated human health risks it was also able to provide additional understanding of how biofilter designs as well as the operational conditions influence the biofilter outflow heavy metal concentrations and the associated risks based on a range of studies i e covering various design and operational conditions the key findings are robustness testing showed that rf remained highly robust and outperformed the other two models during the training phase average nash sutcliffe efficiency nse 0 995 cd 0 317 cr 0 762 cu 0 636 fe 0 726 ni 0 896 zn and 0 656 pb however in the validation phase all models became less stable with the better performance found for cd average nse 0 964 zn 0 530 and ni 0 393 and poorer performance observed for cu 0 219 pb 0 058 fe 0 054 and cr 0 062 based on feature selection analysis ir and cin were found to be important variables for all metals and the ratio of system size and catchment size was also found to be important for zn ni and cd ponding depth was observed to be an important design variable for cd and cu other design and operational variables are relatively less important and the importance of each variable changes for specific type of heavy metal explorative risk assessment showed stormwater biofilters were able to reduce health risks associated with heavy metals and produce reliable water fit for different purpose of reuse with

16948,a monitoring strategy was implemented at two drinking water treatment plants in quebec canada to evaluate microbial reduction performances of full scale treatment processes under different source water conditions β d glucuronidase activity in source water was automatically monitored in near real time to establish baseline and event conditions at each location high volume water samples 50 1 500 l were collected at the inflow and the outflow of coagulation flocculation filtration and uv disinfection processes and were analysed for two naturally occurring surrogate organisms escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens source water cryptosporidium data and full scale c perfringens reduction data were entered into a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra model to estimate daily infection risks associated with exposures to cryptosporidium via consumption of treated drinking water daily mean e coli and cryptosporidium concentrations in source water under event conditions were in the top 5 agricultural site or in the top 15 urban site of what occurs through the year at these drinking water treatment plants reduction performances of up to 6 0 log for e coli and 5 6 log for c perfringens were measured by concentrating high volume water samples throughout the treatment train for both drinking water treatment plants removal performances by coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes were at the high end of the range of those reported in the literature for bacteria and bacterial spores reductions of e coli and c perfringens by floc blanket clarification ballasted clarification and rapid sand filtration did not deteriorate during two snowmelt rainfall events qmra results suggested that daily infection risks were similar during two rainfall snowmelt events than during baseline conditions additional studies investigating full scale reductions would be desirable to improve the evaluation of differences in treatment performances

drinking waterborne outbreaks occurring in affluent nations since 2000 were recently compiled in literature reviews moreira and bondelind 2017 hrudey and hrudey 2019 heavy rain and inadequate treatment of surface water sources were potential causative factors for outbreaks caused by cryptosporidium giardia norovirus and shigella sonnei hrudey hrudey 2019 concluded that the occurrence of waterborne outbreaks after heavy rainfall is certainly common enough to justify increased vigilance for such events as the frequency and the magnitude of extreme rainfall events are projected to increase under climate change scenarios ipcc 2014 enhanced focus on the management of weather events has been recommended in future revisions of guidance documents for drinking water quality khan et al 2015 howard et al 2016 the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach can be valuable to calculate risks associated with hazardous events and support risk management decisions medema and ashbolt 2006 medema and smeets 2009 smeets et al 2010 petterson and ashbolt 2016 in qmra microbial reduction performances by physicochemical and disinfection processes are generally assumed to follow first order kinetics with respect to the micro organisms influent concentrations haas et al 1999 the concentration of an organism in treated drinking water is therefore expected to be directly proportional to its source water concentration several studies showed that microbial concentrations in surface water increase by orders of magnitude over short periods during heavy rainfall and snowmelt events atherholt et al 1998 kistemann et al 2002 signor et al 2005 dorner et al 2007 sylvestre et al 2020b consequently weather events could be critical drivers of the infection risk to water consumers signor et al 2007 there are however limited high resolution data on the microbial reduction performance of drinking water treatment processes to investigate whether the first order assumption holds under variable microbial loads at the source full scale microbial reduction performances are typically assessed with naturally occurring i e not spiked surrogate micro organisms because pathogen concentrations are too low after treatment barriers surrogate organisms can be detected after full scale treatment by concentrating high volume water samples on site payment et al 2002 hijnen et al 2007 spores of sulphite reducing clostridia including clostridium perfringens have been recommended as conservative surrogates for index protozoan pathogens cryptosporidium giardia removal through conventional treatment payment and franco 1993 hijnen et al 2000 who 2017 thermotolerant coliforms including escherichia coli were found to be a proper surrogate for an index bacterial pathogen campylobacter removal by rapid sand filtration hijnen et al 1998 and inactivation by ozonation smeets and medema 2006 identifying microbial peaks in source water can be challenging because these events can occur within a short time frame burnet et al 2019 culture based methods are of limited value for identifying these peaks because they typically require 24 hour incubation periods alternatively β d glucuronidase gluc activity a conservative biochemical proxy parameter for bacterial faecal pollution can be automatically monitored in source water in near real time ryzinska paier et al 2014 koschelnik et al 2015 demeter et al 2020 this technology has recently supported the development of monitoring programs to characterize microbial peaks at drinking water intakes burnet et al 2019 sylvestre et al 2020a sylvestre et al 2020b and to inform an investigation of the removal of human enteric viruses by full scale drinking water treatment processes sylvestre et al 2021 the objective of this study was to evaluate microbial reduction performances of full scale treatment processes at two drinking water treatment plants under different source water conditions an event based sampling strategy informed by online gluc activity monitoring and meteorological conditions was implemented to capture variations in performance between baseline and event conditions source water pathogen data and surrogate organism reduction data were entered into a qmra model to assess human health risks associated with the consumption of drinking water 2 material and methods 2 1 catchment and drinking water treatment descriptions two drinking water treatment plants dwtps were selected for this study dwtp a abstracts raw water from a small agricultural river annual average flow rate of the river is 16 m3 s situated in southern quebec the microbial water quality of source water at dwtp a can be influenced by four combined sewer overflows csos and a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharging 10 km upstream of the drinking water intake at the wwtp human sewage is treated through an aerated pond and discharged into the river at an average rate of 10 000 m3 day cattle and swine manure is applied for agriculture in the catchment area buffer strips of at least 3 m from the river are required gouvernement du québec 2018 during the sampling campaigns dwtp a was operated at a capacity of approximately 3500 m3 d 1 about 20 of the design rate 18 000 m3 d 1 during water treatment potassium permanganate kmno4 0 6 mg l 1 was first added to the raw water after permanganate oxidation polyaluminum chloride pacl pax xl8 110 mg l 1 and cationic polyacrylamide c 492 dosing rate 0 11 mg l 1 were added in water at ph 6 2 and temperature of approximately 10 c and processed by ultrapulsator floc blanket clarification suez quebec canada the settled water was then filtered by four single media sand filters 0 8 m h 1 140 cm sand and disinfected by a medium

characterization of the catchment and the treatment barriers of dwtp b is detailed elsewhere sylvestre et al 2021 briefly dwtp b is supplied by a large urban river under the influence of around 180 csos and 14 municipal wwtps during the sampling period dwtp b was operated at about 40 of the design rate 120 000 m3 d 1 the raw water was processed by actiflo microsand ballasted clarification and was then treated by a combination of inter ozonation and granular activated carbon gac filtration referred to as biological activated carbon bac filtration the filtered water was disinfected with a low pressure uv system fluence 40 mj cm 2 and sodium hypochlorite naocl treatment processes were optimized for turbidity reduction during sampling campaigns 2 2 sampling campaigns 2 2 1 definition of baseline and event conditions at each dwtp an automated rapid on site monitoring system coliminder vwm gmbh vienna austria was installed approximately one month before evaluating microbial reduction performances during this period the gluc activity level was measured at frequencies varying between 1 and 3 h variations in raw water quality were investigated during the autumn at dwtp a three sampling campaigns were carried out under baseline conditions baseline a1 baseline a2 baseline a3 and one campaign was undertaken under event conditions event a1 baseline conditions were defined as dry weather conditions 48 hour total rainfall 0 mm event conditions were established using two criteria wet weather conditions 48 hour total rainfall 40 mm and a relative change in gluc activity variation 5 mmfu 100 ml over 1 h a relative change in gluc activity was chosen to ensure the characterization of the whole gluc activity peak a change of 5 mmfu 100 ml was set based on observed changes during three rainfall events at this dwtp supplementary figure 1 and two rainfall snowmelt events previously characterized at an urban dwtp sylvestre et al 2020b single grab sample baseline conditions and sequential grab samples event conditions n 3 of raw settled 200 l filtered 1000 l and uv disinfected 1500 l waters were collected to match theoretical mean hydraulic residence times through clarification 3 h filtration and uv disinfection 2 h a verroneau personal communication additionally under event conditions six 30 to 40 litres samples of raw water were filtered on site over 24 h to estimate the daily mean cryptosporidium concentration three campaigns under baseline conditions baseline b1 baseline b2 baseline b3 and two campaigns under event conditions event b1 event b2 were carried out during the spring freshet at dwtp b online gluc activity measurements were used in early february 2018 to trigger grab sampling of raw water event b1 this first campaign was undertaken to evaluate how a planned discharge of raw sewage at an upstream wwtp influenced source water quality at dwtp b discharge circumstances and a general characterization of the wwtp are provided elsewhere sylvestre et al 2021 in early march 2018 a short term increase in gluc activity of approximately 20 mmfu 100 ml was observed in the absence of recent snowmelt events 48 hour total snowmelt 2 cm and rainfall events 48 hour total rainfall 0 mm an increase in gluc activity of 20 mmfu 100 ml in dry weather conditions was considered relevant for event based sampling because similar increases were observed in this study during the planned discharge of raw sewage event b1 and during two wet weather events previously characterized at an urban dwtp sylvestre et al 2020b event based samples were collected over four days to quantify the reduction by treatment processes during this gluc activity peak event b2 baseline campaigns were carried out after event b2 at gluc activity levels approximately 20 mmfu 100 ml below levels observed during event b1 and event b2 single grab sample baseline conditions and sequential grab samples event conditions n 4 of raw settled 200 l filtered 1000 l and uv disinfected 1500 l water were collected to match theoretical mean hydraulic residence times through clarification 0 5 h ozonation filtration and uv disinfection 1 5 h m marchand personal communication additionally grab 25 to 30 l samples were filtered on site to estimate the mean cryptosporidium concentration in raw water under baseline conditions n 3 and event conditions n 3 2 2 2 sample concentration raw water samples were concentrated with hemoflow hf80s filters fresenius ontario canada for the enumeration of cryptosporidium concentrates were shipped overnight in coolers at 4 c to the centre d expertise en analyse environnementale du québec ceaeq in quebec city qc and processed within 48 h of sampling the hemoflow concentration method was also used to concentrate naturally occurring e coli and c perfringens spores in raw settled filtered and uv disinfected water samples one tank was filled with 50 l of settled water multiple tanks of 1000 l were filled with 1000 1500 l of filtered water or uv disinfected water the water was pumped through the hemoflow hf80s filter fresenius ontario canada at a minimum speed of 4 l per minute the overpressure over the filter was increased to a maximum of 0 7 bar until the water filtrate was pressed through the walls of the straws with a speed of around 0 9 l min veenendaal and brouwer hanzens 2007 installations with four hemoflow filters in parallel were built to concentrate high volume water samples faster 6 5 h the concentration process was stopped when the concentrate volume only filled the hoses filtrate water was pumped through the hoses once and then collected in a sterile bottle the total end volume was approximately 600 ml samples were kept at 4 c and analysed within 24 h the recovery rate of the hemoflow concentration method was evaluated for raw water samples collected at each dwtp the recovery rate was calculated as the ratio of the surrogate concentration in an un concentrated grab sample to its concentration in a hemoflow concentrated sample 100 l at dwtp a 20 l at dwtp b recovery rates of 103 for e coli and 125 for c perfringens were measured at dwtp a a recovery rate of 124 was measured for c perfringens at dwtp b but no recovery rate was determined for e coli at dwtp b recovery rates of 100 were assumed for the calculations of all e coli and c perfringens concentrations 2 2 3 sample processing and analysis hemoflow filter eluate volumes for enumeration of cryptosporidium oocysts were approximately 500 700 ml post concentration was carried out by centrifugation to obtain a final volume between 20 and 50 ml and a packed pellet volume between 2 and 5 ml between 20 and 50 of the packed pellet volume was then processed by immunomagnetic separation ims before sample staining and examination following usepa method 1623 1 usepa 2012 sample specific recovery rates were measured for each sample collected under baseline and event conditions fluorescently labelled controls colorseed were spiked at a target dose of 98 100 oo cysts in the raw water sample before careful manual mixing and on site concentration using the hemoflow method volumes of hemoflow filter eluates for the enumeration of surrogate organisms were approximately 600 ml from these volumes two aliquots of 100 200 ml were taken to detect e coli and c perfringens spores e coli was enumerated by the defined substrate technology using the idexx quanti tray 2000 system with colilert reagent apha 2005 spores of c perfringens were enumerated on m cp medium as described previously armon and payment 1988 2 3 statistical analysis 2 3 1 exceedance probabilities for source water microbial concentrations exceedance probabilities eps were calculated to determine probabilities that source water concentrations would be exceeded based on historical monitoring data temporal variations in concentrations were assumed to be lognormally distributed the parameters of the lognormal distributions were inferred from e coli data collected weekly for 5 years 2013 2017 and cryptosporidium data collected monthly for approximately 2 years between 2012 and 2016 estimations and inferences were carried out in a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo mcmc as previously described sylvestre et al 2020a c eps were computed for daily mean source water cryptosporidium concentrations adjusted for the recovery efficiency and daily mean source water e coli concentrations this model was implemented using r v3 4 1 the r code is provided in the supplementary material 2 3 2 quantification of reduction by treatment processes the reduction performance of each treatment process was evaluated by comparing the inflow concentration c i n and the outflow concentration c o u t of the surrogate organism point estimates of reduction i e removal or inactivation representing the log reduction lr across a treatment unit paired sample were calculated by the following equation 1 1 lr log 10 c i n c o u t the average percent reduction expressed as effective log reduction l r effective was calculated as follows 1 2 l r effective log 10 c i n c o u t this approach for quantifying the l r effective assigns equal weights to concentrations the standard error of the mean log reduction σ lr was evaluated to provide a simple measure of uncertainty of the lr it can be regarded as the dispersion of the lr across a treatment unit paired sample around the mean lr the standard error was calculated as follows 1 3 σ lr s lr n where s lr is the standard deviation of all lrs evaluated across a treatment unit paired sample and n is the sample size non detects were replaced by a detection limit of 1 organism per volume of sample each treatment step was assumed to behave as a plug low reactor operated hydraulically at a steady state during the sampling period 2 3 3 quantitative microbial risk assessment site specific raw water cryptosporidium data and c perfringens reduction data were entered in a qmra model to quantify daily risks of infection by cryptosporidium via consumption of treated drinking water a linear low dose approximation to the single hit dose response relationship was adopted to simplify calculations the risk of infection associated with exposure to more than one oocyst was assumed to be negligible the daily probability of infection under baseline conditions p inf baseline was calculated as follows 1 4 p inf baseline c baseline 10 l r baseline v r where c baseline is the cryptosporidium concentration in raw water adjusted for the recovery efficiency under baseline conditions l r baseline is the total reduction of c perfringens by treatment processes under baseline conditions v is the ingested volume of drinking water per person per day and r is the probability that any single ingested cryptosporidium oocyst succeeds in infecting the host c baseline were not measured at dwtp a we assumed that c baseline was the arithmetic mean cryptosporidium concentration in source water evaluated with monthly sampling for 2 years the daily probability of infection under event conditions was evaluated as follows 1 5 p inf event c event 10 lr event v r where c event is the mean cryptosporidium concentration in raw water adjusted for the recovery efficiency under event conditions and lr event is the reduction of c perfringens by treatment processes under event conditions it was conservatively assumed that 1 all detected cryptosporidium oocysts in raw water were human infectious 2 the reduction of bacterial spores was equivalent to the reduction of oocysts teunis et al 1997 barbeau et al 2000 and 3 free chlorine did not inactivate cryptosporidium parvum oocysts venczel et al 1997 the ingested volume v was set to 1 litre per person per day and the single oocyst infectivity r was set to 0 2 to be consistent with the qmra model applied in the who guidelines for drinking water quality gdwq who 2017 e coli reduction data were not entered into a qmra model because concentrations of bacterial pathogens in source water were not available and e coli reductions by chlorine disinfection processes were not measured however the risk of infection by bacterial pathogens should be very low at these sites because in general bacteria are very sensitive to chlorine petterson and stenström 2015 3 results 3 1 agricultural drinking water treatment plant a temporal variations in gluc activity e coli concentrations and c perfringens concentrations in raw water during fall 2017 at dwtp a are illustrated with a time series plot fig 2 a the gluc activity decreased from 30 mmfu 100 ml in mid october to 5 mmfu 100 ml in november four gluc activity peaks of similar duration approximately 24 h and different amplitudes 40 160 mmfu 100 ml were measured during this period the performance of treatment processes was assessed during a gluc activity peak with an amplitude of 40 mmfu 100 ml temporal variations in turbidity and daily rainfall are illustrated in supplementary figure 1 the relationship between these parameters and gluc activity at this site is discussed elsewhere sylvestre et al 2020b at the source exceedance probabilities ep for e coli during baseline a2 and baseline a3 were 14 and 38 table 1 the ep during event a1 was 0 8 3 days per year the ep for cryptosporidium in event conditions was also low 5 4 mean raw water c perfringens concentrations were 0 5 log higher under event conditions 109 cfu 100 ml n 6 than under baseline conditions 39 cfu 100 ml n 3 in the treatment train e coli was detected in all filtered water samples n 6 and c perfringens was detected in all filtered and uv disinfected water samples n 6 fig 3 e coli concentrations in uv disinfected water samples were not reported because autofluorescence potentially led to false positive results the hourly abstraction flow rate and the turbidity of settled water were similar under baseline and event conditions supplementary table 1 the water temperature was 10 c lower during baseline a3 compared to baseline a1 baseline a2 and event a1 effective log reductions by floc blanket clarification were similar under event and baseline conditions for both surrogate organisms e coli event 2 9 log baseline 2 8 log c perfringens event 2 9 log baseline 3 3 log supplementary table 2 effective log reductions by rapid sand filtration were higher under event conditions in comparison to baseline conditions for both surrogate organisms e coli event 1 2 log baseline 0 6 log c perfringens event 1 7 log baseline 0 5 log however the standard errors of the mean log removal σ lr were 0 5 log for rapid sand filtration in baseline conditions time series of the log reductions of surrogate organisms by floc blanket clarifiers and rapid sand filters under event conditions show that the removal performance was stable during event conditions fig 4 a overall uv disinfection had a negligible effect on the inactivation of c perfringens for c perfringens the total effective log reduction were similar in baseline and event conditions c perfringens event 4 5 log baseline 4 3 log but a low total effective log reduction was measured during one baseline baseline a2 3 6 log as a result the daily infection risks for cryptosporidium calculated using the c perfringens reduction performance results was 0 4 log higher during baseline a2 than during event a1 3 2 urban drinking water treatment plant b the baseline gluc activity was stable at a level of approximately 15 mmfu 100 ml during spring 2018 at dwtp b fig 2b the gluc activity peaked at 44 mmfu 100 ml in early february following a planned discharge of raw sewage at a wastewater treatment plant located around 5 km upstream of the drinking water intake at the beginning of march the gluc activity increased from 20 to 50 mmfu 100 ml within 4 days and then slowly decreased for two weeks to return to the baseline level the performance of treatment processes was assessed during this long peak event temporal variations in turbidity ammonia river flow rate daily rainfall daily snow cover are illustrated in supplementary figure 1 the relationship between these parameters and gluc activity at this site is discussed elsewhere sylvestre et al 2021 at the source eps for e coli ranged between 14 and 18 under event condition and between 36 and 54 under baseline conditions table 1 eps for cryptosporidium were less than or equal to eps for e coli in baseline and event conditions mean c perfringens concentrations during event conditions 95 cfu 100 ml n 6 were 0 5 log higher in comparison to baseline conditions 30 cfu 100 ml n 3 as previously observed at dwtp a in the treatment train e coli was detected in 83 of the filtered water samples and c perfringens was detected in 66 of the uv disinfected water samples fig 3b the abstraction flow rate the water temperature and the turbidity of settled water were similar under baseline and event conditions supplementary table 2 effective log reductions by ballasted clarification were higher under event conditions in comparison to baseline conditions for both surrogate organisms e coli event 2 4 log baseline 1 9 log c perfringens event 2 1 log baseline 1 8 log effective log reductions by biological filtration were also higher under event conditions than baseline conditions for both surrogate organisms e coli event 3 4 log baseline 2 5 log c perfringens event 2 9 log baseline 2 4 log however log reductions by biological filtration were only measured twice during baseline conditions the log reductions of surrogate organisms by ballasted clarification and biological filtration were stable under event conditions fig 4b uv disinfection had a small effect on c perfringens inactivation effective log inactivation 1 0 log the total effective log reduction for c perfringens were similar in baseline and event conditions c perfringens event 5 4 log baseline 4 7 log the cryptosporidium concentration was approximately 1 0 log higher during the event conditions than in baseline conditions table 2 however as observed at dwtp a daily infection risks for cryptosporidium calculated using the c perfringens reduction performance results were not higher during event conditions than baseline conditions the daily infection risk was 1 3 log higher during baseline b1 than during event b2 4 discussion the collection of high resolution data on the microbial reduction performance is needed to determine whether source water peak events are critical drivers of the infection risk to water consumers in this study an event based sampling strategy using locally derived gluc activity levels was implemented at two dwtps to monitor the full scale performance of physicochemical and disinfection processes under different source water conditions for both dwtps removal performances by coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes were at the high end of the range of those reported for bacteria and bacterial spores hijnen and medema 2010 high reduction performances at dwtp a may in part be attributed to the presence of pre oxidation with potassium permanganate kmno4 before coagulation and in part to the type of clarifier previous investigations have shown that permanganate pre oxidation inactivates e coli cleasby et al 1964 and improves the removal of particles by coagulation flocculation liu et al 2013 a mean removal performance of 3 7 log for c perfringens by floc blanket clarification with pre ozonation was previously reported for a dwtp supplied by an agricultural river in quebec payment and franco 1993 it should be emphasized that treatment processes of dwtp a were optimized for turbidity reduction and operated at approximately 20 of their nominal design capacity under baseline and event conditions the effective log removals of e coli and c perfringens by floc blanket clarification were similar or lower under event conditions than under baseline conditions the removal performance of a floc blanket clarifier used in dwtp a should not theoretically be influenced by the particle concentration in source water the aggregation of micro sized particles in a fluidized bed floc blanket is typically approximated as a first order process by assuming that the size of the flocs in the fluidized bed is independent of the incoming primary particles bache and gregory 2007 however changes in temperature and turbidity can cause preferential currents in the sludge blanket resulting in lower performances these results and flocculation theory suggest that floc blanket clarifiers as operated could not buffer a short term increase in microbial concentration caused by a rainfall event the removal performances by rapid sand filtration at dwtp a were higher under event conditions than under baseline conditions still removal performances by rapid sand filtration were highly variable based on paired samples which we suspect are caused by processes of retention and release rather than actual performances of the filters high reduction performances by ballasted clarification at dwtp b may be attributed to the incorporation of a ballasted media typically silica sand within the incoming stream of flocs it has been shown that ballasted clarification is more robust than conventional systems for removing turbidity regardless of rapid changes in water quality kumar et al 2016 a mean removal performance of 2 0 log of aerobic bacterial endospores by ballasted clarification was previously reported at pilot scale huertas et al 2001 in our study higher removal performances of c perfringens by ballasted clarification were observed at turbidity levels of 12 24 nephelometric turbidity units ntu event b2 baseline b3 than at slightly lower levels of 6 7 ntu baseline b1 baseline b2 our companion study shows that the removal of enteric viruses by ballasted clarification also increased during this event sylvestre et al 2021 further research on the impact of initial particle concentrations on the aggregation of micro organisms during ballasted flocculation would be relevant to determine whether this process operates under steady state conditions or dynamic conditions in response to source water conditions the combination of inter ozonation and gac filtration referred to as biological activated carbon bac filtration considerably reduced e coli concentrations 1 7 to 3 5 log and c perfringens concentrations 2 4 to 3 1 log the reduction of c perfringens by these processes may be underestimated because non detects were replaced by a detection limit 1 organism volume for 3 out of 6 samples it is likely that c perfringens was mainly removed by gac filtration because inactivation of environmental c perfringens under full scale conditions is expected to be small 0 5 log at a ct10 value of around 0 6 mg l 1 min 1 hijnen et al 2002 conversely the inactivation of e coli was most likely driven by ozonation between 2 0 and 3 0 log inactivation of e coli were previously reported under full scale conditions at ct10 values between 0 5 and 1 0 mg l 1 min 1 and water temperature below 10 c smeets et al 2006 higher c perfringens reduction performances were measured under event conditions than under baseline conditions this variation does not appear to be related to the c perfringens concentration or the turbidity level in settled water low inactivation 1 0 log of c perfringens were found for uv medium pressure lamps dwtp a and uv low pressure lamps dwtp b operated at a fluence of 40 mj cm 2 these inactivation performances were lower than those previously reported at a fluence of 40 mj cm 2 for which inactivation of c perfringens approximated 1 0 log at a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant with low pressure lamps gehr et al 2003 inactivation of environmental spores of sulfite reducing clostridia ssrc of 2 4 log were obtained at pilot scale with medium pressure lamps hijnen et al 2004 at the two dwtps daily infection risks by cryptosporidium via consumption of treated drinking water were not higher under studied event conditions than under all baseline conditions the relative impact of short term contamination events on infection risks has been previously investigated by evaluating pathogen concentrations in source water and assuming treatment performances from literature data signor et al 2007 demonstrated that most of the annual risk at a dwtp abstracting raw water from a small agricultural river was attributable to runoff event periods smeets et al 2007 evaluated cryptosporidium data measured routinely in the treated water of eight dwtps with similar physical treatment processes by contrast they found that average treated water concentrations were similar at sites independently of their average cryptosporidium concentration at the source the authors hypothesized that well operated conventional treatment may be more effective in removing high concentrations of micro organisms than low concentrations results from our study also suggested that physical treatment processes optimized for turbidity reduction can effectively manage short term increases in microbial concentrations nonetheless our findings should be interpreted within their context during the studied conditions turbidity levels in source water were moderate dwtp a x 28 ntu dwtp b x 15 ntu and treatment processes were optimized for turbidity reduction although turbidity reduction after filtration is not a direct indicator of pathogen control it is an effective process control indicator for example the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2eswtr award 0 5 or 1 0 log additional cryptosporidium credit for achieving filter effluent turbidity 0 1 ntu usepa 2010 sedimentation effluent turbidity targets typically 1 ntu are also recommended by industry optimization programs usepa 2010 these targets could also be useful to manage short term fluctuations in source water microbial contamination however pathogens can peak before turbidity dorner et al 2007 st pierre et al 2009 sylvestre et al 2020b in these situations achieving sedimentation or filter effluent turbidity targets may not indicate adequate pathogen removal our study has several limitations given its design we only considered approximately one month of gluc activity measurements to define local thresholds for event conditions at dwtp a trends in gluc activity showed large and rapid increases following rainfall events suggesting the contribution of local sources to faecal contamination at the water intake therefore event conditions were based on a locally derived rate of increase in gluc activity and meteorological conditions low eps for daily mean e coli and cryptosporidium concentrations under event conditions confirm that treatment performances were assessed during a period of degraded source water quality at this site nevertheless amplitudes of gluc activity peaks were much higher following rainfall events in early and mid october than during the targeted event therefore periods of poorer source water quality may occur earlier in autumn periods of high gluc activity levels at urban dwtp b were less pronounced and sudden than those observed in the smaller agricultural catchment as discussed in sylvestre et al 2021 this relatively low reactivity most probably reflects the cumulative discharge from multiple upstream wastewater facilities and runoff from upper catchment areas eps for daily mean e coli and cryptosporidium concentrations under event conditions ranged between 10 and 15 which may be relatively high to conclude that performances were assessed during a period of poor source water quality also to evaluate log reduction performances the hydraulic mean retention time of water was assumed to be a valid approximation of the actual detention time of micro organisms however it has been pointed out that micro organisms entering a treatment train following a microbial peak in raw water may be retained in physical processes and remobilized over time hijnen 2009 smeets et al 2007 higher loads of micro organisms removed by ballasted clarification during a contamination event are not likely to be remobilized through treatment because settled sludges are continuously pumped from the bottom of the clarifier and recycled via hydro cyclone to separate the silica sand from the sludge however remobilization could occur in floc blanket clarifiers to maintain a steady volume fluidized bed excess material so called sludge bleed is withdrawn from the fluidized bed at a flow rate of approximately 1 of the inflow at an alum dose of 50 mg l 1 ives 2001 thus remobilization of micro organisms in settled water could occur during a period equivalent to the mean residence time of the flocs remobilization of pathogens from filtration processes could also happen by the end of the filter cycle before turbidity increases the collection of composite filtered water samples for an extended period following periods of poor source water quality may be valuable to improve process control strategies for filter operations overall the assessment of full scale treatment performances during source water events was logistically challenging and costly the development of automated sampling devices and faster concentration methods would be needed to collect larger sample sizes 5 conclusions the reduction of surrogate micro organisms was evaluated at two full scale drinking water treatment plants in quebec canada under varying source water conditions the following conclusions are drawn naturally occurring surrogate data provide valuable information for the assessment of full scale performances of physicochemical and disinfection processes reduction performances of up to 6 0 log for e coli and 5 6 log for c perfringens were measured by concentrating high volume water samples 15 1500 l throughout the treatment train for both drinking water treatment plants removal performances by coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes were at the high end of the range of those reported in the literature for bacteria and bacterial spores reductions of e coli and c perfringens by floc blanket clarification ballasted clarification and rapid sand filtration did not deteriorate during two snowmelt rainfall events additional studies investigating full scale reduction during microbial peak events in source water would be desirable to validate our findings especially at drinking water treatment plants subjected to severe water quality changes at the source site specific quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra using source water cryptosporidium data and full scale c perfringens reduction data suggested that daily infection risks by cryptosporidium via consumption of treated drinking water were not higher under peak event conditions than under baseline conditions however small sample sizes due to the important time required to concentrate high volume water samples limited the analysis of differences in treatment performances between baseline and event conditions online β d glucuronidase activity monitoring was valuable to establish baseline and event conditions at the agricultural drinking water treatment plant daily mean e coli and cryptosporidium concentrations under peak event conditions were in the top 5 of what occurs through the year based on historical routine monitoring data the value of β d glucuronidase activity monitoring was moderate at the urban site for the study period exceedance probabilities in peak event conditions were 15 for e coli and 11 for cryptosporidium declaration of competing interest the

16948,a monitoring strategy was implemented at two drinking water treatment plants in quebec canada to evaluate microbial reduction performances of full scale treatment processes under different source water conditions β d glucuronidase activity in source water was automatically monitored in near real time to establish baseline and event conditions at each location high volume water samples 50 1 500 l were collected at the inflow and the outflow of coagulation flocculation filtration and uv disinfection processes and were analysed for two naturally occurring surrogate organisms escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens source water cryptosporidium data and full scale c perfringens reduction data were entered into a quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra model to estimate daily infection risks associated with exposures to cryptosporidium via consumption of treated drinking water daily mean e coli and cryptosporidium concentrations in source water under event conditions were in the top 5 agricultural site or in the top 15 urban site of what occurs through the year at these drinking water treatment plants reduction performances of up to 6 0 log for e coli and 5 6 log for c perfringens were measured by concentrating high volume water samples throughout the treatment train for both drinking water treatment plants removal performances by coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes were at the high end of the range of those reported in the literature for bacteria and bacterial spores reductions of e coli and c perfringens by floc blanket clarification ballasted clarification and rapid sand filtration did not deteriorate during two snowmelt rainfall events qmra results suggested that daily infection risks were similar during two rainfall snowmelt events than during baseline conditions additional studies investigating full scale reductions would be desirable to improve the evaluation of differences in treatment performances

drinking waterborne outbreaks occurring in affluent nations since 2000 were recently compiled in literature reviews moreira and bondelind 2017 hrudey and hrudey 2019 heavy rain and inadequate treatment of surface water sources were potential causative factors for outbreaks caused by cryptosporidium giardia norovirus and shigella sonnei hrudey hrudey 2019 concluded that the occurrence of waterborne outbreaks after heavy rainfall is certainly common enough to justify increased vigilance for such events as the frequency and the magnitude of extreme rainfall events are projected to increase under climate change scenarios ipcc 2014 enhanced focus on the management of weather events has been recommended in future revisions of guidance documents for drinking water quality khan et al 2015 howard et al 2016 the quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra approach can be valuable to calculate risks associated with hazardous events and support risk management decisions medema and ashbolt 2006 medema and smeets 2009 smeets et al 2010 petterson and ashbolt 2016 in qmra microbial reduction performances by physicochemical and disinfection processes are generally assumed to follow first order kinetics with respect to the micro organisms influent concentrations haas et al 1999 the concentration of an organism in treated drinking water is therefore expected to be directly proportional to its source water concentration several studies showed that microbial concentrations in surface water increase by orders of magnitude over short periods during heavy rainfall and snowmelt events atherholt et al 1998 kistemann et al 2002 signor et al 2005 dorner et al 2007 sylvestre et al 2020b consequently weather events could be critical drivers of the infection risk to water consumers signor et al 2007 there are however limited high resolution data on the microbial reduction performance of drinking water treatment processes to investigate whether the first order assumption holds under variable microbial loads at the source full scale microbial reduction performances are typically assessed with naturally occurring i e not spiked surrogate micro organisms because pathogen concentrations are too low after treatment barriers surrogate organisms can be detected after full scale treatment by concentrating high volume water samples on site payment et al

pathogen campylobacter removal by rapid sand filtration hijnen et al 1998 and inactivation by ozonation smeets and medema 2006 identifying microbial peaks in source water can be challenging because these events can occur within a short time frame burnet et al 2019 culture based methods are of limited value for identifying these peaks because they typically require 24 hour incubation periods alternatively β d glucuronidase gluc activity a conservative biochemical proxy parameter for bacterial faecal pollution can be automatically monitored in source water in near real time ryzinska paier et al 2014 koschelnik et al 2015 demeter et al 2020 this technology has recently supported the development of monitoring programs to characterize microbial peaks at drinking water intakes burnet et al 2019 sylvestre et al 2020a sylvestre et al 2020b and to inform an investigation of the removal of human enteric viruses by full scale drinking water treatment processes sylvestre et al 2021 the objective of this study was to evaluate microbial reduction performances of full scale treatment processes at two drinking water treatment plants under different source water conditions an event based sampling strategy informed by online gluc activity monitoring and meteorological conditions was implemented to capture variations in performance between baseline and event conditions source water pathogen data and surrogate organism reduction data were entered into a qmra model to assess human health risks associated with the consumption of drinking water 2 material and methods 2 1 catchment and drinking water treatment descriptions two drinking water treatment plants dwtps were selected for this study dwtp a abstracts raw water from a small agricultural river annual average flow rate of the river is 16 m3 s situated in southern quebec the microbial water quality of source water at dwtp a can be influenced by four combined sewer overflows csos and a municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp discharging 10 km upstream of the drinking water intake at the wwtp human sewage is treated through an aerated pond and discharged into the river at an average rate of 10 000 m3 day cattle and swine manure is applied for agriculture in the catchment area buffer strips of at least 3 m from the river are required gouvernement du québec 2018 during the sampling campaigns dwtp a was operated at a capacity of approximately 3500 m3 d 1 about 20 of the design rate 18 000 m3 d 1 during water treatment potassium permanganate kmno4 0 6 mg l 1 was first added to the raw water after permanganate oxidation polyaluminum chloride pacl pax xl8 110 mg l 1 and cationic polyacrylamide c 492 dosing rate 0 11 mg l 1 were added in water at ph 6 2 and temperature of approximately 10 c and processed by ultrapulsator floc blanket clarification suez quebec canada the settled water was then filtered by four single media sand filters 0 8 m h 1 140 cm sand and disinfected by a medium

characterization of the catchment and the treatment barriers of dwtp b is detailed elsewhere sylvestre et al 2021 briefly dwtp b is supplied by a large urban river under the influence of around 180 csos and 14 municipal wwtps during the sampling period dwtp b was operated at about 40 of the design rate 120 000 m3 d 1 the raw water was processed by actiflo microsand ballasted clarification and was then treated by a combination of inter ozonation and granular activated carbon gac filtration referred to as biological activated carbon bac filtration the filtered water was disinfected with a low pressure uv system fluence 40 mj cm 2 and sodium hypochlorite naocl treatment processes were optimized for turbidity reduction during sampling campaigns 2 2 sampling campaigns 2 2 1 definition of baseline and event conditions at each dwtp an automated rapid on site monitoring system coliminder vwm gmbh vienna austria was installed approximately one month before evaluating microbial reduction performances during this period the gluc activity level was measured at frequencies varying between 1 and 3 h variations in raw water quality were investigated during the autumn at dwtp a three sampling campaigns were carried out under baseline conditions baseline a1 baseline a2 baseline a3 and one campaign was undertaken under event conditions event a1 baseline conditions were defined as dry weather conditions 48 hour total rainfall 0 mm event conditions were established using two criteria wet weather conditions 48 hour total rainfall 40 mm and a relative change in gluc activity variation 5 mmfu 100 ml over 1 h a relative change in gluc activity was chosen to ensure the characterization of the whole gluc activity peak a change of 5 mmfu 100 ml was set based on observed changes during three rainfall events at this dwtp supplementary figure 1 and two rainfall snowmelt events previously characterized at an urban dwtp sylvestre et al 2020b single grab sample baseline conditions and sequential grab samples event conditions n 3 of raw settled 200 l filtered 1000 l and uv disinfected 1500 l waters were collected to match theoretical mean hydraulic residence times through clarification 3 h filtration and uv disinfection 2 h a verroneau personal communication additionally under event conditions six 30 to 40 litres samples of raw water were filtered on site over 24 h to estimate the daily mean cryptosporidium concentration three campaigns under baseline conditions baseline b1 baseline b2 baseline b3 and two campaigns under event conditions event b1 event b2 were carried out during the spring freshet at dwtp b online gluc activity measurements were used in early february 2018 to trigger grab sampling of raw water event b1 this first campaign was undertaken to evaluate how a planned discharge of raw sewage at an upstream wwtp influenced source water quality at dwtp b discharge circumstances and a general characterization of the wwtp are provided elsewhere sylvestre et al 2021 in early march 2018 a short term increase in gluc activity of approximately 20 mmfu 100 ml was observed in the absence of recent snowmelt events 48 hour total snowmelt 2 cm and rainfall events 48 hour total rainfall 0 mm an increase in gluc activity of 20 mmfu 100 ml in dry weather conditions was considered relevant for event based sampling because similar increases were observed in this study during the planned discharge of raw sewage event b1 and during two wet weather events previously characterized at an urban dwtp sylvestre et al 2020b event based samples were collected over four days to quantify the reduction by treatment processes during this gluc activity peak event b2 baseline campaigns were carried out after event b2 at gluc activity levels approximately 20 mmfu 100 ml below levels observed during event b1 and event b2 single grab sample baseline conditions and sequential grab samples event conditions n 4 of raw settled 200 l filtered 1000 l and uv disinfected 1500 l water were collected to match theoretical mean hydraulic residence times through clarification 0 5 h ozonation filtration and uv disinfection 1 5 h m marchand personal communication additionally grab 25 to 30 l samples were filtered on site to estimate the mean cryptosporidium concentration in raw water under baseline conditions n 3 and event conditions n 3 2 2 2 sample concentration raw water samples were concentrated with hemoflow hf80s filters fresenius ontario canada for the enumeration of cryptosporidium concentrates were shipped overnight in coolers at 4 c to the centre d expertise en analyse environnementale du québec ceaeq in quebec city qc and processed within 48 h of sampling the hemoflow concentration method was also used to concentrate naturally occurring e coli and c perfringens spores in raw settled filtered and uv disinfected water samples one tank was filled with 50 l of settled water multiple tanks of 1000 l were filled with 1000 1500 l of filtered water or uv disinfected water the water was pumped through the hemoflow hf80s filter fresenius ontario canada at a minimum speed of 4 l per minute the overpressure over the filter was increased to a maximum of 0 7 bar until the water filtrate was pressed through the walls of the straws with a speed of around 0 9 l min veenendaal and brouwer hanzens 2007 installations with four hemoflow filters in parallel were built to concentrate high volume water samples faster 6 5 h the concentration process was stopped when the concentrate volume only filled the hoses filtrate water was pumped through the hoses once and then collected in a sterile bottle the total end volume was approximately 600 ml samples were kept at 4 c and analysed within 24 h the recovery rate of the hemoflow concentration method was evaluated for raw water samples collected at each dwtp the recovery rate was calculated as the ratio of the surrogate concentration in an un concentrated grab sample to its concentration in a hemoflow concentrated sample 100 l at dwtp a 20 l at dwtp b recovery rates of 103 for e coli and 125 for c perfringens were measured at dwtp a a recovery rate of 124 was measured for c perfringens at dwtp b but no recovery rate was determined for e coli at dwtp b recovery rates of 100 were assumed for the calculations of all e coli and c perfringens concentrations 2 2 3 sample processing and analysis hemoflow filter eluate volumes for enumeration of cryptosporidium oocysts were approximately 500 700 ml post concentration was carried out by centrifugation to obtain a final volume between 20 and 50 ml and a packed pellet volume between 2 and 5 ml between 20 and 50 of the packed pellet volume was then processed by immunomagnetic separation ims before sample staining and examination following usepa method 1623 1 usepa 2012 sample specific recovery rates were measured for each sample collected under baseline and event conditions fluorescently labelled controls colorseed were spiked at a target dose of 98 100 oo cysts in the raw water sample before careful manual mixing and on site concentration using the hemoflow method volumes of hemoflow filter eluates for the enumeration of surrogate organisms were approximately 600 ml from these volumes two aliquots of 100 200 ml were taken to detect e coli and c perfringens spores e coli was enumerated by the defined substrate technology using the idexx quanti tray 2000 system with colilert reagent apha 2005 spores of c perfringens were enumerated on m cp medium as described previously armon and payment 1988 2 3 statistical analysis 2 3 1 exceedance probabilities for source water microbial concentrations exceedance probabilities eps were calculated to determine probabilities that source water concentrations would be exceeded based on historical monitoring data temporal variations in concentrations were assumed to be lognormally distributed the parameters of the lognormal distributions were inferred from e coli data collected weekly for 5 years 2013 2017 and cryptosporidium data collected monthly for approximately 2 years between 2012 and 2016 estimations and inferences were carried out in a bayesian framework using markov chain monte carlo mcmc as previously described sylvestre et al 2020a c eps were computed for daily mean source water cryptosporidium concentrations adjusted for the recovery efficiency and daily mean source water e coli concentrations this model was implemented using r v3 4 1 the r code is provided in the supplementary material 2 3 2 quantification of reduction by treatment processes the reduction performance of each treatment process was evaluated by comparing the inflow concentration c i n and the outflow concentration c o u t of the surrogate organism point estimates of reduction i e removal or inactivation representing the log reduction lr across a treatment unit paired sample were calculated by the following equation 1 1 lr log 10 c i n c o u t the average percent reduction expressed as effective log reduction l r effective was calculated as follows 1 2 l r effective log 10 c i n c o u t this approach for quantifying the l r effective assigns equal weights to concentrations the standard error of the mean log reduction σ lr was evaluated to provide a simple measure of uncertainty of the lr it can be regarded as the dispersion of the lr across a treatment unit paired sample around the mean lr the standard error was calculated as follows 1 3 σ lr s lr n where s lr is the standard deviation of all lrs evaluated across a treatment unit paired sample and n is the sample size non detects were replaced by a detection limit of 1 organism per volume of sample each treatment step was assumed to behave as a plug low reactor operated hydraulically at a steady state during the sampling period 2 3 3 quantitative microbial risk assessment site specific raw water cryptosporidium data and c perfringens reduction data were entered in a qmra model to quantify daily risks of infection by cryptosporidium via consumption of treated drinking water a linear low dose approximation to the single hit dose response relationship was adopted to simplify calculations the risk of infection associated with exposure to more than one oocyst was assumed to be negligible the daily probability of infection under baseline conditions p inf baseline was calculated as follows 1 4 p inf baseline c baseline 10 l r baseline v r where c baseline is the cryptosporidium concentration in raw water adjusted for the recovery efficiency under baseline conditions l r baseline is the total reduction of c perfringens by treatment processes under baseline conditions v is the ingested volume of drinking water per person per day and r is the probability that any single ingested cryptosporidium oocyst succeeds in infecting the host c baseline were not measured at dwtp a we assumed that c baseline was the arithmetic mean cryptosporidium concentration in source water evaluated with monthly sampling for 2 years the daily probability of infection under event conditions was evaluated as follows 1 5 p inf event c event 10 lr event v r where c event is the mean cryptosporidium concentration in raw water adjusted for the recovery efficiency under event conditions and lr event is the reduction of c perfringens by treatment processes under event conditions it was conservatively assumed that 1 all detected cryptosporidium oocysts in raw water were human infectious 2 the reduction of bacterial spores was equivalent to the reduction of oocysts teunis et al 1997 barbeau et al 2000 and 3 free chlorine did not inactivate cryptosporidium parvum oocysts venczel et al 1997 the ingested volume v was set to 1 litre per person per day and the single oocyst infectivity r was set to 0 2 to be consistent with the qmra model applied in the who guidelines for drinking water quality gdwq who 2017 e coli reduction data were not entered into a qmra model because concentrations of bacterial pathogens in source water were not available and e coli reductions by chlorine disinfection processes were not measured however the risk of infection by bacterial pathogens should be very low at these sites because in general bacteria are very sensitive to chlorine petterson and stenström 2015 3 results 3 1 agricultural drinking water treatment plant a temporal variations in gluc activity e coli concentrations and c perfringens concentrations in raw water during fall 2017 at dwtp a are illustrated with a time series plot fig 2 a the gluc activity decreased from 30 mmfu 100 ml in mid october to 5 mmfu 100 ml in november four gluc activity peaks of similar duration approximately 24 h and different amplitudes 40 160 mmfu 100 ml were measured during this period the performance of treatment processes was assessed during a gluc activity peak with an amplitude of 40 mmfu 100 ml temporal variations in turbidity and daily rainfall are illustrated in supplementary figure 1 the relationship between these parameters and gluc activity at this site is discussed elsewhere sylvestre et al 2020b at the source exceedance probabilities ep for e coli during baseline a2 and baseline a3 were 14 and 38 table 1 the ep during event a1 was 0 8 3 days per year the ep for cryptosporidium in event conditions was also low 5 4 mean raw water c perfringens concentrations were 0 5 log higher under event conditions 109 cfu 100 ml n 6 than under baseline conditions 39 cfu 100 ml n 3 in the treatment train e coli was detected in all filtered water samples n 6 and c perfringens was detected in all filtered and uv disinfected water samples n 6 fig 3 e coli concentrations in uv disinfected water samples were not reported because autofluorescence potentially led to false positive results the hourly abstraction flow rate and the turbidity of settled water were similar under baseline and event conditions supplementary table 1 the water temperature was 10 c lower during baseline a3 compared to baseline a1 baseline a2 and event a1 effective log reductions by floc blanket clarification were similar under event and baseline conditions for both surrogate organisms e coli event 2 9 log baseline 2 8 log c perfringens event 2 9 log baseline 3 3 log supplementary table 2 effective log reductions by rapid sand filtration were higher under event conditions in comparison to baseline conditions for both surrogate organisms e coli event 1 2 log baseline 0 6 log c perfringens event 1 7 log baseline 0 5 log however the standard errors of the mean log removal σ lr were 0 5 log for rapid sand filtration in baseline conditions time series of the log reductions of surrogate organisms by floc blanket clarifiers and rapid sand filters under event conditions show that the removal performance was stable during event conditions fig 4 a overall uv disinfection had a negligible effect on the inactivation of c perfringens for c perfringens the total effective log reduction were similar in baseline and event conditions c perfringens event 4 5 log baseline 4 3 log but a low total effective log reduction was measured during one baseline baseline a2 3 6 log as a result the daily infection risks for cryptosporidium calculated using the c perfringens reduction performance results was 0 4 log higher during baseline a2 than during event a1 3 2 urban drinking water treatment plant b the baseline gluc activity was stable at a level of approximately 15 mmfu 100 ml during spring 2018 at dwtp b fig 2b the gluc activity peaked at 44 mmfu 100 ml in early february following a planned discharge of raw sewage at a wastewater treatment plant located around 5 km upstream of the drinking water intake at the beginning of march the gluc activity increased from 20 to 50 mmfu 100 ml within 4 days and then slowly decreased for two weeks to return to the baseline level the performance of treatment processes was assessed during this long peak event temporal variations in turbidity ammonia river flow rate daily rainfall daily snow cover are illustrated in supplementary figure 1 the relationship between these parameters and gluc activity at this site is discussed elsewhere sylvestre et al 2021 at the source eps for e coli ranged between 14 and 18 under event condition and between 36 and 54 under baseline conditions table 1 eps for cryptosporidium were less than or equal to eps for e coli in baseline and event conditions mean c perfringens concentrations during event conditions 95 cfu 100 ml n 6 were 0 5 log higher in comparison to baseline conditions 30 cfu 100 ml n 3 as previously observed at dwtp a in the treatment train e coli was detected in 83 of the filtered water samples and c perfringens was detected in 66 of the uv disinfected water samples fig 3b the abstraction flow rate the water temperature and the turbidity of settled water were similar under baseline and event conditions supplementary table 2 effective log reductions by ballasted clarification were higher under event conditions in comparison to baseline conditions for both surrogate organisms e coli event 2 4 log baseline 1 9 log c perfringens event 2 1 log baseline 1 8 log effective log reductions by biological filtration were also higher under event conditions than baseline conditions for both surrogate organisms e coli event 3 4 log baseline 2 5 log c perfringens event 2 9 log baseline 2 4 log however log reductions by biological filtration were only measured twice during baseline conditions the log reductions of surrogate organisms by ballasted clarification and biological filtration were stable under event conditions fig 4b uv disinfection had a small effect on c perfringens inactivation effective log inactivation 1 0 log the total effective log reduction for c perfringens were similar in baseline and event conditions c perfringens event 5 4 log baseline 4 7 log the cryptosporidium concentration was approximately 1 0 log higher during the event conditions than in baseline conditions table 2 however as observed at dwtp a daily infection risks for cryptosporidium calculated using the c perfringens reduction performance results were not higher during event conditions than baseline conditions the daily infection risk was 1 3 log higher during baseline b1 than during event b2 4 discussion the collection of high resolution data on the microbial reduction performance is needed to determine whether source water peak events are critical drivers of the infection risk to water consumers in this study an event based sampling strategy using locally derived gluc activity levels was implemented at two dwtps to monitor the full scale performance of physicochemical and disinfection processes under different source water conditions for both dwtps removal performances by coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes were at the high end of the range of those reported for bacteria and bacterial spores hijnen and medema 2010 high reduction performances at dwtp a may in part be attributed to the presence of pre oxidation with potassium permanganate kmno4 before coagulation and in part to the type of clarifier previous investigations have shown that permanganate pre oxidation inactivates e coli cleasby et al 1964 and improves the removal of particles by coagulation flocculation liu et al 2013 a mean removal performance of 3 7 log for c perfringens by floc blanket clarification with pre ozonation was previously reported for a dwtp supplied by an agricultural river in quebec payment and franco 1993 it should be emphasized that treatment processes of dwtp a were optimized for turbidity reduction and operated at approximately 20 of their nominal design capacity under baseline and event conditions the effective log removals of e coli and c perfringens by floc blanket clarification were similar or lower under event conditions than under baseline conditions the removal performance of a floc blanket clarifier used in dwtp a should not theoretically be influenced by the particle concentration in source water the aggregation of micro sized particles in a fluidized bed floc blanket is typically approximated as a first order process by assuming that the size of the flocs in the fluidized bed is independent of the incoming primary particles bache and gregory 2007 however changes in temperature and turbidity can cause preferential currents in the sludge blanket resulting in lower performances these results and flocculation theory suggest that floc blanket clarifiers as operated could not buffer a short term increase in microbial concentration caused by a rainfall event the removal performances by rapid sand filtration at dwtp a were higher under event conditions than under baseline conditions still removal performances by rapid sand filtration were highly variable based on paired samples which we suspect are caused by processes of retention and release rather than actual performances of the filters high reduction performances by ballasted clarification at dwtp b may be attributed to the incorporation of a ballasted media typically silica sand within the incoming stream of flocs it has been shown that ballasted clarification is more robust than conventional systems for removing turbidity regardless of rapid changes in water quality kumar et al 2016 a mean removal performance of 2 0 log of aerobic bacterial endospores by ballasted clarification was previously reported at pilot scale huertas et al 2001 in our study higher removal performances of c perfringens by ballasted clarification were observed at turbidity levels of 12 24 nephelometric turbidity units ntu event b2 baseline b3 than at slightly lower levels of 6 7 ntu baseline b1 baseline b2 our companion study shows that the removal of enteric viruses by ballasted clarification also increased during this event sylvestre et al 2021 further research on the impact of initial particle concentrations on the aggregation of micro organisms during ballasted flocculation would be relevant to determine whether this process operates under steady state conditions or dynamic conditions in response to source water conditions the combination of inter ozonation and gac filtration referred to as biological activated carbon bac filtration considerably reduced e coli concentrations 1 7 to 3 5 log and c perfringens concentrations 2 4 to 3 1 log the reduction of c perfringens by these processes may be underestimated because non detects were replaced by a detection limit 1 organism volume for 3 out of 6 samples it is likely that c perfringens was mainly removed by gac filtration because inactivation of environmental c perfringens under full scale conditions is expected to be small 0 5 log at a ct10 value of around 0 6 mg l 1 min 1 hijnen et al 2002 conversely the inactivation of e coli was most likely driven by ozonation between 2 0 and 3 0 log inactivation of e coli were previously reported under full scale conditions at ct10 values between 0 5 and 1 0 mg l 1 min 1 and water temperature below 10 c smeets et al 2006 higher c perfringens reduction performances were measured under event conditions than under baseline conditions this variation does not appear to be related to the c perfringens concentration or the turbidity level in settled water low inactivation 1 0 log of c perfringens were found for uv medium pressure lamps dwtp a and uv low pressure lamps dwtp b operated at a fluence of 40 mj cm 2 these inactivation performances were lower than those previously reported at a fluence of 40 mj cm 2 for which inactivation of c perfringens approximated 1 0 log at a full scale municipal wastewater treatment plant with low pressure lamps gehr et al 2003 inactivation of environmental spores of sulfite reducing clostridia ssrc of 2 4 log were obtained at pilot scale with medium pressure lamps hijnen et al 2004 at the two dwtps daily infection risks by cryptosporidium via consumption of treated drinking water were not higher under studied event conditions than under all baseline conditions the relative impact of short term contamination events on infection risks has been previously investigated by evaluating pathogen concentrations in source water and assuming treatment performances from literature data signor et al 2007 demonstrated that most of the annual risk at a dwtp abstracting raw water from a small agricultural river was attributable to runoff event periods smeets et al 2007 evaluated cryptosporidium data measured routinely in the treated water of eight dwtps with similar physical treatment processes by contrast they found that average treated water concentrations were similar at sites independently of their average cryptosporidium concentration at the source the authors hypothesized that well operated conventional treatment may be more effective in removing high concentrations of micro organisms than low concentrations results from our study also suggested that physical treatment processes optimized for turbidity reduction can effectively manage short term increases in microbial concentrations nonetheless our findings should be interpreted within their context during the studied conditions turbidity levels in source water were moderate dwtp a x 28 ntu dwtp b x 15 ntu and treatment processes were optimized for turbidity reduction although turbidity reduction after filtration is not a direct indicator of pathogen control it is an effective process control indicator for example the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2eswtr award 0 5 or 1 0 log additional cryptosporidium credit for achieving filter

manage short term fluctuations in source water microbial contamination however pathogens can peak before turbidity dorner et al 2007 st pierre et al 2009 sylvestre et al 2020b in these situations achieving sedimentation or filter effluent turbidity targets may not indicate adequate pathogen removal our study has several limitations given its design we only considered approximately one month of gluc activity measurements to define local thresholds for event conditions at dwtp a trends in gluc activity showed large and rapid increases following rainfall events suggesting the contribution of local sources to faecal contamination at the water intake therefore event conditions were based on a locally derived rate of increase in gluc activity and meteorological conditions low eps for daily mean e coli and cryptosporidium concentrations under event conditions confirm that treatment performances were assessed during a period of degraded source water quality at this site nevertheless amplitudes of gluc activity peaks were much higher following rainfall events in early and mid october than during the targeted event therefore periods of poorer source water quality may occur earlier in autumn periods of high gluc activity levels at urban dwtp b were less pronounced and sudden than those observed in the smaller agricultural catchment as discussed in sylvestre et al 2021 this relatively low reactivity most probably reflects the cumulative discharge from multiple upstream wastewater facilities and runoff from upper catchment areas eps for daily mean e coli and cryptosporidium concentrations under event conditions ranged between 10 and 15 which may be relatively high to conclude that performances were assessed during a period of poor source water quality also to evaluate log reduction performances the hydraulic mean retention time of water was assumed to be a valid approximation of the actual detention time of micro organisms however it has been pointed out that micro organisms entering a treatment train following a microbial peak in raw water may be retained in physical processes and remobilized over time hijnen 2009 smeets et al 2007 higher loads of micro organisms removed by ballasted clarification during a contamination event are not likely to be remobilized through treatment because settled sludges are continuously pumped from the bottom of the clarifier and recycled via hydro cyclone to separate the silica sand from the sludge however remobilization could occur in floc blanket clarifiers to maintain a steady volume fluidized bed excess material so called sludge bleed is withdrawn from the fluidized bed at a flow rate of approximately 1 of the inflow at an alum dose of 50 mg l 1 ives 2001 thus remobilization of micro organisms in settled water could occur during a period equivalent to the mean residence time of the flocs remobilization of pathogens from filtration processes could also happen by the end of the filter cycle before turbidity increases the collection of composite filtered water samples for an extended period following periods of poor source water quality may be valuable to improve process control strategies for filter operations overall the assessment of full scale treatment performances during source water events was logistically challenging and costly the development of automated sampling devices and faster concentration methods would be needed to collect larger sample sizes 5 conclusions the reduction of surrogate micro organisms was evaluated at two full scale drinking water treatment plants in quebec canada under varying source water conditions the following conclusions are drawn naturally occurring surrogate data provide valuable information for the assessment of full scale performances of physicochemical and disinfection processes reduction performances of up to 6 0 log for e coli and 5 6 log for c perfringens were measured by concentrating high volume water samples 15 1500 l throughout the treatment train for both drinking water treatment plants removal performances by coagulation flocculation sedimentation processes were at the high end of the range of those reported in the literature for bacteria and bacterial spores reductions of e coli and c perfringens by floc blanket clarification ballasted clarification and rapid sand filtration did not deteriorate during two snowmelt rainfall events additional studies investigating full scale reduction during microbial peak events in source water would be desirable to validate our findings especially at drinking water treatment plants subjected to severe water quality changes at the source site specific quantitative microbial risk assessment qmra using source water cryptosporidium data and full scale c perfringens reduction data suggested that daily infection risks by cryptosporidium via consumption of treated drinking water were not higher under peak event conditions than under baseline conditions however small sample sizes due to the important time required to concentrate high volume water samples limited the analysis of differences in treatment performances between baseline and event conditions online β d glucuronidase activity monitoring was valuable to establish baseline and event conditions at the agricultural drinking water treatment plant daily mean e coli and cryptosporidium concentrations under peak event conditions were in the top 5 of what occurs through the year based on historical routine monitoring data the value of β d glucuronidase activity monitoring was moderate at the urban site for the study period exceedance probabilities in peak event conditions were 15 for e coli and 11 for cryptosporidium declaration of competing interest the

16949,advanced treatment is increasingly being applied to improve abatement of micropollutants in wastewater effluent and reduce their load to surface waters in this study non target screening of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms data collected at three swiss wastewater treatment plants wwtps was used to evaluate different advanced wastewater treatment setups including 1 granular activated carbon gac filtration alone 2 pre ozonation followed by gac filtration and 3 pre ozonation followed by powdered activated carbon pac dosed onto a sand filter samples were collected at each treatment step of the wwtp and analyzed with reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled to hrms each wwtp received a portion of industrial wastewater and a prioritization method was applied to select non target features potentially resulting from industrial activities approximately 37 000 non target features were found in the influents of the wwtps a number of non target features 1207 were prioritized as likely of industrial origin and 54 were identified through database spectral matching the fates of all detected non target features were assessed through a novel automated trend assignment method a trend was assigned to each non target feature based on the normalized intensity profile for each sampling date results showed that 73 4 of influent non target features and the majority of industrial features 89 were well removed i e 80 intensity reduction during biological treatment in all three wwtps advanced treatment removed on average an additional 11 of influent non target features with no significant differences observed among the different advanced treatment settings in contrast when considering a subset of 66 known micropollutants advanced treatment was necessary to adequately abate these compounds and higher abatement was observed in fresh gac 7 000 8 000 bed volumes bvs compared to older gac 18 000 48 000 bvs 80 vs 56 of micropollutants were well removed respectively approximately half of the features detected in the wwtp effluents were features newly formed during the various treatment steps in ozonation between 1108 3579 features were classified as potential non target ozonation transformation products otps no difference could be observed for their removal in gac filters at the bvs investigated 70 of otps were well removed on average similar amounts 67 was

keywords ozonation micropollutants non target analysis transformation products industrial wastewater 1 introduction trace organic compounds or micropollutants originating from human activities

ternes 2001 schmidt 2018 their input pathway into surface waters is often through treated or sometimes untreated wastewater loos et al 2013 schwarzenbach et al 2006 ternes 1998 due to the closed water cycle surface waters are also a source of drinking water for many communities therefore it is of great interest to reduce the load of micropollutants discharging from wastewater treatment plants wwtps to subsequently protect aquatic communities and drinking water resources joss et al 2008 eggen et al 2014 because primary and secondary wastewater treatment are mostly ineffective at removing polar

organic matter dom is also degraded in ozonation and can lead to the formation of disinfection by products dbps richardson et al 2007 von gunten 2003 therefore a biologically active post treatment

kovalova et al 2013 margot et al 2013 snyder et al 2007 because compounds adsorb to the activated carbon without the formation of tps or dbps pac treatment should also be followed by a polishing step such as sand filtration to remove particles a third option for advanced wastewater treatment is the use of granular activated carbon gac filtration which is considered more sustainable because gac can be reactivated siegrist et al 2019 gac filtration can remove compounds both through sorption and through the promotion of biologically active filters also referred to as biological activated carbon bac altmann et al s 2016 choi et al 2008 hernández leal et al 2011 efficiency of removal in gac however can be expected to decrease over time as adsorption sites become limiting benstoem et al 2017 and is strongly affected by contact time sari et al 2020 due to the demonstrated advantages of both ozonation and activated carbon for the removal of micropollutants research into coupling these technologies has been pursued and has shown promising results knopp et al 2016 lee et al 2012 reungoat et al 2010 sánchez polo et al 2006 the coupling of low dose ozonation i e pre ozonation with gac filtration is expected to be cost efficient while also increasing overall removal due to the synergism of the two technologies in the first step pre ozonation leads to partial abatement of micropollutants and the formation of more readily biodegradable compounds at lower energy consumption and therefore costs compared to ozone treatment at higher doses in the second step adsorption to activated carbon functions as a removal mechanism for micropollutants while the presence of increased assimilable organic carbon aoc through pre ozonation can promote biofilm formation together these are expected to result in better removal of recalcitrant micropollutants otps and dbps bourgin et al 2018 knopp et al 2016 the promotion of biofilm formation and the transition to a bac treatment and

target screening of known micropollutants e g bourgin et al 2018 knopp et al 2016 reungoat et al 2012 reungoat et al 2010 a more comprehensive assessment of unknown compounds is lacking a wide variety of analytical methods have been applied to assess the occurrence and fate of micropollutants in wwtps and in the environment fatta et al 2007 richardson and kimura 2016 however screening methods that focus on a limited number of target compounds provide an incomplete picture non target screening nts with high resolution mass spectrometry hrms can be applied to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the compounds present hollender et al 2017 ibáñez et al 2008 krauss et al 2010 petrie et al 2015 nts is generally used in one of the following two ways the first and more common method is to identify unknown substances by applying appropriately selected differential data analyses to prioritize a small number of unknown non target features brunner et al 2019 hollender et al 2017 schymanski et al 2014b this analysis method is relevant especially when looking for unknown sources of toxicity for example or trying to narrow the knowledge gap about potential new emerging chemicals of concern however by choosing to focus on a limited number of prioritized non target features ultimately some knowledge is lost about the overall chemical burden of the samples the second nts strategy is to apply data mining to comprehensively characterize all detected non target features and identify possible patterns resulting from a treatment or different environmental conditions without the goal of compound identification this type of non target screening has only been applied sparingly to date brunner et al 2020 nürenberg et al 2019 schollée et al 2018 specifically information about the formation of unknown otps and their fate in post treatment is sparse deeb et al 2017 itzel et al 2020 schollée et al 2018 in this study the two complementary nts approaches were applied to study advanced wastewater treatment at three wwtps across switzerland first for a complete nts characterization trends of non target features which were automatically assigned with a newly developed method were compared among different advanced wastewater treatments i e ozone and or activated carbon treatment second since each wwtp received a portion of industrial wastewater a prioritization approach modified from anliker et al 2020 was applied to select and identify non target features possibly of industrial origin i e nts identification goals of the study were 1 to assess the fate of non target features including possible industrial compounds 2 to compare the impact of advanced treatment with low dose ozone and or activated carbon on the formation and removal of non target features including evaluating the formation of tp dbps and 3 comparing the effectiveness of different biological activated carbon treatment i e gac or pac dosed onto a sand filter for the removal of potential otps 2 methods 2 1 sampling locations and procedure samples were collected at three wwtps in switzerland during predominately dry weather conditions operating with biological treatment mostly in full scale and advanced treatment in pilot scale on each sampling date samples were collected at the influent of the wwtp inf after the biological treatment bio after ozonation ozo and after post treatment with activated carbon at the effluent eff the sampling locations are summarized below the different sample settings are shown in table 1 and details on the wwtps can be found

out covering a range of ozone doses 0 0 27 go3 gdoc and pac doses 0 16 3 mg l table 1 for each campaign 48 h composite samples were collected three times over the course of 2 3 weeks in total 24 sampling campaigns were conducted across the three wwtps and 140 samples were collected for a complete list see si table s1 samples were collected in borosilicate glass bottles frozen and kept at 20 c until analysis influent samples were collected one day prior at gl and ar to account for hydraulic retention time in the wwtps 2 2 chemical analysis samples were measured as described in bourgin et al 2018 further details on the analytical procedure are also available in the si section s2 briefly samples were first thawed overnight and filtered all samples were diluted 1 1 w w with nanopure water except influent samples which were diluted 1 3 w w to account for possible higher matrix effects each sample was spiked with a mixture of 147 isotopically labeled internal standards iss si table s2 which covered a broad mass and retention time range and were used as quality controls at multiple points in the data evaluation after filtration and spiking samples were stored for a maximum of 8 days at 4 c prior to measurement in addition to individual samples pooled samples were produced for each matrix at each wwtp for example equal aliquots of all bio samples from wwtp altenrhein were mixed to generate an ar bio pool si table s1 these pooled samples were also split into two sets one set was only spiked with iss and one set that was spiked with iss and a mixture of reference micropollutants i e target compounds for the non target screening the pooled samples were injected in triplicate and were used for data cleaning as advocated for in bader et al 2016 through the implementation of a replicate filter discussed in section 2 3 1 and in si section s3 samples were enriched with a multi layer online solid phase extraction spe and then measured in reverse phase liquid chromatography followed by positive electrospray ionization and high resolution mass spectrometry lc esi hrms the mass range was 100 1000 m z mass error 5 ppm and the resolution was 140 000 for ms1 spectra and 17 500 for ms ms spectra further details on the analytical method can be found in the si section s2 2 3 data analysis in the following non target feature is used when referring to a unique mass to change m z retention time rt combination that was detected the term profile is used when referring to multiple detections of the same non target feature across samples and the corresponding detected intensities of this feature analysis of lc hrms data entailed the following steps detailed information on each step is provided in the sections below first pre processing of the lc hrms data was done to detect unique exact mass retention time pairs i e a non target feature in each sample second to analyze the trends of non target features in the different wastewater treatment settings an automated trend assignment method was developed and applied third two lists were used for feature annotation 1 a list of known organic micropollutants and 2 a list of known ozonation transformation products otps fourth a classification method was applied similar to anliker et al 2020 to prioritize and identify possible industrial inputs in the two influent streams in prorheno finally a linkage analysis was used to screen for possible unknown otps and compare their removal in different post treatment settings 2 3 1 pre processing acquired raw files were converted to centroid data and mzxml files with msconvert v 3 0 11781 from proteowizard chambers et al 2012 unless otherwise noted data analysis was performed in r v 3 5 0 v 3 5 3 r development core team 2017 and rstudio v 1 1 453 v 1 2 1335 the list of r packages used is provided in the si table s3 and additional functions are available at www github com dutchjes the non target screening workflow si fig s4 is summarized below more detailed information and evaluation of different processing steps is available in the si section s3 schollée et al 2015 and schollée et al 2018 the evaluation of the pre processing was done with a set of 147 isotopically labeled internal standards for the quantification of false positives and false negatives new pre processing steps include the following a profile grouping step a replicate filter based on the pooled samples a profile quality control filter annotation and removal of homologues and an algorithm for missing value imputation the implementation of these additional steps are discussed below their evaluation is discussed in the section 3 1 further information is proved in the si section s3 pre processing of hrms data was performed as follows 1 peak picking and 2 profiling were done with functions from envipick v 2 4 loos 2016 settings in si section s3 and executed with rmassscreening stravs 2020 next a 3 profile grouping step was implemented to detect cases where features belonging to the same chromatographic peak were split across multiple profiles additional information in si section s3 si fig s5 thereafter a 4 replicate filter was applied using the triplicate injections of the pooled samples non target features were only retained if present in all 3 injections of at least one pooled sample type bader et al 2016 schulze et al 2020 following the replicate filter 5 intensity normalization was performed as in albergamo et al 2019 si fig s6 a 6 profile quality control filter was developed to address cases where different chromatographic peaks were incorrectly assigned to the same profile these cases were detected based on the boxplot rule to detect outliers tukey 1977 further information in si section s3 next 7 isotopes adducts and homologues were annotated with the non target package v 1 9 loos 2015 https github com blosloos nontarget settings in si section s3 si figs s7 s8 and s9 and removed with the aim to a eliminate multiple profiles associated with one compound isotopes and adducts and b exclude profiles possibly associated with the wastewater matrix homologues previous studies have shown that many of the homologues detected in wastewater are related to either surfactants garcía et al 2019 mairinger et al 2021 to matrix components such as proteins mairinger 2019 or to dom verkh et al 2018 all of which were not the focus of this characterization in 8 intensities were adjusted based on the dilution factors of the different wastewater matrices finally in 9 missing value imputation was done by randomly drawing values from below the estimated global instrument loq based on the feature intensity distribution si fig s10 more information in si section s3 this algorithm accounts for missing data resulting from non target features being below the lod it does not address missing at random cases e g instances where the peak picking missed a high intensity peak however in our experience these occurrences are rare a final data matrix was obtained with a row for each non target feature defined by the mean m z and rt of a profile a column for each sample and populated with the respective intensities the pre processing was optimized with 147 iss and with the final workflow 100 147 iss corresponding to 156 profiles were detected si table s4 2 3 2 automated trend assignment to analyze trends of non target features across a wwtp a method was developed to automatically assign trends to each non target feature for each sampling date each profile was normalized to the maximum intensity detected in the four sampling locations i e inf bio ozo eff domains of high 100 60 medium 60 20 and low intensity 20 were defined si fig s11 and the intensity at each treatment step was converted to 1 0 1 respectively to generate an intensity profile barcode which could then be interpreted as profile trends based on four treatment steps three intensity domains and the normalization method 65 unique barcodes were generated si fig s12 these were then assigned to one of 12 major trends si fig s13 and si table s5 11 of which correspond to expected patterns in the wwtp e g removed in biological treatment removed in ozonation persistent and a twelfth for trends that didn t fit to expected patterns in wastewater treatment referred to generally as other overall the numbers of features classified as other were extremely low 1 8 0 7 of the total number of features nsam ple s 27 and were therefore not further considered trend assignment was done separately for each sampling date it was observed that a number of potential otps appeared to be formed on the sampling dates in pr where no ozone had been dosed these features were assumed to result from either analytical or experimental artifacts caused by a biofilm in the ozonation column and were removed from the entire dataset overall this method represents a significant improvement over the trend assignment that was previously done with hierarchical cluster analysis chiaia hernández et al 2017 schollée et al 2018 because 1 trends are assigned individually for each profile rather than for an entire cluster and because 2 trend assignment is done automatically increasing reproducibility and throughput 2 3 3 qualitative target and suspect screening a qualitative target screening was done with a list of 427 organic micropollutants targets were confirmed through m z and rt matches to reference compounds using 2 5 ppm and 30 seconds as tolerances for a positive match from these a list of 66 wastewater relevant micropollutants mp66 si table s7 which have been previously reported in swiss wastewater bourgin et al 2018 and were detected on all sampling dates was compiled furthermore to evaluate different post treatments a suspect screening was also conducted for 999 known otps obtained from the literature si table s8 these otps were either previously found to be formed during wastewater treatment or in laboratory experiments the list included otps from 84 parent micropollutants and spanned wide m z and rt ranges m z 86 0598 764 4791 rt 5 1 24 7 minutes suspect hits were tentatively identified with exact mass only 5 ppm tolerance confidence level 3 schymanski et al 2014a screening was done with functions available in rmassscreening stravs 2020 and at www github com dutchjes 2 3 4 characterization of wwtp influents and possible industrial contribution classification of non target features possibly of industrial origin was done in the two influent streams from prorheno using intensity spread calculated as the ratio of the 95th 5th profile intensity percentiles according to a method by anliker et al 2020 with the following modifications first classification was done with non target features detected in influent samples rather than with effluent samples classifying influent features was considered an advantage for this study because parent compounds are directly measured prior to treatment and potential transformation and because the removal over the whole treatment train could be evaluated furthermore in pr separate influent streams were collected from industrial and municipal discharges and different advanced treatment settings were sampled so changes in intensity in the effluents could be a result of higher lower removal efficiency and not necessarily related to industrial inputs however classification of influent features also presented a challenge because the expected intensity spread is higher since detection of industrial peaks would be restricted to the day of emission and not spread out and diluted over multiple sampling days on account of retention in the wwtp therefore the cutoff criteria for classification as an industrial input was increased to an intensity spread 1e4 and no minimum number of consecutive daily detections was included exceptionally large intensity spreads were generated in cases where the 5th percentile was actually a non detect therefore a low intensity baseline was simulated for the calculation of intensity spread where intensities of previously imputated data points i e non detects were increased by 1e5 this modification allowed for the detection of one time industrial inputs without generation of high spread values due to the lack of continuous time series data after classification of possible industrial non target features structure elucidation was done ms2 spectra were extracted with rmassbank stravs et al 2013 and converted to msp files ms2 were compared to library spectra with nist ms search v 2 3 stein and wallace 2017 spectral libraries included massbankeu schulze et al 2012 retrieved december 2019 mona massbank of north america http mona fiehnlab ucdavid edu retrieved december 2019 csupmf library broeckling et al 2016 and nist hrms 2017 matches were visually inspected and finally a best match was selected confidence level 2b schymanski et al 2014a 2 3 5 linkage analysis linkage analysis where parents and possible tps are linked together was performed as described in schollée et al 2015 and schollée et al 2018 to detect possible otps the table of reactions that can be expected based on known ozonation mechanisms e g addition of oxygen atoms demethylation si table s9 was edited to include additional known transformations expected ozonation transformations were derived from otps reported in literature and from predicted otps o3 ppd lee et al 2017 schollée et al in prep in total 45 possible reactions were included possible parent compounds were any feature with a trend that decreased during ozonation while possible otps were any feature assigned a trend that increased during ozonation an m z window of 5 ppm was used to link possible pairs 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of pre processing of optimized non target screening workflow in accordance with discussions in the non target screening community about data quality schulze et al 2020 a number of new pre processing steps were implemented into previously developed non target screening workflows schollée et al 2018 schollée et al 2015 to reduce noise and eliminate artifacts or redundant non target features these additional steps were evaluated with a set of 147 internal standards iss the motivation and impact of these additional steps is discussed briefly below detailed information can be found in the si section s3 initially after peak picking and profiling a total of 459 867 non target features were detected fig 1 to evaluate the efficiency of the pre processing non target features of the internal standards were used based on exact mass and rt 1136 of non target features matched to the expected m z and rts of the 147 iss for the purposes of the evaluation of the pre processing duplicate hits of the iss were labeled as false positives at least 989 since multiple features were detected for each is no false negatives were found since at least 1 non target feature was detected for each is additional workflow steps were therefore incorporated to reduce the number of is false positives and the overall number of non target features detected the first additional step was a profile grouping algorithm using very narrow m z and rt windows 1 ppm and 20 seconds respectively the grouping algorithm combined possible split peaks into one profile this step resulted in a 14 reduction in the total number of features fig 1 and reduced the number of detected is features from 1136 to 929 thereby lowering the number of false positive is hits by 21 from 989 to 782 si table s4 the second additional step included was a replicate filter based on the pooled samples adopted from standard methods in metabolomics broadhurst et al 2018 overall higher numbers of features were detected in the pooled samples compared to the individual samples si fig s15 suggesting that very few compounds fell below the lod due to dilution in the pooled samples through implementation of this quality control step the number of detected is features decreased from 929 to 161 thereby decreasing the false positive is features to 14 98 overall the number of non target features was reduced by 83 next intensity normalization was incorporated to account for matrix effects from the different wastewater matrices as explained in albergamo et al 2019 and resulted in a similar intensity distribution across all samples si fig s6 subsequently a profile quality control criterion considered the intra profile variability of m z and rt the number of detected is features decreased to 158 with 11 false positives while the percent of detected non target features was further decreased by 10 potential interfering or redundant features isotopes adducts and homologues were annotated non target package v 1 9 loos 2015 and were removed to reduce redundancy in the data set the number of detected iss decreased to 156 false positives reduced by 2 overall the number of non target features decreased by 17 from 60 953 to 50 722 through implementation of this criteria thereafter feature intensities were adjusted for dilution 1 3 for inf samples 1 1 for all other samples and missing value imputation was applied which estimated the intensity lod per profile and randomly sampled from below this threshold to fill non detects through this optimized method a highly curated data set was produced with 0 false negative is hits 100 true positive is hits and 50 722 detected non target features 3 2 evaluation of automated trend assignment across wwtps trends were assigned to non target features on each sampling date based on the normalized intensity profile to indicate if the feature was removed persistent or formed as described in section 2 3 2 and in the si section s3 the assignment of compounds into either one or another trend is governed by the definition of the cutoffs between the three normalized intensity domains therefore a sensitivity analysis was conducted with different domain cutoffs si table s12 to determine the robustness of the trend assignment domain cutoffs considered were 20 60 30 70 20 80 and 10 90 where the first number is the cutoff between the low and middle domains and the second number is the cutoff between the middle and high domains differences among the percent of features assigned to a particular trend ranged only from 1 6 to 1 7 si figs s19 and s20 establishing the method to be robust against the selection of cutoffs for the high middle and low domains further details in the si section s5 in the end 20 was selected as the lower cutoff representing a minimum intensity elimination of 80 because it corresponds to the overall micropollutant abatement target set by the new swiss regulation for the upper cutoff 60 was chosen because it equally divided the remaining portion this automated trend assignment was validated by comparing trends assigned to the non target hrms data with trends assigned to eight target compounds quantified in the same samples additionally trends assigned to the internal standards were evaluated quantified target screening results of the so called swiss indicator substances götz et al 2015 were reported elsewhere gl mcardell et al 2020 oltramare et al in prep ar bogler 2019 pr krahnstöver et al 2018 and trends were assigned through the same method as for the non target hrms data except with quantified concentrations rather than non target feature intensities for each sampling day concentrations were normalized to the maximum concentration normalized concentrations were binned into high middle and low domains and a trend was assigned in total quantified data was available for 8 9 target compounds on 25 sampling days resulting in 206 trend assignments for comparison of these 172 trends were the same between the quantified target data and the non target profile intensity data with an average of 84 17 consistency per sampling date si table s6 demonstrating that overall the trends assigned to the non target features was representative of the results obtained with quantified targets finally the trend analysis was also evaluated based on 147 detected iss corresponding to 156 profiles of these 90 3 were assigned the correct trend i e stable intensity across sampling points trend 10 this was increased to 95 3 when the 8 profiles resulting from split profiles were manually removed 3 3 characterization of influents and potential industrial contribution a general characterization of the four influent streams i e gl ar pr comm and pr chem was performed further details in si section s4 principal component analysis pca in si figs s16 and s17 subsequently in pr a classification method was applied to find influent features potentially of industrial origin finally structure elucidation was performed on the selected potential industrial features a total of 37 427 non target features were detected in the four influent streams ngl 3 nar 5 npr comm 15 npr chem 14 with between 17 514 gl and 22 862 pr chem non target features detected in one influent stream almost a quarter 23 of all influent features 11 482 features si fig s17 were found in all four influents indicating wastewater commonality despite different industrial inputs in contrast between 2 8 features were unique to one influent stream in the pca si fig s17 some differences are observed among the influents for example samples from the first sampling campaign in ar appeared to be substantially different si fig s17 however it is not clear what the cause of this difference is perhaps a change in industrial input in the catchment e g due to batch production classification of potential industrial inputs with the intensity spread method was carried out only on the two pr influent streams since calculating the intensity spread was not possible in ar and gl on account of the low number of influent samples further details in section 2 3 4 this classification resulted in a total of 1207 non target influent features as potential industrial features si table s10 in pr comm 274 1 3 of detected features and in pr chem 977 4 3 potential industrial features were detected si table s10 and fig s18 note that some features were classified as industrial in both influents to identify the potential industrial compounds ms2 spectra were extracted and compared to the nist spectral library of the 1207 possible industrial features ms2 spectra was available for 754 features this list was further reduced to features with clean ms2 spectra defined as mspurity score 40 lawson et al 2017 resulting in 556 ms2 spectra that were evaluated matches to library spectra were found for 54 compounds i e confidence level 2b schymanski et al 2014a overall 37 of the 54 identified compounds were present in the norman substance database norman susdat aalizadeh et al 2020 including 21 that were on the stoff ident letzel et al 2017 list of environmentally relevant compounds and included reach regisitration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals ec no 1907 2006 chemicals pharmaceuticals and transformation products si table s10 identified compounds included some that could be confirmed from the qualitative target screening e g 18β glycyrrhentinic acid 1h benzotriazole atenolol carbamazepine crotamiton mycophenolic acid naproxen n desmethyltramadol oseltamivir praziquantel and propamocarb intensity profiles of 18β glycyrrhetinic acid pharmaceutical used in dermatology and cosmetology applications and praziquantel a pharmaceutical only licensed for veterinary use in switzerland are shown in fig 2 in both examples high peaks detected over 1 2 months was observed in pr chem samples in the pr comm samples no detections of praziquantel were observed while for 18β glycyrrhetinic acid a relatively constant baseline was observed as could be expected from domestic use 3 4 summary of non target feature trends using the optimized non target screening workflow and automated trend assignment the fate of all non target features including potential industrial inputs and known target compounds mp66 list could be traced across the three wwtps the trends detected through the automated trend assignment of all non target features were aggregated in the different treatment steps and are shown in fig 3 at each sampling location features still detected after the respective treatment step were annotated as 80 removed and 80 removed details in the si section s6 the cumulative intensities of features for each sample setting and at each sampling point are shown in si fig s22 overall as is expected the wwtps provide large reductions in both the number and the intensity of detected non target features many of which are likely to be matrix i e dom the number of features is reduced by 6 63 median 36 from the influent to the effluent fig 3 and si table s14 and the cumulative feature intensity is on average 8 5x less in the effluent than in the influent si table s14 and si fig s22 following along each treatment step the formation of new features is observed as well as the elimination of non target features for example after biological treatment across all wwtps between 36 and 52 of the detected features are newly formed median 46 while the other portion are influent features that have not been completely eliminated these values are in agreement with those recently reported by nürenberg et al 2019 who found that after biological treatment the percent of features originating from the influent was between 33 45 formation of features during ozonation and post treatment with activated carbon was also observed resulting in the effluents in a complex mixture of influent features biological tps otps and tps formed during activated carbon treatment as discussed in detail below on average across all wwtps the effluent was composed of approximately 45 features that originated from the influent including features removed by 80 and features removed 80 between 10 20 were features formed during biological treatment and around 10 each were features formed during either ozonation or post treatment with gac or pac sf fig 3 3 5 fate of influent features a comparison was made between the removal of all influent non target features and the removal of a selected set of 66 wastewater relevant micropollutants i e the mp66 list the largest contributor to the removal of influent non target features in all three wwtps was biological treatment with 66 81 removed by more than 80 fig 4 a in contrast only 6 42 of compounds from the mp66 list were removed in bio by 80 fig 4b this difference suggests that many of the non target features removed during bio are matrix related compounds and or that the mp66 list is biased toward compounds that are persistent during biological treatment nevertheless differences in elimination were seen among the wwtps for example the highest numbers of influent non target features were well removed during biological treatment at pr figs 3 4 si tables s13 and s14 which can be expected due to recirculation of loaded pac from the post treatment into the sbr providing additional sorption sites higher removal in biological treatment in pr was even more apparent when considering the compounds in the mp66 list fig 4b with pr removing 2 5x more target compounds than the other wwtps some misclassification of features can occur with the automated trend assignment for example eight target compounds were assigned the trend removed in ozonation in the setting in pr where no ozone was dosed fig 4b in reality these features were partially removed during biological treatment approximately 50 removal followed by a further smaller intensity decrease approximately 35 after ozonation possibly due to matrix effects due to the selected cutoffs and reduction of 63 minor trends into only 12 major trends this intensity pattern was assigned as removed in ozonation however the original minor trend can easily be used to identify such instances and generally misclassification with this method is expected to be less than with other classification method e g hierarchical cluster analysis during ozonation 7 18 of influent non target features detected after biological treatment were removed 80 in gl and ar at a specific ozone dose of 0 21 0 08 go3 gdoc while 3 28 of the compounds in the mp66 list were removed for both the non target features and the mp66 compounds a difference was seen between the two ozone doses in ar for the non target features detected after biological treatment 6 4 2 7 n 3 were well removed 80 at ar0 2o3 gac44000 while 24 8 1 4 n 2 were well removed at ar0 3o3 gac48000 similarly a difference was seen for the mp66 compounds fig 4b the number of target compounds removed 80 during ozonation was 4 at the lower specific ozone dose 0 15 0 03 go3 gdoc and increased to 16 at the higher specific ozone dose 0 32 0 04 go3 gdoc in gl removal of the mp66 compounds differed even though similar ozone doses were applied the second sampling date was possibly influenced by rain or snow melt but still showed a high organic matter content table 1 pointing to a different matrix composition that may have influenced the removal of compounds in pr the samples reported to be dosed at 0 1 0 2 go3 gdoc did not show a clear trend for higher removal at higher ozone dose moreover higher removal of influent non target features as well as mp66 compounds was observed compared to ar and gl at similar specific ozone doses between 21 and 27 of influent non target features and between 45 and 66 of mp66 compounds were removed 80 fig 4a and b based on these values and on the observed abatement of quantified target compounds krahnstöver et al 2018 we assume that ozone doses applied at this location were higher than reported and showed a high uncertainty the higher ozone dose applied at pr complicates the evaluation of the post treatments pac sf due to increased elimination in ozonation compounds are already close to the lod prior to post treatment any additional elimination achieved in post treatment cannot be fully quantified and therefore the elimination in pac sf is likely underestimated at average pac doses of 7 7 and 13 6 mg l corresponding to the two sampling campaigns with reportedly similar specific ozone doses of 0 2 go3 gdoc 8 21 of remaining non target features are removed 80 while 13 59 of mp66 compounds are removed without clear differences among the different pac doses a number of interesting observations were found with regard to the effect of gac bvs and the coupling of o3 gac in gl more of the remaining non target features were well removed in the freshest gac 33 7 000 8 000 bv with a relatively small decrease in removal with increasing bvs 18 25 17 000 33 000 bv this pattern was observed for both all non target features and the mp66 list and also with and without pre ozonation though the decrease was more pronounced in the case of gac without pre ozonation removal decreased by approximately 15 without pre ozonation compared to approximately 5 with pre ozonation this difference may be due to higher biological activity on the gac after pre ozonation though more research is needed on this point the percent of well removed features was smaller during the second sampling gac bvs 17 000 19 000 compared to the third sampling gac bvs 31 000 33 000 which was not expected this difference may be explained by a higher influent flow resulting in lower inflow concentrations on the second sampling day which was found to decrease the sorption efficiency in gac columns oltramare et al in prep mcardell et al 2020 these results show that gac alone removes quite a high number of remaining features but a pre ozonation can increase the overall removal under conditions where the gac filtration may not perform optimally the influence of the ozone dose can be seen in ar especially when considering the mp66 list the increase of the specific ozone dose from 0 15 go3 gdoc to 0 32 go3 gdoc led to a slight increase in the number of target compounds removed in the advanced treatment i e o3 gac from 36 to 43 44 000 and 48 000 bv respectively previous results boehler et al 2020 mcardell et al 2020 have shown that for target compounds pre ozonation prior to gac filtration can be an effective method to extend the lifetime of the gac these examples show that this may also be true for non target compounds though further research will be necessary however a combined treatment of course requires additional investment costs finally the fates of the 1207 potential industrial compounds prioritized in section 3 3 were also investigated because the industrial inputs were sporadic and generally short lived the removal was evaluated only in the sample with the highest intensity this meant that depending on when the discharge was observed different advanced treatment settings may have been applied for the removal of different features the majority of the potential industrial compounds were well removed i e 80 removal during biological treatment si table s11 indicating that traditional wastewater treatment is in many cases sufficient to remove these compounds ozonation was also an important removal mechanism and was responsible for elimination an additional 9 of the detected industrial features 11 were well removed with ozonation combined with post treatment less than 3 of potential industrial features were found to be persistent these results demonstrate that although emissions of high intensity can occur in the overwhelming number of cases these emissions are substantially reduced through the wastewater treatment technologies applied 3 6 formation and fate of transformation products during wastewater treatment non target features are removed but new features i e tps are also formed as seen in fig 3 and discussed above the assessment of the formation and subsequent removal of these tps is important for the overall evaluation of different wastewater treatment steps similar to the compounds originating from the influent tps formed from biodegradation i e bio tps were removed in ozonation better in pr compared to gl and ar this is most probably due to ozone doses at pr that was higher than reported although other factors may also be responsible e g different wastewater matrices slightly higher ozone doses in ar had also a minor effect with regards to the removal of bio tps 66 removal in ar0 1o3 gac44000 vs 74 removal in ar0 3o3 gac48000 p 0 01 t test with regard to gac the highest percentage of bio tps were well removed in the freshest gac 73 in glnoo3 gac7000 48 in glnoo3 gac17000 52 in glnoo3 gac31000 as was expected and on average more bio tps were removed when pre ozonation was applied 74 7 removal 80 with pre ozonation vs 57 13 removal without pre ozonation the formation of tps in both pac sf and gac post treatment was also observed the formation of tps during gac and sand filtration has also been reported in nürenberg et al 2019 and is not surprising since both the gac filter and the sand filter used for pac removal can be expected to be biologically active reungoat et al 2012 between 11 40 of non target features detected in the effluent were formed during post treatment with ac however no significant differences were observed among the various post treatments of particular interest was the formation of otps and their fate in activated carbon post treatment due to the novelty of coupling these technologies for wastewater treatment it is clear that not all micropollutants or otps are captured through reverse phase lc however this method is standard practice for the measurement of polar organic compounds in environmental matrices and is expected to be appropriate to measure a wide variety of micropollutants and associated tps through the trend assignment method 5 13 non target features 1911 features on average with increasing intensities after ozonation were classified as non target otps fig 3 a subset were suspect otps based on an exact mass suspect screening with a list of 999 known otps si table s8 details in section 2 3 3 per sampling date the average number of suspect hits with an otp trend was 53 min 43 max 65 nsamples 20 si table s16 the suspect otps were previously found to be formed from 84 relevant micropollutants in laboratory experiments or wastewater treatment while many of the non target otps are likely formed from reactions with the wastewater matrix as well as otps from other micropollutants the amount of both non target and suspect otps formed during ozonation did not correlate with ozone dose si table s16 this was previously reported for non target otps with a broader range of ozone doses schollée et al 2018 and is thought to result from the differing wastewater matrices as well as different otps i e higher generation otps being formed at higher ozone doses overall 68 9 of non target otps were well removed i e eliminated 80 during post treatment this value was significantly lower for the suspect otps student s t test p 0 01 of which 59 15 were well removed indicating that known otps originating from micropollutants may be more stable during post treatment fig 5 and si table s16 in both cases the lowest removal was observed in pr with no pac addition onto the sand filter pr0 3o3 nopac tukey s hsd p 0 01 54 non target otps and 43 suspect otps were well removed notable differences in otp removal among the post treatments could be observed though not statistically significant p 0 05 t test in pr a higher removal of suspect otps and to a smaller extent non target otps was observed at 12 13 mg l pac compared to 8 mg l pac fig 5a nevertheless a high removal was also observed when no pac was added onto the sand filter indicating that a large part of removal is due to biological transformation others found that otps are only moderately well removed during sand filtration and or biofiltration without additional sorptive removal by ac gulde et al 2021 knopp et al 2016 schollée et al 2018 we can however not exclude that removal with pac is underestimated as discussed in section 3 5 looking at gac filtration across both gl and ar removal of suspect otps was highest for the freshest gac as expected 65 47 59 and 51 otp removal at 8 000 19 000 33 000 and 44 000 bvs respectively fig 5b lower removal at 19 000 bv is likely related to higher flow on this sampling day as discussed in section 3 5 contrarily removal for non target otps was not significantly different among the gac sampled at different bvs 66 in gl0 2o3 gac7000 72 in gl0 2o3 gac17000 74 in gl0 2o3 gac31000 67 in ar0 2o3 gac44000 73 in ar0 2o3 gac48000 lower sorption with higher bv may be compensated by higher biotransformation which could also be the case for the suspect otps but to a lesser extent a linkage analysis schollée et al 2015 was performed using 45 expected ozonation transformation reactions the possible parent compounds were non target features with decreasing trends during ozonation while possible otps were non target features with increasing trends during ozonation the number of possible parent compounds which could be linked to otps through the expected transformations per sampling date ranged from 2576 to 4341 while the number of possible otps ranged from 1108 to 3579 it should be noted that in this analysis parents can be matched to many otps and vice versa and false links may arise schollée et al 2018 the reaction types detected most were 2h 2h h2o o and ch3 si fig s25 which have also been reported in previous linkage analyses during ozonation of non targets schollée et al 2018 or of dom remucal et al 2020 hierarchical cluster analysis revealed one cluster where the otps appeared to be better removed at higher gac bvs si fig s26 this cluster included the transformation reactions 3o h 4o h and 5o h and suggests that for these highly oxygenated otps biological degradation is the primary removal mechanism further details in si section s7 finally the characteristics of well removed and stable otps were compared on all sampling dates the median m z of stable otps was lower than for well removed otps si fig s23 in the gac samples the median rt of stable otps was also lower than for well removed otps si fig s24 these results imply that otps not well removed in gac filters were generally smaller and more polar i e less prone to sorption as has been reported previously schollée et al 2018 this rt change was not observed in most of the samples treated with pac possibly suggesting different removal mechanisms between the two post treatment types overall these results demonstrate that based on the non targets detected with the applied lc hrms method both gac and pac sf appear to be suitable for the removal of otps formed during ozonation 4 conclusions improvements and novel additions to previous non target screening workflows resulted in a fully validated method for the characterization and identification of detected lc hrms non target features with this workflow trends were automatically assigned to each feature detected in the wwtp subsequently formation and elimination of features in different advanced wastewater treatments could be evaluated both for all detected non target features and for a subset of 66 wastewater relevant micropollutants moreover a prioritization method was applied to identify non target features potentially of industrial origin and assess their fate during wastewater treatment finally the applicability of gac and pac sf as post treatment for the removal of otps was evaluated the application of this workflow showed that 1 the majority of non target features and features intensities including those potentially originating from industrial inputs were removed during biological treatment at all three wwtps approximately three quarters of all features were well removed i e 80 intensity reduction demonstrating that this treatment step is effective for the abatement of a broad spectrum of compounds that are detected with rplc hrms including both matrix component such as dom and polar organic micropollutants 2 advanced treatment provided an additional barrier and contributed to the removal of features recalcitrant in biological treatment this step is especially important for the removal of micropollutants measured here with a set of 66 wastewater relevant compounds of which 38 80 were removed by 80 during advanced treatment during biological treatment only 6 40 of these compounds were well removed 3 between one and five percent of all non target features detected in the influent of one wwtp were classified as potentially originating from industrial inputs 54 compounds could be tentatively identified through spectral library database matching more than 83 of the assigned industrial non targets were well removed during biological treatment while an additional 11 of features well removed during advanced treatment these results demonstrate that in the majority of cases the applied wastewater treatment lead to a substantial reduction in potential emissions 4 approximately half of the features detected in the effluent originated from the influent while the other half were transformation products formed during the various treatment steps this result emphasizes the importance of understanding the formation and toxicity of transformation products as well as high intensity influent features that are not completely abated during treatment 5 more than half of the non target features formed during ozonation i e non target otps were well removed during activated carbon post treatment regardless of gac bvs or pac dose otps expected to be highly oxygenated were better removed at higher gac bvs in contrast for suspect otps expected to be formed from micropollutants higher removal was observed at higher pac doses and in fresher gac different reaction mechanisms i e sorption vs biodegradation influence otp removal in gac filters emphasizing the need for more research on the performance of biological activated carbon filters

16949,advanced treatment is increasingly being applied to improve abatement of micropollutants in wastewater effluent and reduce their load to surface waters in this study non target screening of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms data collected at three swiss wastewater treatment plants wwtps was used to evaluate different advanced wastewater treatment setups including 1 granular activated carbon gac filtration alone 2 pre ozonation followed by gac filtration and 3 pre ozonation followed by powdered activated carbon pac dosed onto a sand filter samples were collected at each treatment step of the wwtp and analyzed with reverse phase liquid chromatography coupled to hrms each wwtp received a portion of industrial wastewater and a prioritization method was applied to select non target features potentially resulting from industrial activities approximately 37 000 non target features were found in the influents of the wwtps a number of non target features 1207 were prioritized as likely of industrial origin and 54 were identified through database spectral matching the fates of all detected non target features were assessed through a novel automated trend assignment method a trend was assigned to each non target feature based on the normalized intensity profile for each sampling date results showed that 73 4 of influent non target features and the majority of industrial features 89 were well removed i e 80 intensity reduction during biological treatment in all three wwtps advanced treatment removed on average an additional 11 of influent non target features with no significant differences observed among the different advanced treatment settings in contrast when considering a subset of 66 known micropollutants advanced treatment was necessary to adequately abate these compounds and higher abatement was observed in fresh gac 7 000 8 000 bed volumes bvs compared to older gac 18 000 48 000 bvs 80 vs 56 of micropollutants were well removed respectively approximately half of the features detected in the wwtp effluents were features newly formed during the various treatment steps in ozonation between 1108 3579 features were classified as potential non target ozonation transformation products otps no difference could be observed for their removal in gac filters at the bvs investigated 70 of otps were well removed on average similar amounts 67 was observed with pac 7 7 13 6 mg l dosed onto a sand filter demonstrating that a post treatment with activated carbon is efficient for the removal of otps graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords ozonation micropollutants non target analysis transformation products industrial wastewater 1 introduction trace organic compounds or micropollutants originating from human activities

organic matter dom is also degraded in ozonation and can lead to the formation of disinfection by products dbps richardson et al 2007 von gunten 2003 therefore a biologically active post treatment should be applied after ozonation hollender et al 2009 reungoat et al 2012 powdered activated carbon pac treatment is an alternative method for advanced wastewater treatment boehler et al 2012 kovalova et al 2013 margot et al 2013 snyder et al 2007 because compounds adsorb to the activated carbon without the formation of tps or dbps pac treatment should also be followed by a polishing step such as sand filtration to remove particles a third option for advanced wastewater treatment is the use of granular activated carbon gac filtration which is considered more sustainable because gac can be reactivated siegrist et al 2019 gac filtration can remove compounds both through sorption and through the promotion of biologically active filters also referred to as biological activated carbon bac altmann et al s 2016 choi et al 2008 hernández leal et al 2011 efficiency of removal in gac however can be expected to decrease over time as adsorption sites become limiting benstoem et al 2017 and is strongly affected by contact time sari et al 2020 due to the demonstrated advantages of both ozonation and activated carbon for the removal of micropollutants research into coupling these technologies has been pursued and has shown promising results knopp et al 2016 lee et al 2012 reungoat et al 2010 sánchez polo et al 2006 the coupling of low dose ozonation i e pre ozonation with gac filtration is expected to be cost efficient while also increasing overall removal due to the synergism of the two technologies in the first step pre ozonation leads to partial abatement of micropollutants and the formation of more readily biodegradable compounds at lower energy consumption and therefore costs compared to ozone treatment at higher doses in the second step adsorption to activated carbon functions as a removal mechanism for micropollutants while the presence of increased assimilable organic carbon aoc through pre ozonation can promote biofilm formation together these are expected to result in better removal of recalcitrant micropollutants otps and dbps bourgin et al 2018 knopp et al 2016 the promotion of biofilm formation and the transition to a bac treatment and

target screening of known micropollutants e g bourgin et al 2018 knopp et al 2016 reungoat et al 2012 reungoat et al 2010 a more comprehensive assessment of unknown compounds is lacking a wide variety of analytical methods have been applied to assess the occurrence and fate of micropollutants in wwtps and in the environment fatta et al 2007 richardson and kimura 2016 however screening methods that focus on a limited number of target compounds provide an incomplete picture non target screening nts with high resolution mass spectrometry hrms can be applied to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the compounds present hollender et al 2017 ibáñez et al 2008 krauss et al 2010 petrie et al 2015 nts is generally used in one of the following two ways the first and more common method is to identify unknown substances by applying appropriately selected differential data analyses to prioritize a small number of unknown non target features brunner et al 2019 hollender et al 2017 schymanski et al 2014b this analysis method is relevant especially when looking for unknown sources of toxicity for example or trying to narrow the knowledge gap about potential new emerging chemicals of concern however by choosing to focus on a limited number of prioritized non target features ultimately some knowledge is lost about the overall chemical burden of the samples the second nts strategy is to apply data mining to comprehensively characterize all detected non target features and identify possible patterns resulting from a treatment or different environmental conditions without the goal of compound identification this type of non target screening has only been applied sparingly to date brunner et al 2020 nürenberg et al 2019 schollée et al 2018 specifically information about the formation of unknown otps and their fate in post treatment is sparse deeb et al 2017 itzel et al 2020 schollée et al 2018 in this study the two complementary nts approaches were applied to study advanced wastewater treatment at three wwtps across switzerland first for a complete nts characterization trends of non target features which were automatically assigned with a newly developed method were compared among different advanced wastewater treatments i e ozone and or activated carbon treatment second since each wwtp received a portion of industrial wastewater a prioritization approach modified from anliker et al 2020 was applied to select and identify non target features possibly of industrial origin i e nts identification goals of the study were 1 to assess the fate of non target features including possible industrial compounds 2 to compare the impact of advanced treatment with low dose ozone and or activated carbon on the formation and removal of non target features including evaluating the formation of tp dbps and 3 comparing the effectiveness of different biological activated carbon treatment i e gac or pac dosed onto a sand filter for the

sampling campaigns were conducted across the three wwtps and 140 samples were collected for a complete list see si table s1 samples were collected in borosilicate glass bottles frozen and kept at 20 c until analysis influent samples were collected one day prior at gl and ar to account for hydraulic retention time in the wwtps 2 2 chemical analysis samples were measured as described in bourgin et al 2018 further details on the analytical procedure are also available in the si section s2 briefly samples were first thawed overnight and filtered all samples were diluted 1 1 w w with nanopure water except influent samples which were diluted 1 3 w w to account for possible higher matrix effects each sample was spiked with a mixture of 147 isotopically labeled internal standards iss si table s2 which covered a broad mass and retention time range and were used as quality controls at multiple points in the data evaluation after filtration and spiking samples were stored for a maximum of 8 days at 4 c prior to measurement in addition to individual samples pooled samples were produced for each matrix at each wwtp for example equal aliquots of all bio samples from wwtp altenrhein were mixed to generate an ar bio pool si table s1 these pooled samples were also split into two sets one set was only spiked with iss and one set that was spiked with iss and a mixture of reference micropollutants i e target compounds for the non target screening the pooled samples were injected in triplicate and were used for data cleaning as advocated for in bader et al 2016 through the implementation of a replicate filter discussed in section 2 3 1 and in si section s3 samples were enriched with a multi layer online solid phase extraction spe and then measured in reverse phase liquid chromatography followed by positive electrospray ionization and high resolution mass spectrometry lc esi hrms the mass range was 100 1000 m z mass error 5 ppm and the resolution was 140 000 for ms1 spectra and 17 500 for ms ms spectra further details on the analytical method can be found in the si section s2 2 3 data analysis in the following non target feature is used when referring to a unique mass to change m z retention time rt combination that was detected the term profile is used when referring to multiple detections of the same non target feature across samples and the corresponding detected intensities of this feature analysis of lc hrms data entailed the following steps detailed information on each step is provided in the sections below first pre processing of the lc hrms data was done to detect unique exact mass retention time pairs i e a non target feature in each sample second to analyze the trends of non target features in the different wastewater treatment settings an automated trend assignment method was developed and applied third two lists were used for feature annotation 1 a list of known organic micropollutants and 2 a list of known ozonation transformation products otps fourth a classification method was applied similar to anliker et al 2020 to prioritize and identify possible industrial inputs in the two influent streams in prorheno finally a linkage analysis was used to screen for possible unknown otps and compare their removal in different post treatment settings 2 3 1 pre processing acquired raw files were converted to centroid data and mzxml files with msconvert v 3 0 11781 from proteowizard chambers et al 2012 unless otherwise noted data analysis was performed in r v 3 5 0 v 3 5 3 r development core team 2017 and rstudio v 1 1 453 v 1 2 1335 the list of r packages used is provided in the si table s3 and additional functions are available at www github com dutchjes the non target screening workflow si fig s4 is summarized below more detailed information and evaluation of different processing steps is available in the si section s3 schollée et al 2015 and schollée et al 2018 the evaluation of the pre processing was done with a set of 147 isotopically labeled internal standards for the quantification of false positives and false negatives new pre processing steps include the following a profile grouping step a replicate filter based on the pooled samples a profile quality control filter annotation and removal of homologues and an algorithm for missing value imputation the implementation of these additional steps are discussed below their evaluation is discussed in the section 3 1 further information is proved in the si section s3 pre processing of hrms data was performed as follows 1 peak picking and 2 profiling were done with functions from envipick v 2 4 loos 2016 settings in si section s3 and executed with rmassscreening stravs 2020 next a 3 profile grouping step was implemented to detect cases where features belonging to the same chromatographic peak were split across multiple profiles additional information in si section s3 si fig s5 thereafter a 4 replicate filter was applied using the triplicate injections of the pooled samples non target features were only retained if present in all 3 injections of at least one pooled sample type bader et al 2016 schulze et al 2020 following the replicate filter 5 intensity normalization was performed as in albergamo et al 2019 si fig s6 a 6 profile quality control filter was developed to address cases where different chromatographic peaks were incorrectly assigned to the same profile these cases were detected based on the boxplot rule to detect outliers tukey 1977 further information in si section s3 next 7 isotopes adducts and homologues were annotated with the non target package v 1 9 loos 2015 https github com blosloos nontarget settings in si section s3 si figs s7 s8 and s9 and removed with the aim to a eliminate multiple profiles associated with one compound isotopes and adducts and b exclude profiles possibly associated with the wastewater matrix homologues previous studies have shown that many of the homologues detected in wastewater are related to either surfactants garcía et al 2019 mairinger et al 2021 to matrix components such as proteins mairinger 2019 or to dom verkh et al 2018 all of which were not the focus of this characterization in 8 intensities were adjusted based on the dilution factors of the different wastewater matrices finally in 9 missing value imputation was done by randomly drawing values from below the estimated global instrument loq based on the feature intensity distribution si fig s10 more information in si section s3 this algorithm accounts for missing data resulting from non target features being below the lod it does not address missing at random cases e g instances where the peak picking missed a high intensity peak however in our experience these occurrences are rare a final data matrix was obtained with a row for each non target feature defined by the mean m z and rt of a profile a column for each sample and populated with the respective intensities the pre processing was optimized with 147 iss and with the final workflow 100 147 iss corresponding to 156 profiles were detected si table s4 2 3 2 automated trend assignment to analyze trends of non target features across a wwtp a method was developed to automatically assign trends to each non target feature for each sampling date each profile was normalized to the maximum intensity detected in the four sampling locations i e inf bio ozo eff domains of high 100 60 medium 60 20 and low intensity 20 were defined si fig s11 and the intensity at each treatment step was converted to 1 0 1 respectively to generate an intensity profile barcode which could then be interpreted as profile trends based on four treatment steps three intensity domains and the normalization method 65 unique barcodes were generated si fig s12 these were then assigned to one of 12 major trends si fig s13 and si table s5 11 of which correspond to expected patterns in the wwtp e g removed in biological treatment removed in ozonation persistent and a twelfth for trends that didn t fit to expected patterns in wastewater treatment referred to generally as other overall the numbers of features classified as other were extremely low 1 8 0 7 of the total number of features nsam ple s 27 and were therefore not further considered trend assignment was done separately for each sampling date it was observed that a number of potential otps appeared to be formed on the sampling dates in pr where no ozone had been dosed these features were assumed to result from either analytical or experimental artifacts caused by a biofilm in the ozonation column and were removed from the entire dataset overall this method represents a significant improvement over the trend assignment that was previously done with hierarchical cluster analysis chiaia hernández et al 2017 schollée et al 2018 because 1 trends are assigned individually for each profile rather than for an entire cluster and because 2 trend assignment is done automatically increasing reproducibility and throughput 2 3 3 qualitative target and suspect screening a qualitative target screening was done with a list of 427 organic micropollutants targets were confirmed through m z and rt matches to reference compounds using 2 5 ppm and 30 seconds as tolerances for a positive match from these a list of 66 wastewater relevant micropollutants mp66 si table s7 which have been previously reported in swiss wastewater bourgin et al 2018 and were detected on all sampling dates was compiled furthermore to evaluate different post treatments a suspect screening was also conducted for 999 known otps obtained from the literature si table s8 these otps were either previously found to be formed during wastewater treatment or in laboratory experiments the list included otps from 84 parent micropollutants and spanned wide m z and rt ranges m z 86 0598 764 4791 rt 5 1 24 7 minutes suspect hits were tentatively identified with exact mass only 5 ppm tolerance confidence level 3 schymanski et al 2014a screening was done with functions available in rmassscreening stravs 2020 and at www github com dutchjes 2 3 4 characterization of wwtp influents and possible industrial contribution classification of non target features possibly of industrial origin was done in the two influent streams from prorheno using intensity spread calculated as the ratio of the 95th 5th profile intensity percentiles according to a method by anliker et al 2020 with the following modifications first classification was done with non target features detected in influent samples rather than with effluent samples classifying influent features was considered an advantage for this study because parent compounds are directly measured prior to treatment and potential transformation and because the removal over the whole treatment train could be evaluated furthermore in pr separate influent streams were collected from industrial and municipal discharges and different advanced treatment settings were sampled so changes in intensity in the effluents could be a result of higher lower removal efficiency and not necessarily related to industrial inputs however classification of influent features also presented a challenge because the expected intensity spread is higher since detection of industrial peaks would be restricted to the day of emission and not spread out and diluted over multiple sampling days on account of retention in the wwtp therefore the cutoff criteria for classification as an industrial input was increased to an intensity spread 1e4 and no minimum number of consecutive daily detections was included exceptionally large intensity spreads were generated in cases where the 5th percentile was actually a non detect therefore a low intensity baseline was simulated for the calculation of intensity spread where intensities of previously imputated data points i e non detects were increased by 1e5 this modification allowed for the detection of one time industrial inputs without generation of high spread values due to the lack of continuous time series data after classification of possible industrial non target features structure elucidation was done ms2 spectra were extracted with rmassbank stravs et al 2013 and converted to msp files ms2 were compared to library spectra with nist ms search v 2 3 stein and wallace 2017 spectral libraries included massbankeu schulze et al 2012 retrieved december 2019 mona massbank of north america http mona fiehnlab ucdavid edu retrieved december 2019 csupmf library broeckling et al 2016 and nist hrms 2017 matches were visually inspected and finally a best match was selected confidence level 2b schymanski et al 2014a 2 3 5 linkage analysis linkage analysis where parents and possible tps are linked together was performed as described in schollée et al 2015 and schollée et al 2018 to detect possible otps the table of reactions that can be expected based on known ozonation mechanisms e g addition of oxygen atoms demethylation si table s9 was edited to include additional known transformations expected ozonation transformations were derived from otps reported in literature and from predicted otps o3 ppd lee et al 2017 schollée et al in prep in total 45 possible reactions were included possible parent compounds were any feature with a trend that decreased during ozonation while possible otps were any feature assigned a trend that increased during ozonation an m z window of 5 ppm was used to link possible pairs 3 results and discussion 3 1 evaluation of pre processing of optimized non target screening workflow in accordance with discussions in the non target screening community about data quality schulze et al 2020 a number of new pre processing steps were implemented into previously developed non target screening workflows schollée et al 2018 schollée et al 2015 to reduce noise and eliminate artifacts or redundant non target features these additional steps were evaluated with a set of 147 internal standards iss the motivation and impact of these additional steps is discussed briefly below detailed information can be found in the si section s3 initially after peak picking and profiling a total of 459 867 non target features were detected fig 1 to evaluate the efficiency of the pre processing non target features of the internal standards were used based on exact mass and rt 1136 of non target features matched to the expected m z and rts of the 147 iss for the purposes of the evaluation of the pre processing duplicate hits of the iss were labeled as false positives at least 989 since multiple features were detected for each is no false negatives were found since at least 1 non target feature was detected for each is additional workflow steps were therefore incorporated to reduce the number of is false positives and the overall number of non target features detected the first additional step was a profile grouping algorithm using very narrow m z and rt windows 1 ppm and 20 seconds respectively the grouping algorithm combined possible split peaks into one profile this step resulted in a 14 reduction in the total number of features fig 1 and reduced the number of detected is features from 1136 to 929 thereby lowering the number of false positive is hits by 21 from 989 to 782 si table s4 the second additional step included was a replicate filter based on the pooled samples adopted from standard methods in metabolomics broadhurst et al 2018 overall higher numbers of features were detected in the pooled samples compared to the individual samples si fig s15 suggesting that very few compounds fell below the lod due to dilution in the pooled samples through implementation of this quality control step the number of detected is features decreased from 929 to 161 thereby decreasing the false positive is features to 14 98 overall the number of non target features was reduced by 83 next intensity normalization was incorporated to account for matrix effects from the different wastewater matrices as explained in albergamo et al 2019 and resulted in a similar intensity distribution across all samples si fig s6 subsequently a profile quality control criterion considered the intra profile variability of m z and rt the number of detected is features decreased to 158 with 11 false positives while the percent of detected non target features was further decreased by 10 potential interfering or redundant features isotopes adducts and homologues were annotated non target package v 1 9 loos 2015 and were removed to reduce redundancy in the data set the number of detected iss decreased to 156 false positives reduced by 2 overall the number of non target features decreased by 17 from 60 953 to 50 722 through implementation of this criteria thereafter feature intensities were adjusted for dilution 1 3 for inf samples 1 1 for all other samples and missing value imputation was applied which estimated the intensity lod per profile and randomly sampled from below this threshold to fill non detects through this optimized method a highly curated data set was produced with 0 false negative is hits 100 true positive is hits and 50 722 detected non target features 3 2 evaluation of automated trend assignment across wwtps trends were assigned to non target features on each sampling date based on the normalized intensity profile to indicate if the feature was removed persistent or formed as described in section 2 3 2 and in the si section s3 the assignment of compounds into either one or another trend is governed by the definition of the cutoffs between the three normalized intensity domains therefore a sensitivity analysis was conducted with different domain cutoffs si table s12 to determine the robustness of the trend assignment domain cutoffs considered were 20 60 30 70 20 80 and 10 90 where the first number is the cutoff between the low and middle domains and the second number is the cutoff between the middle and high domains differences among the percent of features assigned to a particular trend ranged only from 1 6 to 1 7 si figs s19 and s20 establishing the method to be robust against the selection of cutoffs for the high middle and low domains further details in the si section s5 in the end 20 was selected as the lower cutoff representing a minimum intensity elimination of 80 because it corresponds to the overall micropollutant abatement target set by the new swiss regulation for the upper cutoff 60 was chosen because it equally divided the remaining portion this automated trend assignment was validated by comparing trends assigned to the non target hrms data with trends assigned to eight target compounds quantified in the same samples additionally trends assigned to the internal standards were evaluated quantified target screening results of the so called swiss indicator substances götz et al 2015 were reported elsewhere gl mcardell et al 2020 oltramare et al in prep ar bogler 2019 pr krahnstöver et al 2018 and trends were assigned through the same method as for the non target hrms data except with quantified concentrations rather than non target feature intensities for each sampling day concentrations were normalized to the maximum concentration normalized concentrations were binned into high middle and low domains and a trend was assigned in total quantified data was available for 8 9 target compounds on 25 sampling days resulting in 206 trend assignments for comparison of these 172 trends were the same between the quantified target data and the non target profile intensity data with an average of 84 17 consistency per sampling date si table s6 demonstrating that overall the trends assigned to the non target features was representative of the results obtained with quantified targets finally the trend analysis was also evaluated based on 147 detected iss corresponding to 156 profiles of these 90 3 were assigned the correct trend i e stable intensity across sampling points trend 10 this was increased to 95 3 when the 8 profiles resulting from split profiles were manually removed 3 3 characterization of influents and potential industrial contribution a general characterization of the four influent streams i e gl ar pr comm and pr chem was performed further details in si section s4 principal component analysis pca in si figs s16 and s17 subsequently in pr a classification method was applied to find influent features potentially of industrial origin finally structure elucidation was performed on the selected potential industrial features a total of 37 427 non target features were detected in the four influent streams ngl 3 nar 5 npr comm 15 npr chem 14 with between 17 514 gl and 22 862 pr chem non target features detected in one influent stream almost a quarter 23 of all influent features 11 482 features si fig s17 were found in all four influents indicating wastewater commonality despite different industrial inputs in contrast between 2 8 features were unique to one influent stream in the pca si fig s17 some differences are observed among the influents for example samples from the first sampling campaign in ar appeared to be substantially different si fig s17 however it is not clear what the cause of this difference is perhaps a change in industrial input in the catchment e g due to batch production classification of potential industrial inputs with the intensity spread method was carried out only on the two pr influent streams since calculating the intensity spread was not possible in ar and gl on account of the low number of influent samples further details in section 2 3 4 this classification resulted in a total of 1207 non target influent features as potential industrial features si table s10 in pr comm 274 1 3 of detected features and in pr chem 977 4 3 potential industrial features were detected si table s10 and fig s18 note that some features were classified as industrial in both influents to identify the potential industrial compounds ms2 spectra were extracted and compared to the nist spectral library of the 1207 possible industrial features ms2 spectra was available for 754 features this list was further reduced to features with clean ms2 spectra defined as mspurity score 40 lawson et al 2017 resulting in 556 ms2 spectra that were evaluated matches to library spectra were found for 54 compounds i e confidence level 2b schymanski et al 2014a overall 37 of the 54 identified compounds were present in the norman substance database norman susdat aalizadeh et al 2020 including 21 that were on the stoff ident letzel et al 2017 list of environmentally relevant compounds and included reach regisitration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals ec no 1907 2006 chemicals pharmaceuticals and transformation products si table s10 identified compounds included some that could be confirmed from the qualitative target screening e g 18β glycyrrhentinic acid 1h benzotriazole atenolol carbamazepine crotamiton mycophenolic acid naproxen n desmethyltramadol oseltamivir praziquantel and propamocarb intensity profiles of 18β glycyrrhetinic acid pharmaceutical used in dermatology and cosmetology applications and praziquantel a pharmaceutical only licensed for veterinary use in switzerland are shown in fig 2 in both examples high peaks detected over 1 2 months was observed in pr chem samples in the pr comm samples no detections of praziquantel were observed while for 18β glycyrrhetinic acid a relatively constant baseline was observed as could be expected from domestic use 3 4 summary of non target feature trends using the optimized non target screening workflow and automated trend assignment the fate of all non target features including potential industrial inputs and known target compounds mp66 list could be traced across the three wwtps the trends detected through the automated trend assignment of all non target features were aggregated in the different treatment steps and are shown in fig 3 at each sampling location features still detected after the respective treatment step were annotated as 80 removed and 80 removed details in the si section s6 the cumulative intensities of features for each sample setting and at each sampling point are shown in si fig s22 overall as is expected the wwtps provide large reductions in both the number and the intensity of detected non target features many of which are likely to be matrix i e dom the number of features is reduced by 6 63 median 36 from the influent to the effluent fig 3 and si table s14 and the cumulative feature intensity is on average 8 5x less in the effluent than in the influent si table s14 and si fig s22 following along each treatment step the formation of new features is observed as well as the elimination of non target features for example after biological treatment across all wwtps between 36 and 52 of the detected features are newly formed median 46 while the other portion are influent features that have not been completely eliminated these values are in agreement with those recently reported by nürenberg et al 2019 who found that after biological treatment the percent of features originating from the influent was between 33 45 formation of features during ozonation and post treatment with activated carbon was also observed resulting in the effluents in a complex mixture of influent features biological tps otps and tps formed during activated carbon treatment as discussed in detail below on average across all wwtps the effluent was composed of approximately 45 features that originated from the influent including features removed by 80 and features removed 80 between 10 20 were features formed during biological treatment and around 10 each were features formed during either ozonation or post treatment with gac or pac sf fig 3 3 5 fate of influent features a comparison was made between the removal of all influent non target features and the removal of a selected set of 66 wastewater relevant micropollutants i e the mp66 list the largest contributor to the removal of influent non target features in all three wwtps was biological treatment with 66 81 removed by more than 80 fig 4 a in contrast only 6 42 of compounds from the mp66 list were removed in bio by 80 fig 4b this difference suggests that many of the non target features removed during bio are matrix related compounds and or that the mp66 list is biased toward compounds that are persistent during biological treatment nevertheless differences in elimination were seen among the wwtps for example the highest numbers of influent non target features were well removed during biological treatment at pr figs 3 4 si tables s13 and s14 which can be expected due to recirculation of loaded pac from the post treatment into the sbr providing additional sorption sites higher removal in biological treatment in pr was even more apparent when considering the compounds in the mp66 list fig 4b with pr removing 2 5x more target compounds than the other wwtps some misclassification of features can occur with the automated trend assignment for example eight target compounds were assigned the trend removed in ozonation in the setting in pr where no ozone was dosed fig 4b in reality these features were partially removed during biological treatment approximately 50 removal followed by a further smaller intensity decrease approximately 35 after ozonation possibly due to matrix effects due to the selected cutoffs and reduction of 63 minor trends into only 12 major trends this intensity pattern was assigned as removed in ozonation however the original minor trend can easily be used to identify such instances and generally misclassification with this method is expected to be less than with other classification method e g hierarchical cluster analysis during ozonation 7 18 of influent non target features detected after biological treatment were removed 80 in gl and ar at a specific ozone dose of 0 21 0 08 go3 gdoc while 3 28 of the compounds in the mp66 list were removed for both the non target features and the mp66 compounds a difference was seen between the two ozone doses in ar for the non target features detected after biological treatment 6 4 2 7 n 3 were well removed 80 at ar0 2o3 gac44000 while 24 8 1 4 n 2 were well removed at ar0 3o3 gac48000 similarly a difference was seen for the mp66 compounds fig 4b the number of target compounds removed 80 during ozonation was 4 at the lower specific ozone dose 0 15 0 03 go3 gdoc and increased to 16 at the higher specific ozone dose 0 32 0 04 go3 gdoc in gl removal of the mp66 compounds differed even though similar ozone doses were applied the second sampling date was possibly influenced by rain or snow melt but still showed a high organic matter content table 1 pointing to a different matrix composition that may have influenced the removal of compounds in pr the samples reported to be dosed at 0 1 0 2 go3 gdoc did not show a clear trend for higher removal at higher ozone dose moreover higher removal of influent non target features as well as mp66 compounds was observed compared to ar and gl at similar specific ozone doses between 21 and 27 of influent non target features and between 45 and 66 of mp66 compounds were removed 80 fig 4a and b based on these values and on the observed abatement of quantified target compounds krahnstöver et al 2018 we assume that ozone doses applied at this location were higher than reported and showed a high uncertainty the higher ozone dose applied at pr complicates the evaluation of the post treatments pac sf due to increased elimination in ozonation compounds are already close to the lod prior to post treatment any additional elimination achieved in post treatment cannot be fully quantified and therefore the elimination in pac sf is likely underestimated at average pac doses of 7 7 and 13 6 mg l corresponding to the two sampling campaigns with reportedly similar specific ozone doses of 0 2 go3 gdoc 8 21 of remaining non target features are removed 80 while 13 59 of mp66 compounds are removed without clear differences among the different pac doses a number of interesting observations were found with regard to the effect of gac bvs and the coupling of o3 gac in gl more of the remaining non target features were well removed in the freshest gac 33 7 000 8 000 bv with a relatively small decrease in removal with increasing bvs 18 25 17 000 33 000 bv this pattern was observed for both all non target features and the mp66 list and also with and without pre ozonation though the decrease was more pronounced in the case of gac without pre ozonation removal decreased by approximately 15 without pre ozonation compared to approximately 5 with pre ozonation this difference may be due to higher biological activity on the gac after pre ozonation though more research is needed on this point the percent of well removed features was smaller during the second sampling gac bvs 17 000 19 000 compared to the third sampling gac bvs 31 000 33 000 which was not expected this difference may be explained by a higher influent flow resulting in lower inflow concentrations on the second sampling day which was found to decrease the sorption efficiency in gac columns oltramare et al in prep mcardell et al 2020 these results show that gac alone removes quite a high number of remaining features but a pre ozonation can increase the overall removal under conditions where the gac filtration may not perform optimally the influence of the ozone dose can be seen in ar especially when considering the mp66 list the increase of the specific ozone dose from 0 15 go3 gdoc to 0 32 go3 gdoc led to a slight increase in the number of target compounds removed in the advanced treatment i e o3 gac from 36 to 43 44 000 and 48 000 bv respectively previous results boehler et al 2020 mcardell et al 2020 have shown that for target compounds pre ozonation prior to gac filtration can be an effective method to extend the lifetime of the gac these examples show that this may also be true for non target compounds though further research will be necessary however a combined treatment of course requires additional investment costs finally the fates of the 1207 potential industrial compounds prioritized in section 3 3 were also investigated because the industrial inputs were sporadic and generally short lived the removal was evaluated only in the sample with the highest intensity this meant that depending on when the discharge was observed different advanced treatment settings may have been applied for the removal of different features the majority of the potential industrial compounds were well removed i e 80 removal during biological treatment si table s11 indicating that traditional wastewater treatment is in many cases sufficient to remove these compounds ozonation was also an important removal mechanism and was responsible for elimination an additional 9 of the detected industrial features 11 were well removed with ozonation combined with post treatment less than 3 of potential industrial features were found to be persistent these results demonstrate that although emissions of high intensity can occur in the overwhelming number of cases these emissions are substantially reduced through the wastewater treatment technologies applied 3 6 formation and fate of transformation products during wastewater treatment non target features are removed but new features i e tps are also formed as seen in fig 3 and discussed above the assessment of the formation and subsequent removal of these tps is important for the overall evaluation of different wastewater treatment steps similar to the compounds originating from the influent tps formed from biodegradation i e bio tps were removed in ozonation better in pr compared to gl and ar this is most probably due to ozone doses at pr that was higher than reported although other factors may also be responsible e g different wastewater matrices slightly higher ozone doses in ar had also a minor effect with regards to the removal of bio tps 66 removal in ar0 1o3 gac44000 vs 74 removal in ar0 3o3 gac48000 p 0 01 t test with regard to gac the highest percentage of bio tps were well removed in the freshest gac 73 in glnoo3 gac7000 48 in glnoo3 gac17000 52 in glnoo3 gac31000 as was expected and on average more bio tps were removed when pre ozonation was applied 74 7 removal 80 with pre ozonation vs 57 13 removal without pre ozonation the formation of tps in both pac sf and gac post treatment was also observed the formation of tps during gac and sand filtration has also been reported in nürenberg et al 2019 and is not surprising since both the gac filter and the sand filter used for pac removal can be expected to be biologically active reungoat et al 2012 between 11 40 of non target features detected in the effluent were formed during post treatment with ac however no significant differences were observed among the various post treatments of particular interest was the formation of otps and their fate in activated carbon post treatment due to the novelty of coupling these technologies for wastewater treatment it is clear that not all micropollutants or otps are captured through reverse phase lc however this method is standard practice for the measurement of polar organic compounds in environmental matrices and is expected to be appropriate to measure a wide variety of micropollutants and associated tps through the trend assignment method 5 13 non target features 1911 features on average with increasing intensities after ozonation were classified as non target otps fig 3 a subset were suspect otps based on an exact mass suspect screening with a list of 999 known otps si table s8 details in section 2 3 3 per sampling date the average number of suspect hits with an otp trend was 53 min 43 max 65 nsamples 20 si table s16 the suspect otps were previously found to be formed from 84 relevant micropollutants in laboratory experiments or wastewater treatment while many of the non target otps are likely formed from reactions with the wastewater matrix as well as otps from other micropollutants the amount of both non target and suspect otps formed during ozonation did not correlate with ozone dose si table s16 this was previously reported for non target otps with a broader range of ozone doses schollée et al 2018 and is thought to result from the differing wastewater matrices as well as different otps i e higher generation otps being formed at higher ozone doses overall 68 9 of non target otps were well removed i e eliminated 80 during post treatment this value was significantly lower for the suspect otps student s t test p 0 01 of which 59 15 were well removed indicating that known otps originating from micropollutants may be more stable during post treatment fig 5 and si table s16 in both cases the lowest removal was observed in pr with no pac addition onto the sand filter pr0 3o3 nopac tukey s hsd p 0 01 54 non target otps and 43 suspect otps were well removed notable differences in otp removal among the post treatments could be observed though not statistically significant p 0 05 t test in pr a higher removal of suspect otps and to a smaller extent non target otps was observed at 12 13 mg l pac compared to 8 mg l pac fig 5a nevertheless a high removal was also observed when no pac was added onto the sand filter indicating that a large part of removal is due to biological transformation others found that otps are only moderately well removed during sand filtration and or biofiltration without additional sorptive removal by ac gulde et al 2021 knopp et al 2016 schollée et al 2018 we can however not exclude that removal with pac is underestimated as discussed in section 3 5 looking at gac filtration across both gl and ar removal of suspect otps was highest for the freshest gac as expected 65 47 59 and 51 otp removal at 8 000 19 000 33 000 and 44 000 bvs respectively fig 5b lower removal at 19 000 bv is likely related to higher flow on this sampling day as discussed in section 3 5 contrarily removal for non target otps was not significantly different among the gac sampled at different bvs 66 in gl0 2o3 gac7000 72 in gl0 2o3 gac17000 74 in gl0 2o3 gac31000 67 in ar0 2o3 gac44000 73 in ar0 2o3 gac48000 lower sorption with higher bv may be compensated by higher biotransformation which could also be the case for the suspect otps but to a lesser extent a linkage analysis schollée et al 2015 was performed using 45 expected ozonation transformation reactions the possible parent compounds were non target features with decreasing trends during ozonation while possible otps were non target features with increasing trends during ozonation the number of possible parent compounds which could be linked to otps through the expected transformations per sampling date ranged from 2576 to 4341 while the number of possible otps ranged from 1108 to 3579 it should be noted that in this analysis parents can be matched to many otps and vice versa and false links may arise schollée et al 2018 the reaction types detected most were 2h 2h h2o o and ch3 si fig s25 which have also been reported in previous linkage analyses during ozonation of non targets schollée et al 2018 or of dom remucal et al 2020 hierarchical cluster analysis revealed one cluster where the otps appeared to be better removed at higher gac bvs si fig s26 this cluster included the transformation reactions 3o h 4o h and 5o h and suggests that for these highly oxygenated otps biological degradation is the primary removal mechanism further details in si section s7 finally the characteristics of well removed and stable otps were compared on all sampling dates the median m z of stable otps was lower than for well removed otps si fig s23 in the gac samples the median rt of stable otps was also lower than for well removed otps si fig s24 these results imply that otps not well removed in gac filters were generally smaller and more polar i e less prone to sorption as has been reported previously schollée et al 2018 this rt change was not observed in most of the samples treated with pac possibly suggesting different removal mechanisms between the two post treatment types overall these results demonstrate that based on the non targets detected with the applied lc hrms method both gac and pac sf appear to be suitable for the removal of otps formed during ozonation 4 conclusions improvements and novel additions to previous non target screening workflows resulted in a fully validated method for the characterization and identification of detected lc hrms non target features with this workflow trends were automatically assigned to each feature detected in the wwtp subsequently formation and elimination of features in different advanced wastewater treatments could be evaluated both for all detected non target features and for a subset of 66 wastewater relevant micropollutants moreover a prioritization method was applied to identify non target features potentially of industrial origin and assess their fate during wastewater treatment finally the applicability of gac and pac sf as post treatment for the removal of otps was evaluated the application of this workflow showed that 1 the majority of non target features and features intensities including those potentially originating from industrial inputs were removed during biological treatment at all three wwtps approximately three quarters of all features were well removed i e 80 intensity reduction demonstrating that this treatment step is effective for the abatement of a broad spectrum of compounds that are detected with rplc hrms including both matrix component such as dom and polar organic micropollutants 2 advanced treatment provided an additional barrier and contributed to the removal of features recalcitrant in biological treatment this step is especially important for the removal of micropollutants measured here with a set of 66 wastewater relevant compounds of which 38 80 were removed by 80 during advanced treatment during biological treatment only 6 40 of these compounds were well removed 3 between one and five percent of all non target features detected in the influent of one wwtp were classified as potentially originating from industrial inputs 54 compounds could be tentatively identified through spectral library database matching more than 83 of the assigned industrial non targets were well removed during biological treatment while an additional 11 of features well removed during advanced treatment these results demonstrate that in the majority of cases the applied wastewater treatment lead to a substantial reduction in potential emissions 4 approximately half of the features detected in the effluent originated from the influent while the other half were transformation products formed during the various treatment steps this result emphasizes the importance of understanding the formation and toxicity of transformation products as well as high intensity influent features that are not completely abated during treatment 5 more than half of the non target features formed during ozonation i e non target otps were well removed during activated carbon post treatment regardless of gac bvs or pac dose otps expected to be highly oxygenated were better removed at higher gac bvs in contrast for suspect otps expected to be formed from micropollutants higher removal was observed at higher pac doses and in fresher gac different reaction mechanisms i e sorption vs biodegradation influence otp removal in gac filters emphasizing the need for more research on the performance of biological activated carbon filters
