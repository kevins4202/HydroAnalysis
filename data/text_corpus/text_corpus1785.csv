8925,the prevalence of water intensive cropping systems in tandem with the use of traditional irrigation methods such as flood irrigation have resulted in alarming water scarcity levels in many countries like india enhancing irrigation and nutrient use efficiency in agriculture using drip irrigation systems is accentuated to address the rising water scarcity and fertilizer crisis input use efficiencies may be further improved by optimizing nutrient doses and irrigation schedules in the present study crop and water productivities of wheat moongbean maize cropping system were evaluated for surface drip irrigation sdi and subsurface drip irrigation ssdi systems when irrigated at 0 6 and 0 8 etc crop evapotranspiration and fertigated with 0 60 80 and 100 recommended doses of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizers rdf the results were compared with the conventional local practice of surface flood irrigation and soil application of recommended fertilizers ssdi at 0 8 etc with 100 fertigation of rdf in the wheat moongbean maize cropping system increased average system productivity by 5 4 irrigation water productivity by 118 and total water productivity by 45 compared to surface flood irrigation and soil application of fertilizers the total amount of irrigation water applied through sdi or ssdi at 0 8 etc 336 274 mm was 44 0 and 58 5 lower compared to surface flood 600 660 mm in 2019 20 and 2020 21 seasons respectively fertigation using sdi or ssdi also reduced fertilizer requirements for this cropping system by 20 to obtain an equivalent yield to the conventional system fertigation of 60 80 and 100 rdf resulted in significant yield gain of 36 55 and 67 in wheat 25 31 and 34 in moongbean and 33 49 and 62 in maize as compared to fertilizer control 0 rdf respectively on average grain yields obtained with irrigation scheduling at 0 8 etc were circa 10 higher than that at 0 6 etc keywords crop water requirement precision irrigation multiple cropping sustainable agriculture water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction optimum water and nutrient supply are pre requisite for improving crop productivity especially in water scarce regions affected by nutrient deficiencies in india unpredictable monsoon coupled with increasing demand for food production induces an imperative need for irrigation options with higher use efficiency singh 2009 the most common irrigation method in india is surface flood irrigation despite its poor water use efficiency and transport of pesticides and nutrients to water sources liang et al 2016 alternatively drip irrigation minimizes water and nutrient loss thus improves use efficiency of water and nutrient and finally the crop quality and yield wang et al 2013a 2013b chen et al 2015 kaur and brar 2016 compared to 50 60 water use efficiency wue in surface irrigation drip has 90 wue that reduces water consumption by 30 70 karamanos et al 2007 previous study indicated that crop yields recorded with irrigation scheduling at 1 0 etc through surface flood irrigation method can be achieved by irrigating at 0 75 0 80 etc through drip irrigation el meseery 2003 sub surface drip irrigation ssdi further lead to precise use of inputs due to application of water directly to the active root zone of the plants compared to surface drip irrigation sdi ayars et al 1999 wang et al 2022 unlike sdi ssdi system has longer lifespan leads to less weed infestation in crops and easy land preparation and other tillage operations in drip fertigation placing of fertilizer in active root zone reduces nutrient leaching or volatilization in case of nitrogen losses and improves fertilizer use efficiency singandhupe et al 2003 the use efficiency of n p and k in drip fertigation has been found to be 90 45 and 80 compared to 30 50 20 and 50 in case of soil application vjekoslav et al 2011 raina et al 2013 improved fertilizer use efficiency implies that similar crop yields can be achieved at reduced dose of added fertilizer better water and nutrient management also reduce potential environmental risks posed due to nutrient losses xu et al 2020 developing fertigation scheduling and exploiting synergistic effects of water and nutrients are significant for achieving the higher crop and water productivity in a drip irrigated cropping system lenka and singh 2011 singh et al 2016 indo gangetic plains of north west india particularly the region dominated by rice based cropping systems is confronted with depleted groundwater and low water productivity nearly 70 of the water resources allocated for agricultural purposes are used for rice production only besides rice crop is culprit for massive residue burning in this region causing environmental pollution and health issues during rice harvesting season considering these sustainability issues researchers and policy makers are advocating alternative maize based cropping systems such as maize wheat summer moongbean having low water requirement and comparable economic returns singh et al 2016 the annual world s production of maize wheat and moongbean is 1050 766 and 5 3 million tonnes respectively and the corresponding india s production is 28 6 106 2 and 2 4 million tonnes economic survey of india 2019 irrigation and nutrient application schedules for maize wheat and moongbean have been developed under conventional system of cultivation i e surface irrigation and soil application of npk fertilizers however precision irrigation practices tailored to this cropping system need to be tested in order to quantify the associated advantages and consequently to promote agricultural productivity farmers profitability and sustainable water use in north west india worldwide drip irrigation has demonstrated a range of benefits but the studies are mostly confined to vegetables horticultural crops and single field crops mohammad 2015 tripathi et al 2016 therefore drip system is a potential option for addressing future water scarcity predicted in north western india owing to declining groundwater resources in this regard policymakers shall advocate alternate schemes to incentivize farmers for adopting water efficient practices and crops rather than providing power subsidies for extracting groundwater the targeted integration of the ssdi system and alternate wheat moongbean maize multiple cropping system can act complementarily from both a policy and technology application perspectives the premise of this study was to optimize the irrigation and fertigation schedules for higher crop yields water productivity and water saving in wheat moongbean maize cropping system and compare the performance with conventional local practice of surface irrigation and soil application of recommended dose fertilizers 2 materials and methods 2 1 location soil and climate the study was carried out for two years 2019 20 and 2020 21 at research farm icar

irrigation schedules and methods of irrigation all combinations of sdi ssdi schedules with fertigation rates of 80 and 100 rdf resulted statistically similar growth and yield attributes of wheat to that observed under conventional practice plant height cob length and grain lines per cob of maize showed a significant increase of 11 19 and 8 respectively with fertigation dose of 100 rdf as compared to non fertigated fig 5 however maize fertigated with 80 rdf had statistically similar growth and yield attributes to the 100 rdf irrigation schedules and methods of irrigation did not significantly influence plant height and cob length of maize ssdi resulted in higher number of grain lines per cob as compared to sdi as observed in wheat 100 seed weight of maize and 1000 seed weight of moongbean was not significantly influenced by different fertigation doses irrigation schedules and methods of irrigation figs 5 and 6 the data also revealed that sdi or ssdi at 0 8 etc with 80 or 100 fertigation of rdf resulted in significantly similar plant height cob length grain lines per cob and 100 grain weight of maize as compared to conventional system i e flood irrigated and soil application of 100 rdf the interactions between different treatment combinations for all the growth and yield attributes of crops were found to be insignificant 3 3 crop yields with variable fertigation doses irrigation methods and irrigation schedules wheat grain varied from 3 36 to 5 96 mg ha 1 in 2019 20 and 2 78 6 00 mg ha 1 in 2020 21 table 4 reflecting the positive effects of fertigation on growth and yield parameters a significant increase in wheat grain yield was noticed which was 29 52 and 58 during first year and 43 52 and 76 during second year with the application of 60 80 and 100 rdf respectively than fertilizer control no npk increase in fertigation doses from 60 to 100 also improved wheat grain yields by about 23 however application of 80 and 100 recommended doses of npk resulted statistically equal grain yield during both the years methods of irrigation did not influence the grain yield similarly the crop irrigated at 0 6 and 0 8 etc had statistically equal grain yield during 2019 20 however irrigation at 0 8 etc resulted about 23 higher grain yield than 0 6 etc during 2020 21 the interactions between methods of irrigation irrigation schedules and fertigation doses for grain yield of wheat were found to be insignificant however the combination of irrigation at 0 8 etc and fertigation with 80 rdf resulted in significantly similar grain yield compared to conventional system during both the years highest grain yield was obtained when the crop was irrigated at 0 8 etc with ssdi and fertilized with 100 rdf during 2020 21 moongbean fertigated with 60 rdf resulted 16 35 higher grain yield compared to no fertigation table 5 fertigation of 80 rdf produced statistically similar grain yield of moongbean to 100 rdf during both years methods of irrigation did not significantly influence grain yield during both years while different irrigation schedules did not influence grain yield during 2020 21 only grain yield of moongbean was about 15 higher when irrigated at 0 8 etc compared to 0 6 etc during 2019 20 the interactions between methods of irrigation irrigation schedules and fertigation doses for grain yield were found to be insignificant however ssdi at 0 8 etc with either 60 or 80 or 100 fertigation of rdf resulted in significantly similar grain yield compared to conventional system during both the years grain yield of maize varied from 4 0 to 7 3 mg ha 1 and 4 2 7 6 mg ha 1 respectively during 2019 20 and 2020 21 table 6 fertigation of 60 80 and 100 rdf increased the grain yield of maize by 28 53 and 61 during first year and 38 56 and 64 during second year respectively as compared to 0 rdf fertigation of 80 rdf produced statistically similar grain yield to 100 rdf during both years different methods of irrigation and irrigation schedules did not significantly influence the grain yield during both years similarly the interactions between methods of irrigation irrigation schedules and fertigation doses for grain yield were found to be non significant the combinations of irrigation at 0 8 etc and fertigation with 80 or 100 rdf through sdi or ssdi resulted in significantly similar grain yield compared to conventional system during both the years highest grain yield was obtained when the maize was irrigated at 0 8 etc with ssdi and fertilized with 100 rdf during 2020 21 3 4 system

year table 7 wheat equivalent yield obtained with fertigation of 60 80 and 100 rdf was 26 47 and 53 higher during 2019 20 and 38 55 and 64 higher during 2020 21 respectively as compared to the control application of 80 and 100 recommended doses of npk fertilizers resulted statistically similar grain yield during both the years similarly both methods of drip irrigation resulted in statistically equal system productivity however irrigation schedules significantly influenced the system productivity and it was 9 5 10 higher when crops were irrigated at 0 8 etc as compared to 0 6 etc interactions between methods of irrigation irrigation schedules and fertigation doses were found to be insignificant for system productivity the minimum system productivity of the cropping system 8 4 9 1 mg ha 1 was obtained from the combination of a lower water application schedule i e 0 6 etc with no application of nutrients i e 0 rdf during both years increasing the frequency of irrigation from 0 6 to 0 8 etc at lower fertigation doses 0 and 60 rdf did not significantly enhance the system productivity regardless of the method of drip irrigation in contrast increasing the frequency of irrigation from 0 6 to 0 8 etc along with an increase in fertigation doses 80 and 100 rdf resulted in a significant improvement in system productivity of the cropping system however irrigating crops at 0 8 etc with 80 fertigation of rdf resulted in statistically similar system productivity 14 2 15 4 mg ha 1 to the 0 8 etc with 100 fertigation of rdf 15 2 15 9 mg ha 1 regardless of the method of drip irrigation clearly appropriate reduction of fertilization did not significantly reduce the system productivity but low irrigation and fertilization rates significantly reduced the system productivity besides irrigating crops at 0 8 etc with 80 or 100 fertigation of rdf through sdi or ssdi resulted in significantly similar system productivity 14 2 15 9 mg ha 1 as to conventional system of surface irrigation and 100 rdf 14 3 15 2 mg ha 1 during both the years even though conventional system of crop production recorded statistically equal system productivity to that obtained under sdi or ssdi at 0 6 etc in combination with fertigation of 100 rdf during both years 3 5 irrigation and total water productivity of wheat moongbean and maize different fertigation doses and irrigation schedules significantly influenced the irrigation water productivity iwp of wheat moongbean and maize during both years fig 7 iwp of wheat moongbean and maize varied from 4 38 to 9 29 0 46 0 85 and 3

and 58 76 respectively as compared to fertilizer control increase in fertigation dose from 0 to 100 rdf increased the iwp of moongbean and maize by 25 45 and 62 65 respectively however the magnitude of increase was smaller during first year iwp of all the crops were significantly higher when irrigated at 0 6 etc as compared to 0 8 etc irrespective of method of irrigation decrease in irrigation frequency from 0 8 etc to 0 6 etc improved iwp of wheat moongbean and maize from 5 94 to 7 87 0 55 0 77 and 5 05 6 53 kg m 3 respectively during 2019 20 similarly scheduling irrigation at 0 6 etc increased iwp of wheat moongbean and maize by 12 68 and 51 respectively as compared to 0 8 etc during 2020 21 both the methods of drip irrigation i e sdi and ssdi had statistically similar iwp of all the crops during both the years the interactive effects of irrigation scheduling methods of irrigation and fertigation doses on iwp were also non significant overall ssdi at 0 8 etc with 80 fertigation of rdf resulted in 2 1 3 0 1 5 2 0 and 1 9 3 2 folds higher iwp of wheat moongbean and maize respectively as compared to the corresponding iwp of these crops with conventional practice of flood irrigation and soil application of fertilizers different fertigation doses significantly influenced the total water productivity twp of wheat moongbean and maize during both years fig 8 twp of wheat increased from 1 31 to 1 71 kg m 3 at control to 1 68 2 45 1 98 2 82 and 2 06 3 02 kg m 3 respectively with 60 80 and 100 recommended doses of npk the differences in twp of wheat obtained with

80 and 100 rdf increased the twp of moongbean by 17 38 23 42 and 27 46 respectively as compared to control no npk similarly compared to fertilizer control fertigation of 60 80 and 100 rdf significantly increased twp of maize by 28 39 53 56 and 61 64 respectively methods of irrigation did not significantly influence the twp of wheat moongbean and maize during both years likewise irrigation schedules had no significant effect on twp of wheat and maize twp of moongbean was about 12 14 when irrigated at 0 6 etc than 0 8 etc twp of the drip fertigated wheat receiving 80 recommended doses of npk and irrigation at 0 8 etc was 30 31 higher during first year and 117 138 during second year as compared to the conventional practice similarly ssdi at 0 8 etc with 80 rdf increased the twp of moongbean and maize by 28 50 and 23 30 respectively 3 6 irrigation and total water productivity of cropping system irrigation water productivity of the wheat moongbean maize cropping system varied from 3 03 to 6 20 and 3 40 8 21 kg m 3 respectively during 2019 20 and 2020 21 when crops were irrigated through drip systems table 7 iwp of cropping system increased from 3 52 kg m 3 in fertilizer control to 4 44 5 15 and 5 35 kg m 3 with the application of 60 80 and 100 recommended dose of npk respectively during first year similar trend was observed during second year fertigation of 80 and 100 rdf resulted statistically similar iwp of cropping system during 2019 20 however fertigation of 100 rdf recorded statistically higher iwp as compared to 80 rdf during 2020 21 on an average crops irrigated at 0 8 etc had 35 40 lower iwp than 0 6 etc irrigation water applied either through surface drip or subsurface drip did not influence the iwp of the cropping system crops when irrigated at 0 8 etc and fertigated with 80 rdf resulted in 1 7 2 5 folds higher iwp of cropping system than the conventional practice surface irrigation and soil application of npk fertilizers total water productivity twp of the cropping system varied from 1 38 to 1 92 and 1 08 1 92 kg m 3 respectively during 2019 20 and 2020 21 table 7 compared to fertilizer control application of 60 80

system similarly crops irrigated at 0 8 and 0 6 etc had similar twp during both the years the interactive effect of methods of irrigation irrigation schedules and fertigation doses were found to be non significant for both iwp and twp of the cropping system highest twp was obtained when the crops were irrigated at 0 6 etc and fertigated with 100 recommended dose of npk irrespective of the method of irrigation crops when irrigated at 0 8 etc with 80 or 100 rdf recorded 26 32 and 49 58 higher twp of cropping system respectively during 2019 20 and 2020 21 than the conventional practice 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation water applied the yield response and water saving estimations are essential for optimizing the fertigation doses and irrigation regimes in a drip irrigated wheat moongbean maize cropping system a large variation in the amounts of irrigation water applied in first and second year of study was observed for example 122 mm of irrigation water was applied to maize at 0 8 etc during 2019 20 while it was only 42 mm during 2020 21 higher rainfall was the reason for the lower total water applied during second year as compared to the first year the effective rainfall er amount during maize season was 219 mm during 2019 20 and 324 mm during 2020 21 similar variations were recorded in wheat and moongbean crop irrigated through drip system or surface flood irrigation effective rainfall amount was 201 and 85 mm during wheat and moongbean season respectively in the first year while er amount reversed to 66 and 148 mm in the second year earlier studies show that drip irrigation systems have high water use efficiency with minimum water losses as compared to surface irrigation karamanos et al 2007 in our study the total amount of irrigation water applied through sdi or ssdi at 0 8 etc 336 274 mm was 44 0 and 58 5 lower compared to surface flood 600 660 mm in 2019 20 and 2020 21 seasons respectively net saving of 40 22 and 23 of total water was recorded in wheat moongbean maize respectively when these crops were irrigated through drip system at 0 8 etc as compared to conventional system using surface irrigation previous studies also reported 20 35 water saving in drip irrigated wheat liao et al 2008 wang et al 2010 2011 2013a 2013b chen et al 2015 rao et al 2016 and 25 55 in drip irrigated maize lamm and trooien 2003 compared to conventional local practice similarly jat et al 2019 reported a saving of 84 of irrigation water in subsurface drip irrigated maize wheat crop rotation in comparison to surface irrigation the crops received small quantity of water at frequent intervals 2 3 days interval through sdi and ssdi subjected to weather conditions whereas much larger quantity of water was applied at longer intervals in surface flood irrigation in these crops this large quantity of irrigation water exceeded the soil profile storage capacity and thus contributed to percolation losses in contrast sufficient water was delivered in the active root zone with less wetted area through sdi and ssdi to keep pace with plant extraction rates 4 2 yield and yield attributes the experimental soil was highly deficient in nitrogen but in sufficiency range of available phosphorus and medium range in potassium therefore beneficial effects of npk fertigation on yield attributes and crop yields were expected the hypothesis was proved by the pooled data which showed significant improvement in yield attributes of wheat plant height spike length and number of effective tillers and maize plant height cob length and grain lines per cob with npk fertigation doses as compared to fertilizer control figs 4 and 5 as a reflection of improved plant growth and yield parameters added fertigation doses caused a significant increase of 29 58 15 24 28 61 and 26 53 in grain yields of wheat moongbean maize and system productivity respectively during first year and 43 76 35 44 38 64 and 38 64 during second year compared to fertilizer control tables 4 to 7 comparatively lesser improvement in the yield of moongbean beyond 60 rdf can be ascribed to the leguminous nature of the crop which fixes atmospheric nitrogen and has low nitrogen requirement along with high contents of available phosphorus and dominance of potassium rich illitic clay minerals in the soil adequate supply of n through fertigation with precise timing and uniform distribution might have stimulated the increased activity of meristematic cells and cell division enzymes involved in various metabolic process promoted cell elongation and protein chlorophyll formation thus improving plant height number of tillers etc and ultimately greater crop yields compared to control mukherjee 2008 better performance of crop could also be due to higher photosynthetic efficiency effective absorption and utilization of available nutrients and better proliferation of roots resulting in quick canopy development sivanappan 2004 malve et al 2017 the higher number of effective tillers and grains per ear in drip irrigated wheat as compared to the surface irrigated were also found by rao et al 2016 consistent with the results of our study significant improvement in crop yield and plant attributes of wheat moongbean and maize with fertigation were also reported by the previous researchers behera and ghosh 2009 khairul mazed et al 2016 li et al 2021 crops fertigated with either 80 or 100 rdf had similar yield attributes and grain yield when irrigated at 0 8 etc during both the years which were also statistically similar to the conventional system surface irrigation and soil application of 100 rdf indicating a potential saving of 20 of the recommended dose of npk fertilizer saving in fertilizer amount was found to be 64 16 and 28 kg n p2o5 and k2o ha 1 respectively in one cropping year it could mainly be due to regular supply of required amount of nutrients in multiple splits directly in the root zone in coordination with crop demand owing to reduced nutrient losses and higher nutrient use efficiency the crop nutrient requirement would have been satisfied even at 20 lower rdf yolcu and cetin 2015 sandhu et al 2019 consistent nutrient availability and better translocation of assimilates have been reported by previous workers when major nutrients were supplied through drip fertigation as compared to their soil application anitta and muthukrishnan 2011 qin et al 2016 patra et al 2021 crops irrigation at 0 8 etc resulted 10 higher system productivity as compared to 0 6 etc which might be due to the improved plant metabolism at favourable soil water regime malve et al 2017 the higher system productivity when crops irrigated at 80 etc resulted from extra quantity of irrigation water applied to the root zone which directly coincided with the water requirement of crops and avoided moisture stress however irrigation scheduling had no effect on wheat yields during 2019 20 because of the rains received regularly at critical growth stages such as crown root initiation tillering late jointing and flowering however rainfall was quite low during 2020 21 and consequently wheat irrigated at 0 8 etc produced 23 higher grain yield than 0 6 etc similarly the effective rainfall amount during moongbean season of 2019 20 was just half of that received during 2020 21 therefore significantly beneficial effect of frequent irrigation 0 8 etc on grain yield of moongbean was observed during first year only during maize season nearly 73 of the crop water requirement was met through rainfall in both the years and thereby no effects of irrigation scheduling were observed in our study similar grain yields of wheat moongbean and maize in sdi and ssdi were might be due to the weather parameters based irrigation scheduling resulting in application of equal amount of irrigation water through both the methods of irrigation and supplementary rainfall events the annual cost of a ssdi system is significantly lower than a sdi system due to lower installation cost and longer lifespan ssdi systems can be used for 10 15 years while sdi systems have a lifespan of 6 8 years ssdi systems do not require removal of laterals and inlines during crop harvesting and sowing and they are protected from rodents and sunlight additionally the use of a tractor operated machine to install ssdi systems further reduces cost brar et al 2022 the study found that the lowest system productivity in terms of wheat equivalent yield of the cropping system was achieved with the combination of a lower irrigation schedule i e 0 6 etc with no application of nutrients i e 0 rdf during both years table 7 increasing irrigation and fertilizer amounts led to higher system productivity as crops were able to make better use of light energy resources for photosynthesis when reasonable irrigation and nutrients are ensured in the root zone yan et al 2021 also reported that timely and accurate supply of water and nutrients to root zone caused maximization of the coupling effect of water and fertilizer to achieve high crop yield and improve water productivity the average system productivity at 0 8 etc with 80 rdf and 0 8 etc with 100 rdf was higher by 61 69 and 72 75 respectively compared to 0 6 etc with 0 rdf however irrigating crops at 0 8 etc with 80 rdf resulted in statistically similar system productivity to the 0 8 etc with 100 rdf regardless of the method of drip irrigation this study showed that reducing irrigation had negative effects on crop yields while appropriate fertilization reduction had non significant effects on grain yield as reported elsewhere zou et al 2020 4 3 irrigation and total water productivity the per cent improvement in the irrigation water productivity and increase in grain yield over control were directly correlated with increase in fertigation doses this was due to the equal amount of irrigation water applied irrespective of irrigation schedules methods of irrigation and nutrient doses increase in iwp owned to the successive increase in crop yield the twp of wheat moongbean and maize also responded positively with the graded levels of fertigation total amount of water applied also affected the twp of different crops wheat yield levels were almost the same during both the years but amount of water used was 30 37 lower during second year which resulted in relatively higher twp during the study period the iwp values of wheat moongbean and maize irrigated at 0 6 etc were 12 32 41 68 and 29 51 higher in comparison to the iwp recorded at 0 8 etc respectively higher iwp values were mainly due to proportionately lower yield reduction 9 23 in wheat 6 14 in moongbean and 3 7 in maize than the reduction in the amount of irrigation water applied 38 45 in wheat 60 80 in moongbean and 39 55 in maize at 0 6 etc compared to 0 8 etc our findings are in alignment with yang et al 2020 who also reported less soil water extraction with increasing etc responsible for the lower water use efficiency of drip irrigated wheat at 0 8 etc than at 0 6 etc contrary to iwp twp of wheat and maize irrigated at 0 8 and 0 6 etc were similar in both the years mainly due to the reduced amount of total water irrigation water effective rainfall at 0 6 etc while proportionately smaller reduction in crop yield during second year similar yield was obtained but higher amount of total water owing to rainfall resulted in 14 higher twp of moongbean irrigated at 0 6 etc than 0 8 etc mussaddak and somi 2001 and ramamurthy et al 2009 also reported that cotton irrigated at 0 6 etc had higher water use efficiency than 0 8 and 1 0 etc in the present study statistically equal grain yields were obtained with sdi or ssdi at 0 8 etc and 80 or 100 rdf to that of conventional practice however quantity of irrigation water reduced in drip irrigated systems because of precise application in the vicinity of active roots and negligible deep percolation losses as compared to surface flood irrigation liu and diamond 2005 zhou et al 2018 jha et al 2019 si et al 2020 li et al 2021 lu et al 2021 for that reason higher iwp and twp were recorded with drip fertigated system compared to conventional cultivation method conversely sdi ssdi at 0 6 etc had significantly higher iwp and twp of cropping system than all other combinations and conventional system but this irrigation schedule resulted lower system productivity thus could not be recommended consistent with the present study better plant growth higher yield twp and water use efficiency under fertigation compared to conventional surface irrigation were also reported from previous studies sandhu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 si et al 2020 cheng et al 2022 moreover avoiding irrigation events before precipitation based upon weather forecast might have also assisted in saving of irrigation water resulting in higher iwp and twp in case of drip irrigation 5 conclusions wheat moongbean maize cropping system responded positively to increasing npk fertigation doses and irrigation frequency irrigating crops at 0 8 etc enhanced grain yield of wheat and moongbean yields but there was no effect on grain yield of maize because major part of crop water requirement was met through rainfall the results showed that the crops irrigated at 0 8 etc and fertigated with 80 of recommended dose of npk regardless of method of drip irrigation had a saving of 20 npk and 52 irrigation water reflecting higher crop and water productivity in reference to the conventional system of cultivation with no yield penalty both the methods of drip irrigation resulted in similar system productivity and irrigation water productivity however considering the differential installation cost and life span annual cost of ssdi was considerably lower than sdi the extant study has generated science based evidence that the ssdi technique leads to substantial irrigation water savings as compared to conventional surface irrigation practice as demonstrated in wheat moongbean maize cropping system table 8 summarises the research findings ssdi at 0 8 etc with 80 fertigation of rdf in the wheat moongbean maize cropping system increases partial factor productivity by 28 agronomic efficiency by 34 and net returns by 7 as compared to the conventional practice of surface irrigation and soil application of recommended fertilizers besides ssdi at 0 8 etc with 100 fertigation of rdf increased system productivity by 5 4 irrigation water productivity by 120 and net returns by 13 compared to conventional surface irrigation and soil application of fertilizers however a higher fertigation dose of 100 rdf resulted in lower partial factor productivity and agronomic efficiency of the cropping system as compared to fertigation dose of 80 rdf conclusively wheat moongbean maize cropping system with optimized ssdi and fertigation may be put forth as an appropriate cropping system for north west india facing dual problem of poor soil fertility and declining water table our study jointly analyzed precision irrigation and multiple cropping systems and provided evidence that could inform policy planners with regard to the potential water saving technologies in agriculture encasing large scale impact incentivizing growers for minimising irrigation water use will be more proactive and futuristic towards sustainable development goals although the soil type of our research farm represents the major soil type of the north western regions it is obligatory to standardize the sub surface drip system in different soil types and agro climatic conditions before widespread advocation to the growers the effects of varying fertilizer doses and irrigation schedules also need to be studied in relation to the lateral and downward movement of water and nutrients in the soil we would like to further optimise irrigation and fertigation schedules for the wheat moongbean maize cropping system for higher productivity water and nutrient saving and extend our research to other multiple cropping systems comprehensive results from long term assessment of the drip systems on farmers fields will lead to new challenges and opportunities to refine this technology

8925,the prevalence of water intensive cropping systems in tandem with the use of traditional irrigation methods such as flood irrigation have resulted in alarming water scarcity levels in many countries like india enhancing irrigation and nutrient use efficiency in agriculture using drip irrigation systems is accentuated to address the rising water scarcity and fertilizer crisis input use efficiencies may be further improved by optimizing nutrient doses and irrigation schedules in the present study crop and water productivities of wheat moongbean maize cropping system were evaluated for surface drip irrigation sdi and subsurface drip irrigation ssdi systems when irrigated at 0 6 and 0 8 etc crop evapotranspiration and fertigated with 0 60 80 and 100 recommended doses of nitrogen n phosphorus p and potassium k fertilizers rdf the results were compared with the conventional local practice of surface flood irrigation and soil application of recommended fertilizers ssdi at 0 8 etc with 100 fertigation of rdf in the wheat moongbean maize cropping system increased average system productivity by 5 4 irrigation water productivity by 118 and total water productivity by 45 compared to surface flood irrigation and soil application of fertilizers the total amount of irrigation water applied through sdi or ssdi at 0 8 etc 336 274 mm was 44 0 and 58 5 lower compared to surface flood 600 660 mm in 2019 20 and 2020 21 seasons respectively fertigation using sdi or ssdi also reduced fertilizer requirements for this cropping system by 20 to obtain an equivalent yield to the conventional system fertigation of 60 80 and 100 rdf resulted in significant yield gain of 36 55 and 67 in wheat 25 31 and 34 in moongbean and 33 49 and 62 in maize as compared to fertilizer control 0 rdf respectively on average grain yields obtained with irrigation scheduling at 0 8 etc were circa 10 higher than that at 0 6 etc keywords crop water requirement precision irrigation multiple cropping sustainable agriculture water productivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction optimum water and nutrient supply are pre requisite for improving crop productivity especially in water scarce regions affected by nutrient deficiencies in india unpredictable monsoon coupled with increasing demand for food production induces an imperative need for irrigation options with higher use efficiency singh 2009 the most common irrigation method in india is surface flood irrigation despite its poor water use efficiency and transport of pesticides and nutrients to water sources liang et al 2016 alternatively drip irrigation minimizes water and nutrient loss thus improves use efficiency of water and nutrient and finally the crop quality and yield wang et al 2013a 2013b chen et al 2015 kaur and brar 2016 compared to 50 60 water use efficiency wue in surface irrigation drip has 90 wue that reduces water consumption by 30 70 karamanos et al 2007 previous study indicated that crop yields recorded with irrigation scheduling at 1 0 etc through surface flood irrigation method can be achieved by irrigating at 0 75 0 80 etc through drip irrigation el meseery 2003 sub surface drip irrigation ssdi further lead to precise use of inputs due to application of water directly to the active root zone of the plants compared to surface drip irrigation sdi ayars et al 1999 wang et al 2022 unlike sdi ssdi system has longer lifespan leads to less weed infestation in crops and easy land preparation and other tillage operations in drip fertigation placing of fertilizer in active root zone reduces nutrient leaching or volatilization in case of nitrogen losses and improves fertilizer use efficiency singandhupe et al 2003 the use efficiency of n p and k in drip fertigation has been found to be 90 45 and 80 compared to 30 50 20 and 50 in case of soil application vjekoslav et al 2011 raina et al 2013 improved fertilizer use efficiency implies that similar crop yields can be achieved at reduced dose of added fertilizer better water and nutrient management also reduce potential environmental risks posed due to nutrient losses xu et al 2020 developing fertigation scheduling and exploiting synergistic effects of water and nutrients are significant for achieving the higher crop and water productivity in a drip irrigated cropping system lenka and singh 2011 singh et al 2016 indo gangetic plains of north west india particularly the region dominated by rice based cropping systems is confronted with depleted groundwater and low water productivity nearly 70 of the water resources allocated for agricultural purposes are used for rice production only besides rice crop is culprit for massive residue burning in this region causing environmental pollution and health issues during rice harvesting season considering these sustainability issues researchers and policy makers are advocating alternative maize based cropping systems such as maize wheat summer moongbean having low water requirement and comparable economic returns singh et al 2016 the annual world s production of maize wheat and moongbean is 1050 766 and 5 3 million tonnes respectively and the corresponding india s production is 28 6 106 2 and 2 4 million tonnes economic survey of india 2019 irrigation and nutrient application schedules for maize wheat and moongbean have been developed under conventional system of cultivation i e surface irrigation and soil application of npk fertilizers however precision irrigation practices tailored to this cropping system need to be tested in order to quantify the associated advantages and consequently to promote agricultural productivity farmers profitability and sustainable water use in north west india worldwide drip irrigation has demonstrated a range of benefits but the studies are mostly confined to vegetables horticultural crops and single field crops mohammad 2015 tripathi et al 2016 therefore drip system is a potential option for addressing future water scarcity predicted in north western india owing to declining groundwater resources in this regard policymakers shall advocate alternate schemes to incentivize farmers for adopting water efficient practices and crops rather than providing power subsidies for extracting groundwater the targeted integration of the ssdi system and alternate wheat moongbean maize multiple cropping system can act complementarily from both a policy and technology application perspectives the premise of this study was to optimize the irrigation and fertigation schedules for higher crop yields water productivity and water saving in wheat moongbean maize cropping system and compare the performance with conventional local practice of surface irrigation and soil application of recommended dose fertilizers 2 materials and methods 2 1 location soil and climate the study was carried out for two years 2019 20 and 2020 21 at research farm icar

irrigation scheduling while single factor anova to compare all the seventeen experimental treatments inclusive of conventional system 3 results 3 1 irrigation water applied the amount of irrigation water applied through surface flooding ranged from 180 to 360 mm 180 180 mm and 120 240 mm in wheat moongbean and maize respectively whereas the corresponding values of irrigation water applied through sdi ssdi ranged from 58 to 133 mm 55 130 mm and 27 122 mm in both years table 3 the amount of irrigation water reduced by 26 49 and 34 mm during first year and 37 44 and 15 mm during second year respectively when wheat moongbean and maize crop were irrigated at 0 6 etc than at 0 8 etc the total amount of irrigation water applied to the wheat moongbean maize cropping system through sdi ssdi at 0 8 etc 336 274 mm was 44 0 and 58 4 lower as compared to surface flood 600 660 mm in 2019 20 and 2020 21 seasons respectively the effective rainfall received in wheat moongbean and maize growing seasons was 201 85 and 219 mm respectively during first year and 66 148 and 371 mm during the second year the total amount of water for wheat moongbean maize cropping system was 732 763 and 841 859 mm at 0 6 etc and 0 8 etc respectively which was 33 8 38 7 and 23 9 31 0 less as compared to surface flood irrigation 1105 1245 mm over two years 3 2 growth and yield attributes the data revealed that plant height number of effective tillers per meter row length and spike length at harvest of wheat varied from 65 3 to 105 3 cm 75 116 and 68 118 mm respectively fig 4 wheat fertigated with 60 rdf registered 34 higher plant height 37 larger spike length and 30 more number of effective tillers as compared to wheat without fertigation i e 0 rdf further increase in the fertigation dose from 60 to 100 rdf improved the number of effective tillers by 14 1 and spike length of wheat by 12 6 however the wheat fertigated with 80 rdf had statistically similar growth and yield attributes to the 100 rdf all the growth and yield parameters except the number of effective tillers were not significantly influenced by different irrigation schedules and methods of irrigation irrigation scheduling at 0 8 etc resulted in significantly higher 6 8 number of effective tillers as compared to 0 6 etc in contrast thousand grain weight of wheat was not affected by different fertigation doses irrigation schedules and methods of irrigation all combinations of sdi ssdi schedules with fertigation rates of 80 and 100 rdf resulted statistically similar growth and yield attributes of wheat to that observed under conventional practice plant height cob length and grain lines per cob of maize showed a significant increase of 11 19 and 8 respectively with fertigation dose of 100 rdf as compared to non fertigated fig 5 however maize fertigated with 80 rdf had statistically similar growth and yield attributes to the 100 rdf irrigation schedules and methods of irrigation did not significantly influence plant height and cob length of maize ssdi resulted in higher number of grain lines per cob as compared to sdi as observed in wheat 100 seed weight of maize and 1000 seed weight of moongbean was not significantly influenced by different fertigation doses irrigation schedules and methods of irrigation figs 5 and 6 the data also revealed that sdi or ssdi at 0 8 etc with 80 or 100 fertigation of rdf resulted in significantly similar plant height cob length grain lines per cob and 100 grain weight of maize as compared to conventional system i e flood irrigated and soil application of 100 rdf the interactions between different treatment combinations for all the growth and yield attributes of crops were found to be insignificant 3 3 crop yields with variable fertigation doses irrigation methods and irrigation schedules wheat grain varied from 3 36 to 5 96 mg ha 1 in 2019 20 and 2 78 6 00 mg ha 1 in 2020 21 table 4 reflecting the positive effects of fertigation on growth and yield parameters a significant increase in wheat grain yield was noticed which was 29 52 and 58 during first year and 43 52 and 76 during second year with the application of 60 80 and 100 rdf respectively than fertilizer control no npk increase in fertigation doses from 60 to 100 also improved wheat grain yields by about 23 however application of 80 and 100 recommended doses of npk resulted statistically equal grain yield during both the years methods of irrigation did not influence the grain yield similarly the crop irrigated at 0 6 and 0 8 etc had statistically equal grain yield during 2019 20 however irrigation at 0 8 etc resulted about 23 higher grain yield than 0 6 etc during 2020 21 the interactions between methods of irrigation irrigation schedules and fertigation doses for grain yield of wheat were found to be insignificant however the combination of irrigation at 0 8 etc and fertigation with 80 rdf resulted in significantly similar grain yield compared to conventional system during both the years highest grain yield was obtained when the crop was irrigated at 0 8 etc with ssdi and fertilized with 100 rdf during 2020 21 moongbean fertigated with 60 rdf resulted 16 35 higher grain yield compared to no fertigation table 5 fertigation of 80 rdf produced statistically similar grain yield of moongbean to 100 rdf during both years methods of irrigation did not significantly influence grain yield during both years while different irrigation schedules did not influence grain yield during 2020 21 only grain yield of moongbean was about 15 higher when irrigated at 0 8 etc compared to 0 6 etc during 2019 20 the interactions between methods of irrigation irrigation schedules and fertigation doses for grain yield were found to be insignificant however ssdi at 0 8 etc with either 60 or 80 or 100 fertigation of rdf resulted in significantly similar grain yield compared to conventional system during both the years grain yield of maize varied from 4 0 to 7 3 mg ha 1 and 4 2 7 6 mg ha 1 respectively during 2019 20 and 2020 21 table 6 fertigation of 60 80 and 100 rdf increased the grain yield of maize by 28 53 and 61 during first year and 38 56 and 64 during second year respectively as compared to 0 rdf fertigation of 80 rdf produced statistically similar grain yield to 100 rdf during both years different methods of irrigation and irrigation schedules did not significantly influence the grain yield during both years similarly the interactions between methods of irrigation irrigation schedules and fertigation doses for grain yield were found to be non significant the combinations of irrigation at 0 8 etc and fertigation with 80 or 100 rdf through sdi or ssdi resulted in significantly similar grain yield compared to conventional system during both the years highest grain yield was obtained when the maize was irrigated at 0 8 etc with ssdi and fertilized with 100 rdf during 2020 21 3 4 system productivity the system productivity in terms of wheat equivalent yield of wheat moongbean maize cropping system varied from 9 1 to 15 4 mg ha 1 during first year and 8 4 15 9 mg ha 1 during second year table 7 wheat equivalent yield obtained with fertigation of 60 80 and 100 rdf was 26 47 and 53 higher during 2019 20 and 38 55 and 64 higher during 2020 21 respectively as compared to the control application of 80 and 100 recommended doses of npk fertilizers resulted statistically similar grain yield during both the years similarly both methods of drip irrigation resulted in statistically equal system productivity however irrigation schedules significantly influenced the system productivity and it was 9 5 10 higher when crops were irrigated at 0 8 etc as compared to 0 6 etc interactions between methods of irrigation irrigation schedules and fertigation doses were found to be insignificant for system productivity the minimum system productivity of the cropping system 8 4 9 1 mg ha 1 was obtained from the combination of a lower water application schedule i e 0 6 etc with no application of nutrients i e 0 rdf during both years increasing the frequency of irrigation from 0 6 to 0 8 etc at lower fertigation doses 0 and 60 rdf did not significantly enhance the system productivity regardless of the method of drip irrigation in contrast increasing the frequency of irrigation from 0 6 to 0 8 etc along with an increase in fertigation doses 80 and 100 rdf resulted in a significant improvement in system productivity of the cropping system however irrigating crops at 0 8 etc with 80 fertigation of rdf resulted in statistically similar system productivity 14 2 15 4 mg ha 1 to the 0 8 etc with 100 fertigation of rdf 15 2 15 9 mg ha 1 regardless of the method of drip irrigation clearly appropriate reduction of fertilization did not significantly reduce the system productivity but low irrigation and fertilization rates significantly reduced the system productivity besides irrigating crops at 0 8 etc with 80 or 100 fertigation of rdf through sdi or ssdi resulted in significantly similar system productivity 14 2 15 9 mg ha 1 as to conventional system of surface irrigation and 100 rdf 14 3 15 2 mg ha 1 during both the years even though conventional system of crop production recorded statistically equal system productivity to that obtained under sdi or ssdi at 0 6 etc in combination with fertigation of 100 rdf during both years 3 5 irrigation and total water productivity of wheat moongbean and maize different fertigation doses and irrigation schedules significantly influenced the irrigation water productivity iwp of wheat moongbean and maize during both years fig 7 iwp of wheat moongbean and maize varied from 4 38 to 9 29 0 46 0 85 and 3

and 58 76 respectively as compared to fertilizer control increase in fertigation dose from 0 to 100 rdf increased the iwp of moongbean and maize by 25 45 and 62 65 respectively however the magnitude of increase was smaller during first year iwp of all the crops were significantly higher when irrigated at 0 6 etc as compared to 0 8 etc irrespective of method of irrigation decrease in irrigation frequency from 0 8 etc to 0 6 etc improved iwp of wheat moongbean and maize from 5 94 to 7 87 0 55 0 77 and 5 05 6 53 kg m 3 respectively during 2019 20 similarly scheduling irrigation at 0 6 etc increased iwp of wheat moongbean and maize by 12 68 and 51 respectively as compared to 0 8 etc during 2020 21 both the methods of drip irrigation i e sdi and ssdi had statistically similar iwp of all the crops during both the years the interactive effects of irrigation scheduling methods of irrigation and fertigation doses on iwp were also non significant overall ssdi at 0 8 etc with 80 fertigation of rdf resulted in 2 1 3 0 1 5 2 0 and 1 9 3 2 folds higher iwp of wheat moongbean and maize respectively as compared to the corresponding iwp of these crops with conventional practice of flood irrigation and soil application of fertilizers different fertigation doses significantly influenced the total water productivity twp of wheat moongbean and maize during both years fig 8 twp of wheat increased from 1 31 to 1 71 kg m 3 at control to 1 68 2 45 1 98 2 82 and 2 06 3 02 kg m 3 respectively with 60 80 and 100 recommended doses of npk the differences in twp of wheat obtained with the fertigation of 80 or 100 rdf were non significant during both the years twp of moongbean varied from 0 28 to 0 41 and 0 22 0 39 kg m 3 respectively during 2019 20 and 2020 21 fertigation with 60 80 and 100 rdf increased the twp of moongbean by 17 38 23 42 and 27 46 respectively as compared to control no npk similarly compared to fertilizer control fertigation of 60 80 and 100 rdf significantly increased twp of maize by 28 39 53 56 and 61 64 respectively methods of irrigation did not significantly influence the twp of wheat moongbean and maize during both years likewise irrigation schedules had no significant effect on twp of wheat and maize twp of moongbean was about 12 14 when irrigated at 0 6 etc than 0 8 etc twp of the drip fertigated wheat receiving 80 recommended doses of npk and irrigation at 0 8 etc was 30 31 higher during first year and 117 138 during second year as compared to the conventional practice similarly ssdi at 0 8 etc with 80 rdf increased the twp of moongbean and maize by 28 50 and 23 30 respectively 3 6 irrigation and total water productivity of cropping system irrigation water productivity of the wheat moongbean maize cropping system varied from 3 03 to 6 20 and 3 40 8 21 kg m 3 respectively during 2019 20 and 2020 21 when crops were irrigated through drip systems table 7 iwp of cropping system increased from 3 52 kg m 3 in fertilizer control to 4 44 5 15 and 5 35 kg m 3 with the application of 60 80 and 100 recommended dose of npk respectively during first year similar trend was observed during second year fertigation of 80 and 100 rdf resulted statistically similar iwp of cropping system during 2019 20 however fertigation of 100 rdf recorded statistically higher iwp as compared to 80 rdf during 2020 21 on an average crops irrigated at 0 8 etc had 35 40 lower iwp than 0 6 etc irrigation water applied either through surface drip or subsurface drip did not influence the iwp of the cropping system crops when irrigated at 0 8 etc and fertigated with 80 rdf resulted in 1 7 2 5 folds higher iwp of cropping system than the conventional practice surface irrigation and soil application of npk fertilizers total water productivity twp of the cropping system varied from 1 38 to 1 92 and 1 08 1 92 kg m 3 respectively during 2019 20 and 2020 21 table 7 compared to fertilizer control application of 60 80 and 100 recommended doses of npk significantly increased the system twp by 25 39 45 55 and 52 62 respectively different methods of drip irrigation did not significantly influence the twp of cropping system similarly crops irrigated at 0 8 and 0 6 etc had similar twp during both the years the interactive effect of methods of irrigation irrigation schedules and fertigation doses were found to be non significant for both iwp and twp of the cropping system highest twp was obtained when the crops were irrigated at 0 6 etc and fertigated with 100 recommended dose of npk irrespective of the method of irrigation crops when irrigated at 0 8 etc with 80 or 100 rdf recorded 26 32 and 49 58 higher twp of cropping system respectively during 2019 20 and 2020 21 than the conventional practice 4 discussion 4 1 irrigation water applied the yield response and water saving estimations are essential for optimizing the fertigation doses and irrigation regimes in a drip irrigated wheat moongbean maize cropping system a large variation in the amounts of irrigation water applied in first and second year of study was observed for example 122 mm of irrigation water was applied to maize at 0 8 etc during 2019 20 while it was only 42 mm during 2020 21 higher rainfall was the reason for the lower total water applied during second year as compared to the first year the effective rainfall er amount during maize season was 219 mm during 2019 20 and 324 mm during 2020 21 similar variations were recorded in wheat and moongbean crop irrigated through drip system or surface flood irrigation effective rainfall amount was 201 and 85 mm during wheat and moongbean season respectively in the first year while er amount reversed to 66 and 148 mm in the second year earlier studies show that drip irrigation systems have high water use efficiency with minimum water losses as compared to surface irrigation karamanos et al 2007 in our study the total amount of irrigation water applied through sdi or ssdi at 0 8 etc 336 274 mm was 44 0 and 58 5 lower compared to surface flood 600 660 mm in 2019 20 and 2020 21 seasons respectively net saving of 40 22 and 23 of total water was recorded in wheat moongbean maize respectively when these crops were irrigated through drip system at 0 8 etc as compared to conventional system using surface irrigation previous studies also reported 20 35 water saving in drip irrigated wheat liao et al 2008 wang et al 2010 2011 2013a 2013b chen et al 2015 rao et al 2016 and 25 55 in drip irrigated maize lamm and trooien 2003 compared to conventional local practice similarly jat et al 2019 reported a saving of 84 of irrigation water in subsurface drip irrigated maize wheat crop rotation in comparison to surface irrigation the crops received small quantity of water at frequent intervals 2 3 days interval through sdi and ssdi subjected to weather conditions whereas much larger quantity of water was applied at longer intervals in surface flood irrigation in these crops this large quantity of irrigation water exceeded the soil profile storage capacity and thus contributed to percolation losses in contrast sufficient water was delivered in the active root zone with less wetted area through sdi and ssdi to keep pace with plant extraction rates 4 2 yield and yield attributes the experimental soil was highly deficient in nitrogen but in sufficiency range of available phosphorus and medium range in potassium therefore beneficial effects of npk fertigation on yield attributes and crop yields were expected the hypothesis was proved by the pooled data which showed significant improvement in yield attributes of wheat plant height spike length and number of effective tillers and maize plant height cob length and grain lines per cob with npk fertigation doses as compared to fertilizer control figs 4 and 5 as a reflection of improved plant growth and yield parameters added fertigation doses caused a significant increase of 29 58 15 24 28 61 and 26 53 in grain yields of wheat moongbean maize and system productivity respectively during first year and 43 76 35 44 38 64 and 38 64 during second year compared to fertilizer control tables 4 to 7 comparatively lesser improvement in the yield of moongbean beyond 60 rdf can be ascribed to the leguminous nature of the crop which fixes atmospheric nitrogen and has low nitrogen requirement along with high contents of available phosphorus and dominance of potassium rich illitic clay minerals in the soil adequate supply of n through fertigation with precise timing and uniform distribution might have stimulated the increased activity of meristematic cells and cell division enzymes involved in various metabolic process promoted cell elongation and protein chlorophyll formation thus improving plant height number of tillers etc and ultimately greater crop yields compared to control mukherjee 2008 better performance of crop could also be due to higher photosynthetic efficiency effective absorption and utilization of available nutrients and better proliferation of roots resulting in quick canopy development sivanappan 2004 malve et al 2017 the higher number of effective tillers and grains per ear in drip irrigated wheat as compared to the surface irrigated were also found by rao et al 2016 consistent with the results of our study significant improvement in crop yield and plant attributes of wheat moongbean and maize with fertigation were also reported by the previous researchers behera and ghosh 2009 khairul mazed et al 2016 li et al 2021 crops fertigated with either 80 or 100 rdf had similar yield attributes and grain yield when irrigated at 0 8 etc during both the years which were also statistically similar to the conventional system surface irrigation and soil application of 100 rdf indicating a potential saving of 20 of the recommended dose of npk fertilizer saving in fertilizer amount was found to be 64 16 and 28 kg n p2o5 and k2o ha 1 respectively in one cropping year it could mainly be due to regular supply of required amount of nutrients in multiple splits directly in the root zone in coordination with crop demand owing to reduced nutrient losses and higher nutrient use efficiency the crop nutrient requirement would have been satisfied even at 20 lower rdf yolcu and cetin 2015 sandhu et al 2019 consistent nutrient availability and better translocation of assimilates have been reported by previous workers when major nutrients were supplied through drip fertigation as compared to their soil application anitta and muthukrishnan 2011 qin et al 2016 patra et al 2021 crops irrigation at 0 8 etc resulted 10 higher system productivity as compared to 0 6 etc which might be due to the improved plant metabolism at favourable soil water regime malve et al 2017 the higher system productivity when crops irrigated at 80 etc resulted from extra quantity of irrigation water applied to the root zone which directly coincided with the water requirement of crops and avoided moisture stress however irrigation scheduling had no effect on wheat yields during 2019 20 because of the rains received regularly at critical growth stages such as crown root initiation tillering late jointing and flowering however rainfall was quite low during 2020 21 and consequently wheat irrigated at 0 8 etc produced 23 higher grain yield than 0 6 etc similarly the effective rainfall amount during moongbean season of 2019 20 was just half of that received during 2020 21 therefore significantly beneficial effect of frequent irrigation 0 8 etc on grain yield of moongbean was observed during first year only during maize season nearly 73 of the crop water requirement was met through rainfall in both the years and thereby no effects of irrigation scheduling were observed in our study similar grain yields of wheat moongbean and maize in sdi and ssdi were might be due to the weather parameters based irrigation scheduling resulting in application of equal amount of irrigation water through both the methods of irrigation and supplementary rainfall events the annual cost of a ssdi system is significantly lower than a sdi system due to lower installation cost and longer lifespan ssdi systems can be used for 10 15 years while sdi systems have a lifespan of 6 8 years ssdi systems do not require removal of laterals and inlines during crop harvesting and sowing and they are protected from rodents and sunlight additionally the use of a tractor operated machine to install ssdi systems further reduces cost brar et al 2022 the study found that the lowest system productivity in terms of wheat equivalent yield of the cropping system was achieved with the combination of a lower irrigation schedule i e 0 6 etc with no application of nutrients i e 0 rdf during both years table 7 increasing irrigation and fertilizer amounts led to higher system productivity as crops were able to make better use of light energy resources for photosynthesis when reasonable irrigation and nutrients are ensured in the root zone yan et al 2021 also reported that timely and accurate supply of water and nutrients to root zone caused maximization of the coupling effect of water and fertilizer to achieve high crop yield and improve water productivity the average system productivity at 0 8 etc with 80 rdf and 0 8 etc with 100 rdf was higher by 61 69 and 72 75 respectively compared to 0 6 etc with 0 rdf however irrigating crops at 0 8 etc with 80 rdf resulted in statistically similar system productivity to the 0 8 etc with 100 rdf regardless of the method of drip irrigation this study showed that reducing irrigation had negative effects on crop yields while appropriate fertilization reduction had non significant effects on grain yield as reported elsewhere zou et al 2020 4 3 irrigation and total water productivity the per cent improvement in the irrigation water productivity and increase in grain yield over control were directly correlated with increase in fertigation doses this was due to the equal amount of irrigation water applied irrespective of irrigation schedules methods of irrigation and nutrient doses increase in iwp owned to the successive increase in crop yield the twp of wheat moongbean and maize also responded positively with the graded levels of fertigation total amount of water applied also affected the twp of different crops wheat yield levels were almost the same during both the years but amount of water used was 30 37 lower during second year which resulted in relatively higher twp during the study period the iwp values of wheat moongbean and maize irrigated at 0 6 etc were 12 32 41 68 and 29 51 higher in comparison to the iwp recorded at 0 8 etc respectively higher iwp values were mainly due to proportionately lower yield reduction 9 23 in wheat 6 14 in moongbean and 3 7 in maize than the reduction in the amount of irrigation water applied 38 45 in wheat 60 80 in moongbean and 39 55 in maize at 0 6 etc compared to 0 8 etc our findings are in alignment with yang et al 2020 who also reported less soil water extraction with increasing etc responsible for the lower water use efficiency of drip irrigated wheat at 0 8 etc than at 0 6 etc contrary to iwp twp of wheat and maize irrigated at 0 8 and 0 6 etc were similar in both the years mainly due to the reduced amount of total water irrigation water effective rainfall at 0 6 etc while proportionately smaller reduction in crop yield during second year similar yield was obtained but higher amount of total water owing to rainfall resulted in 14 higher twp of moongbean irrigated at 0 6 etc than 0 8 etc mussaddak and somi 2001 and ramamurthy et al 2009 also reported that cotton irrigated at 0 6 etc had higher water use efficiency than 0 8 and 1 0 etc in the present study statistically equal grain yields were obtained with sdi or ssdi at 0 8 etc and 80 or 100 rdf to that of conventional practice however quantity of irrigation water reduced in drip irrigated systems because of precise application in the vicinity of active roots and negligible deep percolation losses as compared to surface flood irrigation liu and diamond 2005 zhou et al 2018 jha et al 2019 si et al 2020 li et al 2021 lu et al 2021 for that reason higher iwp and twp were recorded with drip fertigated system compared to conventional cultivation method conversely sdi ssdi at 0 6 etc had significantly higher iwp and twp of cropping system than all other combinations and conventional system but this irrigation schedule resulted lower system productivity thus could not be recommended consistent with the present study better plant growth higher yield twp and water use efficiency under fertigation compared to conventional surface irrigation were also reported from previous studies sandhu et al 2019 wang et al 2019 si et al 2020 cheng et al 2022 moreover avoiding irrigation events before precipitation based upon weather forecast might have also assisted in saving of irrigation water resulting in higher iwp and twp in case of drip irrigation 5 conclusions wheat moongbean maize cropping system responded positively to increasing npk fertigation doses and irrigation frequency irrigating crops at 0 8 etc enhanced grain yield of wheat and moongbean yields but there was no effect on grain yield of maize because major part of crop water requirement was met through rainfall the results showed that the crops irrigated at 0 8 etc and fertigated with 80 of recommended dose of npk regardless of method of drip irrigation had a saving of 20 npk and 52 irrigation water reflecting higher crop and water productivity in reference to the conventional system of cultivation with no yield penalty both the methods of drip irrigation resulted in similar system productivity and irrigation water productivity however considering the differential installation cost and life span annual cost of ssdi was considerably lower than sdi the extant study has generated science based evidence that the ssdi technique leads to substantial irrigation water savings as compared to conventional surface irrigation practice as demonstrated in wheat moongbean maize cropping system table 8 summarises the research findings ssdi at 0 8 etc with 80 fertigation of rdf in the wheat moongbean maize cropping system increases partial factor productivity by 28 agronomic efficiency by 34 and net returns by 7 as compared to the conventional practice of surface irrigation and soil application of recommended fertilizers besides ssdi at 0 8 etc with 100 fertigation of rdf increased system productivity by 5 4 irrigation water productivity by 120 and net returns by 13 compared to conventional surface irrigation and soil application of fertilizers however a higher fertigation dose of 100 rdf resulted in lower partial factor productivity and agronomic efficiency of the cropping system as compared to fertigation dose of 80 rdf conclusively wheat moongbean maize cropping system with optimized ssdi and fertigation may be put forth as an appropriate cropping system for north west india facing dual problem of poor soil fertility and declining water table our study jointly analyzed precision irrigation and multiple cropping systems and provided evidence that could inform policy planners with regard to the potential water saving technologies in agriculture encasing large scale impact incentivizing growers for minimising irrigation water use will be more proactive and futuristic towards sustainable development goals although the soil type of our research farm represents the major soil type of the north western regions it is obligatory to standardize the sub surface drip system in different soil types and agro climatic conditions before widespread advocation to the growers the effects of varying fertilizer doses and irrigation schedules also need to be studied in relation to the lateral and downward movement of water and nutrients in the soil we would like to further optimise irrigation and fertigation schedules for the wheat moongbean maize cropping system for higher productivity water and nutrient saving and extend our research to other multiple cropping systems comprehensive results from long term assessment of the drip systems on farmers fields will lead to new challenges and opportunities to refine this technology

8926,drought events and water use conflicts drive the need for more efficient water management in rice growing areas of the brazilian cerrado recent studies have shown the advantages of adopting water saving irrigation in the region but a comprehensive assessment is needed this study aims to model the performance of rice cultivation and water productivity in the tropical floodplains of the cerrado biome of northern brazil in response to irrigation management under contrasting seasonal rainfall levels twenty seven scenarios of rice cultivation resulting from the combination of three sites three irrigation treatments and three rainfall regimes were simulated with the calibrated and validated hydrological model swap wofost the rainfall levels high 1501 mm intermediate 952 mm and low 510 mm were relative to 120 days and obtained from weather stations located in the region two irrigation methods flooding and water saving irrigation were compared against rainfed cultivation actual transpiration of the flooding and water saving irrigation was 9 and 4 higher in the intermediate and high rainfall scenarios while it was 30 and 20 higher in the low rainfall scenario compared to the rainfed treatment the largest deep percolation loss was 12700 mm per season for flood irrigation in the low rainfall scenario whereas the lowest one was 349 mm for the rainfed treatment in the low rainfall scenario changing from flooding to water saving irrigation increases water productivity by an average of 9 and decreases relative grain yield by 5 12 water productivity based on bottom flux increased on average by about five times high rainfall scenario to ten times low rainfall scenario when comparing flooding with water saving irrigation results suggest that saving irrigation based on crop transpiration can reduce deep percolation losses and increase water productivity in the rice growing areas of the brazilian cerrado keywords rice irrigation water productivity swap model cerrado data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice is one of the most produced commodities in brazil over 10 mt in 2021 22 with 92 of the production coming from lowland irrigated agrosystems conab 2022 the country s largest rice cultivation area is located in the subtropical lowlands in south brazil which account for 83 of the national annual production farmers in south brazil employ the traditional method of continuously flooding fields throughout the crop season which is also the most practiced strategy worldwide e g california valley perry et al 2022 mekong delta tong 2017 indo gangetic plain choudhury and singh 2016 rice is the staple food in south america and due to the increasing demand for its consumption rice cultivation in brazil has expanded to new agricultural areas since the early 2000s fig 1 many growers employ the management practices such as continuous flooding suited to the traditional regions in these new areas without having proof of whether they are the best option whereas continuous flooding may often lead to productivity losses or overusing of natural resources water ponding occurs on top of the soil surface when rainfall or irrigation intensity exceeds soil infiltration capacity water management and use in flood irrigation are highly sensitive to soil hydraulics and internal drainage characteristics lowland cerrado soils do not present the typical dense and impermeable layer below the root zone that restricts water percolation in traditional rice growing regions bouldin 1986 but may contain plinthite and a textural gradient that reduces water infiltration rate and helps to keep the soil water content near saturation embrapa 2008 depending on the soil attributes and the agricultural practices employed by the farmer flood irrigation in the tropical floodplains of the cerrado biome can demand a large amount of water up to 35 mm d 1 of water is needed to maintain the ponding layer in the flooding condition in tropical lowland soils embrapa 2008 which is substantially higher than the requirements for subtropical soils from 6 to 15 mm d 1 sosbai 2018 the rainfall regime affects the quantity of water needed for continuous flood irrigation during the wet season the water table level can be close to the soil surface in lowland cerrado soils and its presence affects soil drainage if the water table level is close to the soil surface the drainage is poor benefiting the formation of a ponding layer over the soil surface therefore the suitability of using flood irrigation in the lowland areas of the brazilian cerrado needs a better evaluation focusing on the recommendation of sustainable irrigation management irrigation strategies like shallow wet irrigation controlled irrigation zhuang et al 2019 intermittent flooding alternating wetting and drying carracelas et al 2019 yamaguchi et al 2019 and irrigation based on soil water content or matric potential singh et al 2021 kadiyala et al 2015 kukal et al 2005 are some of the alternatives to continuous flooding that can save water in lowland rice production wang et al 2020 concluded that for rice paddies in china alternating wetting and drying irrigation slightly benefited yield and reduced the amount of water needed zhuang et al 2019 indicated that using controlled irrigation in which surface water is maintained only in the turning green and the early tillering stages had the highest average water saving rate and the highest average pollutant reduction rate in paddy fields in china borja reis et al 2018a 2018b experimentally evaluated irrigation methods for rice cultivation in lowland areas of the cerrado they concluded the rainfed aerobic rice systems had equivalent or better crop performance and water productivity than other irrigation regimes however borja reis et al 2018a 2018b did not consider different soils and climate scenarios few studies on rice irrigation have been carried out in the brazilian tropical floodplains and therefore more investigations are needed to assess the rice performance response to the irrigation regime field experiments can help analyze irrigation management concerning soil characteristics and rainfall regimes but they are expensive and labor intensive process based simulation models such as swap kroes et al 2017 daisy hansen et al 1990 and hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 are recommended to evaluate scenarios in which it is necessary to obtain data in the short term and at a relatively low cost the swap model has been used in several agricultural research projects gelsinari et al 2021 bonfante et al 2020 ismail et al 2020 pinheiro et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 kroes et al 2019 taufik et al 2018 and has shown its effectiveness in describing soil water dynamics and applicability to case studies of crop performance in brazil melo and de jong van lier 2021 turek et al 2020 pinheiro et al 2016 durigon et al 2012 the swap model contains the detailed crop growth routine wofost de wit et al 2019 developed to simulate potential yields and water limited yields and applied for over two decades as part of crop yield forecasting operating systems we hypothesize that conservative or water saving irrigation methods could be employed to improve rice cultivation in the tropical floodplains of the brazilian cerrado area by significantly reducing the use of water with little or no yield penalties compared with traditional irrigation management flood irrigation in this context we carried out model simulations to evaluate the performance of rice cultivation in these areas in response to flooding and water saving irrigation treatments our objective was to assess soils with distinct hydraulic properties and cultivated with rice crops regarding water use and crop productivity under various rainfall and irrigation amounts 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental data experiments were carried out in the municipality of lagoa da confusão state of tocantins

swap hydrological model kroes et al 2017 is a richards equation based model that simulates water solutes and heat transport in the soil vadose zone swap transport processes are predominantly vertical one dimensional and the model simulations are at the field scale the vertical domain of the model ranges from just above the canopy to the shallow groundwater the richards equation in one dimension added by the sink terms s is implemented in swap to calculate the water movement in the soil matrix van dam and feddes 2000 as follows 1 c h h t z k h h z 1 s h where c is the differential water capacity θ z cm 1 θ cm3 cm 3 is the volumetric soil water content t d is time and s cm3 cm 3 d 1 is the water extraction rate by plant roots swap uses the richards equation for describing water flux in the unsaturated and saturated zones of the soil and solves eq 1 numerically using the relations between θ h and k with the mualem van genuchten functions θ h and k h mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 2 2 2 plant module in this study the detailed crop model available in swap was used to simulate crop growth performance in irrigated rice fields the detailed crop module is an adaptation of the world food studies wofost model boogaard et al 2014 and simulates absolute productivity the prediction of potential production is determined by solar radiation air temperature co2 concentration in the atmosphere crop characteristics and planting date it requires plant biometrics co2 assimilation dry matter partitioning data and other crop information swap wofost simulates the reduction of potential crop productivity due to water salinity and nutrient deficit kroes et al 2017 the transpiration reduction function of feddes et al 1978 rules the reduction in crop productivity due to water stress nutrient deficiencies and salinity were not considered limiting factors to crop performance 2 2 3 soil evaporation soil evaporation e cm d 1 is predicted in swap using the penman monteith equation

december 1 and december 20 2014 the second data set refers to θ measurements with two replicates between january 20 and april 7 2016 the first dataset corresponds to irrigation methods employed in the studies of borja reis et al 2018a 2018b only the interval of rainfed rice cultivation the first 25 days of cultivation approximately was considered for model calibration in the 2014 2015 season because swap requires daily irrigation quantities for simulations such data were not available in the studies of borja reis et al 2018a 2018b the second dataset consists of continuous measurements of θ in two different plots of rainfed rice cultivation in the 2015 2016 season and was used to validate the model a few crop parameters were selected to be fitted manually in the calibration step of the crop module of swap wofost the calibrated parameters were the temperature sum required to complete the vegetative stage t sumea the temperature sum needed to complete the reproductive stage t sumam and the light use efficiency ε data of leaf area index lai aboveground biomass agb and soil water content θ measured experimentally at site 1 with no irrigation during the 2014 2015 season were used to assess the effectiveness of the model to simulate lai agb and θ in the calibration step the simulated values were compared with experimentally obtained values during the season 2015 2016 in the validation procedure of the model stochastic simulations with swap were performed to obtain the confidence interval in which the experimental values of θ should be situated and to determine the quality of the simulations the means standard deviations and the correlation matrix of the soil hydraulic parameters obtained from the fit of the experimental θ h pairs to the van genuchten model generated a dataset of ten thousand 10 000 realizations of θ s α and n for each soil type and soil layer stochastic realizations of the van genuchten parameters were obtained using the cholesky decomposition technique pinheiro and de jong van lier 2021 considering the correlation matrix between soil hydraulic parameters each generated realization of the parameters θ s α and n was used in swap to simulate a complete rice cultivation season as a result 10 000 simulated values of θ were obtained for each day of the rice season the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles were selected from these θ values and an interval of θ data was created representing the most probable results of θ for the two simulated scenarios seasons 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles limits for the simulated θ validated the model simulations 2 5 statistical analysis the root mean square error rmse eq 5 the index of agreement d eq 6 and the nash sutcliff model efficiency nse eq 7 were used for quantifying the quality of the model calibration and validation 5 rmse t 1 n p o 2 n 6 d 1 t 1 n p o 2 t 1 n p o o o 7 nse 1 t 1 n p o 2 t 1 n o o 2 where n is the number of values used for the calculations p is the soil water content θ predicted by swap o is the θ measured experimentally and ō is the average of the measured θ values the 50th percentile of the stochastic simulation was used for calculating the rmse d and nse the rmse is the standard deviation of the residuals and measures how spread out these deviations are rmse has the same unit of measurement of the variable from which the residuals are calculated the index d measures the agreement of the model simulations to the experimental values the dimensionless d has a minimum value of 0 indicating no concordance and a maximum of 1 indicating a perfect agreement nse is also dimensionless and it can assume values between and 1 nse equal to 1 means the model perfectly fits the experimental values and an nse lower than 0 means that the average of the experimental observations is a better prediction than the model prediction groenendijk et al 2014 2 6 simulation scenarios twenty seven scenarios of rice cultivation resulting from the combination of three soil types table 1 three irrigation treatments and three rainfall regimes were evaluated with the calibrated and validated swap wofost model the simulated treatments were

capacity h 100 cm every time the relative transpiration falls below 95 3 flood irrigation daily irrigation maintains a water layer of 6 cm over the soil surface during the cropping season simulating the flooding conditions of the field experiment rainfall regimes were obtained from weather stations located in the state of tocantins brazil each rainfall amount was relative to periods of 120 days from november to april between 2006 and 2020 the rainfall amounts selected for the simulations were 1501 mm 952 mm and 510 mm and correspond to high maximum intermediate median and low minimum rainfall scenarios respectively 2 7 relative grain yield relative grain yield y r is the ratio between the simulated actual grain yield y a and potential grain yield y p the simulated rice y a is affected by water availability from rainfall and irrigation and water scarcity in its term y p is only affected by the radiation fluxes above the canopy air temperature and crop partitioning factors responsible for dry matter partitioning and growth respiration kroes et al 2017 2 8 water productivity water productivity wp kg m 3 in general terms is the rate of dry matter produced per unit volume of water used grain yield can be used instead of dry matter production the amount of water used can be replaced by crop transpiration the sum of evaporation and crop transpiration or even the sum of

evaporation and by deep percolation respectively 3 results and discussion 3 1 model calibration and validation fig 4 shows the results of soil water content θ obtained experimentally and simulated by swap for two intervals of rainfed rice cultivation at site 1 the peaks in θ correspond to the rainfall events some of which reached more than 100 mm in one day the θ peaks are more frequent in the 2015 2016 season fig 4b whereas the θ observed remains relatively constant in the 2014 2015 season fig 4 a due to the constancy of the average θ obtained experimentally in the 2014 2015 season fig 4 a the average of observed θ was a better predictor than the model during this interval nse 0 nonetheless most of the observed θ is within the p5 and p90 limits percentiles 5 and 90 respectively in contrast rmse and d indexes for the 2015 2016 season showed satisfactory model performance during this simulated period the statistical indexes rmse d and nse of the 2015 2016 season confirm the agreement of θ simulations with experimental data fig 5 a and fig 5 c show the results of leaf area index lai and aboveground biomass agb simulated with swap after calibration of plant parameters fig 5b and fig 5d show the results of the same variables after model validation lai and agb simulations show that swap simulations effectively predicted the plant performance in both cycles rice grain yield simulated with swap wofost was 9030 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 7135 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 grain yield amounts obtained experimentally were 10576 kg ha 1 and 8531 kg ha 1 respectively for seasons 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the differences between simulated and observed grain yield may be because swap does not include any effect of suboptimal soil fertility which may have had some effect on rice growth 3 2 simulation scenarios 3 2 1 water balance the water balance components for all irrigation treatments and soil combinations are shown in fig 6 in the water saving treatments the highest irrigation amount was 754 mm for site 3 in the low rainfall scenario and the lowest one was 46 mm for site 2 during the high rainfall scenario the highest irrigation amount applied in flooding was 12754 mm 106 mm d 1 for site 2 in the low rainfall scenario and the lowest one was 8247 mm 69 mm d 1 for site 3 in the high rainfall scenario the smallest water amount used in flood irrigation was 10 times higher than the largest amount used in water saving irrigation treatments the highest deep percolation loss per season q within the water saving irrigation treatments was 2063 mm site 3 in the high rainfall scenario within the flood irrigation treatments the highest q was 12675 mm site 2 in the low rainfall scenario the lowest q was 349 mm for the rainfed treatment at site 2 in the low rainfall scenario which is very close to q for site 1 with no irrigation and low rainfall conditions fig 6 the q values obtained in this study were larger than those measured experimentally in traditional rice fields lahue and linquist 2021 obtained percolation rates for californian rice fields from 0 04 to 69 5 mm per season and an average of 1306 mm total water input rainfall irrigation castañeda et al 2002 measured a percolation of 128 mm in rice fields cultivated in the philippines during the dry season and 68 mm during the wet season being the total water input of 1370 and 1325 mm respectively as no experimental data on the groundwater level gwl were available the lower boundary condition used in swap was free drainage i e the bottom water flux was considered equal to the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of the lowest soil compartment section 2 using this boundary condition the gwl is simulated and modulated by rainfall infiltration rate and the hydraulic conductivity of the bottom compartment in our simulations the gwl stayed below the rooting depth around 1 m for most of the simulated period coming close to the soil surface only for a few days after high intensity rain events the detachment of the gwl from the vadose zone or even the soil surface may be the reason for the high values of q obtained in flood irrigation treatments additionally swap simulated only vertical soil water fluxes a relatively small lateral seepage may have occurred in flooded rice fields lahue and linquist 2019 but this study does not consider lateral flow the average increases in t a during the intermediate and high rainfall scenarios were 9 and 4 when comparing the results for actual transpiration t a of the flood and water saving irrigation treatments with the rainfed treatment fig 6 when the flood irrigation was applied in the low rainfall scenario t a increased by 30 on average compared with t a obtained in the rainfed treatment when water saving irrigation was used in the low rainfall scenario t a increased by 20 compared with the rainfed treatment therefore irrigation is shown to be needed in the low rainfall scenario to maintain crop transpiration and optimize yield at site 3 significant increases in t a were observed comparing the flood irrigation with the rainfed treatment the increase in t a was 57 for the low rainfall scenario and 18 for the high and the intermediate rainfall scenarios the soil water retention curve at site 3 may explain the elevated sensitivity of t a to irrigation this soil has the lowest water storage capacity among the studied soils fig 3 since the soil water availability is even lower in the dry season low rainfall the water available to plants will be more limited than in other soils with greater water storage capacity with a continuous water supply e g under flood irrigation water is available all the time and water storage capacity does not affect the transpiration which will be potential soil evaporation e a increased when the flood irrigation was used compared with the rainfed and the water saving irrigation treatments fig 6 at site 2 e a increased from 95 mm rainfed to 165 mm flood irrigation in the low rainfall scenario the lowest e a increment occurred at site 3 from 110 mm rainfed to 126 mm flood irrigation in the intermediate rainfall scenario e a in flooded rice is expected to be high almost equal to a free water surface at site 3 e a decreased from 125 mm rainfed to 108 mm water saving irrigation in the low rainfall scenario such a decrease in soil evaporation is related to the higher soil cover by crop canopy in water saving irrigation compared to the rainfed treatment 3 2 2 grain yield and water productivity most of the simulated grain yields for the rainfed treatment were significantly lower than the potential grain yield in the low rainfall scenario fig 7 the water saving irrigation treatment did not significantly increase the relative grain yield y r compared with the rainfed treatment in the low rainfall scenario for the three sites the y r of the water saving irrigation in the low rainfall scenario was at most at site 1 3 higher than the grain yield in the rainfed treatment the flood irrigation treatment increased y r from 8 site 2 to 25 site 3 compared with other treatments in the low rainfall scenario fig 7 grain yields simulated for site 1 and site 2 were similar to potential grain yields y r between 94 and 99 with or without irrigation for the intermediate and high rainfall scenarios based on these results irrigation appears to be unnecessary in years with intermediate or high rainfall amounts nevertheless flood irrigation would increase grain yields for at least one of the sites site 3 in years with low rainfall regarding water use efficiency fig 8a shows water productivity considering only transpiration wp t fig 8b presents water productivity based on evapotranspiration wp et and fig 8c shows water productivity based on the sum of evapotranspiration and deep percolation wp etq simulations with low rainfall and rainfed treatment resulted in the highest wp t values from 3 7 to 4 2 kg m 3 fig 8a wp et values from 2 5 to 2 7 kg m 3 fig 8b and wp etq values from 0 8 to 1 3 kg m 3 fig 8 c there was no difference between wp t obtained for the rainfed and the irrigation treatments and there is no apparent tendency in the values of wp t concerning the rainfall amounts fig 8a most wp et values were in the range of 2 0 and 2 5 kg m 3 and only three wp et values were in the range of 2 5 and 3 0 kg m 3 fig 8b which referred to the rainfed and water saving irrigation treatments in the low rainfall scenario water demand from flood irrigation is evidenced in the water productivity indexes calculated as wp et and wp etq these indexes consider soil evaporation and deep percolation q respectively to estimate water productivity besides crop transpiration wp etq values are mainly influenced by q and that is why the lowest values of wp etq were obtained in most of the high rainfall scenarios and for all scenarios with flood irrigation fig 8c wp etq of flood irrigation treatment was 250 lower than the second lowest wp etq which refers to water saving irrigation in the high rainfall scenario at site 3 wp et values agree with those calculated from field experiments in tropical floodplains of the cerrado biome in brazil borja reis et al 2018a 2018b however wp et values obtained in this study were higher than values commonly obtained for irrigated rice which are between 0 4 and 1 6 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 tuong and bouman 2003 dossou yovo and saito 2022 however mainuddin et al 2020 reported average wp et values of 1 60 kg m 1 and 1 78 kg m 3 in two years with the maximum reaching around 3 0 kg m 3 wp etq values obtained in this study are also similar to wp values reported by singh et al 2006 for rice crops in india an ideal irrigation management should result in high crop productivity with optimal water use recommended by a combined assessment of water productivity and grain yield from our results changing from flood irrigation to water saving irrigation or rainfed treatment increases wp et and wp etq while the relative grain yield is little affected as a function of irrigation treatment for two of the three evaluated sites fig 9 flood irrigation treatment resulted in large deep percolation losses which explains why wp etq is significantly affected by changing from flooding to water saving or rainfed treatments rainfed treatment showed that the grain yield is reduced considerably 23 at site 3 when the rainfall amount is low however water saving irrigation increased wp et and wp etq while grain yield was reduced by 13 which is almost half of the y r reduction when changing from flood irrigation to rainfed treatment therefore from a combined assessment of grain yield and water use efficiency water saving irrigation is a promising method for rice cultivation in the lowland region of cerrado brazil 4 conclusion in the tropical floodplains of the brazilian cerrado flood irrigation results in the highest grain yields but the lowest water use efficiency this irrigation method is only recommended when rainfall is very low below 500 mm per season and if maximization of grain yield is preferable over water use efficiency choosing the water saving irrigation method rather than the flood irrigation method increases water productivity by about 10 and penalizes the rice grain yield by 5 13 hence as an alternative to the traditional method of flood irrigation employed in south brazil a more sustainable irrigation method based on crop transpiration is recommended for increasing the water use efficiency of rice

8926,drought events and water use conflicts drive the need for more efficient water management in rice growing areas of the brazilian cerrado recent studies have shown the advantages of adopting water saving irrigation in the region but a comprehensive assessment is needed this study aims to model the performance of rice cultivation and water productivity in the tropical floodplains of the cerrado biome of northern brazil in response to irrigation management under contrasting seasonal rainfall levels twenty seven scenarios of rice cultivation resulting from the combination of three sites three irrigation treatments and three rainfall regimes were simulated with the calibrated and validated hydrological model swap wofost the rainfall levels high 1501 mm intermediate 952 mm and low 510 mm were relative to 120 days and obtained from weather stations located in the region two irrigation methods flooding and water saving irrigation were compared against rainfed cultivation actual transpiration of the flooding and water saving irrigation was 9 and 4 higher in the intermediate and high rainfall scenarios while it was 30 and 20 higher in the low rainfall scenario compared to the rainfed treatment the largest deep percolation loss was 12700 mm per season for flood irrigation in the low rainfall scenario whereas the lowest one was 349 mm for the rainfed treatment in the low rainfall scenario changing from flooding to water saving irrigation increases water productivity by an average of 9 and decreases relative grain yield by 5 12 water productivity based on bottom flux increased on average by about five times high rainfall scenario to ten times low rainfall scenario when comparing flooding with water saving irrigation results suggest that saving irrigation based on crop transpiration can reduce deep percolation losses and increase water productivity in the rice growing areas of the brazilian cerrado keywords rice irrigation water productivity swap model cerrado data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rice is one of the most produced commodities in brazil over 10 mt in 2021 22 with 92 of the production coming from lowland irrigated agrosystems conab 2022 the country s largest rice cultivation area is located in the subtropical lowlands in south brazil which account for 83 of the national annual production farmers in south brazil employ the traditional method of continuously flooding fields throughout the crop season which is also the most practiced strategy worldwide e g california valley perry et al 2022 mekong delta tong 2017 indo gangetic plain choudhury and singh 2016 rice is the staple food in south america and due to the increasing demand for its consumption rice cultivation in brazil has expanded to new agricultural areas since the early 2000s fig 1 many growers employ the management practices such as continuous flooding suited to the traditional regions in these new areas without having proof of whether they are the best option whereas continuous flooding may often lead to productivity losses or overusing of natural resources water ponding occurs on top of the soil surface when rainfall or irrigation intensity exceeds soil infiltration capacity water management and use in flood irrigation are highly sensitive to soil hydraulics and internal drainage characteristics lowland cerrado soils do not present the typical dense and impermeable layer below the root zone that restricts water percolation in traditional rice growing regions bouldin 1986 but may contain plinthite and a textural gradient that reduces water infiltration rate and helps to keep the soil water content near saturation embrapa 2008 depending on the soil attributes and the agricultural practices employed by the farmer flood irrigation in the tropical floodplains of the cerrado biome can demand a large amount of water up to 35 mm d 1 of water is needed to maintain the ponding layer in the flooding condition in tropical lowland soils embrapa 2008 which is substantially higher than the requirements for subtropical soils from 6 to 15 mm d 1 sosbai 2018 the rainfall regime affects the quantity of water needed for continuous flood irrigation during the wet season the water table level can be close to the soil surface in lowland cerrado soils and its presence affects soil drainage if the water table level is close to the soil surface the drainage is poor benefiting the formation of a ponding layer over the soil surface therefore the suitability of using flood irrigation in the lowland areas of the brazilian cerrado needs a better evaluation focusing on the recommendation of sustainable irrigation management irrigation strategies like shallow wet irrigation controlled irrigation zhuang et al 2019 intermittent flooding alternating wetting and drying carracelas et al 2019 yamaguchi et al 2019 and irrigation based on soil water content or matric potential singh et al 2021 kadiyala et al 2015 kukal et al 2005 are some of the alternatives to continuous flooding that can save water in lowland rice production wang et al 2020 concluded that for rice paddies in china alternating wetting and drying irrigation slightly benefited yield and reduced the amount of water needed zhuang et al 2019 indicated that using controlled irrigation in which surface water is maintained only in the turning green and the early tillering stages had the highest average water saving rate and the highest average pollutant reduction rate in paddy fields in china borja reis et al 2018a 2018b experimentally evaluated irrigation methods for rice cultivation in lowland areas of the cerrado they concluded the rainfed aerobic rice systems had equivalent or better crop performance and water productivity than other irrigation regimes however borja reis et al 2018a 2018b did not consider different soils and climate scenarios few studies on rice irrigation have been carried out in the brazilian tropical floodplains and therefore more investigations are needed to assess the rice performance response to the irrigation regime field experiments can help analyze irrigation management concerning soil characteristics and rainfall regimes but they are expensive and labor intensive process based simulation models such as swap kroes et al 2017 daisy hansen et al 1990 and hydrus šimůnek et al 2008 are recommended to evaluate scenarios in which it is necessary to obtain data in the short term and at a relatively low cost the swap model has been used in several agricultural research projects gelsinari et al 2021 bonfante et al 2020 ismail et al 2020 pinheiro et al 2019 yuan et al 2019 kroes et al 2019 taufik et al 2018 and has shown its effectiveness in describing soil water dynamics and applicability to case studies of crop performance in brazil melo and de jong van lier 2021 turek et al 2020 pinheiro et al 2016 durigon et al 2012 the swap model contains the detailed crop growth routine wofost de wit et al 2019 developed to simulate potential yields and water limited yields and applied for over two decades as part of crop yield forecasting operating systems we hypothesize that conservative or water saving irrigation methods could be employed to improve rice cultivation in the tropical floodplains of the brazilian cerrado area by significantly reducing the use of water with little or no yield penalties compared with traditional irrigation management flood irrigation in this context we carried out model simulations to evaluate the performance of rice cultivation in these areas in response to flooding and water saving irrigation treatments our objective was to assess soils with distinct hydraulic properties and cultivated with rice crops regarding water use and crop productivity under various rainfall and irrigation amounts 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental data experiments were carried out in the municipality of lagoa da confusão state of tocantins in northern brazil 10 46 39 80 s 49 55 20 94 w during the years 2014 2015 and 2016 two seasons of rice cultivation were chosen for the experimental measurements 1 season 2014 2015 from november 18

the soil layers 0 10 10 20 20 40 40 90 cm in each of the three sites to determine the soil hydraulic parameters θ s θ r n and α table 1 2 2 the swap hydrological model 2 2 1 water flow and balance the swap hydrological model kroes et al 2017 is a richards equation based model that simulates water solutes and heat transport in the soil vadose zone swap transport processes are predominantly vertical one dimensional and the model simulations are at the field scale the vertical domain of the model ranges from just above the canopy to the shallow groundwater the richards equation in one dimension added by the sink terms s is implemented in swap to calculate the water movement in the soil matrix van dam and feddes 2000 as follows 1 c h h t z k h h z 1 s h where c is the differential water capacity θ z cm 1 θ cm3 cm 3 is the volumetric soil water content t d is time and s cm3 cm 3 d 1 is the water extraction rate by plant roots swap uses the richards equation for describing water flux in the unsaturated and saturated zones of the soil and solves eq 1 numerically using the relations between θ h and k with the mualem van genuchten functions θ h and k h mualem 1976 van genuchten 1980 2 2 2 plant module in this study the detailed crop model available in swap was used to simulate crop growth performance in irrigated rice fields the detailed crop module is an adaptation of the world food studies wofost model boogaard et al 2014 and simulates absolute productivity the prediction of potential production is determined by solar radiation air temperature co2 concentration in the atmosphere crop characteristics and planting date it requires plant biometrics co2 assimilation dry matter partitioning data and other crop information swap wofost simulates the reduction of potential crop productivity due to water salinity and nutrient deficit kroes et al 2017 the transpiration reduction function of feddes et al 1978 rules the reduction in crop productivity due to water stress nutrient deficiencies and salinity were not considered limiting factors to crop performance 2 2 3 soil evaporation soil evaporation e cm d 1 is predicted in swap using the penman monteith equation monteith 1981 for wet soil or in ponded conditions the actual soil evaporation simulated by swap equals the potential soil evaporation e p when the soil gets drier the soil hydraulic conductivity decreases and the evaporation is reduced to the actual evaporation rate e a kroes et al 2017 in swap the maximum evaporation rate sustained by the topsoil e max cm d 1 is calculated according to darcy s law eq 2 2 e m a x k 1 2 h a t m h 1 z 1 z 1 where k 1 2 is the average hydraulic conductivity cm d 1 between the soil surface h atm and the first soil compartment h1 in swap h atm is the soil pressure head cm in equilibrium with the air relative humidity h 1 is the soil water pressure head of the first soil compartment and z 1 is the depth cm at the middle of the first soil compartment h atm is initially equal to 2 75 105 cm in swap and is updated according to the atmospheric and soil water conditions z1 is automatically calculated according to the soil compartments chosen by the model user 2 2 4 bottom boundary condition the free drainage bottom boundary condition was used in this study in this lower boundary condition water is considered to move vertically by gravity alone under a unit hydraulic head h z gradient consequently a bottom flux q bot equal to the saturated hydraulic conductivity of the lowest soil compartment k lc is established 3 h z z z 1 4 q b o t k l c eq 3 indicates that only the gravity potential influences the soil water movement in the bottom of the soil profile i e the hydraulic head h equals z h z 1 eq 4 is the darcy equation for water flux considering water moves only with the gravitational potential 2 3 data input soil water retention curves were obtained by measuring the soil water content after submitting soil samples to pressure heads of 10 20 60 330 1000 3000 and 15 000 cm in porous plate pressure chambers the van genuchten 1980 model was fitted to θ h data pairs for each of the four sampled soil layers using the retc software van genuchten et al 1991 retc generates the means standard deviations and the correlation matrix of the van genuchten parameters θ s θ r α and n table 1 shows the mean values of the van genuchten parameters for the three sites and four analyzed depths fig 3 shows the mean retention curves of the three study sites in which each curve was built with the mean of θ h pairs obtained for the four depths saturated hydraulic conductivity k s table 1 was obtained by neural network analysis rosetta software v 1 1 using soil texture dry bulk density complementary material and water content

experimentally obtained values of field water content θ borja reis et al 2018a 2018b were used to evaluate model performance the first dataset refers to θ values measured with six replicates between december 1 and december 20 2014 the second data set refers to θ measurements with two replicates between january 20 and april 7 2016 the first dataset corresponds to irrigation methods employed in the studies of borja reis et al 2018a 2018b only the interval of rainfed rice cultivation the first 25 days of cultivation approximately was considered for model calibration in the 2014 2015 season because swap requires daily irrigation quantities for simulations such data were not available in the studies of borja reis et al 2018a 2018b the second dataset consists of continuous measurements of θ in two different plots of rainfed rice cultivation in the 2015 2016 season and was used to validate the model a few crop parameters were selected to be fitted manually in the calibration step of the crop module of swap wofost the calibrated parameters were the temperature sum required to complete the vegetative stage t sumea the temperature sum needed to complete the reproductive stage t sumam and the light use efficiency ε data of leaf area index lai aboveground biomass agb and soil water content θ measured experimentally at site 1 with no irrigation during the 2014 2015 season were used to assess the effectiveness of the model to simulate lai agb and θ in the calibration step the simulated values were compared with experimentally obtained values during the season 2015 2016 in the validation procedure of the model stochastic simulations with swap were performed to obtain the confidence interval in which the experimental values of θ should be situated and to determine the quality of the simulations the means standard deviations and the correlation matrix of the soil hydraulic parameters obtained from the fit of the experimental θ h pairs to the van genuchten model generated a dataset of ten thousand 10 000 realizations of θ s α and n for each soil type and soil layer stochastic realizations of the van genuchten parameters were obtained using the cholesky decomposition technique pinheiro and de jong van lier 2021 considering the correlation matrix between soil hydraulic parameters each generated realization of the parameters θ s α and n was used in swap to simulate a complete rice cultivation season as a result 10 000 simulated values of θ were obtained for each day of the rice season the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles were selected from these θ values and an interval of θ data was created representing the most probable results of θ for the two simulated scenarios seasons 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the 5th 50th and 95th percentiles limits for the simulated θ validated the model simulations 2 5 statistical analysis the root mean square error rmse eq 5 the index of agreement d eq 6 and the nash sutcliff model efficiency nse eq 7 were used

of 1 indicating a perfect agreement nse is also dimensionless and it can assume values between and 1 nse equal to 1 means the model perfectly fits the experimental values and an nse lower than 0 means that the average of the experimental observations is a better prediction than the model prediction groenendijk et al 2014 2 6 simulation scenarios twenty seven scenarios of rice cultivation resulting from the combination of three soil types table 1 three irrigation treatments and three rainfall regimes were evaluated with the calibrated and validated swap wofost model the simulated treatments were

capacity h 100 cm every time the relative transpiration falls below 95 3 flood irrigation daily irrigation maintains a water layer of 6 cm over the soil surface during the cropping season simulating the flooding conditions of the field experiment rainfall regimes were obtained from weather stations located in the state of tocantins brazil each rainfall amount was relative to periods of 120 days from november to april between 2006 and 2020 the rainfall amounts selected for the simulations were 1501 mm 952 mm and 510 mm and correspond to high maximum intermediate median and low minimum rainfall scenarios respectively 2 7 relative grain yield relative grain yield y r is the ratio between the simulated actual grain yield y a and potential grain yield y p the simulated rice y a is affected by water availability from rainfall and irrigation and water scarcity in its term y p is only affected by the radiation fluxes above the canopy air temperature and crop partitioning factors responsible for dry matter partitioning and growth respiration kroes et al 2017 2 8 water productivity water productivity wp kg m 3 in general terms is the rate of dry matter produced per unit volume of water used grain yield can be used instead of dry matter production the amount of water used can be replaced by crop transpiration the sum of evaporation and crop transpiration or even the sum of

swap for two intervals of rainfed rice cultivation at site 1 the peaks in θ correspond to the rainfall events some of which reached more than 100 mm in one day the θ peaks are more frequent in the 2015 2016 season fig 4b whereas the θ observed remains relatively constant in the 2014 2015 season fig 4 a due to the constancy of the average θ obtained experimentally in the 2014 2015 season fig 4 a the average of observed θ was a better predictor than the model during this interval nse 0 nonetheless most of the observed θ is within the p5 and p90 limits percentiles 5 and 90 respectively in contrast rmse and d indexes for the 2015 2016 season showed satisfactory model performance during this simulated period the statistical indexes rmse d and nse of the 2015 2016 season confirm the agreement of θ simulations with experimental data fig 5 a and fig 5 c show the results of leaf area index lai and aboveground biomass agb simulated with swap after calibration of plant parameters fig 5b and fig 5d show the results of the same variables after model validation lai and agb simulations show that swap simulations effectively predicted the plant performance in both cycles rice grain yield simulated with swap wofost was 9030 kg ha 1 in 2014 2015 and 7135 kg ha 1 in 2015 2016 grain yield amounts obtained experimentally were 10576 kg ha 1 and 8531 kg ha 1 respectively for seasons 2014 2015 and 2015 2016 the differences between simulated and observed grain yield may be because swap does not include any effect of suboptimal soil fertility which may have had some effect on rice growth 3 2 simulation scenarios 3 2 1 water balance the water balance components for all irrigation treatments and soil combinations are shown in fig 6 in the water saving treatments the highest irrigation amount was 754 mm for site 3 in the low rainfall scenario and the lowest one was 46 mm for site 2 during the high rainfall scenario the highest irrigation amount applied in flooding was 12754 mm 106 mm d 1 for site 2 in the low rainfall scenario and the lowest one was 8247 mm 69 mm d 1 for site 3 in the high rainfall scenario the smallest water amount used in flood irrigation was 10 times higher than the largest amount used in water saving irrigation treatments the highest deep percolation loss per season q within the water saving irrigation treatments was 2063 mm site 3 in the high rainfall scenario within the flood irrigation treatments the highest q was 12675 mm site 2 in the low rainfall scenario the lowest q was 349 mm for the rainfed treatment at site 2 in the low rainfall scenario which is very close to q for site 1 with no irrigation and low rainfall conditions fig 6 the q values obtained in this study were larger than those measured experimentally in traditional rice fields lahue and linquist 2021 obtained percolation rates for californian rice fields from 0 04 to 69 5 mm per season and an average of 1306 mm total water input rainfall irrigation castañeda et al 2002 measured a percolation of 128 mm in rice fields cultivated in the philippines during the dry season and 68 mm during the wet season being the total water input of 1370 and 1325 mm respectively as no experimental data on the groundwater level gwl were available the lower boundary condition used in swap was free drainage i e the bottom water flux was considered equal to the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity of the lowest soil compartment section 2 using this boundary condition the gwl is simulated and modulated by rainfall infiltration rate and the hydraulic conductivity of the bottom compartment in our simulations the gwl stayed below the rooting depth around 1 m for most of the simulated period coming close to the soil surface only for a few days after high intensity rain events the detachment of the gwl from the vadose zone or even the soil surface may be the reason for the high values of q obtained in flood irrigation treatments additionally swap simulated only vertical soil water fluxes a relatively small lateral seepage may have occurred in flooded rice fields lahue and linquist 2019 but this study does not consider lateral flow the average increases in t a during the intermediate and high rainfall scenarios were 9 and 4 when comparing the results for actual transpiration t a of the flood and water saving irrigation treatments with the rainfed treatment fig 6 when the flood irrigation was applied in the low rainfall scenario t a increased by 30 on average compared with t a obtained in the rainfed treatment when water saving irrigation was used in the low rainfall scenario t a increased by 20 compared with the rainfed treatment therefore irrigation is shown to be needed in the low rainfall scenario to maintain crop transpiration and optimize yield at site 3 significant increases in t a were observed comparing the flood irrigation with the rainfed treatment the increase in t a was 57 for the low rainfall scenario and 18 for the high and the intermediate rainfall scenarios the soil water retention curve at site 3 may explain the elevated sensitivity of t a to irrigation this soil has the lowest water storage capacity among the studied soils fig 3 since the soil water availability is even lower in the dry season low rainfall the water available to plants will be more limited than in other soils with greater water storage capacity with a continuous water supply e g under flood irrigation water is available all the time and water storage capacity does not affect the transpiration which will be potential soil evaporation e a increased when the flood irrigation was used compared with the rainfed and the water saving irrigation treatments fig 6 at site 2 e a increased from 95 mm rainfed to 165 mm flood irrigation in the low rainfall scenario the lowest e a increment occurred at site 3 from 110 mm rainfed to 126 mm flood irrigation in the intermediate rainfall scenario e a in flooded rice is expected to be high almost equal to a free water surface at site 3 e a decreased from 125 mm rainfed to 108 mm water saving irrigation in the low rainfall scenario such a decrease in soil evaporation is related to the higher soil cover by crop canopy in water saving irrigation compared to the rainfed treatment 3 2 2 grain yield and water productivity most of the simulated grain yields for the rainfed treatment were significantly lower than the potential grain yield in the low rainfall scenario fig 7 the water saving irrigation treatment did not significantly increase the relative grain yield y r compared with the rainfed treatment in the low rainfall scenario for the three sites the y r of the water saving irrigation in the low rainfall scenario was at most at site 1 3 higher than the grain yield in the rainfed treatment the flood irrigation treatment increased y r from 8 site 2 to 25 site 3 compared with other treatments in the low rainfall scenario fig 7 grain yields simulated for site 1 and site 2 were similar to potential grain yields y r between 94 and 99 with or without irrigation for the intermediate and high rainfall scenarios based on these results irrigation appears to be unnecessary in years with intermediate or high rainfall amounts nevertheless flood irrigation would increase grain yields for at least one of the sites site 3 in years with low rainfall regarding water use efficiency fig 8a shows water productivity considering only transpiration wp t fig 8b presents water productivity based on evapotranspiration wp et and fig 8c shows water productivity based on the sum of evapotranspiration and deep percolation wp etq simulations with low rainfall and rainfed treatment resulted in the highest wp t values from 3 7 to 4 2 kg m 3 fig 8a wp et values from 2 5 to 2 7 kg m 3 fig 8b and wp etq values from 0 8 to 1 3 kg m 3 fig 8 c there was no difference between wp t obtained for the rainfed and the irrigation treatments and there is no apparent tendency in the values of wp t concerning the rainfall amounts fig 8a most wp et values were in the range of 2 0 and 2 5 kg m 3 and only three wp et values were in the range of 2 5 and 3 0 kg m 3 fig 8b which referred to the rainfed and water saving irrigation treatments in the low rainfall scenario water demand from flood irrigation is evidenced in the water productivity indexes calculated as wp et and wp etq these indexes consider soil evaporation and deep percolation q respectively to estimate water productivity besides crop transpiration wp etq values are mainly influenced by q and that is why the lowest values of wp etq were obtained in most of the high rainfall scenarios and for all scenarios with flood irrigation fig 8c wp etq of flood irrigation treatment was 250 lower than the second lowest wp etq which refers to water saving irrigation in the high rainfall scenario at site 3 wp et values agree with those calculated from field experiments in tropical floodplains of the cerrado biome in brazil borja reis et al 2018a 2018b however wp et values obtained in this study were higher than values commonly obtained for irrigated rice which are between 0 4 and 1 6 kg m 3 zwart and bastiaanssen 2004 tuong and bouman 2003 dossou yovo and saito 2022 however mainuddin et al 2020 reported average wp et values of 1 60 kg m 1 and 1 78 kg m 3 in two years with the maximum reaching around 3 0 kg m 3 wp etq values obtained in this study are also similar to wp values reported by singh et al 2006 for rice crops in india an ideal irrigation management should result in high crop productivity with optimal water use recommended by a combined assessment of water productivity and grain yield from our results changing from flood irrigation to water saving irrigation or rainfed treatment increases wp et and wp etq while the relative grain yield is little affected as a function of irrigation treatment for two of the three evaluated sites fig 9 flood irrigation treatment resulted in large deep percolation losses which explains why wp etq is significantly affected by changing from flooding to water saving or rainfed treatments rainfed treatment showed that the grain yield is reduced considerably 23 at site 3 when the rainfall amount is low however water saving irrigation increased wp et and wp etq while grain yield was reduced by 13 which is almost half of the y r reduction when changing from flood irrigation to rainfed treatment therefore from a combined assessment of grain yield and water use efficiency water saving irrigation is a promising method for rice cultivation in the lowland region of cerrado brazil 4 conclusion in the tropical floodplains of the brazilian cerrado flood irrigation results in the highest grain yields but the lowest water use efficiency this irrigation method is only recommended when rainfall is very low below 500 mm per season and if maximization of grain yield is preferable over water use efficiency choosing the water saving irrigation method rather than the flood irrigation method increases water productivity by about 10 and penalizes the rice grain yield by 5 13 hence as an alternative to the traditional method of flood irrigation employed in south brazil a more sustainable irrigation method based on crop transpiration is recommended for increasing the water use efficiency of rice

8927,in controlled environment horticulture nutrients are retained in horticultural substrates resulting in additional export of the nutrients provided through fertigation to increase feasibility of the circular use of renewable growing media nutrient retention in the substrate should remain low during cultivation the aim of the present study was to examine the effect on nutrient retention 1 if nutrient input via fertigation is reduced and 2 if alternative growing media are used nutrient dynamics were studied for soilless strawberry cultivation in two full scale greenhouse trials with the short day cultivar elsanta and with a new substrate blend with 25 v v wood fiber and 15 v v green compost versus a conventional peat based blend 75 15 10 v v peat coir perlite the conventional fertigation regime was compared with a reduced fertigation regime which contained 65 of the standard concentration for n p k mg ca and s the first trial was a nine month autumn spring cycle the second trial was a two month autumn cultivation peat reduced blends with or without wood based biochar resulted in the same fruit yield as the peat based blends trial length and fertigation regime interacted to affect yield with significantly lower yield in the long trial under reduced fertigation versus conventional fertigation and higher yield under reduced fertigation in the shorter trial these findings indicate that nutrient concentrations in the applied fertigation should not be reduced during the long autumn spring cycle ca 76 88 mg 70 85 and n 61 81 are mainly retained in the spent medium while k is mainly retained in the aboveground biomass 60 k contents in the peat reduced substrate clearly decreased during cultivation the peat reduced blend may thus be a source of k wood based biochar in the blend 3 10 v v showed no effect on either nutrient retention or nutrient balance graphical abstract ga1 keywords horticultural substrates controlled environment agriculture circular horticulture peat replacement wood fiber data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction controlled environment agriculture for food production shows promise for addressing some current horticultural challenges important success factors are growing media and nutrient supply shamshiri et al 2018 soilless cultivation systems show high water and nutrient use efficiency which makes them important within controlled environment agriculture massa et al 2020 nutrient export in controlled environment agriculture is mainly related to harvested crops crop residues and spent growing media with their relative share being dependent on the crop and the cultivation conditions van tuyll et al 2022 this paper focuses on soilless strawberry production more than 80 of the strawberry production in belgium 50 000 tonnes year is based on soilless cultivation this share has increased during the past decade due to phytosanitary technical and economic factors van delm et al 2016 de samber 2019 conventional growing media for strawberry cultivation contain at least 80 peat with coir and perlite as the other main ingredients each year 140 000 m³ of peat is used for soilless strawberry cultivation 800 ha representing more than 20 of the peat used for horticulture in belgium the importance of soilless strawberry cultivation and the use of peat in the netherlands is comparable to belgium 1 1 new materials including biochar peat is a main ingredient in growing media but peat extraction has an important environmental impact this has led to a search for alternatives atzori et al 2021 barrett et al 2016 blok et al 2021 especially as peat extraction in the european union will be included in mitigation targets defined in the eu regulation 2018 841 european union 2018 from 2026 onwards potentially reducing the supply of european peat for horticulture hirschler et al 2022 several european countries have developed national or regional strategies to reduce and phase out peat use in horticulture by 2030 hirschler et al 2022 growing media blends based on sustainable and local materials make it possible to reduce or even completely replace non renewable or less sustainable raw materials such as peat stone wool or coir barrett et al 2016 sustainable growing media can also have an added value for plant growth and environment in terms of reduced use of fertilizers and crop protection products owing to the provision of recycled nutrients and increased disease resistance in crops e g madhavi et al 2021 atzori et al 2021 the current linear approach to greenhouse horticulture has heavy environmental impacts related to the input of fossil fuels mineral fertilizers and the energy required to produce mineral slabs a more circular approach could reduce these environmental impacts van tuyll et al 2022 optimization of cultivation practices may lead to increased circularity of nutrients and materials in soilless horticulture massa et al 2020 and may reduce the production costs for growers spent media including any retained nutrients may be either directly reused or used as feedstock for further processing thus extending their use as growing media shuttleworth et al 2021 vandecasteele et al 2020 such practices improve nutrient efficiency and the general sustainability of the soilless cultivation system amery et al 2021 materials in sustainable growing media blends and the cultivation practices applied during the first use of the growing media affect the nutrient retention and other characteristics of spent growing media nutrient retention is an important factor in the feasibility of circular use of spent growing media as excessive nutrient levels may negatively affect the possibility for either direct reuse or use after further processing vandecasteele et al 2020 wood fiber compost and bark products are already regularly used as materials in growing media atzori et al 2021 barrett et al 2016 woznicki et al 2021 composts harbor a diversity of microbes optimize the nitrification process and can act as either a source of nutrients or as a liming agent e g pot et al 2021 vandecasteele et al 2022 the addition of small amounts of biochar to growing media can increase disease suppression e g frenkel et al 2017 while it can also be applied for bulk replacement of peat coir or perlite e g blok et al 2017 chrysargyris et al 2020 lévesque et al 2020 messiga et al 2021 in the latter case biochars may interact with fertigation in different ways amery et al 2021 report that nutrients are released rather than retained when biochars are used as bulk material in fertigated growing media lévesque et al 2020 observed that adding 5 10 or 15 v v biochar in peat based growing media for tomato and pepper cultivation significantly increased n and p uptake efficiency i e the amount of nutrients taken up by the plant relative to the total amount of n or p supplied as fertilizer and retained in the growing medium with subsequently lower n and p losses with the leachate chrysargyris et al 2020 also reported that biochars can act as a source of nutrients during seedling production 1 2 fertilizers and fertigation strategies soilless cultivation systems with drip irrigation or subirrigation require less water and fertilizers in comparison to soil bound cultivation massa et al 2020 soilless cultivation systems based on nutrient supply by fertigation have more flexibility in terms of crop management than supplying nutrients only at the onset of cultivation massa et al 2020 the concentration of the nutrient solution is the dominant factor for the nutrient dynamics and retention in these systems venezia et al 2022 ropokis et al 2021 and the nutrient use efficiency neocleous and savvas 2019 nutrient management in the fertigation is also an important strategy to optimize fruit quality and shelf life for strawberry gallace and lieten 2018 replacement of virgin mineral fertilizer sources with recycled nutrients and or organic fertilizers is also important for increasing circularity ahmed et al 2021 blok et al 2021 renewable materials in growing media may also be a source of nutrients to plants as observed for composts biochars and plant fibers vandecasteele et al 2018 amery et al 2021 nguyen et al 2022 for this reason the supply of additional nutrients during cultivation may need to be optimized based on the blend composition different strategies have been tested for recycling the nutrients retained in spent growing media including direct reuse shuttleworth et al 2021 vandecasteele et al 2020 and use as feedstock for biochar for subsequent application in horticultural substrates amery et al 2021 low decomposition rates and lower n availability were measured in spent growing media while p and k remained highly plant available vandecasteele et al 2020 vollmer et al 2022 1 3 objectives of the study low nutrient retention in the substrate during cultivation increases the feasibility of circular use of growing media the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of growing medium blend and fertigation regime on nutrient export in plants and growing media at the end of cultivation in a closed loop gutter system with drip fertigation four objectives related to peat based and reduced peat substrate used for strawberry production were assessed namely 1 whether the use of peat reduced substrate increased nutrient retention in the substrate 2 what was the relative importance of nutrient retention in the substrate in relation to nutrient export in aboveground biomass at crop termination 3 how the fertigation regime affected nutrient export at crop termination 4 whether addition of wood based biochar to the horticultural substrate increased nutrient retention 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup we tested the effect of blend composition e g partial peat replacement with or without 3 10 v v biochar and fertigation concentration in two trials of strawberry cultivation of different durations at the end of cultivation nutrients are either removed from the system via the spent growing media or have been taken up by the vegetative plant parts the impact of fertigation and blend on nutrients was assessed based on crop nutrient uptake and nutrient retention in growing media based on total nutrient content at crop termination net nutrient retention in growing media change during cultivation and changes in nutrient availability in growing media based on extractable concentrations in this context the net nutrient balance is the difference between import of nutrients i e nutrients entering the system with the virgin growing media and export of nutrients from the system at crop termination i e nutrients leaving the system two full scale greenhouse trials with three growing media and two fertigation regimes in a random block design were executed in a closed loop gutter system with drip irrigation in a professional greenhouse growing system at proefcentrum hoogstraten an extension research center located in meerle belgium during the 2020 trial a continued autumn spring cycle 278 days was applied i e an autumn culture of strawberries that started on 19 august 2020 and resumed in spring ending in june 2021 strawberries were grown in a heated glass greenhouse at 5 5 m post height during 10 months representative of a typical highly intensive culture the greenhouse was heated and screens were used for climate control the heating regime started in early october 8 c at night and 17 c during the day until the end of harvest then climate control changed to 8 c at night and 14 c during the day no climate control was applied from early january until 10 february 2021 after which the spring heating regime 8 c at night and 14 c during the day began the 2021 trial was an autumn cultivation 72 days in an unheated plastic vanden heuvel type greenhouse with six meter post height vanden heuvel brecht belgium both trials used the strawberry hybrid fragaria ananassa cultivar elsanta which is a june bearing strawberry i e producing one large crop of fruit each growing season typically in june and is the most widely produced cultivar in flanders belgium white 9 or 8 l trays were used in 2020 and 2021 respectively per tray 6 pre rooted plugs were grown at a plant density of 10 5 plants per m2 greenhouse surface i e 1 ha of greenhouse contains 17 500 trays each tray was filled with an equal volume of substrate and then 6 tray plants are put in each tray each trial had 6 treatments combination of blend and fertigation regime tested with four replicates each replicate had 10 trays and 60 plants resulting in treatments of 22 24 m2 greenhouse surface greenhouse and fertigation management was comparable with current practices in horticulture in belgium and the netherlands 2 2 growing media blends three blends were compared in the trials a conventional peat based blend peat a peat reduced pr and biochar amended peat reduced pr b blend table 1 all blends were produced by agaris gent belgium the conventional peat based blend contained 75 v v peat a mixture of blocked irish and white peat 10 30 mm 15 v v coir chips 8 mm fraction and 10 v v perlite 3 6 mm fraction the peat reduced blend contained 45 v v peat mixture of blocked irish and

3 6 mm fraction the composition of the peat based and peat reduced blends remained constant for the 2020 and 2021 trials wood fiber and green compost were selected for their high potential for peat replacement and their increasing use in european horticulture atzori et al 2021 barrett et al 2016 green compost was selected based on previous experiences of this material as a source of nutrients atzori et al 2021 vandecasteele et al 2018 and its effect on microbial characteristics of the blend including the stimulation of nitrification vandecasteele et al 2022 a wood based biochar was used in both years table a1 the wood based biochars were produced by the netherlands organisation for applied scientific research tno petten the netherlands using a specific gasification reactor pyromaat reactor under controlled conditions table a1 biochar 1 is based on mixed wood residues from park maintenance and biochar 2 is based on beech wood due to a practical mixing error during production of the blends at pilot scale only 3 biochar v v equivalent to 10 g dm l was included in the blend with biochar in 2020 versus the 10 v v used in 2021 the composition of the 2021 blends with biochar was as follows 41 v v peat mixture of blocked irish and white peat 22 5 v v wood fiber 13 5 v v green compost 10 v v biochar 8 v v coir chips and 5 v v perlite before blending the biochar into the blend it was moistened to a moisture content of 50 dm on fresh weight to allow for better mixing and avoid losses through dust haifa multi mix potting soil 14 16 18 micronutrients fertilizer was added to each blend in a dose of 0 4 g l representing 56 28 and 60 mg l for n p and k respectively the small dose of mineral fertilizer in all blends was applied to avoid differences in nutrient availability between the blends in the first days of the trials lime was added in a dose of 3 0 g l for the peat based blend and 1 8 g l for the peat reduced blend the results of the physical analyses of the substrates table 3 indicate no distinct differences in water or air volume between the blends tested as only small differences between the blends were observed for total pore volume max difference 1 v v shrinkage max difference 3 v v air volume max difference 5 v v and water volume at 10 cm max 4 v v the peat based blend had a higher organic matter content higher water potential lower density and lower dry matter content than the other blends table 3 the wood based biochars were smaller than 5 mm and the main part of the biochar particles was in the 1 2 mm fraction table a1 the biochar used in the 2020 trial had more particles in the 2 5 mm fraction than the beech wood biochar of the 2021 trial 2 3 fertigation regimes and drain water volume water supply was managed at the greenhouse level the fertigation was determined by solar radiation in accordance with local weather conditions i e 200 ml per tray or 3500 l ha supplied in 3 min per 220 joules solar radiation fertigation was controlled by a priva greenhouse climate computer priva de lier the netherlands two pressure compensated kameleon drippers netafim maasdijk the netherlands were provided in each tray each situated in the middle of 4 plants with each dripper providing 100 ml water in 3 min per fertigation event the conventional fertigation regime was compared with a reduced fertigation regime which contained 65 of the standard concentration for n p k mg ca and s and 100 of the standard regime for trace elements the composition of the fertigation solution during the different stages of cultivation is given in table 2 the intended drainage fraction was 20 drain volume relative to the water input through fertigation this drainage volume was reused in a fully closed recirculation system where drainage was mixed with rainwater as follows 30 v v drain water was mixed with 70 v v rain water and nutrients are supplemented to this mixture up to the desired nutrient concentrations the electrical conductivity ec of the collected drain water at greenhouse level was measured biweekly and the nutrient supply was adapted accordingly during the entire cultivation samples of the fertigation solution were collected from two drippers per feeding line the drainage water was collected from 4 trays 2 trays from 2 replicates per treatment ec of fertigation and drainage was monitored weekly chemical composition of fertigation and drainage was checked based on lab analyses a sample of each fertigation regime and a composite sample of the drainage water of each combination of blend and fertigation regime was analyzed for nutrient content at a commercial lab samples were sent on 23 september 2020 21 october 2020 and 14 april 2021 for the 2020 trial and on 11 august 2021 and 09 september 2021 for the 2021 trial ec in these samples was measured based on conductometry p k ca mg were measured in an acidified filtrate with icp aes according to nen 6966 2005 nen 2005 and nh4 n and no3 n were measured in a filtrate with continuous flow spectophotometry according to npr6650 nen 1991 both fertigation composition and drainage composition were monitored continually based on ec fig a1 and were checked based on chemical analyses on specific dates the tested differences in fertigation were confirmed by the ec monitoring and by the lab analyses fig a1 all blends within one fertigation regime received the same fertigation solution and similar ec values were measured for the three blends per fertigation level 2 4 cultivation and fruit harvest for the first trial strawberry was planted on 19

flowering as noted above forcing the crop towards the reproductive phase on 24 august 2021 the first fruits were harvested and on 24 september 2021 the last fruits were harvested an overview of each trial is provided in table a2 fruit yield was determined twice weekly by harvesting the ripe strawberries fruits were harvested by trained staff per experimental treatment across the entire trial per experimental unit all 60 plants were used to assess fruit yield 240 plants per treatment to cover the natural variation in yield between plants a standardized mold for round fruits is used to categorize fruit size based on a standard procedure for all trials at pch the fruit size of a strawberry is defined as the maximum diameter of the largest cross section at every harvest the yields per plot were registered and the fruits were registered in the following size categories large 2 a large a small rotten and misshapen fruit large 2 a fruits have a minimum diameter of 35 mm large a fruits have a minimum diameter of 31 mm small fruits have a diameter smaller than 31 mm the yield data kg m² were compared for the first class fruit size 30 mm large 2 a and large a and for the total yield yield data were processed separately for both harvest periods of the 2020 trial the 2021 trial had only one harvest period the two cultivation systems tested in this study reflect the main systems used for soilless strawberry cultivation in belgium the netherlands and greater northwestern europe neri et al 2012 van delm et al 2016 the gutter based system with drain collection is used by almost all growers who apply soilless strawberry cultivation in belgium and the netherlands van delm et al 2016 2 5 sampling of aboveground biomass and growing media per treatment six trays with six plants per tray were sampled at the end of cultivation all remaining fruits were removed before sampling then the vegetative aboveground biomass without remaining fruits was harvested weighed manually cut into 2 cm pieces and a subsample of minimum 175 g fresh material was dried for further processing here we define aboveground biomass as the vegetative aboveground biomass stalks and leaflets of the compound leaves present at the end of the cultivation pre rooted plugs were cut with a knife from the growing medium as these plugs were included at time of planting and the plug thus contained a growing medium blend and nutrients that differed from the tested blends and the nutrients supplied by fertigation spent growing medium is thus defined as the growing medium remaining at the end of the cultivation after removal of the rooted plugs this spent growing medium was weighed and sampled 2 6 chemical composition of plants and growing media sample preparation of growing media for determination of total nutrient content dry matter content moisture content and laboratory compacted bulk density was executed according to en13040 cen 2007a the total porosity air filled porosity and water filled porosity and the shrinkage of the growing media was determined according to en13041 cen 2012 particle size distribution of the biochars was determined according to en15428 cen 2007b

ammonium acetate extractable concentrations are considered to be potentially plant available in the growing medium in the longer term assessment of optimal range and nutrient deficiency for foliar composition is based on pritts et al 2015 crop nutrient uptake in the leaves was calculated by multiplying the measured content with the dry mass of leaves 2 7 calculations for these trials comparisons were made for a nutrient contents g kg dm biomass in the aboveground biomass b nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass kg ha i e nutrient content x dm mass of the aboveground biomass per ha c nutrient amount in the spent growing medium kg ha i e nutrient content x dm mass of the spent medium per ha and d ratio between the nutrient amount in the spent growing medium sgm versus the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass ab denoted as the sgm ab ratio the sgm ab ratio expresses the nutrient distribution between two components of the cultivation system in terms of nutrients removed at the end of the cultivation a ratio higher than 1 indicates that the spent growing medium contains more nutrients than the aboveground biomass differences in bulk density between the growing media blends were present due to differences in organic matter content crop nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass and nutrient retention in the spent growing medium were expressed in kg per ha to represent an equal volume of horticultural substrate for the net nutrient balance calculation nutrient import was calculated as the initial nutrient amount in the virgin growing media and nutrient export was the sum of the nutrient export with the sgm and with the aboveground vegetative biomass values for nutrients in sgm and aboveground biomass are average values for six replicates import of nutrients i e nutrients entering the system with the virgin growing media were shown in the figures as positive values while export of nutrients from the system i e nutrients leaving the system at the end of cultivation were shown in the figures as negative values table 3 2 8 statistics data were processed per trial two way anova and tukey s post hoc test was used for factor 1 blend and factor 2 fertigation regime homogeneity of variances was checked using box plots and data normality was checked using qqplots statistica 13 5 statsoft inc hamburg germany 3 results 3 1 fruit yield no interaction between blend and fertigation was observed for the yield for any of the three harvest periods peat reduced blends with or without wood based biochar resulted in the same yield as the peat based blends in both trials table 4 a significant effect of the blend on first class quality fruit yield was only observed for the spring cultivation of the 2020 trial where the peat reduced blend with biochar had a significantly higher yield of first class quality fruits 4 1 kg m2 than for the peat 3 4 kg m2 or peat reduced 3 5 kg m2 blend there was no significant effect of blend on the total yield in any of the trials fertigation had a significant effect on total and first quality size yield for the three periods with 10 17 and 18 28 higher yields for the higher fertigation regime in the 2020 trial for the autumn 4 2 vs 3 8 kg m2 and spring 8 3 vs 6 5 kg m2 cultivation respectively table 4 in contrast to the 2020 trial the higher fertigation regime 2 5 kg m2 resulted in a 10 yield reduction for the 2021 trial compared with the reduced fertigation 2 8 kg m2 in the 2021 trial 3 2 nutrient contents and nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass nutrient contents in relation to fertigation and blend effects in both trials are shown in table a3 for the foliar composition in terms of optimal contents or nutrient deficiency pritts et al 2015 only n contents were below the optimal range in the lower fertigation regime in 2020 values 2 n dm p and k contents in the higher level fertigation regime in the 2021 trial were beyond the optimal range indicating luxury consumption at this level of fertigation in summary the main trends for 2020 were related to fertigation while in 2021 more interaction was observed between fertigation and blend type higher mg contents in the plant biomass for the peat based blend were found in both trials table a3 for both 2020 and 2021 no significant interaction was observed for the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass between factor blend and factor fertigation regime similarly the effect of the blend was not significant for aboveground biomass nor for nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass table 5 the low fertigation regime resulted in significantly lower aboveground biomass and nutrient uptake for all elements in 2020 whereas in 2021 the nutrient uptake was lower for n p and k under the low fertigation regime no additional significant effect of wood based biochar addition was observed in the blend on the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass under the fertigation regimes tested no additional net uptake from the peat reduced blend with mainly the compost as a source of nutrients fig a2 was observed as no differences were noted in the uptake in the aboveground biomass the higher contents in the plant biomass observed for some elements thus did not result in significantly higher uptake in the plants in summary fertigation had the highest effect with significantly lower n p and k uptake for the low fertigation regime in both trials in 2020 this resulted in a significantly lower aboveground biomass for the lower fertigation regime but not in 2021 3 3 nutrients in the spent growing medium the fertigation regimes resulted in more significant differences in 2020 than in 2021 table 6 in contrast only a limited number of cases showed an effect of blend composition on residual nutrient amounts in general residual p and k amount is clearly lower for the trial in 2020 p 13 k 25 kg ha than for 2021 p 20 k 45 kg ha the c related characteristics of growing media are important in terms of the microbiology in the rhizosphere but also affect the reuse options e g more c lower dry bulk density or the value of spent growing media as soil improver for the amount of c kg ha both the peat reduced blends were higher than for peat in 2020 while in 2021 the biochar amended peat reduced blend had a significantly higher amount of c per ha than the other blends table 6 wood based biochar resulted in an intermediate c n ratio in both trials and in an intermediate c p ratio in 2021 in comparison with the peat blend and the peat reduced blend in summary there was a large effect of the blend on the amount of nutrients in the spent growing media related to the initial amount of nutrients in the virgin blend biochar dose in both experiments had a rather small impact on the total amount of nutrients in the sgm within the 2021 trial with the higher biochar dose only the blend with biochar showed higher values for c c n and c p 3 4 ratio between the nutrients in the spent growing medium versus nutrients in the aboveground biomass values for the ratio sgm ab 1 indicate that nutrient retention in the substrate is more important than nutrient uptake the aboveground biomass a high sgm ab ratio may indicate more potential to reduce the fertigation for this element values for the sgm ab ratio 1 indicate that if the substrate is simply reused during a new cultivation cycle the amount of nutrients present in sgm will not be sufficient to cover the nutrient demand for this cultivation no significant interaction between blend and fertigation was observed for the sgm ab ratio for any of the elements in both years table 7 the effect of blend was significant for all elements in both years for the sgm ab ratio for p mg and ca there is no significant effect of fertigation in both years fertigation only had a significant effect for the sgm ab ratio of n in the 2020 trial and for the ratio of k in the 2021 trial in 2021 the sgm ab ratio for k was significantly higher for the higher fertigation while in 2020 the ratio for n was significantly lower at the higher fertigation rate biochar had no effect on the sgm ab ratio for any of the elements in both years in summary the ratio between the amount of nutrients in the spent growing medium versus the amount of nutrients in the aboveground biomass ranged between 1 9 and 7 5 for ca mg and n the spent medium is thus the main compartment for these elements this sgm ab ratio was always lower than 0 7 for k pointing to the aboveground biomass as the main compartment for k the sgm ab ratio for p was 0 7 for the peat based blends and 1 5 or higher for the other blends pointing to a blend specific effect on the p distribution for the 2020 trial approximately 1 3rd of the total amount of n 30 mg 34 and ca 29 supplied with fertigation ended up in the aboveground biomass versus 1 5th for p 20 and k 22 there was a very low net retention in the spent growing media of n p and k of max 5 of the total amount of n p and k supplied with the fertigation versus a high retention of ca 48 and mg 51 3 5 net evolution of total and available nutrient content before vs after cultivation the initial amount of nutrients in the peat reduced blend is clearly higher than for the peat blend fig 1 the higher nutrient contents in the virgin peat reduced blends are mainly related to the green compost as a source of nutrients fig a2 although only 15 v v of green compost is used it contributes to more than 70 of the p k ca and mg in the peat reduced blend and more than 50 v v of the n at the doses provided in this experiment the effect of the wood based biochar amendment on the n p ca and mg contents in the virgin growing media was limited fig a2 a clear increase in the k content of the blend with 10 v v biochar was noted with biochar representing 27 of the k in this blend fig a2 the mineral fertilizer was a more important source of p and k in the peat reduced blend than peat or coir in the case of peat reduced growing media more nutrients entered the system with the virgin growing medium k and p were removed during cultivation while a clear retention of ca and mg was observed fig a4 for the peat reduced blends in 2020 we observed an average decrease in the growing medium during cultivation of 42 kg k and 6 kg p ha no net increase in n and an increase of 31 kg ca and 10 kg mg ha for 2021 the values are clearly higher i e an average decrease of 17 kg k no net increase in p and an increase of 76 kg ca 74 kg n and 21 kg mg ha for the peat reduced blends for the peat based blends during cultivation the main observed trends in the growing medium were an increase of 89 kg ca and 23 kg mg ha the observations for the nutrient contents are confirmed by the ammonium acetate extractable concentrations fig a3 ammonium acetate extractable p was clearly lower at the end of the cultivation than in the initial blend with overall lower values for the reduced fertigation regime for k the same trend was observed for the peat reduced blends but the decrease in available k was smaller for the peat blends for available ca the concentrations in the 2020 trial were higher for the full fertigation regime than for the initial blend and for the reduced fertigation regime while concentrations remained constant for the 2021 trial we conclude from these data that for the peat reduced blends p and k availability were clearly lower at the end of the cultivation than in the initial blend and were lower for the lower fertigation regime fig a3 the decrease in k and p availability was confirmed by the net decrease in total contents for these elements 3 6 effect of fertigation on nutrient export at crop termination to assess the relevance of fertigation on the residual nutrient contents in the spent growing media the data for the four peat based and eight peat reduced blends in the trials in this paper were compared with data for 13 peat based and 13 peat reduced or peat free blends from other trials and or other growers the data in these box plots fig 2 illustrate that for n ca and mg the contents in the samples of the trials in this manuscript are comparable with contents measured in other studies which indicates only limited potential for reducing the retention of n ca and mg in the spent growing media in contrast the k and p contents in the samples of the trials in this manuscript are clearly lower compared with the other data sets with the p and k contents being on average 3 and 2 times lower respectively in the reported trials than for the other samples mainly for p and k there is potential to reduce retention in spent growing media and the p and k retention in the trials reported here is limited compared with other trials this may explain why a further reduction in nutrient supply with fertigation resulted in less retention in the aboveground biomass but did not decrease the retention in the spent growing medium combined with the knowledge on the distribution between aboveground biomass and spent growing media this means that there is more potential for managing the retention for p and k than for n ca and mg in soilless strawberry cultivation this may change however if fertigation with chemical fertilizers would be partly replaced by organic fertilizers in the growing media 4 discussion 4 1 effect of blend composition on nutrient retention and nutrient balance nutrients were supplied by fertigation and with the virgin growing media blend the nutrients initially available in the virgin growing medium are a buffer for the crop whenever there is a shortage in the nutrient supply through fertigation vandecasteele et al 2018 from the viewpoint of circularity the residual nutrient content of spent growing media is one of the aspects that determines to what extent these spent growing media could be re used for another crop cycle ideally the nutrient content in the substrate is lower after the first cultivation as it shows that the nutrients have been taken up by the plants and valorized in the cropping system the higher the nutrient retention during cultivation the more complex the scenario for reuse of the growing media becomes as high nutrient levels may result in the need for an adapted fertilizer need during reuse vandecasteele et al 2020 spent growing media with higher residual nutrient contents may be used at lower v v in new blends or may be used as organic fertilizer vollmer et al 2022 while a lower nutrient content may allow spent growing media to be reused as stand alone material average yields for unheated and heated greenhouses in belgium are 3 6 and 5 5 kg m2 respectively de samber 2019 the yield in the 2020 trial is clearly higher than these average values the 2021 trial had a lower yield but this was a short cultivation in comparison with the 2020 trial all three blends performed well in regard to nutrient content after first cultivation the composition of the blend did not affect nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass except for a small but significant effect for mg in the 2021 trial no negative effects of peat replacement in the blends on yield were observed and the peat reduced blend with biochar even resulted in a significantly higher yield in the continued culture in spring for the 2020 trial the new blends with or without biochar did not negatively affect yield due to possible differences in aeration drainage or other characteristics of the blend there were no distinct differences in water or air volume between the blends tested table 3 the new blends had lower amounts of perlite but contained wood fiber which is also known for its aeration properties durand et al 2021 while results of lévesque et al 2020 previously indicated that biochar can act as replacement for perlite at the end of the cultivation the peat reduced blends had higher nutrient contents in comparison to the peat based blends however when taking the initial nutrient content of the blends into account the net balance indicates that the peat reduced blends are a source of k and to a lesser extent p during cultivation rather than being a sink peat reduced blends acted as a source of k in both trials and were a source of p in the continued autumn spring cycle in the 2021 trial only n retention was noted in the peat reduced blend these differences between nutrients and blends is the result of nutrient specific interaction with the cation exchange capacity of the growing medium as well as retention of part of the nutrients in the spent growing medium within the roots this is a topic for future research both blends showed an increase during cultivation in ca and mg content while no real change was observed for n content a decrease in k content of the peat reduced blends was observed during cultivation in contrast with the peat based blends which remained more or less stable in addition a clear decrease in plant available p and k was found in the substrate due to cultivation part of the nutrients in the spent growing medium are contained in the roots it is estimated that roots may take up to 5 of the mass of the growing medium massetani et al 2017 sharma et al 2018 the decrease in k content is due to either leaching of k during fertigation and or plant uptake the observed decrease for k content during cultivation on the peat free blend confirms a previous leaching experiment with spent growing media where a high leaching rate and thus higher availability for k than for p was observed vandecasteele et al 2020 more research is needed to detect whether k is taken up by the plants is leached with the drain water or a combination of both the observed effects for k can be related to differences with ca mg n or p in a nutrient binding and cation exchange with the growing medium or b nutrient availability in the plant roots this is a topic for future research 4 2 nutrient export with the aboveground biomass in terms of nutrient efficiency the lower the nutrient contents in the crop residues and in the spent growing media the better nutrients leaving the soilless cultivation system with these 2 compartments however have a clear lower limit below which they cannot fall any further as they are clearly linked to the nutrients taken up by the fruits nutrients leaving the system with the fruits should be benchmarked in relation to optimal yield and nutritional quality of the fruits nutrients left in the vegetative plant parts should be benchmarked in relation to optimal nutrient needs for vegetative growth and fruit development versus signs of luxury consumptions of elements on average 70 kg n 70 kg k 50 kg ca 12 kg mg and 9 kg p was exported per ha greenhouse with the 11 7 tonnes of fresh aboveground vegetative biomass dm content of 24 when this aboveground biomass is collected separately this results in a material with a nutrient profile and n p k ratio different from that of the spent growing medium including a difference in stability among others vandecasteele et al 2020 results of van tuyll et al 2022 show that there is a good potential for recovering minerals from non fruit biomass from greenhouse grown tomato as over half of the supplied mg ca and s ends up in vegetative parts at 58 70 and 70 respectively the nutrients in the spent substrates may have the lowest expected limit for residual nutrients as only a limited part of it consists of plant roots that are essential for plant growth based on the ratio between the nutrient retention in the spent growing medium versus the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass it is concluded that the spent growing medium is an important accumulator for ca mg n p but not for k however on average 114 kg n 18 kg k 163 kg ca 32 kg mg and 6 kg p was exported per ha greenhouse with the 43 tonnes freshly spent peat based growing medium dm content of 22 depending on the processing inclusion of the aboveground biomass when processing the spent growing media may provide added value for composting a combination of the two is required to ensure the optimal ratio between green nutrient rich materials versus the growing media as bulking agent for direct reuse inclusion of the aboveground biomass will clearly increase the p and k content of the spent growing medium which may result in a need for a changed fertilizer application for the next cultivation cycle vandecasteele et al 2020 it can also increase the ratio between k versus ca and mg based on the data for the 2020 trial including the plant biomass during reuse or recycling would result in an increase of the p content by 80 as well as a fourfold increase in k content for the peat reduced blend a strong effect of length of the cultivation on the nutrient contents in the spent growing medium was found the ratio was higher for 2021 than for 2020 indicating that longer trials result in stronger nutrient uptake from the growing medium and thus less nutrient retention than for shorter trials the amount of fruit harvested was five times higher for the 2020 trial than for the 2021 trial the related higher nutrient uptake and export by the fruits may explain the lower nutrient contents in the growing medium after cultivation for the 2020 trial 4 3 effect of fertigation regime on the nutrient balance the impact of the fertigation regime was assessed based on the effect on the yield versus the effect on the nutrient export at the end of cultivation a significant effect of fertigation regime on nutrients in both components was observed which resulted in lower nutrient export the reduced fertigation regime did not result in lower nutrient export with the spent growing media however the reduction was mainly found in the export with the aboveground biomass there is an element specific impact of fertigation and an effect of the initial composition of the growing medium blend on the nutrient distribution and nutrient export with aboveground biomass and with the sgm reducing the fertigation regime for these elements by 35 only resulted in a reduction of less than 20 in 2020 and 10 in 2021 in the amount of n ca and mg in the sgm for p the reduction in the amount of p in the sgm was 21 in both years the conventional fertigation regime still contains a buffer without resulting in a high risk of nutrient retention and too high nutrient export the lower fertigation level decreased the yield in the 2020 trial indicating shortage in nutrients for the crop while increasing the yield in the 2021 trial the aboveground biomass at the end of cultivation was comparable for both trials the decrease in plant available p and k in the growing medium during cultivation for both trials was more pronounced for the lower fertigation regime than for the conventional fertigation regime the decrease in p and k in the aboveground biomass under the lower fertigation regime for both trials was more pronounced than the decrease in p and k exported with the spent peat reduced media based on these observations and the low residual p and k contents compared with spent media from other strawberry trials or growers no change of the fertigation regime is needed as no net retention during cultivation in the substrate is observed for the higher versus the lower fertigation regime future research should also focus on negative or positive effects of the retention of ca and mg in the growing media during cultivation in case the growing media are reused as the ca k ratio affects fruit quality and shelf life in strawberries gallace and lieten 2018 element specific reduction of the concentrations in the fertigation are an alternative to reduction of all elements as tested here and may help to avoid imbalances between k and ca mg this may be achieved by adapting the nutrient solution based on regular analysis of root solution composition during cultivation voogt and bar yosef 2019 future research should thus also consider to what extent such adaptations could reduce the nutrient load of the growing medium at the end of production 4 4 effect of biochar in the blend on nutrient retention and nutrient balance the dose of wood based biochar applied in the 2021 trial was comparable to the majority of other studies that have tested 5 20 v v bulk replacement of peat blok et al 2017 chrysargyris et al 2020 lévesque et al 2020 messiga et al 2021 the biochars in this study can be characterized as wood based biochars with high c contents and low nutrient levels both biochars had comparable total n ca and mg contents the first biochar was richer in p while the second was richer in k the use of different doses of biochar in the two trials with a specific nutrient profile and particle size distribution did not strongly affect the physical properties nor the total nutrient content of the virgin blend due to the comparable nutrient profile of the biochar versus the bulk blend amending the biochar did not change the nutrient content of the virgin blend except for k in the 2021 trial and no additional value of the biochar as fertilizer was found in other setups where biochars were specifically tested as fertilizers in growing media e g amery et al 2021 chrysargyris et al 2020 the biochars had been mixed in peat and the biochar had a higher nutrient concentration than that of peat in the experiments reported here the wood based biochars had a comparable nutrient content as the peat reduced blends thus reducing the effect on the nutrient budget no negative effects of peat replacement by different materials including biochar were observed no contrasting effects between trials were observed for the peat reduced blends with biochar despite the variability in biochar type and dose which indicates that effects of wood based biochar are similar over a broad range of application doses and within a range of particle size distributions biochar amendment had more effect on the c related parameters than on the nutrient content of the spent growing media biochar addition 3 10 v v resulted in a higher c n ratio in both trials and a higher c p ratio in the 2021 trial for the 2021 trial with the higher dose of biochar the spent growing media with biochar had a higher value as soil improver than the peat reduced blends without biochar due to higher c c n and c p values in soilless cultivation biochars are exposed to the nutrients in the fertigation during a longer period this may change the mode of action of the biochars jaiswal et al 2018 proposed pre conditioning of the biochar i e exposing the biochar in the growing medium to pre planting fertigation as a successful strategy to enhance the indigenous microbial community structure and activity in the growing medium this pre conditioning results in improved efficacy of biochar with better plant performance and better suppression of soil borne diseases jaiswal et al 2018 the first use of biochar blended materials as growing medium can be considered a preconditioning as well with the potential for beneficial effects during the reuse of the spent growing media including the positive effects of a nutrient rich organic coating on the biochar hagemann et al 2017 formed during the first use conversion of spent growing media into biochar results in biochars enriched in nutrients in comparison with wood based biochars amery et al 2021 lataf et al 2022 which can be seen as a variant of spiking the biomass with minerals before pyrolysis as proposed by buss et al 2022 5 conclusions the creation of new blends based on renewable materials is the next step towards a more sustainable soilless horticulture peat reduced blends with or without wood based biochar showed comparable performance to peat blends in terms of yield and crop growth fertigation rather than blend composition was the dominant factor for the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass while the nutrient content in the spent growing medium was affected by both factors fertigation management had a higher potential for reducing p and k retention in spent growing media than for n ca and mg the ratio between the nutrients in the spent growing medium versus the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass at crop termination was applied to assess the importance of nutrients in these compartments ratios for ca mg and n ranged between 1 9 and 7 5 indicating the spent medium as the main accumulator for these elements the ratio for k was always lower than 0 7 indicating that the aboveground biomass was the main k accumulator the ratio for p was 0 7 for the peat based blends and 1 5 or higher for the other blends suggesting a blend specific effect on the p distribution a straightforward effect for the type of blend for all elements was found in both trials with peat based blends being less important for nutrient retention in the growing medium at crop termination in comparison with the other blends cultivation resulted in a decrease in total content and available concentrations of p and k in the peat reduced blends indicating active nutrient uptake from the blend either by the crop or through leaching from these results we conclude that the peat reduced substrate is a source of k rather than a sink the lower k and p contents in the spent growing medium compared with the virgin blend is advantageous for reuse under the same cultivation conditions when the spent peat reduced medium is recycled without the aboveground crop residues including the aboveground biomass in a reuse scenario will have a strong impact as it results in higher nutrient contents when corrections in nutrient supply are implemented during cultivation based on crop monitoring there may be even a higher potential for depleting the

8927,in controlled environment horticulture nutrients are retained in horticultural substrates resulting in additional export of the nutrients provided through fertigation to increase feasibility of the circular use of renewable growing media nutrient retention in the substrate should remain low during cultivation the aim of the present study was to examine the effect on nutrient retention 1 if nutrient input via fertigation is reduced and 2 if alternative growing media are used nutrient dynamics were studied for soilless strawberry cultivation in two full scale greenhouse trials with the short day cultivar elsanta and with a new substrate blend with 25 v v wood fiber and 15 v v green compost versus a conventional peat based blend 75 15 10 v v peat coir perlite the conventional fertigation regime was compared with a reduced fertigation regime which contained 65 of the standard concentration for n p k mg ca and s the first trial was a nine month autumn spring cycle the second trial was a two month autumn cultivation peat reduced blends with or without wood based biochar resulted in the same fruit yield as the peat based blends trial length and fertigation regime interacted to affect yield with significantly lower yield in the long trial under reduced fertigation versus conventional fertigation and higher yield under reduced fertigation in the shorter trial these findings indicate that nutrient concentrations in the applied fertigation should not be reduced during the long autumn spring cycle ca 76 88 mg 70 85 and n 61 81 are mainly retained in the spent medium while k is mainly retained in the aboveground biomass 60 k contents in the peat reduced substrate clearly decreased during cultivation the peat reduced blend may thus be a source of k wood based biochar in the blend 3 10 v v showed no effect on either nutrient retention or nutrient balance graphical abstract ga1 keywords horticultural substrates controlled environment agriculture

addressing some current horticultural challenges important success factors are growing media and nutrient supply shamshiri et al 2018 soilless cultivation systems show high water and nutrient use efficiency which makes them important within controlled environment agriculture massa et al 2020 nutrient export in controlled environment agriculture is mainly related to harvested crops crop residues and spent growing media with their relative share being dependent on the crop and the cultivation conditions van tuyll et al 2022 this paper focuses on soilless strawberry production more than 80 of the strawberry production in belgium 50 000 tonnes year is based on soilless cultivation this share has increased during the past decade due to phytosanitary technical and economic factors van delm et al 2016 de samber 2019 conventional growing media for strawberry cultivation contain at least 80 peat with coir and perlite as the other main ingredients each year 140 000 m³ of peat is used for soilless strawberry cultivation 800 ha representing more than 20 of the peat used for horticulture in belgium the importance of soilless strawberry cultivation and the use of peat in the netherlands is comparable to belgium 1 1 new materials including biochar peat is a main ingredient in growing media but peat extraction has an important environmental impact this has led to a search for alternatives atzori et al 2021 barrett et al 2016 blok et al 2021 especially as peat extraction in the european union will be included in mitigation targets defined in the eu regulation 2018 841 european union 2018 from 2026 onwards potentially reducing the supply of european peat for horticulture hirschler et al 2022 several european countries have developed national or regional strategies to reduce and phase out peat use in horticulture by 2030 hirschler et al 2022 growing media blends based on sustainable and local materials make it possible to reduce or even completely replace non renewable or less sustainable raw materials such as peat stone wool or coir barrett et al 2016 sustainable growing media can also have an added value for plant growth and environment in terms of reduced use of fertilizers and crop protection products owing to the provision of recycled nutrients and increased disease resistance in crops e g madhavi et al 2021 atzori et al 2021 the current linear approach to greenhouse horticulture has heavy environmental impacts related to the input of fossil fuels mineral fertilizers and the energy required to produce mineral slabs a more circular approach could reduce these environmental impacts van tuyll et al 2022 optimization of cultivation practices may lead to increased circularity of nutrients and materials in soilless horticulture massa et al 2020 and may reduce the production costs for growers spent media including any retained nutrients may be either directly reused or used as feedstock for further processing thus extending their use as growing media shuttleworth et al 2021 vandecasteele et al 2020 such practices improve nutrient efficiency and the general sustainability of the soilless cultivation system amery et al 2021 materials in sustainable growing media blends and the cultivation practices applied during the first use of the growing media affect the nutrient retention and other characteristics of spent growing media nutrient retention is an important factor in the feasibility of circular use of spent growing media as excessive nutrient levels may negatively affect the possibility for either direct reuse or use after further processing vandecasteele et al 2020 wood fiber compost and bark products are already regularly used as materials in growing media atzori et al 2021 barrett et al 2016 woznicki et al 2021 composts harbor a diversity of microbes optimize the nitrification process and can act as either a source of nutrients or as a liming agent e g pot et al 2021 vandecasteele et al 2022 the addition of small amounts of biochar to growing media can increase disease suppression e g frenkel et al 2017 while it can also be applied for bulk replacement of peat coir or perlite e g blok et al 2017 chrysargyris et al 2020 lévesque et al 2020 messiga et al 2021 in the latter case biochars may interact with fertigation in different ways amery et al 2021 report that nutrients are released rather than retained when biochars are used as bulk material in fertigated growing media lévesque et al 2020 observed that adding 5 10 or 15 v v biochar in peat based growing media for tomato and pepper cultivation significantly increased n and p uptake efficiency i e the amount of nutrients taken up by the plant relative to the total amount of n or p supplied as fertilizer and retained in the growing medium with subsequently lower n and p losses with the leachate chrysargyris et al 2020 also reported that biochars can act as a source of nutrients during seedling production 1 2 fertilizers and fertigation strategies soilless cultivation systems with drip irrigation or subirrigation require less water and fertilizers in comparison to soil bound cultivation massa et al 2020 soilless cultivation systems based on nutrient supply by fertigation have more flexibility in terms of crop management than supplying nutrients only at the onset of cultivation massa et al 2020 the concentration of the nutrient solution is the dominant factor for the nutrient dynamics and retention in these systems venezia et al 2022 ropokis et al 2021 and the nutrient use efficiency neocleous and savvas 2019 nutrient management in the fertigation is also an important strategy to optimize fruit quality and shelf life for strawberry gallace and lieten 2018 replacement of virgin mineral fertilizer sources with recycled nutrients and or organic fertilizers is also important for increasing circularity ahmed et al 2021 blok et al 2021 renewable materials in growing media may also be a source of nutrients to plants as observed for composts biochars and plant fibers vandecasteele et al 2018 amery et al 2021 nguyen et al 2022 for this reason the supply of additional nutrients during cultivation may need to be optimized based on the blend composition different strategies have been tested for recycling the nutrients retained in spent growing media including direct reuse shuttleworth et al 2021 vandecasteele et al 2020 and use as feedstock for biochar for subsequent application in horticultural substrates amery et al 2021 low decomposition rates and lower n availability were measured in spent growing media while p and k remained highly plant available vandecasteele et al 2020 vollmer et al 2022 1 3 objectives of the study low nutrient retention in the substrate during cultivation increases the feasibility of circular use of growing media the aim of the present study was to assess the effect of growing medium blend and fertigation regime on nutrient export in plants and growing media at the end of cultivation in a closed loop gutter system with drip fertigation four objectives related to peat based and reduced peat substrate used for strawberry production were assessed namely 1 whether the use of peat reduced substrate increased nutrient retention in the substrate 2 what was the relative importance of nutrient retention in the substrate in relation to nutrient export in aboveground biomass at crop termination 3 how the fertigation regime affected nutrient export at crop termination 4 whether addition of wood based biochar to the horticultural substrate increased nutrient retention 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental setup we tested the effect of blend composition e g partial peat replacement with or without 3 10 v v biochar and fertigation concentration in two trials of strawberry cultivation of different durations at the end of cultivation nutrients are either removed from the system via the spent growing media or have been taken up by the vegetative plant parts the impact of fertigation and blend on nutrients was assessed based on crop nutrient uptake and nutrient retention in growing media based on total nutrient content at crop termination net nutrient retention in growing media change during cultivation and changes in nutrient availability in growing media based on extractable concentrations in this context the net nutrient balance is the difference between import of nutrients i e nutrients entering the system with the virgin growing media and export of nutrients from the system at crop termination i e nutrients leaving the system two full scale greenhouse trials with three growing media and two fertigation regimes in a random block design were executed in a closed loop gutter system with drip irrigation in a professional greenhouse growing system at proefcentrum hoogstraten an extension research center located in meerle belgium during the 2020 trial a continued autumn spring cycle 278 days was applied i e an autumn culture of strawberries that started on 19 august 2020 and resumed in spring ending in june 2021 strawberries were grown in a heated glass greenhouse at 5 5 m post height during 10 months representative of a typical highly intensive culture the greenhouse was heated and screens were used for climate control the heating regime started in early october 8 c at night and 17 c during the day until the end of harvest then climate control changed to 8 c at night and 14 c during the day no climate control was applied from early january until 10 february 2021 after which the spring heating regime 8 c at night and 14 c during the day began the 2021 trial was an autumn cultivation 72 days in an unheated plastic vanden heuvel type greenhouse with six meter post height vanden heuvel brecht belgium both trials used the strawberry hybrid fragaria ananassa cultivar elsanta which is a june bearing strawberry i e producing one large crop of fruit each growing season typically in june and is the most widely produced cultivar in flanders belgium white 9 or 8 l trays were used in 2020 and 2021 respectively per tray 6 pre rooted plugs were grown at a plant density of 10 5 plants per m2 greenhouse surface i e 1 ha of greenhouse contains 17 500 trays each tray was filled with an equal volume of substrate and then 6 tray plants are put in each tray each trial had 6 treatments combination of blend and fertigation regime tested with four replicates each replicate had 10 trays and 60 plants resulting in treatments of 22 24 m2 greenhouse surface greenhouse and fertigation management was comparable with current practices in horticulture in belgium and the netherlands 2 2 growing media blends three blends were compared in the trials a conventional peat based blend peat a peat reduced pr and biochar amended peat reduced pr b blend table 1 all blends were produced by agaris gent belgium the conventional peat based blend contained 75 v v peat a mixture of blocked irish and white peat 10 30 mm 15 v v coir chips 8 mm fraction and 10 v v perlite 3 6 mm fraction the peat reduced blend contained 45 v v peat mixture of blocked irish and white peat 10 30 mm 25 v v wood fiber kleeschulte erden gmbh co rüthen germany 15 v v green compost certified green compost from a commercial facility 9 v v coir chips 8 mm fraction and 6 v v perlite 3 6 mm fraction the composition of the peat based and peat reduced blends remained constant for the 2020 and 2021 trials wood fiber and green compost were selected for their high potential for peat replacement and their increasing use in european horticulture atzori et al 2021 barrett et al 2016 green compost was selected based on previous experiences of this material as a source of nutrients atzori et al 2021 vandecasteele et al 2018 and its effect on microbial characteristics of the blend including the stimulation of nitrification vandecasteele et al 2022 a wood based biochar was used in both years table a1 the wood based biochars were produced by the netherlands organisation for applied scientific research tno petten the netherlands using a specific gasification reactor pyromaat reactor under controlled conditions table a1 biochar 1 is based on mixed wood residues from park maintenance and biochar 2 is based on beech wood due to a practical mixing error during production of the blends at pilot scale only 3 biochar v v equivalent to 10 g dm l was included in the blend with biochar in 2020 versus the 10 v v used in 2021 the composition of the 2021 blends with biochar was as follows 41 v v peat mixture of blocked irish and white peat 22 5 v v wood fiber 13 5 v v green compost 10 v v biochar 8 v v coir chips and 5 v v perlite before blending the biochar into the blend it was moistened to a moisture content of 50 dm on fresh weight to allow for better mixing and avoid losses through dust haifa multi mix potting soil 14 16 18 micronutrients fertilizer was added to each blend in a dose of 0 4 g l representing 56 28 and 60 mg l for n p and k respectively the small dose of mineral fertilizer in all blends was applied to avoid differences in nutrient availability between the blends in the first days of the trials lime was added in a dose of 3 0 g l for the peat based blend and 1 8 g l for the peat reduced blend the results of the physical analyses of the substrates table 3 indicate no distinct differences in water or air volume between the blends tested as only small differences between the blends were observed for total pore volume max difference 1 v v shrinkage max difference 3 v v air volume max difference 5 v v and water volume at 10 cm max 4 v v the peat based blend had a higher organic matter content higher water potential lower density and lower dry matter content than the other blends table 3 the wood based biochars were smaller than 5 mm and the main part of the biochar particles was in the 1 2 mm fraction table a1 the biochar used in the 2020 trial had more particles in the 2 5 mm fraction than the beech wood biochar of the 2021 trial 2 3 fertigation regimes and drain water volume water supply was managed at the greenhouse level the fertigation was determined by solar radiation in accordance with local weather conditions i e 200 ml per tray or 3500 l ha supplied in 3 min per 220 joules solar radiation fertigation was controlled by a priva greenhouse climate computer priva de lier the netherlands two pressure compensated kameleon drippers netafim maasdijk the netherlands were provided in each tray each situated in the middle of 4 plants with each dripper providing 100 ml water in 3 min per fertigation event the conventional fertigation regime was compared with a reduced fertigation regime which contained 65 of the standard concentration for n p k mg ca and s and 100 of the standard regime for trace elements the composition of the fertigation solution during the different stages of cultivation is given in table 2 the intended drainage fraction was 20 drain volume relative to the water input through fertigation this drainage volume was reused in a fully closed recirculation system where drainage was mixed with rainwater as follows 30 v v drain water was mixed with 70 v v rain water and nutrients are supplemented to this mixture up to the desired nutrient concentrations the electrical conductivity ec of the collected drain water at greenhouse level was measured biweekly and the nutrient supply was adapted accordingly during the entire cultivation samples of the fertigation solution were collected from two drippers per feeding line the drainage water was collected from 4 trays 2 trays from 2 replicates per treatment ec of fertigation and drainage was monitored weekly chemical composition of fertigation and drainage was checked based on lab analyses a sample of each fertigation regime and a composite sample of the drainage water of each combination of blend and fertigation regime was analyzed for nutrient content at a commercial lab samples were sent on 23 september 2020 21 october 2020 and 14 april 2021 for the 2020 trial and on 11 august 2021 and 09 september 2021 for the 2021 trial ec in these samples was measured based on conductometry p k ca mg were measured in an acidified filtrate with icp aes according to nen 6966 2005 nen 2005 and nh4 n and no3 n were measured in a filtrate with continuous flow spectophotometry according to npr6650 nen 1991 both fertigation composition and drainage composition were monitored continually based on ec fig a1 and were checked based on chemical analyses on specific dates the tested differences in fertigation were confirmed by the ec monitoring and by the lab analyses fig a1 all blends within one fertigation regime received the same fertigation solution and similar ec values were measured for the three blends per fertigation level 2 4 cultivation and fruit harvest for the first trial strawberry was planted on 19 aug 2020 in white 9 l meerle 48 23 11 cm 0 11 m2 trays beekenkamp maasdijk the netherlands the trays were placed next to each other in 23 cm gutters with drain collection with 38 trays in a 19 m gutter at a height of 140 cm with a distance between the gutters of 114 cm on 24 august 2020 the fertigation regime was switched to the harvest regime table 2 after flowering forcing the crop towards the reproductive phase on 1 october 2020 the first fruits were harvested and on 14 december 2020 the first harvest was finished the second harvest spring 2021 started on 9 april 2021 and ended on 24 may 2021 for the second trial strawberry was planted on 14 july 2021 in white 8 l beekenkamp 48 17 16 cm 0 082 m2 trays beekenkamp maasdijk the netherlands the trays were placed next to each other in 17 cm gutters with drain collection with 38 trays in a 19 m gutter on a height of 140 cm and with a distance between the gutters of 120 cm on 10 august 2021 the fertigation regime was switched after flowering as noted above forcing the crop towards the reproductive phase on 24 august 2021 the first fruits were harvested and on 24 september 2021 the last fruits were harvested an overview of each trial is provided in table a2 fruit yield was determined twice weekly by harvesting the ripe strawberries fruits were harvested by trained staff per experimental treatment across the entire trial per experimental unit all 60 plants were used to assess fruit yield 240 plants per treatment to cover the natural variation in yield between plants a standardized mold for round fruits is used to categorize fruit size based on a standard procedure for all trials at pch the fruit size of a strawberry is defined as the maximum diameter of the largest cross section at every harvest the yields per plot were registered and the fruits were registered in the following size categories large 2 a large a small rotten and misshapen fruit large 2 a fruits have a minimum diameter of 35 mm large a fruits have a minimum diameter of 31 mm small fruits have a diameter smaller than 31 mm the yield data kg m² were compared for the first class fruit size 30 mm large 2 a and large a and for the total yield yield data were processed separately for both harvest periods of the 2020 trial the 2021 trial had only one harvest period the two cultivation systems tested in this study reflect the main systems used for soilless strawberry cultivation in belgium the netherlands and greater northwestern europe neri et al 2012 van delm et al 2016 the gutter based system with drain collection is used by almost all growers who apply soilless strawberry cultivation in belgium and the netherlands van delm et al 2016 2 5 sampling of aboveground biomass and growing media per treatment six trays with six plants per tray were sampled at the end of cultivation all remaining fruits were removed before sampling then the vegetative aboveground biomass without remaining fruits was harvested weighed manually cut into 2 cm pieces and a subsample of minimum 175 g fresh material was dried for further processing here we define aboveground biomass as the vegetative aboveground biomass stalks and leaflets of the compound leaves present at the end of the cultivation pre rooted plugs were cut with a knife from the growing medium as these plugs were included at time of planting and the plug thus contained a growing medium blend and nutrients that differed from the tested blends and the nutrients supplied by fertigation spent growing medium is thus defined as the growing medium remaining at the end of the cultivation after removal of the rooted plugs this spent growing medium was weighed and sampled 2 6 chemical composition of plants and growing media sample preparation of growing media for determination of total nutrient content dry matter content moisture content and laboratory compacted bulk density was executed according to en13040 cen 2007a the total porosity air filled porosity and water filled porosity and the shrinkage of the growing media was determined according to en13041 cen 2012 particle size distribution of the biochars was determined according to en15428 cen 2007b leaves and spent growing media were dried at 70 c and ground the material of one tray was considered as one biological replicate total n content determined according to the dumas method en13654 2 cen

ammonium acetate extractable concentrations are considered to be potentially plant available in the growing medium in the longer term assessment of optimal range and nutrient deficiency for foliar composition is based on pritts et al 2015 crop nutrient uptake in the leaves was calculated by multiplying the measured content with the dry mass of leaves 2 7 calculations for these trials comparisons were made for a nutrient contents g kg dm biomass in the aboveground biomass b nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass kg ha i e nutrient content x dm mass of the aboveground biomass per ha c nutrient amount in the spent growing medium kg ha i e nutrient content x dm mass of the spent medium per ha and d ratio between the nutrient amount in the spent growing medium sgm versus the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass ab denoted as the sgm ab ratio the sgm ab ratio expresses the nutrient distribution between two components of the cultivation system in terms of nutrients removed at the end of the cultivation a ratio higher than 1 indicates that the spent growing medium contains more nutrients than the aboveground biomass differences in bulk density between the growing media blends were present due to differences in organic matter content crop nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass and nutrient retention in the spent growing medium were expressed in kg per ha to represent an equal volume of horticultural substrate for the net nutrient balance calculation nutrient import was calculated as the initial nutrient amount in the virgin growing media and nutrient export was the sum of the nutrient export with the sgm and with the aboveground vegetative biomass values for nutrients in sgm and aboveground biomass are average values for six replicates import of nutrients i e nutrients entering the system with the virgin growing media were shown in the figures as positive values while export of nutrients from the system i e nutrients leaving the system at the end of cultivation were shown in the figures as negative values table 3 2 8 statistics data were processed per trial two way anova and tukey s post hoc test was used for factor 1 blend and factor 2 fertigation regime homogeneity of variances was checked using box plots and data normality was checked using qqplots statistica 13 5 statsoft inc hamburg germany 3 results 3 1 fruit yield no interaction between blend and fertigation was observed for the yield for any of the three harvest periods peat reduced blends with or without wood based biochar resulted in the same yield as the peat based blends in both trials table 4 a significant effect of the blend on first class quality fruit yield was only observed for the spring cultivation of the 2020 trial where the peat reduced blend with biochar had a significantly higher yield of first class quality fruits 4 1 kg m2 than for the peat 3 4 kg m2 or peat reduced 3 5 kg m2 blend there was no significant effect of blend on the total yield in any of the trials fertigation had a significant effect on total and first quality size yield for the three periods with 10 17 and 18 28 higher yields for the higher fertigation regime in the 2020 trial for the autumn 4 2 vs 3 8 kg m2 and spring 8 3 vs 6 5 kg m2 cultivation respectively table 4 in contrast to the 2020 trial the higher fertigation regime 2 5 kg m2 resulted in a 10 yield reduction for the 2021 trial compared with the reduced fertigation 2 8 kg m2 in the 2021 trial 3 2 nutrient contents and nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass nutrient contents in relation to fertigation and blend effects in both trials are shown in table a3 for the foliar composition in terms of optimal contents or nutrient deficiency pritts et al 2015 only n contents were below the optimal range in the lower fertigation regime in 2020 values 2 n dm p and k contents in the higher level fertigation regime in the 2021 trial were beyond the optimal range indicating luxury consumption at this level of fertigation in summary the main trends for 2020 were related to fertigation while in 2021 more interaction was observed between fertigation and blend type higher mg contents in the plant biomass for the peat based blend were found in both trials table a3 for both 2020 and 2021 no significant interaction was observed for the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass between factor blend and factor fertigation regime similarly the effect of the blend was not significant for aboveground biomass nor for nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass table 5 the low fertigation regime resulted in significantly lower aboveground biomass and nutrient uptake for all elements in 2020 whereas in 2021 the nutrient uptake was lower for n p and k under the low fertigation regime no additional significant effect of wood based biochar addition was observed in the blend on the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass under the fertigation regimes tested no additional net uptake from the peat reduced blend with mainly the compost as a source of nutrients fig a2 was observed as no differences were noted in the uptake in the aboveground biomass the higher contents in the plant biomass observed for some elements thus did not result in significantly higher uptake in the plants in summary fertigation had the highest effect with significantly lower n p and k uptake for the low fertigation regime in both trials in 2020 this resulted in a significantly lower aboveground biomass for the lower fertigation regime but not in 2021 3 3 nutrients in the spent growing medium the fertigation regimes resulted in more significant differences in 2020 than in 2021 table 6 in contrast only a limited number of cases showed an effect of blend composition on residual nutrient amounts in general residual p and k amount is clearly lower for the trial in 2020 p 13 k 25 kg ha than for 2021 p 20 k 45 kg ha the c related characteristics of growing media are important in terms of the microbiology in the rhizosphere but also affect the reuse options e g more c lower dry bulk density or the value of spent growing media as soil improver for the amount of c kg ha both the peat reduced blends were higher than for peat in 2020 while in 2021 the biochar amended peat reduced blend had a significantly higher amount of c per ha than the other blends table 6 wood based biochar resulted in an intermediate c n ratio in both trials and in an intermediate c p ratio in 2021 in comparison with the peat blend and the peat reduced blend in summary there was a large effect of the blend on the amount of nutrients in the spent growing media related to the initial amount of nutrients in the virgin blend biochar dose in both experiments had a rather small impact on the total amount of nutrients in the sgm within the 2021 trial with the higher biochar dose only the blend with biochar showed higher values for c c n and c p 3 4 ratio between the nutrients in the spent growing medium versus nutrients in the aboveground biomass values for the ratio sgm ab 1 indicate that nutrient retention in the substrate is more important than nutrient uptake the aboveground biomass a high sgm ab ratio may indicate more potential to reduce the fertigation for this element values for the sgm ab ratio 1 indicate that if the substrate is simply reused during a new cultivation cycle the amount of nutrients present in sgm will not be sufficient to cover the nutrient demand for this cultivation no significant interaction between blend and fertigation was observed for the sgm ab ratio for any of the elements in both years table 7 the effect of blend was significant for all elements in both years for the sgm ab ratio for p mg and ca there is no significant effect of fertigation in both years fertigation only had a significant effect for the sgm ab ratio of n in the 2020 trial and for the ratio of k in the 2021 trial in 2021 the sgm ab ratio for k was significantly higher for the higher fertigation while in 2020 the ratio for n was significantly lower at the higher fertigation rate biochar had no effect on the sgm ab ratio for any of the elements in both years in summary the ratio between the amount of nutrients in the spent growing medium versus the amount of nutrients in the aboveground biomass ranged between 1 9 and 7 5 for ca mg and n the spent medium is thus the main compartment for these elements this sgm ab ratio was always lower than 0 7 for k pointing to the aboveground biomass as the main compartment for k the sgm ab ratio for p was 0 7 for the peat based blends and 1 5 or higher for the other blends pointing to a blend specific effect on the p distribution for the 2020 trial approximately 1 3rd of the total amount of n 30 mg 34 and ca 29 supplied with fertigation ended up in the aboveground biomass versus 1 5th for p 20 and k 22 there was a very low net retention in the spent growing media of n p and k of max 5 of the total amount of n p and k supplied with the fertigation versus a high retention of ca 48 and mg 51 3 5 net evolution of total and available nutrient content before vs after cultivation the initial amount of nutrients in the peat reduced blend is clearly higher than for the peat blend fig 1 the higher nutrient contents in the virgin peat reduced blends are mainly related to the green compost as a source of nutrients fig a2 although only 15 v v of green compost is used it contributes to more than 70 of the p k ca and mg in the peat reduced blend and more than 50 v v of the n at the doses provided in this experiment the effect of the wood based biochar amendment on the n p ca and mg contents in the virgin growing media was limited fig a2 a clear increase in the k content of the blend with 10 v v biochar was noted with biochar representing 27 of the k in this blend fig a2 the mineral fertilizer was a more important source of p and k in the peat reduced blend than peat or coir in the case of peat reduced growing media more nutrients entered the system with the virgin growing medium k and p were removed during cultivation while a clear retention of ca and mg was observed fig a4 for the peat reduced blends in 2020 we observed an average decrease in the growing medium during cultivation of 42 kg k and 6 kg p ha no net increase in n and an increase of 31 kg ca and 10 kg mg ha for 2021 the values are clearly higher i e an average decrease of 17 kg k no net increase in p and an increase of 76 kg ca 74 kg n and 21 kg mg ha for the peat reduced blends for the peat based blends during cultivation the main observed trends in the growing medium were an increase of 89 kg ca and 23 kg mg ha the observations for the nutrient contents are confirmed by the ammonium acetate extractable concentrations fig a3 ammonium acetate extractable p was clearly lower at the end of the cultivation than in the initial blend with overall lower values for the reduced fertigation regime for k the same trend was observed for the peat reduced blends but the decrease in available k was smaller for the peat blends for available ca the concentrations in the 2020 trial were higher for the full fertigation regime than for the initial blend and for the reduced fertigation regime while concentrations remained constant for the 2021 trial we conclude from these data that for the peat reduced blends p and k availability were clearly lower at the end of the cultivation than in the initial blend and were lower for the lower fertigation regime fig a3 the decrease in k and p availability was confirmed by the net decrease in total contents for these elements 3 6 effect of fertigation on nutrient export at crop termination to assess the relevance of fertigation on the residual nutrient contents in the spent growing media the data for the four peat based and eight peat reduced blends in the trials in this paper were compared with data for 13 peat based and 13 peat reduced or peat free blends from other trials and or other growers the data in these box plots fig 2 illustrate that for n ca and mg the contents in the samples of the trials in this manuscript are comparable with contents measured in other studies which indicates only limited potential for reducing the retention of n ca and mg in the spent growing media in contrast the k and p contents in the samples of the trials in this manuscript are clearly lower compared with the other data sets with the p and k contents being on average 3 and 2 times lower respectively in the reported trials than for the other samples mainly for p and k there is potential to reduce retention in spent growing media and the p and k retention in the trials reported here is limited compared with other trials this may explain why a further reduction in nutrient supply with fertigation resulted in less retention in the aboveground biomass but did not decrease the retention in the spent growing medium combined with the knowledge on the distribution between aboveground biomass and spent growing media this means that there is more potential for managing the retention for p and k than for n ca and mg in soilless strawberry cultivation this may change however if fertigation with chemical fertilizers would be partly replaced by organic fertilizers in the growing media 4 discussion 4 1 effect of blend composition on nutrient retention and nutrient balance nutrients were supplied by fertigation and with the virgin growing media blend the nutrients initially available in the virgin growing medium are a buffer for the crop whenever there is a shortage in the nutrient supply through fertigation vandecasteele et al 2018 from the viewpoint of circularity the residual nutrient content of spent growing media is one of the aspects that determines to what extent these spent growing media could be re used for another crop cycle ideally the nutrient content in the substrate is lower after the first cultivation as it shows that the nutrients have been taken up by the plants and valorized in the cropping system the higher the nutrient retention during cultivation the more complex the scenario for reuse of the growing media becomes as high nutrient levels may result in the need for an adapted fertilizer need during reuse vandecasteele et al 2020 spent growing media with higher residual nutrient contents may be used at lower v v in new blends or may be used as organic fertilizer vollmer et al 2022 while a lower nutrient content may allow spent growing media to be reused as stand alone material average yields for unheated and heated greenhouses in belgium are 3 6 and 5 5 kg m2 respectively de samber 2019 the yield in the 2020 trial is clearly higher than these average values the 2021 trial had a lower yield but this was a short cultivation in comparison with the 2020 trial all three blends performed well in regard to nutrient content after first cultivation the composition of the blend did not affect nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass except for a small but significant effect for mg in the 2021 trial no negative effects of peat replacement in the blends on yield were observed and the peat reduced blend with biochar even resulted in a significantly higher yield in the continued culture in spring for the 2020 trial the new blends with or without biochar did not negatively affect yield due to possible differences in aeration drainage or other characteristics of the blend there were no distinct differences in water or air volume between the blends tested table 3 the new blends had lower amounts of perlite but contained wood fiber which is also known for its aeration properties durand et al 2021 while results of lévesque et al 2020 previously indicated that biochar can act as replacement for perlite at the end of the cultivation the peat reduced blends had higher nutrient contents in comparison to the peat based blends however when taking the initial nutrient content of the blends into account the net balance indicates that the peat reduced blends are a source of k and to a lesser extent p during cultivation rather than being a sink peat reduced blends acted as a source of k in both trials and were a source of p in the continued autumn spring cycle in the 2021 trial only n retention was noted in the peat reduced blend these differences between nutrients and blends is the result of nutrient specific interaction with the cation exchange capacity of the growing medium as well as retention of part of the nutrients in the spent growing medium within the roots this is a topic for future research both blends showed an increase during cultivation in ca and mg content while no real change was observed for n content a decrease in k content of the peat reduced blends was observed during cultivation in contrast with the peat based blends which remained more or less stable in addition a clear decrease in plant available p and k was found in the substrate due to cultivation part of the nutrients in the spent growing medium are contained in the roots it is estimated that roots may take up to 5 of the mass of the growing medium massetani et al 2017 sharma et al 2018 the decrease in k content is due to either leaching of k during fertigation and or plant uptake the observed decrease for k content during cultivation on the peat free blend confirms a previous leaching experiment with spent growing media where a high leaching rate and thus higher availability for k than for p was observed vandecasteele et al 2020 more research is needed to detect whether k is taken up by the plants is leached with the drain water or a combination of both the observed effects for k can be related to differences with ca mg n or p in a nutrient binding and cation exchange with the growing medium or b nutrient availability in the plant roots this is a topic for future research 4 2 nutrient export with the aboveground biomass in terms of nutrient efficiency the lower the nutrient contents in the crop residues and in the spent growing media the better nutrients leaving the soilless cultivation system with these 2 compartments however have a clear lower limit below which they cannot fall any further as they are clearly linked to the nutrients taken up by the fruits nutrients leaving the system with the fruits should be benchmarked in relation to optimal yield and nutritional quality of the fruits nutrients left in the vegetative plant parts should be benchmarked in relation to optimal nutrient needs for vegetative growth and fruit development versus signs of luxury consumptions of elements on average 70 kg n 70 kg k 50 kg ca 12 kg mg and 9 kg p was exported per ha greenhouse with the 11 7 tonnes of fresh aboveground vegetative biomass dm content of 24 when this aboveground biomass is collected separately this results in a material with a nutrient profile and n p k ratio different from that of the spent growing medium including a difference in stability among others vandecasteele et al 2020 results of van tuyll et al 2022 show that there is a good potential for recovering minerals from non fruit biomass from greenhouse grown tomato as over half of the supplied mg ca and s ends up in vegetative parts at 58 70 and 70 respectively the nutrients in the spent substrates may have the lowest expected limit for residual nutrients as only a limited part of it consists of plant roots that are essential for plant growth based on the ratio between the nutrient retention in the spent growing medium versus the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass it is concluded that the spent growing medium is an important accumulator for ca mg n p but not for k however on average 114 kg n 18 kg k 163 kg ca 32 kg mg and 6 kg p was exported per ha greenhouse with the 43 tonnes freshly spent peat based growing medium dm content of 22 depending on the processing inclusion of the aboveground biomass when processing the spent growing media may provide added value for composting a combination of the two is required to ensure the optimal ratio between green nutrient rich materials versus the growing media as bulking agent for direct reuse inclusion of the aboveground biomass will clearly increase the p and k content of the spent growing medium which may result in a need for a changed fertilizer application for the next cultivation cycle vandecasteele et al 2020 it can also increase the ratio between k versus ca and mg based on the data for the 2020 trial including the plant biomass during reuse or recycling would result in an increase of the p content by 80 as well as a fourfold increase in k content for the peat reduced blend a strong effect of length of the cultivation on the nutrient contents in the spent growing medium was found the ratio was higher for 2021 than for 2020 indicating that longer trials result in stronger nutrient uptake from the growing medium and thus less nutrient retention than for shorter trials the amount of fruit harvested was five times higher for the 2020 trial than for the 2021 trial the related higher nutrient uptake and export by the fruits may explain the lower nutrient contents in the growing medium after cultivation for the 2020 trial 4 3 effect of fertigation regime on the nutrient balance the impact of the fertigation regime was assessed based on the effect on the yield versus the effect on the nutrient export at the end of cultivation a significant effect of fertigation regime on nutrients in both components was observed which resulted in lower nutrient export the reduced fertigation regime did not result in lower nutrient export with the spent growing media however the reduction was mainly found in the export with the aboveground biomass there is an element specific impact of fertigation and an effect of the initial composition of the growing medium blend on the nutrient distribution and nutrient export with aboveground biomass and with the sgm reducing the fertigation regime for these elements by 35 only resulted in a reduction of less than 20 in 2020 and 10 in 2021 in the amount of n ca and mg in the sgm for p the reduction in the amount of p in the sgm was 21 in both years the conventional fertigation regime still contains a buffer without resulting in a high risk of nutrient retention and too high nutrient export the lower fertigation level decreased the yield in the 2020 trial indicating shortage in nutrients for the crop while increasing the yield in the 2021 trial the aboveground biomass at the end of cultivation was comparable for both trials the decrease in plant available p and k in the growing medium during cultivation for both trials was more pronounced for the lower fertigation regime than for the conventional fertigation regime the decrease in p and k in the aboveground biomass under the lower fertigation regime for both trials was more pronounced than the decrease in p and k exported with the spent peat reduced media based on these observations and the low residual p and k contents compared with spent media from other strawberry trials or growers no change of the fertigation regime is needed as no net retention during cultivation in the substrate is observed for the higher versus the lower fertigation regime future research should also focus on negative or positive effects of the retention of ca and mg in the growing media during cultivation in case the growing media are reused as the ca k ratio affects fruit quality and shelf life in strawberries gallace and lieten 2018 element specific reduction of the concentrations in the fertigation are an alternative to reduction of all elements as tested here and may help to avoid imbalances between k and ca mg this may be achieved by adapting the nutrient solution based on regular analysis of root solution composition during cultivation voogt and bar yosef 2019 future research should thus also consider to what extent such adaptations could reduce the nutrient load of the growing medium at the end of production 4 4 effect of biochar in the blend on nutrient retention and nutrient balance the dose of wood based biochar applied in the 2021 trial was comparable to the majority of other studies that have tested 5 20 v v bulk replacement of peat blok et al 2017 chrysargyris et al 2020 lévesque et al 2020 messiga et al 2021 the biochars in this study can be characterized as wood based biochars with high c contents and low nutrient levels both biochars had comparable total n ca and mg contents the first biochar was richer in p while the second was richer in k the use of different doses of biochar in the two trials with a specific nutrient profile and particle size distribution did not strongly affect the physical properties nor the total nutrient content of the virgin blend due to the comparable nutrient profile of the biochar versus the bulk blend amending the biochar did not change the nutrient content of the virgin blend except for k in the 2021 trial and no additional value of the biochar as fertilizer was found in other setups where biochars were specifically tested as fertilizers in growing media e g amery et al 2021 chrysargyris et al 2020 the biochars had been mixed in peat and the biochar had a higher nutrient concentration than that of peat in the experiments reported here the wood based biochars had a comparable nutrient content as the peat reduced blends thus reducing the effect on the nutrient budget no negative effects of peat replacement by different materials including biochar were observed no contrasting effects between trials were observed for the peat reduced blends with biochar despite the variability in biochar type and dose which indicates that effects of wood based biochar are similar over a broad range of application doses and within a range of particle size distributions biochar amendment had more effect on the c related parameters than on the nutrient content of the spent growing media biochar addition 3 10 v v resulted in a higher c n ratio in both trials and a higher c p ratio in the 2021 trial for the 2021 trial with the higher dose of biochar the spent growing media with biochar had a higher value as soil improver than the peat reduced blends without biochar due to higher c c n and c p values in soilless cultivation biochars are exposed to the nutrients in the fertigation during a longer period this may change the mode of action of the biochars jaiswal et al 2018 proposed pre conditioning of the biochar i e exposing the biochar in the growing medium to pre planting fertigation as a successful strategy to enhance the indigenous microbial community structure and activity in the growing medium this pre conditioning results in improved efficacy of biochar with better plant performance and better suppression of soil borne diseases jaiswal et al 2018 the first use of biochar blended materials as growing medium can be considered a preconditioning as well with the potential for beneficial effects during the reuse of the spent growing media including the positive effects of a nutrient rich organic coating on the biochar hagemann et al 2017 formed during the first use conversion of spent growing media into biochar results in biochars enriched in nutrients in comparison with wood based biochars amery et al 2021 lataf et al 2022 which can be seen as a variant of spiking the biomass with minerals before pyrolysis as proposed by buss et al 2022 5 conclusions the creation of new blends based on renewable materials is the next step towards a more sustainable soilless horticulture peat reduced blends with or without wood based biochar showed comparable performance to peat blends in terms of yield and crop growth fertigation rather than blend composition was the dominant factor for the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass while the nutrient content in the spent growing medium was affected by both factors fertigation management had a higher potential for reducing p and k retention in spent growing media than for n ca and mg the ratio between the nutrients in the spent growing medium versus the nutrient uptake in the aboveground biomass at crop termination was applied to assess the importance of nutrients in these compartments ratios for ca mg and n ranged between 1 9 and 7 5 indicating the spent medium as the main accumulator for these elements the ratio for k was always lower than 0 7 indicating that the aboveground biomass was the main k accumulator the ratio for p was 0 7 for the peat based blends and 1 5 or higher for the other blends suggesting a blend specific effect on the p distribution a straightforward effect for the type of blend for all elements was found in both trials with peat based blends being less important for nutrient retention in the growing medium at crop termination in comparison with the other blends cultivation resulted in a decrease in total content and available concentrations of p and k in the peat reduced blends indicating active nutrient uptake from the blend either by the crop or through leaching from these results we conclude that the peat reduced substrate is a source of k rather than a sink the lower k and p contents in the spent growing medium compared with the virgin blend is advantageous for reuse under the same cultivation conditions when the spent peat reduced medium is recycled without the aboveground crop residues including the aboveground biomass in a reuse scenario will have a strong impact as it results in higher nutrient contents when corrections in nutrient supply are implemented during cultivation based on crop monitoring there may be even a higher potential for depleting the growing medium before the end of cultivation and for increased yields on alternative growing media declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

8928,a risk based approach is more meaningful to quantify the effects of drought on crop yield given the randomness nature of past drought events compared to the deterministic approach however the majority of these probabilistic studies are conducted at national or global scale to assess the yield loss probability under given drought conditions there is still a lack of research combining droughts and crop yields in a probabilistic way at a local scale moreover it is unclear how drought threshold triggering yield loss at a given conditional probability will vary in dryland cropping regions here we used wheat yield data from 66 shires in new south wales nsw wheat belt and meteorological data from 986 weather stations a copula based probabilistic method was developed to explore the yield loss probability to various drought conditions we investigated the drought threshold under a given yield loss probability using the constructed copula function we found that spei 6 in october was the optimal drought index to represent detrended wheat yield variation as this period covered the main growth stages of winter wheat in the study region our results show that as the severity of drought increased the wheat yield loss probability also increased yield loss probability varied among the study shires mainly due to the various climate conditions of each region the drought threshold in subregion 1 the northwest was highest followed by subregion 2 the southwest and subregion 3 the eastern indicating that wheat yield in subregion 1 was more sensitive to drought the findings could provide important direction and benchmarks for stakeholders in evaluating the agricultural impact of drought especially in those drought prone areas we expect that the methodological framework developed here can be extended to other dryland areas to provide helpful information to growers risk management policy makers and agricultural insurance evaluators graphical abstract ga1 keywords wheat yield drought index copula based function yield loss probability drought threshold data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction climate variability can cause various natural hazards loukas et al 2008 sun et al 2023 yin et al 2022 with drought being one of the most common hazards around the world chiang et al 2021 christian et al 2021 meza et al 2021 drought can lead to several negative effects on ecosystem including but not limited to carbon and water cycle hoover et al 2022 yang et al 2016 vegetation growth ding et al 2020b he et al 2022 and water resources chang et al 2019 li et al 2022b one of the most relevant to human society is the negative impact on crop production which has become a very serious issue especially in those regions and countries where crop is vulnerable to drought araneda cabrera et al 2021 deb et al 2022 li et al 2021 for example global yields of wheat and maize can be reduced by 40 and 21 respectively when the water availability ratio was reduced to 50 caused by drought events daryanto et al 2016 different drought conditions cause varied magnitudes of yield loss to quantify the effects of the various drought conditions drought index such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei has been developed and implemented to quantify drought characteristics spi is the most commonly used meteorological drought index as it is easy to compute with only precipitation data it was used as the standard to compare with other indices soˇláková et al 2014 szalai and szinell 2000 additionally spei proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 was widely used because it adopts a similar mechanism theory to the spi and takes potential evapotranspiration pet into account to provide a more realistic description of the water variability in the study area wang et al 2015b assessed the change of long term 1961 2012 drought severity in china with spi and spei they found that spi spei was able to characterize the evolution of the wet and dry conditions of the study region haile et al 2020 analysed drought pattern on monthly seasonal and interannual basis with spei at various timescales in the greater horn of africa the results showed that drought was more frequent and persistent in sudan and tanzania but more severe in somalia ethiopia and kenya the characteristics of the effects of droughts on crop yield can be captured by the drought index araneda cabrera et al 2021 mokhtar et al 2022 but the suitability of spi and spei was highly dependent on the study area and crop types for example chen et al 2020b compared the relationship between multiple drought indices and crop yield at different time scales they found that the reliability of yield variation analysis was influenced by the choice of drought indices and time scales labudová et al 2017 investigated the correlation between dry wet conditions and crop yields in danubian lowland and the east slovakian lowland with spi and spei they found that the spei had a higher correlation with yield fluctuations for most crops than spi except potato thus it is important to identify the optimal drought index at different time scales to evaluate the effects of drought on crop yield in a given study area kamali et al 2022 prodhan et al 2022 both statistical models and process based crop models have been widely used to evaluate the effects of drought events on crop yield for example zhang et al 2019 used ceres maize model based on risk assessment theory to construct a dynamical drought risk assessment model for maize and analysed the drought impacts on maize yield in north eastern china they found that the hazard level caused by drought varied in the different growth stages of maize in iran zarei et al 2019 tested the r 2 coefficients between several climate indices and wheat yield loss simulated by aquacrop model they found that selecting optimal index to assess climate change impacts on crop yield was required in different regions as we all know process based crop models use the parameters calibrated in a few locations to simulate crop yield at a large area however this approach introduces uncertainties when they are applied beyond locations regions where they are originally developed leng 2021 moreover statistical models are used to study the impacts of droughts on crop yields by fitting a linear or non linear relationships between long term historical yield and observed climate variables kamali et al 2015 wambua 2019 the advantage of such empirical analysis is to provide the overall sensitivity of yield response to drought given its simplicity and less computation cost recently a risk based approach is more meaningful to study the effects of drought on crop yield given the randomness nature of drought events feng and hao 2020 ribeiro et al 2019a as one of probability based statistical approaches copula function is getting more widely used because of its capability of linking several variables to obtain their joint probabilities sklar 1973 copula can establish the joint distribution function of variables via combining the marginal distribution functions of different variables patton 2012 poonia et al 2021 integrated with the conditional probability theory copula enables estimating the probability of crop yield loss under various drought scenarios it can provide more valuable information to the practitioners when designing agricultural risk policies compared to the deterministic approach liu et al 2022 ribeiro et al 2019a australia is a significant player in the global grain trade and has been a major exporter of wheat for several years grundy et al 2016 zeleke and nendel 2016 the new south wales nsw wheat belt is the main wheat production area of australia accounting for 27 of the national production www abares gov au 2013 14 however the wheat in this region is grown under rainfed conditions and its yield is highly variable due to great climate variability almost half of the total production variation was caused by inter annual variability of precipitation and temperature in south eastern australia ray et al 2015 waha et al 2022 the recent 2018 drought in nsw resulted in local crop yields being about 53 lower than the 20 year average 1999 2018 steve et al 2018 numerous studies investigated the impacts of historical climate variations on agricultural production in australia feng et al 2018 potgieter et al 2013 wang et al 2015a but the majority of their conclusions are based on deterministic approaches which are unable to provide any risk assessment information nevertheless madadgar et al 2017 used copula functions to investigate drought impacts on five main crops at a national scale in australia the use of copula based probabilistic approach to assess the probability of yield loss under given drought conditions has not been investigated at a local scale in australia godfrey et al 2022 furthermore it is not clear how drought threshold triggering yield loss at a given conditional probability will vary with different regions in australian dryland cropping areas liu et al 2022 here we used a copula based probabilistic method to explore the potential response of yield loss to various drought conditions in nsw wheat belt of south eastern australia based on long term historical observed wheat yield and climate data for 66 shires we aim to 1 identify the optimum drought index within the wheat growing season determining yield variation in the nsw wheat belt 2 select marginal distribution function and establish the copula based joint distribution function to quantify the probability of yield loss under different drought conditions for each shire and 3 identify drought threshold triggering yield loss at a given conditional probability in the study region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources the nsw wheat belt 141 0 152 0 e 28 5 36 1 s is located in the south eastern australia and covers an area of 360 000 km2 liu et al 2014 the large parts of the nsw wheat belt are characterized by mediterranean climate with a large interannual variation of precipitation the western part of the nsw belt is warm and dry while in contrast the eastern part is cold and wet feng et al 2018 the annual mean amount of precipitation varies from 200 mm in southwest to 1000 mm in southeast while the annual mean temperature decreases from 20 c in the northwest part to 11 c towards the southeast part feng et al 2019a there are 66 shires in the nsw wheat belt where the harvest area of wheat was nearly double up from 2123 to 3800 kha and the production increased almost four times from 3432 kt to 13 110 kt during the last several decades abares https www agriculture gov au in our study the wheat growing region was separated into three sub areas based on climatic conditions fig 1 wang et al 2015a we selected six shires to represent the specific climatic characteristics of each region and then these shires were used to demonstrate the probabilistic analysis at a shire scale coonabarabbran cb and moree plains mp are relatively warm wakool wk and narromine nm are relatively dry nundle nd and gundagai gd are relatively cool and wet sites we used the historical climate data including daily precipitation p maximum and minimum temperature tmax and tmin which were extracted from silo patched point dataset jeffrey et al 2001 we obtained the annual wheat yield data of 66 shires from fitzsimmons 2001 the principal characteristics of all shires in the entire study region are summarized in supplementary table s1 2 2 yield detrend the nsw wheat yield has experienced a significant increase in recent decades as a result of improvements in agricultural management and technology wang et al 2015a the non climatic factor should be removed before quantifying the drought impact on the wheat yield first difference fd has been widely used to remove the influence of non climatic factors tao et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 by calculating the difference of crop yield between two successive year wang et al 2015a 1 yield yield i yield i 1 where yield is the first difference of wheat yield i e detrended yield yield i is the original yield for the ith year yield i 1 is the original yield for the i 1 th year i starts from 1923 or 1961 in this study to ensure a comprehensive analysis and minimize biases caused by relying on a single detrend method three additional detrended methods including centre moving average cma li et al 2022c lu et al 2017 hodrick prescott hp filter cheng and yin 2021 harvey and trimbur 2008 and holt exponential smoothing hes holt 2004 li 2013 were taken into consideration in our study these alternative methods were employed to compare the detrended yield and provide a more robust understanding of the yield data the specific equations and compared results of these three methods are listed in the supplementary materials 2 3 drought index we used spi and spei to investigate the impact of drought conditions on wheat yield variation the spi transforms the fitted distribution of precipitation record into a normal distribution with equiprobability transformation and then zero is set as the mean value therefore the values above or below zero represent the wet and dry conditions respectively mckee et al 1993 zargar et al 2011 also we adopted this process into the construction of spei however we used the water balance instead of precipitation because it is the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet to fit distribution vicente serrano et al 2010 we selected the thornthwaite model thornthwaite 1948 to obtain the pet since the calculation procedure was simple and only mean temperature data was needed as wheat growing season was april to november the 3 month jul sep aug oct and sep nov and 6 month apr sep may oct and jun nov scales were used to calculate spi and spei for example spi 3 sep is the 3 month scale jul sep in september spi 6 sep is the 6 month scale apr sep in september the classification of the two drought indices is shown in the table 1 mckee et al 1993 2 4 optimal index selection we used the kendall tau correlation coefficient to select the drought index bonett and wright 2000 croux and dehon 2010 we selected the index that had the highest tau value with detrended yield as the optimal drought index di o to reflect the impacts of drought on yield variation and then we used this index to estimate the yield loss probabilities with the conditional values that represent the different drought severities the tau coefficients calculated by the following equation temizhan et al 2022 2 τ n concordant n discordant n n 1 2 where n concordant is the number of concordant pairs of drought index and detrended yield n discordant is the number of discordant pairs n is the number of pairs 2 5 probabilistic estimation of drought impacts on yield loss 2 5 1 copula copula function initially proposed by sklar 1973 is able to obtain the joint distribution by connecting the marginal distribution of any two or more variables depending on their correlation levels it was previously used to estimate financial risk issues copula function is becoming more popular in the climatic hazards risk modelling due to less limitation on dependence of marginal functions and simplicity in construction won et al 2020 zhang and jiang 2019 a detailed description of copula can be obtained in nelsen 2007 here we used a 2 dimensional copula function to model the joint distribution of drought index x and detrended yield y as shown in eq 3 3 f x y x y c f x x f y y where f is the marginal distributions of related variables c is the cumulative distribution function of copula there are numerous copula functions that enable the description of the joint probability dependence and relationships between univariate variables under extreme situations nelsen 2007 we compared six commonly used copula functions including gaussian t clayton gumbel frank and joe table 2 and fitted these functions in each shire we used the akaike information criterion aic as the selection standard in the marginal distribution and copula fitting sakamoto et al 1986 the smaller the aic value showed the better fitting result prior to the construction of copula function the distribution of variables needs to be fitted we used normal distribution to fit drought index because spi and spei conformed to the normal distribution according to their principle additionally the normal logistic and uniform distributions table 3 were used to fit the detrended yield for each shire 2 5 2 estimating conditional yield loss probability under different drought conditions based on the copula joint distribution the conditional probability of yield loss under drought and non drought conditions were estimated by eqs 4 and 5 respectively ribeiro et al 2019b we used different levels of drought severity i e x 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 as the different conditional values of di o we set the conditional value of yield to 0 5 i e y 0 5 which represented the average yield loss 4 p y y x x p x x y y p x x c f x x f y y f x x 5 p y y x x f y y c f x x f y y 1 f x x where p is the probability under specific conditions c and f are the copula and marginal distributions x and y represent the value of di o and yield respectively x and y are conditional values of x and y respectively 2 5 3 identifying drought threshold note that when the conditional value of yield is determined the yield loss probability increases consistently with more severe drought here we set the probability of yield loss yield 0 5 as 80 to obtain the corresponding drought severity as shown in eq 6 the specific derived value of di o is the drought threshold dt that causes the corresponding yield loss for each shire li et al 2022a 6 p yield 0 5 di o dt 80 fig 2 shows our brief framework we used the r package of spei to calculate the spi and spei beguería et al 2017 vinecopula was used to calculate the joint and conditional probability schepsmeier et al 2015 and ggplot2 was used to make the figures wickham 2016 3 results 3 1 correlation between wheat yield variation and drought index fig 3a shows the tau correlation coefficient τ between yield and 3 6 month spi spei across 66 shires the average τ value of 3 month spi had a largest value in september 0 26 while that of 6 month scale spi was highest in october 0 30 fig 3a we found similar results for spei also we found that regardless of the time scale the correlation between spei and yield was slightly higher than spi in most months we selected spei 6 in october as the optimal drought index hereinafter referred to as di o capturing wheat yield variation in the study area moreover we found that spei 6 in october was significantly correlated with detrended yield calculated by other three methods fig s1 s3 the spatial distribution of the correlation between di o and yield within the wheat belt is shown in fig 3b with p values less than 0 05 for 62 shires we did not consider four shires due to non significant relation between drought index and yield variation moreover the τ values were higher in the central and western regions than in other parts of the belt 3 2 marginal distribution and copula selection table 4 shows the aic values of the three distribution functions fitted for each shire the bold number was the minimum aic among the three distribution functions with the corresponding distribution being the optimal function the distribution function of yield for most shires was logistic and only a few shires were suitable for the normal distribution once the optimal distribution function of yield was determined we selected the optimal joint distribution function of yield and di o for each shire from the six alternative copula functions fig 4a depicts the spatial distribution of the optimal copula function in the wheat belt we found that clayton was suitable for most shires with a few shires being suitable for other copula functions of frank gaussian and t function additionally similar results were illustrated for other detrended methods fig s4 s6 note that none of our shires were suitable for joe and gumbel copula functions see table 2 the spatial distribution of aic values corresponding to the optimal copula function for each shire showed that the central and southern regions had a slightly lower aic compared to the other regions fig 4b 3 3 the probability of yield loss under different drought conditions we exemplified the conditional probability density values of yield at given di o values red shadow to compare with their pair wise observed values black dots for selected six shires fig 5 the probability density values were normalized into an interval of 0 1 to eliminate the differences in numerical scales of these shires most of observed values were located in the red shadow indicating that the simulated values based on copula function were able to describe the relationship of yield and di o fig 6 shows the conditional probability of yield loss under drought di o 0 5 and non drought di o 0 5 conditions at six selected representative shires the yellow percentage in the figure represents the non exceedance conditional probability of yield loss yield 0 5 under the drought condition while the green percent represents the probability under the non drought condition the conditional probability of yield loss under the drought condition was much greater than that under the non drought condition indicating that drought was more likely to cause yield loss the probability value for nd in region 3 was smallest with only 35 if only considering the probability of yield loss that occurred under drought condition the drought conditional probability at nm in region 2 was highest with 53 3 under the non drought condition the probability of yield loss was 13 7 and 13 at nd and hb respectively which was higher than other shires this might be due to the higher rainfall in these two shires thus the probability of yield loss caused by non drought factors like such as waterlogging was higher than that in other shires it is notable that yield loss probability under non drought condition was only 4 4 for wk as it was the driest in six selected shires fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of yield loss probability across the wheat belt under different drought severities in general the loss probability of yield increased as the increase of drought severity for example the average probability of yield loss was 50 1 when di o was less than 0 5 but the probability of yield loss increased to 88 6 under severer drought conditions di o 1 5 we also calculated the yield loss probability due to different drought severities for each region fig 8 generally under drought condition the yield loss probabilities in all three regions tended to increase as drought severity increased the yield loss probability was lowest in region 3 indicating that it was less affected by drought compared to other two regions the yield loss probability was close higher than 75 for region 1 and region 2 when moderate and severe drought occurred the results based on other three detrended methods of cma hp and hes also showed that yield loss probability in region 3 was lowest compared to other two regions fig s16 s18 the drought threshold for each region and shire was shown in fig 9 we found that averaged drought threshold value increased from region 3 2 18 to region 1 1 62 fig 9a also dt in the shires of western nsw wheat belt had higher values than those shires in eastern australia fig 9b these results indicated that the wheat yield in northwest region was more sensitive to drought than that in eastern high rainfall region other detrended methods illustrated similar distribution of dt except the cma method specifically cma method showed that the averaged drought threshold of region 2 was slightly higher than region 1 fig s19a 4 discussion we firstly investigated the relationship between the detrended yield and drought index then we established the joint probability model to estimate the yield loss risk under various drought severities based on the conditional probability theory moreover we derived the drought thresholds triggering same level of yield loss for each shire as far as we know our study represents the first instance of utilizing a copula based method to conduct a probabilistic assessment of the impact of drought events on wheat yields in australia at a local scale shire level additionally our study also quantifies the specific drought thresholds that trigger yield loss we expect our method could be used in other major rainfed cropping regions around the world where crops often suffer from drought stress previous studies have emphasized the characteristics between crop yield and drought indices with different time scales hunt et al 2014 zipper et al 2016 our study provided further evidence for example we found that among all four detrended methods the 6 month spei in october exhibited the strongest correlation with the variability of detrended wheat yield across the wheat belt region in nsw these findings are consistent with results from previous studies for example peña gallardo et al 2019 analysed the response of several crop yields to different time scales of drought indices in the u s and they found that a high correlation occurs between winter wheat yield and 6 month spei usually wheat is sowed in may and harvested in november in the australian wheat belt and thus the 6 month scale covers the most growth periods of wheat therefore the climatic change during this period could better explain the variability of wheat yield than 3 month index however the correlation between spei and detrended yield is only slightly better than that of spi fig 3 indicating that the sensitivity of drought index to capture yield variation is not significantly improved by taking pet into account this is likely due to the equation used to estimate pet only considering temperature however the pet can be affected by many other climatic factors such as wind speed and humidity shi et al 2022 xiang et al 2020 we found that the clayton was the optimal copula function for most of our shires among four detrended methods fig 4 s4 s6 revealing that a strong lower tail dependence between the time series of detrended yield and spei existed in most shires du et al 2018 she and xia 2018 the comparison of simulated conditional probability of detrended yield and drought index with corresponding pair wise observed value illustrated that most of the observed samples fall within the probability density range estimated by the clayton copula function additionally a small number of samples deviated from this range possibly due to anomalous weather in the corresponding year potgieter et al 2013 the yield loss probabilities under drought condition were much higher than that under non drought condition fig 6 we suspect that other factors such as excessive water supply had limited effects on wheat yield under non drought condition cossani and sadras 2018 sadras et al 2016 the yield loss probability under different drought severities illustrates a tendency that as the severity level of drought increases the probability of wheat yield loss gradually increases fig 7 which is consistent with previous studies li et al 2022a liu et al 2022 the severity of drought represents the adequacy of the water supply required for wheat growth more severe droughts have greater water deficit during drought conditions the limited availability of water significantly constrains the growth of wheat and has a pronounced impact on its yield asseng et al 2004 song et al 2019 thus increasing the probability of yield loss under severe drought conditions the water deficit becomes the dominant factor affecting the growth and leading to the increase of the yield loss probability as the severity tends to extreme levels the yield loss probability approaches to 100 for several shires if no measures are taken to interfere with this process the results of conditional probability showed that the copula function was capable of capturing the probability variations of yield loss at the shire scale in addition yield loss probability varied regionally fig 8 the loss probability in region 1 was highest followed by region 2 and region 3 the growing season rainfall decreased from the east to west and the temperature decrease from the northwest to the southeast in the wheat belt we anticipate that the region 1 is under the dry and hot climate conditions with more severe water shortage compared to region 3 with a cool and moist climate feng and wang 2019b although the soil in region 1 has a high water holding capacity page et al 2018 the rain mainly falls in the summer by contrast the rainfall of region 2 mainly occurs in winter as a result the water for wheat growth can be recharged to some extent additionally we quantified the drought threshold for each region fig 9 although the results of cma detrended method depicted a little difference from other methods the drought threshold of region 1 was highest followed by region 2 and region 3 the values of drought threshold represent the sensitivity of wheat yield to drought we speculate that region 1 was the most sensitive to drought and region 3 had a less sensitivity to drought therefore some targeted actions are required to lower the loss probability of wheat yield in drought sensitive regions especially as drought severity continues to worsen for example drought tolerant wheat cultivars should be considered to enhance the drought resistance for region 1 and 2 wang et al 2019 the management practices such as sowing dates could be adjusted to avoid the impact of drought on critical growth stages of wheat chen et al 2020a zeleke and nendel 2016 zhao et al 2015 moreover implementing a crop rotation system featuring well suited crops and wheat using the right amount of fertilizer and employing practical agronomy options such as stubble return can enhance both the drought resistance and agricultural benefits of this region edwards 2000 ryan et al 2008 sedri et al 2019 therefore our results can help government agencies to identify the hotspots that are vulnerable to drought conditions and enable local growers to employ effective agronomic options to cope with extreme drought there are some limitations in our study firstly the research period for wheat yield only covered 1922 2000 the lack of recent wheat yield data for each shire prevents us evaluating the yield loss risk in the latest decades when the occurrence of drought years has increased crop model has been widely used to simulate crop yield forced with climate data it is possible to employ apsim model to obtain wheat yield in a long term period e g 1900 2022 for each study shire then the simulated yield can be used to quantify the drought impact leng and hall 2019 secondly using spei or spi to characterize the drought condition is partially inadequate since only the precipitation and temperature were considered beguería et al 2014 there are other factors that can affect the wheat growth and yield such as soil properties ding et al 2020a ko et al 2010 for example clay soil has a better buffer capacity to cope with drought than sandy soil karhu et al 2011 olmo et al 2016 thus soil moisture related drought indices should be used to provide more comprehensive information of agricultural drought impacts on crop production furthermore more correlation methods should be considered to provide robust results for optimal drought index selection pan et al 2019 lastly other extreme climate events such as heat and frost often accompany drought zhao et al 2022 evaluated the shock trend of wheat yield loss under hot dry windy events of usa wheat belt they found that the compound events can lead to the 4 of yield reduction moreover global warming is projected to result in the more frequent compound events in the future hao and singh 2020 meng et al 2022 especially for the cropland lesk and anderson 2021 therefore we recommend that future work should pay attention towards understanding the impacts of compound drought and heat events on crop yield in rainfed areas 5 conclusion for the first time we developed a probabilistic analysis method rather than using a deterministic approach to quantify the yield loss probability under various drought severities at a shire scale in the nsw wheat belt south eastern australia we also empirically determined the drought threshold for each shire based on the copula functions we found that the 6 month spei could well explain the variability of detrended wheat yield although taking evapotranspiration into account did not significantly improve the correlation coefficients between drought index and detrended yield due to diverse climatic patterns in the wheat belt our results showed that both yield loss possibility and drought threshold were region specific we found that the western study area was more sensitive to drought therefore more effective agronomic options were required to mitigate the risk of yield loss in these drought prone regions a probabilistic investigation of yield variability under drought severity is more valuable than the results of using deterministic method for risk management policy makers and agricultural insurance evaluators the vulnerable hotspots can be quickly identified and their dynamic change could be effectively detected based on the climatic variability we expect that our research framework can be extended to other areas particularly in the context of more frequent drought events by integrating compound events such as drought and heat with crop models under future climate scenarios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

8928,a risk based approach is more meaningful to quantify the effects of drought on crop yield given the randomness nature of past drought events compared to the deterministic approach however the majority of these probabilistic studies are conducted at national or global scale to assess the yield loss probability under given drought conditions there is still a lack of research combining droughts and crop yields in a probabilistic way at a local scale moreover it is unclear how drought threshold triggering yield loss at a given conditional probability will vary in dryland cropping regions here we used wheat yield data from 66 shires in new south wales nsw wheat belt and meteorological data from 986 weather stations a copula based probabilistic method was developed to explore the yield loss probability to various drought conditions we investigated the drought threshold under a given yield loss probability using the constructed copula function we found that spei 6 in october was the optimal drought index to represent detrended wheat yield variation as this period covered the main growth stages of winter wheat in the study region our results show that as the severity of drought increased the wheat yield loss probability also increased yield loss probability varied among the study shires mainly due to the various climate conditions of each region the drought threshold in subregion 1 the northwest was highest followed by subregion 2 the southwest and subregion 3 the eastern indicating that wheat yield in subregion 1 was more sensitive to drought the findings could provide important direction and benchmarks for stakeholders in evaluating the agricultural impact of drought especially in those drought prone areas we expect that the methodological framework developed here can be extended to other dryland areas to provide helpful information to growers risk management policy makers and agricultural insurance evaluators graphical

variability can cause various natural hazards loukas et al 2008 sun et al 2023 yin et al 2022 with drought being one of the most common hazards around the world chiang et al 2021 christian et al 2021 meza et al 2021 drought can lead to several negative effects on ecosystem including but not limited to carbon and water cycle hoover et al 2022 yang et al 2016 vegetation growth ding et al 2020b he et al 2022 and water resources chang et al 2019 li et al 2022b one of the most relevant to human society is the negative impact on crop production which has become a very serious issue especially in those regions and countries where crop is vulnerable to drought araneda cabrera et al 2021 deb et al 2022 li et al 2021 for example global yields of wheat and maize can be reduced by 40 and 21 respectively when the water availability ratio was reduced to 50 caused by drought events daryanto et al 2016 different drought conditions cause varied magnitudes of yield loss to quantify the effects of the various drought conditions drought index such as standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 and standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei has been developed and implemented to quantify drought characteristics spi is the most commonly used meteorological drought index as it is easy to compute with only precipitation data it was used as the standard to compare with other indices soˇláková et al 2014 szalai and szinell 2000 additionally spei proposed by vicente serrano et al 2010 was widely used because it adopts a similar mechanism theory to the spi and takes potential evapotranspiration pet into account to provide a more realistic description of the water variability in the study area wang et al 2015b assessed the change of long term 1961 2012 drought severity in china with spi and spei they found that spi spei was able to characterize the evolution of the wet and dry conditions of the study region haile et al 2020 analysed drought pattern on monthly seasonal and interannual basis with spei at various timescales in the greater horn of africa the results showed that drought was more frequent and persistent in sudan and tanzania but more severe in somalia ethiopia and kenya the characteristics of the effects of droughts on crop yield can be captured by the drought index araneda cabrera et al 2021 mokhtar et al 2022 but the suitability of spi and spei was highly dependent on the study area and crop types for example chen et al 2020b compared the relationship between multiple drought indices and crop yield at different time scales they found that the reliability of yield variation analysis was influenced by the choice of drought indices and time scales labudová et al 2017 investigated the correlation between dry wet conditions and crop yields in danubian lowland and the east slovakian lowland with spi and spei they found that the spei had a higher correlation with yield fluctuations for most crops than spi except potato thus it is important to identify the optimal drought index at different time scales to evaluate the effects of drought on crop yield in a given study area kamali et al 2022 prodhan et al 2022 both statistical models and process based crop models have been widely used to evaluate the effects of drought events on crop yield for example zhang et al 2019 used ceres maize model based on risk assessment theory to construct a dynamical drought risk assessment model for maize and analysed the drought impacts on maize yield in north eastern china they found that the hazard level caused by drought varied in the different growth stages of maize in iran zarei et al 2019 tested the r 2 coefficients between several climate indices and wheat yield loss simulated by aquacrop model they found that selecting optimal index to assess climate change impacts on crop yield was required in different regions as we all know process based crop models use the parameters calibrated in a few locations to simulate crop yield at a large area however this approach introduces uncertainties when they are applied beyond locations regions where they are originally developed leng 2021 moreover statistical models are used to study the impacts of droughts on crop yields by fitting a linear or non linear relationships between long term historical yield and observed climate variables kamali et al 2015 wambua 2019 the advantage of such empirical analysis is to provide the overall sensitivity of yield response to drought given its simplicity and less computation cost recently a risk based approach is more meaningful to study the effects of drought on crop yield given the randomness nature of drought events feng and hao 2020 ribeiro et al 2019a as one of probability based statistical approaches copula function is getting more widely used because of its capability of linking several variables to obtain their joint probabilities sklar 1973 copula can establish the joint distribution function of variables via combining the marginal distribution functions of different variables patton 2012 poonia et al 2021 integrated with the conditional probability theory copula enables estimating the probability of crop yield loss under various drought scenarios it can provide more valuable information to the practitioners when designing agricultural risk policies compared to the deterministic approach liu et al 2022 ribeiro et al 2019a australia is a significant player in the global grain trade and has been a major exporter of wheat for several years grundy et al 2016 zeleke and nendel 2016 the new south wales nsw wheat belt is the main wheat production area of australia accounting for 27 of the national production www abares gov au 2013 14 however the wheat in this region is grown under rainfed conditions and its yield is highly variable due to great climate variability almost half of the total production variation was caused by inter annual variability of precipitation and temperature in south eastern australia ray et al 2015 waha et al 2022 the recent 2018 drought in nsw resulted in local crop yields being about 53 lower than the 20 year average 1999 2018 steve et al 2018 numerous studies investigated the impacts of historical climate variations on agricultural production in australia feng et al 2018 potgieter et al 2013 wang et al 2015a but the majority of their conclusions are based on deterministic approaches which are unable to provide any risk assessment information nevertheless madadgar et al 2017 used copula functions to investigate drought impacts on five main crops at a national scale in australia the use of copula based probabilistic approach to assess the probability of yield loss under given drought conditions has not been investigated at a local scale in australia godfrey et al 2022 furthermore it is not clear how drought threshold triggering yield loss at a given conditional probability will vary with different regions in australian dryland cropping areas liu et al 2022 here we used a copula based probabilistic method to explore the potential response of yield loss to various drought conditions in nsw wheat belt of south eastern australia based on long term historical observed wheat yield and climate data for 66 shires we aim to 1 identify the optimum drought index within the wheat growing season determining yield variation in the nsw wheat belt 2 select marginal distribution function and establish the copula based joint distribution function to quantify the probability of yield loss under different drought conditions for each shire and 3 identify drought threshold triggering yield loss at a given conditional probability in the study region 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and data sources the nsw wheat belt 141 0 152 0 e 28 5 36 1 s is located in the south eastern australia and covers an area of 360 000 km2 liu et al 2014 the large parts of the nsw wheat belt are characterized by mediterranean climate with a large interannual variation of precipitation the western part of the nsw belt is warm and dry while in contrast the eastern part is cold and wet feng et al 2018 the annual mean amount of precipitation varies from 200 mm in southwest to 1000 mm in southeast while the annual mean temperature decreases from 20 c in the northwest part to 11 c towards the southeast part feng et al 2019a there are 66 shires in the nsw wheat belt where the harvest area of wheat was nearly double up from 2123 to 3800 kha and the production increased almost four times from 3432 kt to 13 110 kt during the last several decades abares https www agriculture gov au in our study the wheat growing region was separated into three sub areas based on climatic conditions fig 1 wang et al 2015a we selected six shires to represent the specific climatic characteristics of each region and then these shires were used to demonstrate the probabilistic analysis at a shire scale coonabarabbran cb and moree plains mp are relatively warm wakool wk and narromine nm are relatively dry nundle nd and gundagai gd are relatively cool and wet sites we used the historical climate data including daily precipitation p maximum and minimum temperature tmax and tmin which were extracted from silo patched point dataset jeffrey et al 2001 we obtained the annual wheat yield data of 66 shires from fitzsimmons 2001 the principal characteristics of all shires in the entire study region are summarized in supplementary table s1 2 2 yield detrend the nsw wheat yield has experienced a significant increase in recent decades as a result of improvements in agricultural management and technology wang et al 2015a the non climatic factor should be removed before quantifying the drought impact on the wheat yield first difference fd has been widely used to remove the influence of non climatic factors tao et al 2008 zhang et al 2010 by calculating the difference of crop yield between two successive year wang et al 2015a 1 yield yield i yield i 1 where yield is the first difference of wheat yield i e detrended yield yield i is the original yield for the ith year yield i 1 is the original yield for the i 1 th year i starts from 1923 or 1961 in this study to ensure a comprehensive analysis and minimize biases caused by relying on a single detrend method three additional detrended methods including centre moving average cma li et al 2022c lu et al 2017 hodrick prescott hp filter cheng and yin 2021 harvey and trimbur 2008 and holt exponential smoothing hes holt 2004 li 2013 were taken into consideration in our study these alternative methods were employed to compare the detrended yield and provide a more robust understanding of the yield data the specific equations and compared results of these three methods are listed in the supplementary materials 2 3 drought index we used spi and spei to investigate the impact of drought conditions on wheat yield variation the spi transforms the fitted distribution of precipitation record into a normal distribution with equiprobability transformation and then zero is set as the mean value therefore the values above or below zero represent the wet and dry conditions respectively mckee et al 1993 zargar et al 2011 also we adopted this process into the construction of spei however we used the water balance instead of precipitation because it is the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration pet to fit distribution vicente serrano et al 2010 we selected the thornthwaite model thornthwaite 1948 to obtain the pet since the calculation procedure was simple and only mean temperature data was needed as wheat growing season was april to november the 3 month jul sep aug oct and sep nov and 6 month apr sep may oct and jun nov scales were used to calculate spi and spei for example spi 3 sep is the 3 month scale jul sep in september spi 6 sep is the 6 month scale apr sep in september the classification of the two drought indices is shown in the table 1 mckee et al 1993 2 4 optimal index selection we used the kendall tau correlation coefficient to select the drought index bonett and wright 2000 croux and dehon 2010 we selected the index that had the highest tau value with detrended yield as the optimal drought index di o to reflect the impacts of drought on yield variation and then we used this index to estimate the yield loss probabilities with the conditional values that represent the different drought severities the tau coefficients calculated by the following equation temizhan et al 2022 2 τ n concordant n discordant n n 1 2 where n concordant is the number of concordant pairs of drought index and detrended yield n discordant is the number of discordant pairs n is the number of pairs 2 5 probabilistic estimation of drought impacts on yield loss 2 5 1 copula copula function initially proposed by sklar 1973 is able to obtain the joint distribution by connecting the marginal distribution of any two or more variables depending on their correlation levels it was previously used to estimate financial risk issues copula function is becoming more popular in the climatic hazards risk modelling due to less limitation on dependence of marginal functions and simplicity in construction won et al 2020 zhang and jiang 2019 a detailed description of copula can be obtained in nelsen 2007 here we used a 2 dimensional copula function to model the joint distribution of drought index x and detrended yield y as shown in eq 3 3 f x y x y c f x x f y y where f is the marginal distributions of related variables c is the cumulative distribution function of copula there are numerous copula functions that enable the description of the joint probability dependence and relationships between univariate variables under extreme situations nelsen 2007 we compared six commonly used copula functions including gaussian t clayton gumbel frank and joe table 2 and fitted these functions in each shire we used the akaike information criterion aic as the selection standard in the marginal distribution and copula fitting sakamoto et al 1986 the smaller the aic value showed the better fitting result prior to the construction of copula function the distribution of variables needs to be fitted we used normal distribution to fit drought index because spi and spei conformed to the normal distribution according to their principle additionally the normal logistic and uniform distributions table 3 were used to fit the detrended yield for each shire 2 5 2 estimating conditional yield loss probability under different drought conditions based on the copula joint distribution the conditional probability of yield loss under drought and non drought conditions were estimated by eqs 4 and 5 respectively ribeiro et al 2019b we used different levels of drought severity i e x 0 5 0 75 1 1 25 1 5 and 1 75 as the different conditional values of di o we set the conditional value of yield to 0 5 i e y 0 5 which represented the average yield loss 4 p y y x x p x x y y p x x c f x x f y y f x x 5 p y y x x f y y c f x x f y y 1 f x x where p is the probability under specific conditions c and f are the copula and marginal distributions x and y represent the value of di o and yield respectively x and y are conditional values of x and y respectively 2 5 3 identifying drought threshold note that when the conditional value of yield is determined the yield loss probability increases consistently with more severe drought here we set the probability of yield loss yield 0 5 as 80 to obtain the corresponding drought severity as shown in eq 6 the specific derived value of di o is the drought threshold dt that causes the corresponding yield loss for each shire li et al 2022a 6 p yield 0 5 di o dt 80 fig 2 shows our brief framework we used the r package of spei to calculate the spi and spei beguería et al 2017 vinecopula was used to calculate the joint and conditional probability schepsmeier et al 2015 and ggplot2 was used to make the figures wickham 2016 3 results 3 1 correlation between wheat yield variation and drought index fig 3a shows the tau correlation coefficient τ between yield and 3 6 month spi spei across 66 shires the average τ value of 3 month spi had a largest value in september 0 26 while that of 6 month scale spi was highest in october 0 30 fig 3a we found similar results for spei also we found that regardless of the time scale the correlation between spei and yield was slightly higher than spi in most months we selected spei 6 in october as the optimal drought index hereinafter referred to as di o capturing wheat yield variation in the study area moreover we found that spei 6 in october was significantly correlated with detrended yield calculated by other three methods fig s1 s3 the spatial distribution of the correlation between di o and yield within the wheat belt is shown in fig 3b with p values less than 0 05 for 62 shires we did not consider four shires due to non significant relation between drought index and yield variation moreover the τ values were higher in the central and western regions than in other parts of the belt 3 2 marginal distribution and copula selection table 4 shows the aic values of the three distribution functions fitted for each shire the bold number was the minimum aic among the three distribution functions with the corresponding distribution being the optimal function the distribution function of yield for most shires was logistic and only a few shires were suitable for the normal distribution once the optimal distribution function of yield was determined we selected the optimal joint distribution function of yield and di o for each shire from the six alternative copula functions fig 4a depicts the spatial distribution of the optimal copula function in the wheat belt we found that clayton was suitable for most shires with a few shires being suitable for other copula functions of frank gaussian and t function additionally similar results were illustrated for other detrended methods fig s4 s6 note that none of our shires were suitable for joe and gumbel copula functions see table 2 the spatial distribution of aic values corresponding to the optimal copula function for each shire showed that the central and southern regions had a slightly lower aic compared to the other regions fig 4b 3 3 the probability of yield loss under different drought conditions we exemplified the conditional probability density values of yield at given di o values red shadow to compare with their pair wise observed values black dots for selected six shires fig 5 the probability density values were normalized into an interval of 0 1 to eliminate the differences in numerical scales of these shires most of observed values were located in the red shadow indicating that the simulated values based on copula function were able to describe the relationship of yield and di o fig 6 shows the conditional probability of yield loss under drought di o 0 5 and non drought di o 0 5 conditions at six selected representative shires the yellow percentage in the figure represents the non exceedance conditional probability of yield loss yield 0 5 under the drought condition while the green percent represents the probability under the non drought condition the conditional probability of yield loss under the drought condition was much greater than that under the non drought condition indicating that drought was more likely to cause yield loss the probability value for nd in region 3 was smallest with only 35 if only considering the probability of yield loss that occurred under drought condition the drought conditional probability at nm in region 2 was highest with 53 3 under the non drought condition the probability of yield loss was 13 7 and 13 at nd and hb respectively which was higher than other shires this might be due to the higher rainfall in these two shires thus the probability of yield loss caused by non drought factors like such as waterlogging was higher than that in other shires it is notable that yield loss probability under non drought condition was only 4 4 for wk as it was the driest in six selected shires fig 7 shows the spatial distribution of yield loss probability across the wheat belt under different drought severities in general the loss probability of yield increased as the increase of drought severity for example the average probability of yield loss was 50 1 when di o was less than 0 5 but the probability of yield loss increased to 88 6 under severer drought conditions di o 1 5 we also calculated the yield loss probability due to different drought severities for each region fig 8 generally under drought condition the yield loss probabilities in all three regions tended to increase as drought severity increased the yield loss probability was lowest in region 3 indicating that it was less affected by drought compared to other two regions the yield loss probability was close higher than 75 for region 1 and region 2 when moderate and severe drought occurred the results based on other three detrended methods of cma hp and hes also showed that yield loss probability in region 3 was lowest compared to other two regions fig s16 s18 the drought threshold for each region and shire was shown in fig 9 we found that averaged drought threshold value increased from region 3 2 18 to region 1 1 62 fig 9a also dt in the shires of western nsw wheat belt had higher values than those shires in eastern australia fig 9b these results indicated that the wheat yield in northwest region was more sensitive to drought than that in eastern high rainfall region other detrended methods illustrated similar distribution of dt except the cma method specifically cma method showed that the averaged drought threshold of region 2 was slightly higher than region 1 fig s19a 4 discussion we firstly investigated the relationship between the detrended yield and drought index then we established the joint probability model to estimate the yield loss risk under various drought severities based on the conditional probability theory moreover we derived the drought thresholds triggering same level of yield loss for each shire as far as we know our study represents the first instance of utilizing a copula based method to conduct a probabilistic assessment of the impact of drought events on wheat yields in australia at a local scale shire level additionally our study also quantifies the specific drought thresholds that trigger yield loss we expect our method could be used in other major rainfed cropping regions around the world where crops often suffer from drought stress previous studies have emphasized the characteristics between crop yield and drought indices with different time scales hunt et al 2014 zipper et al 2016 our study provided further evidence for example we found that among all four detrended methods the 6 month spei in october exhibited the strongest correlation with the variability of detrended wheat yield across the wheat belt region in nsw these findings are consistent with results from previous studies for example peña gallardo et al 2019 analysed the response of several crop yields to different time scales of drought indices in the u s and they found that a high correlation occurs between winter wheat yield and 6 month spei usually wheat is sowed in may and harvested in november in the australian wheat belt and thus the 6 month scale covers the most growth periods of wheat therefore the climatic change during this period could better explain the variability of wheat yield than 3 month index however the correlation between spei and detrended yield is only slightly better than that of spi fig 3 indicating that the sensitivity of drought index to capture yield variation is not significantly improved by taking pet into account this is likely due to the equation used to estimate pet only considering temperature however the pet can be affected by many other climatic factors such as wind speed and humidity shi et al 2022 xiang et al 2020 we found that the clayton was the optimal copula function for most of our shires among four detrended methods fig 4 s4 s6 revealing that a strong lower tail dependence between the time series of detrended yield and spei existed in most shires du et al 2018 she and xia 2018 the comparison of simulated conditional probability of detrended yield and drought index with corresponding pair wise observed value illustrated that most of the observed samples fall within the probability density range estimated by the clayton copula function additionally a small number of samples deviated from this range possibly due to anomalous weather in the corresponding year potgieter et al 2013 the yield loss probabilities under drought condition were much higher than that under non drought condition fig 6 we suspect that other factors such as excessive water supply had limited effects on wheat yield under non drought condition cossani and sadras 2018 sadras et al 2016 the yield loss probability under different drought severities illustrates a tendency that as the severity level of drought increases the probability of wheat yield loss gradually increases fig 7 which is consistent with previous studies li et al 2022a liu et al 2022 the severity of drought represents the adequacy of the water supply required for wheat growth more severe droughts have greater water deficit during drought conditions the limited availability of water significantly constrains the growth of wheat and has a pronounced impact on its yield asseng et al 2004 song et al 2019 thus increasing the probability of yield loss under severe drought conditions the water deficit becomes the dominant factor affecting the growth and leading to the increase of the yield loss probability as the severity tends to extreme levels the yield loss probability approaches to 100 for several shires if no measures are taken to interfere with this process the results of conditional probability showed that the copula function was capable of capturing the probability variations of yield loss at the shire scale in addition yield loss probability varied regionally fig 8 the loss probability in region 1 was highest followed by region 2 and region 3 the growing season rainfall decreased from the east to west and the temperature decrease from the northwest to the southeast in the wheat belt we anticipate that the region 1 is under the dry and hot climate conditions with more severe water shortage compared to region 3 with a cool and moist climate feng and wang 2019b although the soil in region 1 has a high water holding capacity page et al 2018 the rain mainly falls in the summer by contrast the rainfall of region 2 mainly occurs in winter as a result the water for wheat growth can be recharged to some extent additionally we quantified the drought threshold for each region fig 9 although the results of cma detrended method depicted a little difference from other methods the drought threshold of region 1 was highest followed by region 2 and region 3 the values of drought threshold represent the sensitivity of wheat yield to drought we speculate that region 1 was the most sensitive to drought and region 3 had a less sensitivity to drought therefore some targeted actions are required to lower the loss probability of wheat yield in drought sensitive regions especially as drought severity continues to worsen for example drought tolerant wheat cultivars should be considered to enhance the drought resistance for region 1 and 2 wang et al 2019 the management practices such as sowing dates could be adjusted to avoid the impact of drought on critical growth stages of wheat chen et al 2020a zeleke and nendel 2016 zhao et al 2015 moreover implementing a crop rotation system featuring well suited crops and wheat using the right amount of fertilizer and employing practical agronomy options such as stubble return can enhance both the drought resistance and agricultural benefits of this region edwards 2000 ryan et al 2008 sedri et al 2019 therefore our results can help government agencies to identify the hotspots that are vulnerable to drought conditions and enable local growers to employ effective agronomic options to cope with extreme drought there are some limitations in our study firstly the research period for wheat yield only covered 1922 2000 the lack of recent wheat yield data for each shire prevents us evaluating the yield loss risk in the latest decades when the occurrence of drought years has increased crop model has been widely used to simulate crop yield forced with climate data it is possible to employ apsim model to obtain wheat yield in a long term period e g 1900 2022 for each study shire then the simulated yield can be used to quantify the drought impact leng and hall 2019 secondly using spei or spi to characterize the drought condition is partially inadequate since only the precipitation and temperature were considered beguería et al 2014 there are other factors that can affect the wheat growth and yield such as soil properties ding et al 2020a ko et al 2010 for example clay soil has a better buffer capacity to cope with drought than sandy soil karhu et al 2011 olmo et al 2016 thus soil moisture related drought indices should be used to provide more comprehensive information of agricultural drought impacts on crop production furthermore more correlation methods should be considered to provide robust results for optimal drought index selection pan et al 2019 lastly other extreme climate events such as heat and frost often accompany drought zhao et al 2022 evaluated the shock trend of wheat yield loss under hot dry windy events of usa wheat belt they found that the compound events can lead to the 4 of yield reduction moreover global warming is projected to result in the more frequent compound events in the future hao and singh 2020 meng et al 2022 especially for the cropland lesk and anderson 2021 therefore we recommend that future work should pay attention towards understanding the impacts of compound drought and heat events on crop yield in rainfed areas 5 conclusion for the first time we developed a probabilistic analysis method rather than using a deterministic approach to quantify the yield loss probability under various drought severities at a shire scale in the nsw wheat belt south eastern australia we also empirically determined the drought threshold for each shire based on the copula functions we found that the 6 month spei could well explain the variability of detrended wheat yield although taking evapotranspiration into account did not significantly improve the correlation coefficients between drought index and detrended yield due to diverse climatic patterns in the wheat belt our results showed that both yield loss possibility and drought threshold were region specific we found that the western study area was more sensitive to drought therefore more effective agronomic options were required to mitigate the risk of yield loss in these drought prone regions a probabilistic investigation of yield variability under drought severity is more valuable than the results of using deterministic method for risk management policy makers and agricultural insurance evaluators the vulnerable hotspots can be quickly identified and their dynamic change could be effectively detected based on the climatic variability we expect that our research framework can be extended to other areas particularly in the context of more frequent drought events by integrating compound events such as drought and heat with crop models under future climate scenarios declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

8929,the energy demand and their associated costs in pressurized irrigation networks together with water scarcity are currently causing serious challenges for irrigation district s id managers additionally most of the new water distribution networks in ids have been designed to be operated on demand complexing id managers the daily decision making process the knowledge of the water demand several days in advance would facilitate the management of the system and would help to optimize the water use and energy costs for an efficient management and optimization of the water energy nexus in ids longer term forecasting models are needed in this work a new hybrid model called lstmhybrid combining fuzzy logic fl genetic algorithm ga lstm encoder decoder and dense or full connected neural networks dnn for the one week forecasting of irrigation water demand at id scale has been developed lstmhybrid was developed in python and applied to a real id the optimal input variables for lstmhydrid were mean temperature c reference evapotranspiration mm solar radiation mj m 2 and irrigation water demand of the id m3 from 1 to 7 days prior to the first day of prediction the optimal lstmhybrid model selected consisted of 50 lstm cells in the encoder submodel 409 lstm cells in the decoder submodel and three hidden layers in the dnn submodel with 31 96 and 128 neurons in each hidden layer respectively thus lstmhybrid had a total of 1 5 million parameters obtaining a representativeness higher than 94 and an accuracy around of 20 keywords artificial intelligence irrigation pressurized water networks deep learning machine learning data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction irrigation is regarded as one of the main adaptations to support crop production in response to population growth fao 2016 2015 rodríguez díaz et al 2007 however it must be a precision activity where the right amount of water is applied just when it is needed by the crop hedley et al 2014 thus pressurized irrigation systems which are managed by irrigation districts ids are one of the best options to increase water use efficiency daccache et al 2014a 2014b additionally in last two decades the flexibility in the irrigation operation by farmers has been increase because of the new pressurized irrigation networks after modernization process these new water distribution networks for irrigation make water available to farmers 24 h a day thus farmers can decides every day its irrigation scheduling how and when to irrigate playán and mateos 2006 rodríguez díaz et al 2011 tarjuelo et al 2015 however this increase in the availability of water by farmers makes the integrated management of the id a complex task the hydraulic systems must work under a wide range of hydraulic operation conditions managers of these ids do not know when their users farmers are going to irrigate and at what time making it difficult to optimize all the system pumping stations failures repairs energy purchases etc thus the uncertainty associated with irrigation water demands in water distribution networks which are operated on demand plusquellec 2009 and the uncertainty of the electricity market in spain last deep change on 1st june 2021 are generating challenges in the daily management of irrigation districts mainly in arid and semiarid regions such as spain in addition an accurate prediction of water demand would allow for optimal network management measures to reduce energy demand nowadays in the new age of digitalization icts information and communication technologies and intelligent algorithms based on artificial intelligence ai are essential to increase and improve the precision agriculture management particularly in the control of the water energy management in pressurized irrigation systems kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 wolfert et al 2017 traditional strategies to save water and energy in id such as critical point management sectorization etc derardja et al 2019 fernández garcía et al 2016 gonzález perea et al 2016 rodríguez díaz et al 2012 frequently reduce farmers water management flexibility diminishing the positive aspects of the irrigation modernization process on demand irrigation thus new water and energy optimization strategies id are necessary but without reducing the decision making power of farmers based on intelligent models which forecasts this farmer behavior traditionally one of the main drawbacks to implementing new intelligent data driven models is the availability and cost of obtaining this information however the recent revolution of the icts as well as the development of new low cost sensors capable to automatically collect on real time thousands of robust data and the exploitation of ai have modified the technological environment of the current irrigated agriculture based on machine learning from data all these technologies offer new possibilities for water energy nexus management in ids leading to increased use efficiencies of these resources making the ids more sustainable in environmental social and economic aspects based on ai techniques water demand forecasting will allow the entire water distribution network from pumping station to hydrant to be adapted to operate as efficiently as possible reducing the uncertainty caused by on demand irrigation optimizing all its resources thus real water demand forecasting could be one of the main tools to improve ids operation and help managers in the daily decision making processes but without reducing farmers degree of freedom ai icts and bigdata have been applied to solve some forecasting issues mainly of a time series nature in precision irrigation ids and pressurized irrigation networks since it was first published in its full version in the early 2000s graves and schmidhuber 2005 long short term memory lstm neural network is the most widely used type of artificial neural network for solving time series forecasting problems its recurrent connection adds state or memory to this neural network and allow it to learn and harness the ordered nature of input time series thus lstm has become the most cited neural network of the 20th century at id scale ground water level estimations and irrigation demand forecasting are two of the main topics addressed for water energy optimization based on ai and bigdata a new model based on lstm neural network for water table depth forecasting in agricultural areas was developed by zhang et al 2018 this model was applied in five sub areas of hetao irrigation district china using a time series of 14 years results showed that the developed model can serve as an alternative approach as opposed of physical models predicting water table depth especially in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain a combination of lstm neural network with arima autoregressive integrated moving average model was proposed by sheikh khozani et al 2022 to predict ground water level yazd ardekn plain in iran the architecture of this hybrid model was optimized by the salp swarm algorithm ssa sine cosine optimization algorithm scoa particle swarm optimization algorithm psoa and genetic algorithm ga despite the lower values of mae mean absolute error which ranged from 5 to 47 general results indicated that an increased forecasting horizon reduced the accuracy of the model this problem is regularly found in forecasting model based on memory such as lstm and all its modifications no many works can be found for farmer behavior forecasting and so the real irrigation demand in ids the estimation of the water demand in an id can be approached at different spatial and temporal scales at spatial scale farm and irrigation district scale can be distinguished on the other hand at temporal scale short one day middle around a week and long several weeks terms scales can be recognized at present there are not long term forecasting models either at farm or water user association level however some forecasting models have been developed for the rest of the spatial and temporal scales at short term time scale pulido calvo and gutiérrez estrada 2009 developed a hybrid model combining dnns dense neural networks fuzzy logic fl and ga genetic algorithm to forecast one day ahead daily water demand at irrigation district spatial scale a major limitation of this model was the determination of the neural network architecture by trial and error consequently the standard error prediction sep of the model was around 25 this limitation was addressed by gonzález perea et al 2015 which developed a new methodology to optimize the dnn architecture by ga to the short term forecasting of daily irrigation water demand at irrigation district level results showed sep values close to 10 improving the accuracy obtained by other models to date the short term forecasting at farm level was addressed in previous works gonzález perea et al 2019 2018 2021 where three models addressed the forecast of the occurrence of the irrigation events gonzález perea et al 2019 the daily applied irrigation depth gonzález perea et al 2018 and the hourly distribution according to electricity tariff of the daily applied irrigation depth gonzález perea et al 2021 forouhar et al 2022 developed a hybrid framework by incorporating existing physical knowledge conceptual model to understood factors leading to crop water needs using observation data of the system into a data driven model to predict the irrigation water demand up to 7 days ahead for an irrigation district in victoria australia however although results showed that the integration of physical system understanding into data driven models can improve the performance of the predictions the accuracy of the results are not enough for an integrated management of water and energy resources in ids gonzalez perea et al 2021 developed a model to predict the demand seven days ahead but at farm level they combined ai techniques satellite remote sensing and open source climate data to optimize the irrigation water forecasting at farm level for a week in advance however although sep values ranged from 17 to 19 the one week estimation was addressed as a single point not distinguishing between days but for a whole week consequently the accuracy of short term forecasting models for different spatial scales are good but are not enough to be considered in the day to day management of ids short term forecasting models do not have enough time resolution for a holistic management of the ids thus longer term forecasting models would be much more useful for managers to know in advance how much water will be required and hence how much energy should be needed this will involve a more efficient use of water and energy resources and a cost effective purchase of the electric energy however the already developed models are either not developed yet or the accuracy achieved is not adequate for its incorporation into the daily management of the id thus with the main objective of overcoming these limitations in this work a new hybrid model combining fl ga lstm encoder decoder and dense or full connected neural networks dnn for the one week forecast of irrigation water demand at irrigation district scale has been developed this model called lstmhybrid is based on artificial memory and has been developed in python programming language v3 9 van et al 2009 and tested in a real id 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data source the study area where the developed methodology has been applied is in extremadura region southwest span fig 1 shows the location of this real id called canal del zújar irrigation district czid this id consists of ten independent hydraulic sectors the methodology is applied on sector ii of this id czid applied irrigation water through a pressurized irrigation network which is organized on demand czid sector ii convers a total irrigated area of 2691 ha and 191 hydrants tomato rice and maize are the main crops covering more than 90 of the total irrigated area each hydrant of czid sector ii has a flowmeter which automatically records the hourly volume of water applied the complete cleaned dataset of the daily irrigation water demand contained a total of 1849 measures from 2015 to 2022 irrigation seasons this dataset was randomly divided into three subsets training dataset 70 of the total measures of the original dataset validation dataset 15 of the total measures of the original dataset and testing dataset 15 of the total measures of the original dataset the utm coordinates of the closest agro weather station are 252 468 431 917 and 30 for x y and zone respectively the average annual evapotranspiration and precipitation are 1296 mm and 390 mm respectively the average maximum and minimum temperatures range from 23 c to 35 1 c 2 2 problem approach the stated problem focused on the development of a new methodology to determinate the optimal forecasting model of water demand at irrigation district level one week ahead in advance to address this issue the problem has been approached as time series forecasting problem many ai techniques particularly in deep learning can address time series prediction however due to the nature of their architecture not all the deep learning models are specially designed for this issue typically rnns recurrent neural networks are the family of deep learning models for processing sequential data i e time series previous scientific works have highlighted that the most effective time series models used in practical applications are those based on lstm neural networks afzaal et al 2020 ferreira and da cunha 2020 yin et al 2020 however memory based neural networks usually have accuracy problems as the forecasting time increases to mitigate this middle term memory leakage effect the model developed in this work optimizes a hybrid architecture composed of an encoder decoder architecture whose elementary cell includes a lstm neural network and a dnn fig 2 the hyperparameters of this hybrid architecture were optimized by the multiobjective genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 and the identification of the forecasting model inputs were optimized by fl according to the methodology developed by lin et al 1996 2 3 hybrid model architecture typically lstm neural networks as other rnns can map an input sequence time series to an output sequence of the same dimension fixed size vector however in many real applications such as water irrigation forecasting in ids inputs and outputs sequences are not necessary of the same length for example if the aim is to forecast irrigation water demand one week in advance the input variables to the forecast model do not necessarily have the same temporal representativeness thus precipitation could have a representative of two days backward the amount of water applied a representative of four days previous evapotranspiration of three days in advance etc this depends on the id and the training set consequently to generalize the methodology developed in this work an lstm encoder decoder was used to address the fixed length limitation of the lstm neural networks however memory based neural networks such as lstms have another major limitation related to a lack of memory and therefore a reduction in the accuracy of the estimations as the forecasting time increases this effect is discussed in results section but it is related to an effect of the chain rule to reduce this major limitation of memory based networks a hybrid model composed of an lstm encoder decoder and a dnn was developed fig 2 thus the lstm encoder decoder model was forced to learn only to extract the input features while the dnn model was responsible for interpreting these input features and providing the output middle term forecasting of irrigation water demand the entire hybrid model was developed with tensorflow v2 9 0 abadi et al 2015 and keras v2 7 0 chollet 2015 in python due to its high performance in most real world applications the optimization algorithm training function adam adaptative momentum was used for training the hybrid model kingma and ba 2015 with an exponential decay rate for the first and second moment of 0 9 and 0 999 respectively glorot uniform initialized algorithm glorot and bengio 2010 was used to initialize all synaptic weights because of its high performance faster convergence when adams training function is used the loss function used during the training process was the mean square error mse this loss function was used because of its ability to consider anomalous behavior of some specific days thus the hybrid model will have the ability to learn not only from usual data but some typical anomalies in the id exceptional situations such as bank holidays big rain events and so on early stopping was used in this work as a form of regularization to avoid overfitting during training process 2 3 1 lstm encoder decoder architecture the lstm encoder decoder architecture is comprised of two models the encoder to read and encode the input time series and the decoder that reads the encoded input encoder features fig 2 t and makes a one step information extraction for each element in the output time series as the forecasting was performed by the dnn model this submodel lstm encoder decoder was only responsible of extracting the most relevant information from the input time series data thus the responsibility of the lstm encoder decoder in the final forecast focused on improving the main limitation of this kind of artificial neural networks such as lack of memory at certain times both encoder and decoder are composed of elementary cells fig 2 each cell of both encoder and decoder is of the lstm neural network type the number of elementary cells establishes the density of the encode decoder model the number of cells of the encoder ncell enc and the decoder ncell dec is not the same necessarily the higher the density of both encoder and decoder the higher the capacity of adaptation and feature extraction however deeply dense encoder decoder models often show problems in the learning process both problems of memorization and training time and instability of the neural network in lstmhybrid ncell enc and ncell de were optimized by the multi objective genetic algorithm nsga ii 2 3 1 1 lstm cell models based on long short term memory neural networks are specially developed to solve time series forecasting issues this kind of neural networks belong to the family of recurrent neural networks rnns which adds memory to this architecture allowing to learn the ordered nature of time series as inputs the state or memory occurs in its recurrent connections fig 3 shows the typical architecture of a lstm cell a lstm cell consists of a set of gates which are recurrently connected blocks memory blocks each lstm cell is able to read write and reset information along the training phase by its input output forget gates and the cell state memory cell this kind of neural networks considers output from previous time steps ht 1 offering feedback to this lstm cell lstm has a feedback loop at every node which allows information to move in both directions and so learning temporal patters of widely separated events additionally input output and forget gates decide which information is forwarded to the next node for a common lstm cell architecture the input gate it forget gate ft cell state st and output gate ot are described as follow the behavior of the input gate it can be characterized according to eq 1 1 i t σ x t u i h t 1 w i where σ represent the sigmoid function xt is the input vector of the cell at time step t ui is the weight matrix that connects the inputs to the hidden layer ht 1 is the hidden state from previous time step t 1 and wi is the recurrent connection between the previous hidden layer and current hidden layer the forget gate ft decides what to forget by a mechanism of sigmoid function according to eq 2 2 f t σ x t u f h t 1 w f where uf is the weight matrix that connects the inputs to the forget layer and wf is the recurrent connection between the previous forget layer and the current forget layer the cell state st represents the memory of the lstm cell eq 3 and information from the earlier time steps can travel to later time steps reducing the effect of short term memory 3 s t σ f t s t 1 i t s t where s t is the candidate hidden state that is computed based on the current input and the previous hidden state eq 4 and st 1 represents the internal memory at the time step t 1 4 s t tanh x t u s h t 1 w s where tanh represents de tanh function us is the weight matrix that connects the inputs to the candidate hidden layer and ws is the recurrent connection between the previous candidate hidden layer and the current candidate hidden layer finally the output gate ot which behavior is defined in eqs 5 and 6 defines the new cell state st and the hidden state at time step t 5 o t σ x t u o h t 1 w o where u is the weight matrix that connects the inputs to the output gate and w is the recurrent connection between the previous candidate hidden layer and the current candidate hidden layer at output gate 6 h t tanh s t o t the aim of the training process in lstm cells and therefore in lstm encoder decoder model is to find the sets of u and w matrixes that minimize the global forecasting error after finishing the training process the forget gate can decide what is relevant to keep from prior steps the input gate decides what information is relevant to add from the current step and the output gate determines what the next hidden state should be 2 3 2 dnn architecture dnn is a multilayer perceptron network rumelhart et al 1986 responsible for the interpretation of each time step in the output time series provided by lstm encoder decoder and for giving the prediction values in its last layer fig 4 shows a shallow dnn architecture which is mainly composed of three blocks input layer hidden layers and output layer in lstmhybrid the output layer and hence the dnn model has been designed to forecast a single step in the output time series not all days defined in the middle term time scale consequently the same dnn model has been used to process each time step provided by the lstm encoder decoder model to achieve this wrapped the dnn model in a time distributed wrapper that allows the wrapped layers to be used for each time step from the lstm encoder decoder model the block of hidden layers is frequently made up of two or more layers each layer is made up of several nodes or neurons which are connected to the next layer s nodes similarly to the lstm encoder decoder model these connections are called synaptic weights and each layer has a synaptic weights matrix which connect the previous layer to the next one in contrast to the lstm encoder decoder all connections of the dnn model are fed forward and therefore the information is only allowed to move from a previous layer to the next one during the training process all these synaptic weights are determined to minimize the global forecasting error each neuron of the hidden layers is activated by an activation function which defines the exited state of each neuron for each input vector the activation function used in this work in all hidden layers is known as relu rectified linear unit activation function eq 7 as it is one of the best activation functions in terms of performance isola et al 2016 karras et al 2020 the number of neurons of the input layer is defined by the number of input variables in this work the number of neurons of the input layer was determined by the number of outputs of the decoder model 7 output neuron max 0 input neuron where inputneuron and outputneuron is the input and output values of each neuron of the hidden layers respectively as with the lstm encoder decoder both the number of the hidden layers and the number of neurons of each of them define the density of the dnn model and must be determined by each problem these hyperparameters are often adjusted by trial and error but this does not ensure the achievement of an optimal forecasting model thus in this work all this hyperparameters were optimized by the nsga ii algorithm 2 4 optimization of the hybrid model the hybrid model proposed in this work was optimized by nsga ii ga fig 5 shows the flow chart of the optimization process of the hybrid model previously described the optimization process starts by randomly generating a set of solutions this initial set is called initial population and has a size of ipop solutions each of these solutions are known as individuals or chromosomes ch of the initial population and are made up of a set of genes or decision variables numgen in this work each gene represents one hyperparameters of the hybrid model to be optimized table 1 shows the genes considered in this work as well as the value range and the data type that each variable can take during the optimization process the first and second gene numgen 1 and numgen 2 defined the number of lstm cells of the encoder and decoder model of the lstm encoder decoder model respectively thus these two genes determined the density of the lstm encoder decoder model the last three genes numgen 3 numgen 4 and numgen 5 determined the density of the dnn model defining the number of hidden layers as well as the number of neurons of theses layer while numgen4 and numgen5 ranged from 0 to 200 numgen3 ranged from 1 to 200 thus the minimum and maximum number of hidden layers of the dnn model was 1 and 3 respectively after initialization of the initial population each chromosome each hybrid model with different architecture was trained after that each of these trained models were tested and the objective function of1 and of2 were computed in this work of1 maximized the average of the r2 determination coefficient of the output hybrid model output time series of irrigation water demand of2 minimized the average of the standard error prediction sep ventura et al 1995 then it was necessary to sort the initial population according to its aptitude i e the forecast capacity of each hybrid model objective functions the best ipop 2 chromosomes were then selected as the best individual of the initial population in the remaining stages the ipop 2 chromosomes were modified crossover and mutation and a new population of ipop individuals was generated the process was repeated for numgen generations finally the set of ipop optimal chromosomes optimal hybrid models obtained in the last generation defined the pareto front in order to minimize the computational cost during the optimization process all hybrid models are trained with restriction of training epochs once the optimization process is finished the hybrid models that form the pareto front are re trained without restrictions obtaining the optimal values for all the synaptic weights of the gates of the lstm encoder decoder as well as the synaptic weights of the dnn model 2 5 identification of the hybrid model inputs the optimal determination of the number of inputs to the hybrid model developed in this work is a key element the input space reduction is essential both to achieve good generalization during the hybrid model production phase and to reduce the computational cost memory and time during the training phase this dimension reduction must identify the significant inputs from the set of possible inputs potential inputs for the forecasting hybrid model pca principal component analysis or pls partial least square cardinal components methods are widely used to achieve this feature space reduction of the hybrid model however when the significant features resulting from these techniques are used in nonlinear models very poor results are usually obtained lin et al 1996 therefore in this work fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces have been used to automatically identify the main features as inputs in the developed hybrid model by adapting the methodology developed by lin et al 1996 this methodology is described as follow for a potential input variable v potiv a fuzzy curve beam cb v was created eq 8 each curve determined the relationship between v and the output variable of the forecasting model target variable which in this work was the daily irrigation water demand iwd of the id 8 cb v poti v k 1 m iwd k μ v k poti v k 1 m μ v k poti v where µ v k is the fuzzy membership function of point k in the space v iwd which relates the potential input variable v and the daily irrigation water demand of the entire id and is defined by eq 9 m is the total number of points in the space potiv iwd and iwd k is the daily irrigation water demand of the entire id in point k of the space poti v iwd 9 μ v k poti v exp poti v k poti v b 2 where poti v k is the value of poti v at point k in the space pi v iwd and b takes a value close to two lin et al 1996 hereafter the mean square error values mse of each cb v curve were computed and sorted in ascending order according to eq 10 if there was a fully random relationship between the input variable v and the iwd the fuzzy curves were flat and the msecb v was large otherwise msecb v took small values when the relationship in the space poti v iwd was more significant 10 mse cb v 1 m k 1 m cb v poti v k iwd k 2 according to lin et al 1996a a fuzzy surface is a space with a two dimensional fuzzy curve this fuzzy surface fsiv ij is defined in eq 11 11 fs v ij poti v poti ij k 1 m iwd k μ v k poti v μ ij k poti ij k 1 m μ v k poti v μ ij k poti ij where poti v and poti ij are two potential input variables then like eq 10 the mse was computed for each fuzzy surface mse fs v ij thus fuzzy curves were initially used to rank all the potential input variables in ascending order the poti variable with the smallest msecb v was the most important input variable fuzzy surfaces were then used to find the independent input variables and to eliminate the related input in each step 20 according to lin et al 1996 therefore in each step new fuzzy surfaces were computed and 20 of the potential input variable with the largest mse fs v ij was eliminated once the most important features were automatically identified the final dataset composed of input variables target was determined finally the dataset was split into three subsets training set validation set and testing set to achieve a good generalization of the hybrid model this division of the original dataset was computed by a monte carlo algorithm maintaining the same mean and standard deviation in the three subsets as the original dataset ballesteros et al 2016 3 results and discussion the lstmhybrid model was applied to czid for the irrigation seasons from 2015 to 2022 with the aim of predicting the water demand at irrigation district level seven days in advance 3 1 inputs of the hybrid model the significant inputs were determined by a combination of fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces according to lin et al 1996 the potential inputs evaluated and selected are shown in table 2 a total of 18 potential inputs were assessed in a temporal frame which ranged from 1 to 10 days before the forecasting day i e each of these 18 potential input variables were evaluated in a combination from 1 to 10 days from t 1 to t 10 in a step of 1 day being t the forecasted day previous to the forecasted day after applying the methodology described in section 2 5 only four input variables were finally selected iwd tave rad eto the representativeness of all these input variables over the target variable iwd were maximum in a temporal frame of 7 days thus the input space of the hybrid model consisted of four time series input variables the time series ranged from t 1 to t 7 for the four input variables the hybrid model is designed to forecast the real behavior of the farmers within the id but not the aggregation of the crop irrigation needs the main difference but not a small one between the two approaches is the irrigation water management by each farmer logically those farmers with better management of their irrigation systems show a smaller gap between the water applied and the actual crop needs however due to many other factors such as socio cultural practices farmers perception based on their experience or peculiarities of the irrigation system there are farmers who are far from the best irrigation practices according to the methodologies developed by gonzález perea et al 2018 2019 the wind chill temperature determined mainly by temperature wind speed and relative humidity is essential to obtain a good estimation of the daily irrigation water demand in an irrigation district this effect of the wind chill of each farmer seems to be blurred when aggregated to a larger spatial scale such as the entire irrigation district this was highlighted by gonzález perea et al 2015 who developed a forecasting system of the daily water demand at the irrigation district level in that model the farmer s wind chill did not appear so clearly in the main input variables of the daily forecasting model time series with a time frame of 2 days of irrigation water demand and reference evapotranspiration and average temperature and solar radiation for the day to predict table 2 selected inputs shows that this tendency of dilution of the effect of the farmer s wind chill when the spatial scale increases is maintained what coincides with previous works findings moreover as the forecasting period increases the previous days of the input variables considered are also longer in this work this time frame for the input variables was of seven days 3 2 optimization process the density which influences the learning and adaptation capacity of the hybrid model both lstm encoder decoder and dnn was optimized by the nsga ii the initial population consisted of 50 chromosomes ipop 50 the value of numgen number of generations is determined by the stabilization of the two objective functions this stabilization was reach at generation number 100 numgen 100 the probabilities for mutation and crossover were set to 10 and 90 respectively fig 6 shows the pareto front which was obtained in the last generation of the optimization process as well as the initial population both populations initial and pareto front were characterized by their objective function of1 and of2 which were always computed over the test set the aim of the optimization process carried out by the nsga ii was the maximization of of1 and the minimization of of2 in this type of optimization problems where the two objective functions are opposed it is usual to find an initial population located in the upper left corner fig 6 however when the initial population at generation 0 was randomly generated the values of their objective functions were closer to the pareto front the lstmhybrid model was based on the lstm encoder decoder which extracts the characteristics of the inputs and the dnn model which interpretates these characteristics to provide an estimation the density of both submodels so their capacity to learn were optimized however other essential hyperparameters of the hybrid model such as the training function adam activation function relu and loss function mse were previously fixed these hyperparameters were previously set according to previous research works findings to solve the problem addressed in this work memory based time series forecasting consequently a certain part of the hybrid model was already optimized generating an initial population located in the region of the of1 of2 space showed in fig 6 this increased the performance of the genetic algorithm reducing both the size of the initial population and the number of generations for the initial population the values of of1 and of2 ranged from 67 69 to 93 05 and from 23 23 to 52 69 respectively the variation of both objective function values in this population was 4 97 and 6 23 respectively after optimization process the population of the last generation pareto front was in the right lower corner of the of1 of2 space fig 6 usual behavior of a two opposite objective functions pareto front the values of of1 and of2 for the pareto front ranged from 93 39 to 94 15 and from 20 49 to 25 29 respectively however the variance of this population was 0 17 for of1 and 1 15 for of2 although the initial population was close to the pareto front the optimization process involved a smaller dispersion variance of the pareto front compared to that of the initial population also improving the values of the objective functions in addition when the input variables of a forecasting model are temporally correlated as in this work where even the variable to be forecasted also appears as input variable of the hybrid model its r2 value is usually high however this effect does not appear in the estimation s accuracy providing models that are not very accurate if they are not well optimized although with a relatively high r2 value thus the pareto front improved in the of2 direction much more than in the of1 direction which means that the improvement in the accuracy was higher than in representativeness in other words as inputs were correlated because of their temporal correlation the optimization of the density made it possible to find much more accurate hybrid models although it also improved their representativeness fig 7 shows the histogram for the number of lstm cells in the lstm encoder decoder submodel for the initial population fig 7a and the pareto front fig 7b the number of lstm cells of encoder and decoder is controlled by the gen numgen 1 and numgen 2 whose values could range from 1 to 500 table 1 as the initial population was randomly created using a uniform distribution so that all values had the same probability of occurrence the frequencies of the number of the lstm cells were similar for encoder and decoder fig 7a after optimization process the optimal lstm cells in both encoder and decoder models were found fig 7b the number of lstm cells of the encoder model for all individuals was 50 cells hence all individuals with more or fewer lstm cells than 50 were eliminated during the optimization process with a density of 50 lstm cells for the irrigation district studied in this work it is enough to encode all its input variables with losing relevant information although this methodology can be applied to other irrigation districts and other input variables the density of the encode model will be different and specific for each irrigation district the density of the decoder model ranged from 400 to 450 lstm cells in 45 individuals and from 350 to 400 lstm cell in 5 individuals however all individuals of the pareto front had a density in the decoder model which ranged from 391 to 410 lstm cells therefore the density of the decoder model is deeper that the encoder model according to these results of the optimization process while encoder model needed only 50 lstm cells to encode the input information decoder model required at least 391 lstm cells to decode this information and pass it to the interpreter dnn submodel this large difference in densities was due to the dnn submodel which needed the information as atomized as possible to make an accurate estimation similarly to the density of the lstm encoder decoder submodel fig 8 shows the histogram for the number of neurons of the first second and third hidden layers of the dnn model for both initial population fig 8a and pareto front fig 8b the number of neurons of the first second and third hidden layers were controlled during the optimization process by the genes numgen 3 numgen 4 and numgen 5 respectively while the number of the first hidden layer ranged from 1 to 200 the neurons of the second and third hidden layer ranged from 0 to 200 i e the minimum number of the hidden layers of the dnn submodel was 1 and maximum number of hidden layers in this submodel was 3 as the initialization of the first two genes numgen 3 numgen 4 and numgen 5 were randomly initialized with a uniform distribution thus the density of the dnn submodel in the initial population was uniformly distributed between all their individuals fig 8a after optimization process all individuals needed three hidden layers no individual with 0 neurons in genes numgen4 and numgen5 were found to optimize the estimations of irrigation water demand for 7 days ahead fig 8b no hidden layers in the individuals of the pareto front showed neuron numbers close to the established lower and upper limits minimum 0 or 1 neuron and maximum 200 neurons if any of these distributions were close to the lower or upper limit it could mean that the range of neurons of some hidden layer was not well selected this would have required increasing this range to complete its optimization process properly the number of neurons of the three hidden layers were gradually increased thus all individuals showed a density in the first hidden layer that ranged from 30 to 37 neurons getting 28 individuals with 33 neurons in this hidden layer the density of the second hidden layer was increased in all individuals of the pareto front ranged their neurons from 87 to 96 a total of 28 individuals of the pareto front had a density of 90 neurons in its second hidden layer although the density variance of this layer was higher than the other two hidden layers the number of neurons in the third hidden layer ranged from 124 to 130 30 individuals of the pareto front had 127 neurons in this hidden layer according to results shown in figs 7 and 8 the lstmhybrid model was made up of 50 lstm cells in encoder model around 400 lstm cells in decoder model three hidden layers in the dnn submodel with a range of neurons of 30 37 87 96 and 124 130 respectively the optimal hybrid model forecasted a time series of irrigation water demand at irrigation district spatial scale and middle term temporal scale 7 days ahead this is a complex task considering the uncertainty associated with the decisions that each farmer makes every day on his farm and the aggregation of all the farmers behavior at id level consequently all the optimal hybrid models those included in the pareto front found by the genetic algorithm were rather dense with millions of parameters in each of them this fact gives an idea of the complexity of the problem to be solved especially in comparison with the models shown in the introduction which had only several thousands of parameters 3 3 optimal hybrid model after the optimization process the optimal hybrid model was selected according to its objective function values hmselected thus fig 6 shows the hybrid model with the higher of1 value 0 9415 and lower of2 value 0 2049 and so selected as the best optimal hybrid model table 3 shows the values of the decision variables numgen 1 numgen 5 for hmselected as well as r2 and sep values hmselected had 50 and 409 lstm cells in the encoder and decoder models respectively of the lstm encoder decoder submodel three hidden layers of 31 96 and 128 neurons were implemented in the dnn submodel hence hmselected had a total of 1 5 million of parameters with this density the hmselected was able to forecast the daily irrigation water demand at a real id for 7 days ahead with an average representativeness value in the test dataset of 94 15 and an accuracy of 20 49 to achieve these mean forecast values the hmselected required four time series of input variables these time series were composed of data from seven days prior to the first forecast day of tave rad eto and iwd the average values of representativeness and accuracy of the hmselected were enough for a proper daily management of the irrigation district moreover the resolution of the hybrid model allowed the almost real time management of the energy demand of the water distribution network when these results were disaggregated by forecast days the r2 and sep values changed r2 decreased while sep increased when the time horizon was higher fig 9 shows the scatterplots between the observed real iwd and estimated iwd for seven days ahead t 1 t 7 of the hmselected applied over the test dataset although the average of the r2 value of hmselected was 94 15 the representativeness of the hmselected varied considerably as the forecast time increased the r2 value ranged from 97 06 for t 1 to 85 49 for t 7 similarly the accuracy of the hmselected decreased as forecast time increased the sep value of the hmselected ranged from 16 42 for t 1 to 22 31 to t 7 thus the hmselected forecast capability diminished when the forecast time increased it should be noted that the hybrid model developed in this work is based on memory although this type of model architecture is optimal for time series forecast a very large number of lstm cells are chained in both encoder and decoder models the training process of the hybrid model used backpropagation method to update the neural networks weights in the direction in which the error function decreases most rapidly the negative of the gradient therefore the correction of all weights of the hybrid model both lstm encoder decoder submodel and dnn submodel is backward when this backpropagation method is applied to architectures with memory a memory leakage effect appears in the initial lstm cells this effect caused as a vanishing of the error gradient and the chain rule makes the hybrid model more insensitive to the inputs of the time series further back in time the first to enter in the hybrid model causing a loss of memory in this work the hybrid architecture attempted to reduce this effect by limiting the workload of the part of the hybrid model based on memory lstm encoder decoder the full workload was divided into the lstm encoder decoder and the dnn submodels however this alzheimer s effect of the neural networks based on memory is still present albeit with a lower impact future work on this approach should look at new artificial neural network architectures currently under development such as those based on attention based on transformer models rather than memory which eliminate this problem completely this will improve the accuracy and representativeness of newly developed models 4 conclusions several works for short term forecast of daily irrigation water demand at two spatial resolutions farm and irrigation district levels were previously developed however although some of them offered very accurate forecasts the temporal resolution is not wide enough to properly manage an id in this work a novel methodology to develop a hybrid model based on memory to forecast the daily irrigation water demand at middle term time scale 7 days ahead was presented the hybrid model was optimized by the genetic algorithm nsga ii to maximize and minimize the representativeness and accuracy of their estimations applied to a real id the model inputs were also optimized by fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces obtaining four input variables t ave rad eto and iwd as times series in a frame of seven days for the developed hybrid model results showed that the irrigation water demand forecast for seven days in advance in an irrigation district is a complex task requiring a dense hybrid model the hybrid model selected after the optimization process had more than 1 5 million of parameters this hybrid model selected as optimum consisted of 50 lstm cells and 409 lstm cells in the lstm encoder decoder submodels and three hidden layers with 31 96 128 neurons respectively in the dnn submodel the average representativeness of the model was greater than 94 with an average accuracy in their estimations of around 20 to date the forecast model developed in this work is the most accurate at the spatio temporal scale addressed however this hybrid model is memory based and often shows memory leakage effects as the forecast time increases although an attempt was made to minimize this memory leakage effect by reducing the workload of the memory part of the forecast model lstm encoder decoder submodel and expanding with a dnn submodel this alzheimer effect could be observed in the results obtained nevertheless thanks to the hybrid model this memory leakage effect is minimum this model can be very useful for managers since it offers accurate predictions of water demand which plays an essential

8929,the energy demand and their associated costs in pressurized irrigation networks together with water scarcity are currently causing serious challenges for irrigation district s id managers additionally most of the new water distribution networks in ids have been designed to be operated on demand complexing id managers the daily decision making process the knowledge of the water demand several days in advance would facilitate the management of the system and would help to optimize the water use and energy costs for an efficient management and optimization of the water energy nexus in ids longer term forecasting models are needed in this work a new hybrid model called lstmhybrid combining fuzzy logic fl genetic algorithm ga lstm encoder decoder and dense or full connected neural networks dnn for the one week forecasting of irrigation water demand at id scale has been developed lstmhybrid was developed in python and applied to a real id the optimal input variables for lstmhydrid were mean temperature c reference evapotranspiration mm solar radiation mj m 2 and irrigation water demand of the id m3 from 1 to 7 days prior to the first day of prediction the optimal lstmhybrid model selected consisted of 50 lstm cells in the encoder submodel 409 lstm cells in the decoder submodel and three hidden layers in the dnn submodel with 31 96 and 128 neurons in each hidden layer respectively thus lstmhybrid had a total of 1 5 million parameters obtaining a representativeness higher than 94 and an accuracy around of 20 keywords artificial intelligence irrigation pressurized water networks deep learning machine learning data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction irrigation is regarded as one of the main adaptations to support crop production in response to population growth fao 2016 2015 rodríguez díaz et al 2007 however it must be a precision activity where the right amount of water is applied just when it is needed by the crop hedley et al 2014 thus pressurized irrigation systems which are managed by irrigation districts ids are one of the best options to increase water use efficiency daccache et al 2014a 2014b additionally in last two decades the flexibility in the irrigation operation by farmers has been increase because of the new pressurized irrigation networks after modernization process these new water distribution networks for irrigation make water available to farmers 24 h a day thus farmers can decides every day its irrigation scheduling how and when to irrigate playán and mateos 2006 rodríguez díaz et al 2011 tarjuelo et al 2015 however this increase in the availability of water by farmers makes the integrated management of the id a complex task the hydraulic systems must work under a wide range of hydraulic operation conditions managers of these ids do not know when their users farmers are going to irrigate and at what time making it difficult to optimize all the system pumping stations failures repairs energy purchases etc thus the uncertainty associated with irrigation water demands in water distribution networks which are operated on demand plusquellec 2009 and the uncertainty of the electricity market in spain last deep change on 1st june 2021 are generating challenges in the daily management of irrigation districts mainly in arid and semiarid regions such as spain in addition an accurate prediction of water demand would allow for optimal network management measures to reduce energy demand nowadays in the new age of digitalization icts information and communication technologies and intelligent algorithms based on artificial intelligence ai are essential to increase and improve the precision agriculture management particularly in the control of the water energy management in pressurized irrigation systems kamilaris and prenafeta boldú 2018 wolfert et al 2017 traditional strategies to save water and energy in id such as critical point management sectorization etc derardja et al 2019 fernández garcía et al 2016 gonzález perea et al 2016 rodríguez díaz et al 2012 frequently reduce farmers water management flexibility diminishing the positive aspects of the irrigation modernization process on demand irrigation thus new water and energy optimization strategies id are necessary but without reducing the decision making power of farmers based on intelligent models which forecasts this farmer behavior traditionally one of the main drawbacks to implementing new intelligent data driven models is the availability and cost of obtaining this information however the recent revolution of the icts as well as the development of new low cost sensors capable to automatically collect on real time thousands of robust data and the exploitation of ai have modified the technological environment of the current irrigated agriculture based on machine learning from data all these technologies offer new possibilities for water energy nexus management in ids leading to increased use efficiencies of these resources making the ids more sustainable in environmental social and economic aspects based on ai techniques water demand forecasting will allow the entire water distribution network from pumping station to hydrant to be adapted to operate as efficiently as possible reducing the uncertainty caused by on demand irrigation optimizing all its resources thus real water demand forecasting could be one of the main tools to improve ids operation and help managers in the daily decision making processes but without reducing farmers degree of freedom ai icts and bigdata have been applied to solve some forecasting issues mainly of a time series nature in precision irrigation ids and pressurized irrigation networks since it was first published in its full version in the early 2000s graves and schmidhuber 2005 long short term memory lstm neural network is the most widely used type of artificial neural network for solving time series forecasting problems its recurrent connection adds state or memory to this neural network and allow it to learn and harness the ordered nature of input time series thus lstm has become the most cited neural network of the 20th century at id scale ground water level estimations and irrigation demand forecasting are two of the main topics addressed for water energy optimization based on ai and bigdata a new model based on lstm neural network for water table depth forecasting in agricultural areas was developed by zhang et al 2018 this model was applied in five sub areas of hetao irrigation district china using a time series of 14 years results showed that the developed model can serve as an alternative approach as opposed of physical models predicting water table depth especially in areas where hydrogeological data are difficult to obtain a combination of lstm neural network with arima autoregressive integrated moving average model was proposed by sheikh khozani et al 2022 to predict ground water level yazd ardekn plain in iran the architecture of this hybrid model was optimized by the salp swarm algorithm ssa sine cosine optimization algorithm scoa particle swarm optimization algorithm psoa and genetic algorithm ga despite the lower values of mae mean absolute error which ranged from 5 to 47 general results indicated that an increased forecasting horizon reduced the accuracy of the model this problem is regularly found in forecasting model based on memory such as lstm and all its modifications no many works can be found for farmer behavior forecasting and so the real irrigation demand in ids the estimation of the water demand in an id can be approached at different spatial and temporal scales at spatial scale farm and irrigation district scale can be distinguished on the other hand at temporal scale short one day middle around a week and long several weeks terms scales can be recognized at present there are not long term forecasting models either at farm or water user association level however some forecasting models have been developed for the rest of the spatial and temporal scales at short term time scale pulido calvo and gutiérrez estrada 2009 developed a hybrid model combining dnns dense neural networks fuzzy logic fl and ga genetic algorithm to forecast one day ahead daily water demand at irrigation district spatial scale a major limitation of this model was the determination of the neural network architecture by trial and error consequently the standard error prediction sep of the model was around 25 this limitation was addressed by gonzález perea et al 2015 which developed a new methodology to optimize the dnn architecture by ga to the short term forecasting of daily irrigation water demand at irrigation district level results showed sep values close to 10 improving the accuracy obtained by other models to date the short term forecasting at farm level was addressed in previous works gonzález perea et al 2019 2018 2021 where three models addressed the forecast of the occurrence of the irrigation events gonzález perea et al 2019 the daily applied irrigation depth gonzález perea et al 2018 and the hourly distribution according to electricity tariff of the daily applied irrigation depth gonzález perea et al 2021 forouhar et al 2022 developed a hybrid framework by incorporating existing physical knowledge conceptual model to understood factors leading to crop water needs using observation data of the system into a data driven model to predict the irrigation water demand up to 7 days ahead for an irrigation district in victoria australia however although results showed that the integration of physical system understanding into data driven models can improve the performance of the predictions the accuracy of the results are not enough for an integrated management of water and energy resources in ids gonzalez perea et al 2021 developed a model to predict the demand seven days ahead but at farm level they combined ai techniques satellite remote sensing and open source climate data to optimize the irrigation water forecasting at farm level for a week in advance however although sep values ranged from 17 to 19 the one week estimation was addressed as a single point not distinguishing between days but for a whole week consequently the accuracy of short term forecasting models for different spatial scales are good but are not enough to be considered in the day to day management of ids short term forecasting models do not have enough time resolution for a holistic management of the ids thus longer term forecasting models would be much more useful for managers to know in advance how much water will be required and hence how much energy should be needed this will involve a more efficient use of water and energy resources and a cost effective purchase of the electric energy however the already developed models are either not developed yet or the accuracy achieved is not adequate for its incorporation into the daily management of the id thus with the main objective of overcoming these limitations in this work a new hybrid model combining fl ga lstm encoder decoder and dense or full connected neural networks dnn for the one week forecast of irrigation water demand at irrigation district scale has been developed this model called lstmhybrid is based on artificial memory and has been developed in python programming language v3 9 van et al 2009 and tested in a real id 2 methodology 2 1 study area and data source the study area where the developed methodology has been applied is in extremadura region southwest span fig 1 shows the location of this real id called canal del zújar irrigation district czid this id consists of ten independent hydraulic sectors the methodology is applied on sector ii of this id czid applied irrigation water through a pressurized irrigation network which is organized on demand czid sector ii convers a total irrigated area of 2691 ha and 191 hydrants tomato rice and maize are the main crops covering more than 90 of the total irrigated area each hydrant of czid sector ii has a flowmeter which automatically records the hourly volume of water applied the complete cleaned dataset of the daily irrigation water demand contained a total of 1849 measures from 2015 to 2022 irrigation seasons this dataset was randomly divided into three subsets training dataset 70 of the total measures of the original dataset validation dataset 15 of the total measures of the original dataset and testing dataset 15 of the total measures of the original dataset the utm coordinates of the closest agro weather station are 252 468 431 917 and 30 for x y and zone respectively the average annual evapotranspiration and precipitation are 1296 mm and 390 mm respectively the average maximum and minimum temperatures range from 23 c to 35 1 c 2 2 problem approach the stated problem focused on the development of a new methodology to determinate the optimal forecasting model of water demand at irrigation district level one week ahead in advance to address this issue the problem has been approached as time series forecasting problem many ai techniques particularly in deep learning can address time series prediction however due to the nature of their architecture not all the deep learning models are specially designed for this issue typically rnns recurrent neural networks are the family of deep learning models for processing sequential data i e time series previous scientific works have highlighted that the most effective time series models used in practical applications are those based on lstm neural networks afzaal et al 2020 ferreira and da cunha 2020 yin et al 2020 however memory based neural networks usually have accuracy problems as the forecasting time increases to mitigate this middle term memory leakage effect the model developed in this work optimizes a hybrid architecture composed of an encoder decoder architecture whose elementary cell includes a lstm neural network and a dnn fig 2 the hyperparameters of this hybrid architecture were optimized by the multiobjective genetic algorithm nsga ii deb et al 2002 and the identification of the forecasting model inputs were optimized by fl according to the methodology developed by lin et al 1996 2 3 hybrid model architecture typically lstm neural networks as other rnns can map an input sequence time series to an output sequence of the same dimension fixed size vector however in many real applications such as water irrigation forecasting in ids inputs and outputs sequences are not necessary of the same length for example if the aim is to forecast irrigation water demand one week in advance the input variables to the forecast model do not necessarily have the same temporal representativeness thus precipitation could have a representative of two days backward the amount of water applied a representative of four days previous evapotranspiration of three days in advance etc this depends on the id and the training set consequently to generalize the methodology developed in this work an lstm encoder decoder was used to address the fixed length limitation of the lstm neural networks however memory based neural networks such as lstms have another major limitation related to a lack of memory and therefore a reduction in the accuracy of the estimations as the forecasting time increases this effect is discussed in results section but it is related to an effect of the chain rule to reduce this major limitation of memory based networks a hybrid model composed of an lstm encoder decoder and a dnn was developed fig 2 thus the lstm encoder decoder model was forced to learn only to extract the input features while the dnn model was responsible for interpreting these input features and providing the output middle term forecasting of irrigation water demand the entire hybrid model was developed with tensorflow v2 9 0 abadi et al 2015 and keras v2 7 0 chollet 2015 in python due to its high performance in most real world applications the optimization algorithm training function adam adaptative momentum was used for training the hybrid model kingma and ba 2015 with an exponential decay rate for the first and second moment of 0 9 and 0 999 respectively glorot uniform initialized algorithm glorot and bengio 2010 was used to initialize all synaptic weights because of its high performance faster convergence when adams training function is used the loss function used during the training process was the mean square error mse this loss function was used because of its ability to consider anomalous behavior of some specific days thus the hybrid model will have the ability to learn not only from usual data but some typical anomalies in the id exceptional situations such as bank holidays big rain events and so on early stopping was used in this work as a form of regularization to avoid overfitting during training process 2 3 1 lstm encoder decoder architecture the lstm encoder decoder architecture is comprised of two models the encoder to read and encode the input time series and the decoder that reads the encoded input encoder features fig 2 t and makes a one step information extraction for each element in the output time series as the forecasting was performed by the dnn model this submodel lstm encoder decoder was only responsible of extracting the most relevant information from the input time series data thus the responsibility of the lstm encoder decoder in the final forecast focused on improving the main limitation of this kind of artificial neural networks such as lack of memory at certain times both encoder and decoder are composed of elementary cells fig 2 each cell of both encoder and decoder is of the lstm neural network type the number of elementary cells establishes the density of the encode decoder model the number of cells of the encoder ncell enc and the decoder ncell dec is not the same necessarily the higher the density of both encoder and decoder the higher the capacity of adaptation and feature extraction however deeply dense encoder decoder models often show problems in the learning process both problems of memorization and training time and instability of the neural network in lstmhybrid ncell enc and ncell de were optimized by the multi objective genetic algorithm nsga ii 2 3 1 1 lstm cell models based on long short term memory neural networks are specially developed to solve time series forecasting issues this kind of neural networks belong to the family of recurrent neural networks rnns which adds memory to this architecture allowing to learn the ordered nature of time series as inputs the state or memory occurs in its recurrent connections fig 3 shows the typical architecture of a lstm cell a lstm cell consists of a set of gates which are recurrently connected blocks memory blocks each lstm cell is able to read write and reset information along the training phase by its input output forget gates and the cell state memory cell this kind of neural networks considers output from previous time steps ht 1 offering feedback to this lstm cell lstm has a feedback loop at every node which allows information to move in both directions and so learning temporal patters of widely separated events additionally input output and forget gates decide which information is forwarded to the next node for a common lstm cell architecture the input gate it forget gate ft cell state st and output gate ot are described as follow the behavior of the input gate it can be characterized according to eq 1 1 i t σ x t u i h t 1 w i where σ represent the sigmoid function xt is the input vector of the cell at time step t ui is the weight matrix that connects the inputs to the hidden layer ht 1 is the hidden state from previous time step t 1 and wi is the recurrent connection between the previous hidden layer and current hidden layer the forget gate ft decides what to forget by a mechanism of sigmoid function according to eq 2 2 f t σ x t u f h t 1 w f where uf is the weight matrix that connects the inputs to the forget layer and wf is the recurrent connection between the previous forget layer and the current forget layer the cell state st represents the memory of the lstm cell eq 3 and information from the earlier time steps can travel to later time steps reducing the effect of short term memory 3 s t σ f t s t 1 i t s t where s t is the candidate hidden state that is computed based on the current input and the previous hidden state eq 4 and st 1 represents the internal memory at the time step t 1 4 s t tanh x t u s h t 1 w s where tanh represents de tanh function us is the weight matrix that connects the inputs to the candidate hidden layer and ws is the recurrent connection between the previous candidate hidden layer and the current candidate hidden layer finally the output gate ot which behavior is defined in eqs 5 and 6 defines the new cell state st and the hidden state at time step t 5 o t σ x t u o h t 1 w o where u is the weight matrix that connects the inputs to the output gate and w is the recurrent connection between the previous candidate hidden layer and the current candidate hidden layer at output gate 6 h t tanh s t o t the aim of the training process in lstm cells and therefore in lstm encoder decoder model is to find the sets of u and w matrixes that minimize the global forecasting error after finishing the training process the forget gate can decide what is relevant to keep from prior steps the input gate decides what information is relevant to add from the current step and the output gate determines what the next hidden state should be 2 3 2 dnn architecture dnn is a multilayer perceptron network rumelhart et al 1986 responsible for the interpretation of each time step in the output time series provided by lstm encoder decoder and for giving the prediction values in its last layer fig 4 shows a shallow dnn architecture which is mainly composed of three blocks input layer hidden layers and output layer in lstmhybrid the output layer and hence the dnn model has been designed to forecast a single step in the output time series not all days defined in the middle term time scale consequently the same dnn model has been used to process each time step provided by the lstm encoder decoder model to achieve this wrapped the dnn model in a time distributed wrapper that allows the wrapped layers to be used for each time step from the lstm encoder decoder model the block of hidden layers is frequently made up of two or more layers each layer is made up of several nodes or neurons which are connected to the next layer s nodes similarly to the lstm encoder decoder model these connections are called synaptic weights and each layer has a synaptic weights matrix which connect the previous layer to the next one in contrast to the lstm encoder decoder all connections of the dnn model are fed forward and therefore the information is only allowed to move from a previous layer to the next one during the training process all these synaptic weights are determined to minimize the global forecasting error each neuron of the hidden layers is activated by an activation function which defines the exited state of each neuron for each input vector the activation function used in this work in all hidden layers is known as relu rectified linear unit activation function eq 7 as it is one of the best activation functions in terms of performance isola et al 2016 karras et al 2020 the number of neurons of the input layer is defined by the number of input variables in this work the number of neurons of the input layer was determined by the number of outputs of the decoder model 7 output neuron max 0 input neuron where inputneuron and outputneuron is the input and output values of each neuron of the hidden layers respectively as with the lstm encoder decoder both the number of the hidden layers and the number of neurons of each of them define the density of the dnn model and must be determined by each problem these hyperparameters are often adjusted by trial and error but this does not ensure the achievement of an optimal forecasting model thus in this work all this hyperparameters were optimized by the nsga ii algorithm 2 4 optimization of the hybrid model the hybrid model proposed in this work was optimized by nsga ii ga fig 5 shows the flow chart of the optimization process of the hybrid model previously described the optimization process starts by randomly generating a set of solutions this initial set is called initial population and has a size of ipop solutions each of these solutions are known as individuals or chromosomes ch of the initial population and are made up of a set of genes or decision variables numgen in this work each gene represents one hyperparameters of the hybrid model to be optimized table 1 shows the genes considered in this work as well as the value range and the data type that each variable can take during the optimization process the first and second gene numgen 1 and numgen 2 defined the number of lstm cells of the encoder and decoder model of the lstm encoder decoder model respectively thus these two genes determined the density of the lstm encoder decoder model the last three genes numgen 3 numgen 4 and numgen 5 determined the density of the dnn model defining the number of hidden layers as well as the number of neurons of theses layer while numgen4 and numgen5 ranged from 0 to 200 numgen3 ranged from 1 to 200 thus the minimum and maximum number of hidden layers of the dnn model was 1 and 3 respectively after initialization of the initial population each chromosome each hybrid model with different architecture was trained after that each of these trained models were tested and the objective function of1 and of2 were computed in this work of1 maximized the average of the r2 determination coefficient of the output hybrid model output time series of irrigation water demand of2 minimized the average of the standard error prediction sep ventura et al 1995 then it was necessary to sort the initial population according to its aptitude i e the forecast capacity of each hybrid model objective functions the best ipop 2 chromosomes were then selected as the best individual of the initial population in the remaining stages the ipop 2 chromosomes were modified crossover and mutation and a new population of ipop individuals was generated the process was repeated for numgen generations finally the set of ipop optimal chromosomes optimal hybrid models obtained in the last generation defined the pareto front in order to minimize the computational cost during the optimization process all hybrid models are trained with restriction of training epochs once the optimization process is finished the hybrid models that form the pareto front are re trained without restrictions obtaining the optimal values for all the synaptic weights of the gates of the lstm encoder decoder as well as the synaptic weights of the dnn model 2 5 identification of the hybrid model inputs the optimal determination of the number of inputs to the hybrid model developed in this work is a key element the input space reduction is essential both to achieve good generalization during the hybrid model production phase and to reduce the computational cost memory and time during the training phase this dimension reduction must identify the significant inputs from the set of possible inputs potential inputs for the forecasting hybrid model pca principal component analysis or pls partial least square cardinal components methods are widely used to achieve this feature space reduction of the hybrid model however when the significant features resulting from these techniques are used in nonlinear models very poor results are usually obtained lin et al 1996 therefore in this work fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces have been used to automatically identify the main features as inputs in the developed hybrid model by adapting the methodology developed by lin et al 1996 this methodology is described as follow for a potential input variable v potiv a fuzzy curve beam cb v was created eq 8 each curve determined the relationship between v and the output variable of the forecasting model target variable which in this work was the daily irrigation water demand iwd of the id 8 cb v poti v k 1 m iwd k μ v k poti v k 1 m μ v k poti v where µ v k is the fuzzy membership function of point k in the space v iwd which relates the potential input variable v and the daily irrigation water demand of the entire id and is defined by eq 9 m is the total number of points in the space potiv iwd and iwd k is the daily irrigation water demand of the entire id in point k of the space poti v iwd 9 μ v k poti v exp poti v k poti v b 2 where poti v k is the value of poti v at point k in the space pi v iwd and b takes a value close to two lin et al 1996 hereafter the mean square error values mse of each cb v curve were computed and sorted in ascending order according to eq 10 if there was a fully random relationship between the input variable v and the iwd the fuzzy curves were flat and the msecb v was large otherwise msecb v took small values when the relationship in the space poti v iwd was more significant 10 mse cb v 1 m k 1 m cb v poti v k iwd k 2 according to lin et al 1996a a fuzzy surface is a space with a two dimensional fuzzy curve this fuzzy surface fsiv ij is defined in eq 11 11 fs v ij poti v poti ij k 1 m iwd k μ v k poti v μ ij k poti ij k 1 m μ v k poti v μ ij k poti ij where poti v and poti ij are two potential input variables then like eq 10 the mse was computed for each fuzzy surface mse fs v ij thus fuzzy curves were initially used to rank all the potential input variables in ascending order the poti variable with the smallest msecb v was the most important input variable fuzzy surfaces were then used to find the independent input variables and to eliminate the related input in each step 20 according to lin et al 1996 therefore in each step new fuzzy surfaces were computed and 20 of the potential input variable with the largest mse fs v ij was eliminated once the most important features were automatically identified the final dataset composed of input variables target was determined finally the dataset was split into three subsets training set validation set and testing set to achieve a good generalization of the hybrid model this division of the original dataset was computed by a monte carlo algorithm maintaining the same mean and standard deviation in the three subsets as the original dataset ballesteros et al 2016 3 results and discussion the lstmhybrid model was applied to czid for the irrigation seasons from 2015 to 2022 with the aim of predicting the water demand at irrigation district level seven days in advance 3 1 inputs of the hybrid model the significant inputs were determined by a combination of fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces according to lin et al 1996 the potential inputs evaluated and selected are shown in table 2 a total of 18 potential inputs were assessed in a temporal frame which ranged from 1 to 10 days before the forecasting day i e each of these 18 potential input variables were evaluated in a combination from 1 to 10 days from t 1 to t 10 in a step of 1 day being t the forecasted day previous to the forecasted day after applying the methodology described in section 2 5 only four input variables were finally selected iwd tave rad eto the representativeness of all these input variables over the target variable iwd were maximum in a temporal frame of 7 days thus the input space of the hybrid model consisted of four time series input variables the time series ranged from t 1 to t 7 for the four input variables the hybrid model is designed to forecast the real behavior of the farmers within the id but not the aggregation of the crop irrigation needs the main difference but not a small one between the two approaches is the irrigation water management by each farmer logically those farmers with better management of their irrigation systems show a smaller gap between the water applied and the actual crop needs however due to many other factors such as socio cultural practices farmers perception based on their experience or peculiarities of the irrigation system there are farmers who are far from the best irrigation practices according to the methodologies developed by gonzález perea et al 2018 2019 the wind chill temperature determined mainly by temperature wind speed and relative humidity is essential to obtain a good estimation of the daily irrigation water demand in an irrigation district this effect of the wind chill of each farmer seems to be blurred when aggregated to a larger spatial scale such as the entire irrigation district this was highlighted by gonzález perea et al 2015 who developed a forecasting system of the daily water demand at the irrigation district level in that model the farmer s wind chill did not appear so clearly in the main input variables of the daily forecasting model time series with a time frame of 2 days of irrigation water demand and reference evapotranspiration and average temperature and solar radiation for the day to predict table 2 selected inputs shows that this tendency of dilution of the effect of the farmer s wind chill when the spatial scale increases is maintained what coincides with previous works findings moreover as the forecasting period increases the previous days of the input variables considered are also longer in this work this time frame for the input variables was of seven days 3 2 optimization process the density which influences the learning and adaptation capacity of the hybrid model both lstm encoder decoder and dnn was optimized by the nsga ii the initial population consisted of 50 chromosomes ipop 50 the value of numgen number of generations is determined by the stabilization of the two objective functions this stabilization was reach at generation number 100 numgen 100 the probabilities for mutation and crossover were set to 10 and 90 respectively fig 6 shows the pareto front which was obtained in the last generation of the optimization process as well as the initial population both populations initial and pareto front were characterized by their objective function of1 and of2 which were always computed over the test set the aim of the optimization process carried out by the nsga ii was the maximization of of1 and the minimization of of2 in this type of optimization problems where the two objective functions are opposed it is usual to find an initial population located in the upper left corner fig 6 however when the initial population at generation 0 was randomly generated the values of their objective functions were closer to the pareto front the lstmhybrid model was based on the lstm encoder decoder which extracts the characteristics of the inputs and the dnn model which interpretates these characteristics to provide an estimation the density of both submodels so their capacity to learn were optimized however other essential hyperparameters of the hybrid model such as the training function adam activation function relu and loss function mse were previously fixed these hyperparameters were previously set according to previous research works findings to solve the problem addressed in this work memory based time series forecasting consequently a certain part of the hybrid model was already optimized generating an initial population located in the region of the of1 of2 space showed in fig 6 this increased the performance of the genetic algorithm reducing both the size of the initial population and the number of generations for the initial population the values of of1 and of2 ranged from 67 69 to 93 05 and from 23 23 to 52 69 respectively the variation of both objective function values in this population was 4 97 and 6 23 respectively after optimization process the population of the last generation pareto front was in the right lower corner of the of1 of2 space fig 6 usual behavior of a two opposite objective functions pareto front the values of of1 and of2 for the pareto front ranged from 93 39 to 94 15 and from 20 49 to 25 29 respectively however the variance of this population was 0 17 for of1 and 1 15 for of2 although the initial population was close to the pareto front the optimization process involved a smaller dispersion variance of the pareto front compared to that of the initial population also improving the values of the objective functions in addition when the input variables of a forecasting model are temporally correlated as in this work where even the variable to be forecasted also appears as input variable of the hybrid model its r2 value is usually high however this effect does not appear in the estimation s accuracy providing models that are not very accurate if they are not well optimized although with a relatively high r2 value thus the pareto front improved in the of2 direction much more than in the of1 direction which means that the improvement in the accuracy was higher than in representativeness in other words as inputs were correlated because of their temporal correlation the optimization of the density made it possible to find much more accurate hybrid models although it also improved their representativeness fig 7 shows the histogram for the number of lstm cells in the lstm encoder decoder submodel for the initial population fig 7a and the pareto front fig 7b the number of lstm cells of encoder and decoder is controlled by the gen numgen 1 and numgen 2 whose values could range from 1 to 500 table 1 as the initial population was randomly created using a uniform distribution so that all values had the same probability of occurrence the frequencies of the number of the lstm cells were similar for encoder and decoder fig 7a after optimization process the optimal lstm cells in both encoder and decoder models were found fig 7b the number of lstm cells of the encoder model for all individuals was 50 cells hence all individuals with more or fewer lstm cells than 50 were eliminated during the optimization process with a density of 50 lstm cells for the irrigation district studied in this work it is enough to encode all its input variables with losing relevant information although this methodology can be applied to other irrigation districts and other input variables the density of the encode model will be different and specific for each irrigation district the density of the decoder model ranged from 400 to 450 lstm cells in 45 individuals and from 350 to 400 lstm cell in 5 individuals however all individuals of the pareto front had a density in the decoder model which ranged from 391 to 410 lstm cells therefore the density of the decoder model is deeper that the encoder model according to these results of the optimization process while encoder model needed only 50 lstm cells to encode the input information decoder model required at least 391 lstm cells to decode this information and pass it to the interpreter dnn submodel this large difference in densities was due to the dnn submodel which needed the information as atomized as possible to make an accurate estimation similarly to the density of the lstm encoder decoder submodel fig 8 shows the histogram for the number of neurons of the first second and third hidden layers of the dnn model for both initial population fig 8a and pareto front fig 8b the number of neurons of the first second and third hidden layers were controlled during the optimization process by the genes numgen 3 numgen 4 and numgen 5 respectively while the number of the first hidden layer ranged from 1 to 200 the neurons of the second and third hidden layer ranged from 0 to 200 i e the minimum number of the hidden layers of the dnn submodel was 1 and maximum number of hidden layers in this submodel was 3 as the initialization of the first two genes numgen 3 numgen 4 and numgen 5 were randomly initialized with a uniform distribution thus the density of the dnn submodel in the initial population was uniformly distributed between all their individuals fig 8a after optimization process all individuals needed three hidden layers no individual with 0 neurons in genes numgen4 and numgen5 were found to optimize the estimations of irrigation water demand for 7 days ahead fig 8b no hidden layers in the individuals of the pareto front showed neuron numbers close to the established lower and upper limits minimum 0 or 1 neuron and maximum 200 neurons if any of these distributions were close to the lower or upper limit it could mean that the range of neurons of some hidden layer was not well selected this would have required increasing this range to complete its optimization process properly the number of neurons of the three hidden layers were gradually increased thus all individuals showed a density in the first hidden layer that ranged from 30 to 37 neurons getting 28 individuals with 33 neurons in this hidden layer the density of the second hidden layer was increased in all individuals of the pareto front ranged their neurons from 87 to 96 a total of 28 individuals of the pareto front had a density of 90 neurons in its second hidden layer although the density variance of this layer was higher than the other two hidden layers the number of neurons in the third hidden layer ranged from 124 to 130 30 individuals of the pareto front had 127 neurons in this hidden layer according to results shown in figs 7 and 8 the lstmhybrid model was made up of 50 lstm cells in encoder model around 400 lstm cells in decoder model three hidden layers in the dnn submodel with a range of neurons of 30 37 87 96 and 124 130 respectively the optimal hybrid model forecasted a time series of irrigation water demand at irrigation district spatial scale and middle term temporal scale 7 days ahead this is a complex task considering the uncertainty associated with the decisions that each farmer makes every day on his farm and the aggregation of all the farmers behavior at id level consequently all the optimal hybrid models those included in the pareto front found by the genetic algorithm were rather dense with millions of parameters in each of them this fact gives an idea of the complexity of the problem to be solved especially in comparison with the models shown in the introduction which had only several thousands of parameters 3 3 optimal hybrid model after the optimization process the optimal hybrid model was selected according to its objective function values hmselected thus fig 6 shows the hybrid model with the higher of1 value 0 9415 and lower of2 value 0 2049 and so selected as the best optimal hybrid model table 3 shows the values of the decision variables numgen 1 numgen 5 for hmselected as well as r2 and sep values hmselected had 50 and 409 lstm cells in the encoder and decoder models respectively of the lstm encoder decoder submodel three hidden layers of 31 96 and 128 neurons were implemented in the dnn submodel hence hmselected had a total of 1 5 million of parameters with this density the hmselected was able to forecast the daily irrigation water demand at a real id for 7 days ahead with an average representativeness value in the test dataset of 94 15 and an accuracy of 20 49 to achieve these mean forecast values the hmselected required four time series of input variables these time series were composed of data from seven days prior to the first forecast day of tave rad eto and iwd the average values of representativeness and accuracy of the hmselected were enough for a proper daily management of the irrigation district moreover the resolution of the hybrid model allowed the almost real time management of the energy demand of the water distribution network when these results were disaggregated by forecast days the r2 and sep values changed r2 decreased while sep increased when the time horizon was higher fig 9 shows the scatterplots between the observed real iwd and estimated iwd for seven days ahead t 1 t 7 of the hmselected applied over the test dataset although the average of the r2 value of hmselected was 94 15 the representativeness of the hmselected varied considerably as the forecast time increased the r2 value ranged from 97 06 for t 1 to 85 49 for t 7 similarly the accuracy of the hmselected decreased as forecast time increased the sep value of the hmselected ranged from 16 42 for t 1 to 22 31 to t 7 thus the hmselected forecast capability diminished when the forecast time increased it should be noted that the hybrid model developed in this work is based on memory although this type of model architecture is optimal for time series forecast a very large number of lstm cells are chained in both encoder and decoder models the training process of the hybrid model used backpropagation method to update the neural networks weights in the direction in which the error function decreases most rapidly the negative of the gradient therefore the correction of all weights of the hybrid model both lstm encoder decoder submodel and dnn submodel is backward when this backpropagation method is applied to architectures with memory a memory leakage effect appears in the initial lstm cells this effect caused as a vanishing of the error gradient and the chain rule makes the hybrid model more insensitive to the inputs of the time series further back in time the first to enter in the hybrid model causing a loss of memory in this work the hybrid architecture attempted to reduce this effect by limiting the workload of the part of the hybrid model based on memory lstm encoder decoder the full workload was divided into the lstm encoder decoder and the dnn submodels however this alzheimer s effect of the neural networks based on memory is still present albeit with a lower impact future work on this approach should look at new artificial neural network architectures currently under development such as those based on attention based on transformer models rather than memory which eliminate this problem completely this will improve the accuracy and representativeness of newly developed models 4 conclusions several works for short term forecast of daily irrigation water demand at two spatial resolutions farm and irrigation district levels were previously developed however although some of them offered very accurate forecasts the temporal resolution is not wide enough to properly manage an id in this work a novel methodology to develop a hybrid model based on memory to forecast the daily irrigation water demand at middle term time scale 7 days ahead was presented the hybrid model was optimized by the genetic algorithm nsga ii to maximize and minimize the representativeness and accuracy of their estimations applied to a real id the model inputs were also optimized by fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces obtaining four input variables t ave rad eto and iwd as times series in a frame of seven days for the developed hybrid model results showed that the irrigation water demand forecast for seven days in advance in an irrigation district is a complex task requiring a dense hybrid model the hybrid model selected after the optimization process had more than 1 5 million of parameters this hybrid model selected as optimum consisted of 50 lstm cells and 409 lstm cells in the lstm encoder decoder submodels and three hidden layers with 31 96 128 neurons respectively in the dnn submodel the average representativeness of the model was greater than 94 with an average accuracy in their estimations of around 20 to date the forecast model developed in this work is the most accurate at the spatio temporal scale addressed however this hybrid model is memory based and often shows memory leakage effects as the forecast time increases although an attempt was made to minimize this memory leakage effect by reducing the workload of the memory part of the forecast model lstm encoder decoder submodel and expanding with a dnn submodel this alzheimer effect could be observed in the results obtained nevertheless thanks to the hybrid model this memory leakage effect is minimum this model can be very useful for managers since it offers accurate predictions of water demand which plays an essential role for water management and energy contracting in irrigation districts considering current and expected scenarios of water scarcity and high energy prices declaration of competing interest the
