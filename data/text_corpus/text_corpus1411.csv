7055,traditional methods for characterizing horizontally anisotropic aquifers are all based on pumping tests in this paper we present a new method for the identification of horizontal anisotropy using cross hole slug tests which is much more easily accessible comparing to pumping tests through scaler transform an anisotropic medium was converted into an equivalent isotropic medium when applying the analytical solutions derived for isotropic media to interpret cross hole slug tests performed in anisotropic media the estimated transmissivity is the geometrical mean of the anisotropic transmissivity tensor regardless of sampling direction however the apparent storativity calculated from different observation wells is equal to the true storativity scaled by a factor defined by the formation anisotropy thus anisotropy can be resolved through apparent storativity that bears directional information the proposed method was first validated by a numerical experiment and then applied to field data it was found that the tensor results obtained by this new method with cross hole slug tests are consistent with that obtained by applying the classical papadopulos method with cross hole pumping tests conducted in the same wells when applied to heterogeneous media tensor results produced by the new method may be subject to considerable errors this is because the results are strongly sensitive to the connectivity between measurement boreholes and the formation medium to reduce the error level responses from a large number of observation wells located in various directions around the source well are needed in addition to the adopted kgs solution for confined aquifers the proposed methodology can be applied to incorporate other analytical methods for a variety of aquifer types as long as the characteristic relationship between the measure scale and the aquifer storativity can be established keywords aquifer anisotropy slug test transmissivity tensor storativity heterogeneity multi scale 1 introduction conventional single well hydraulic methods for the determination of aquifer transmissivity are based on a common assumption of homogeneous and isotropic formations however natural aquifers are often highly anisotropic because the formation of sedimentary aquifers is often driven by many highly directional processes such as streaming wind and faulting characterizations of groundwater flow patterns in natural systems maybe significantly in error if the aquifer anisotropy is not considered in the conceptual models in the middle 1960s analytical methods for estimating horizontal aquifer anisotropy using multiple observation wells were developed for confined aquifers papadopulos 1965 hantush 1966a b and leaky aquifers hantush and thomas 1966 these methods rely on the joint interpretation of time drawdown responses to a pumping recorded in at least three observational wells that are not radially aligned the restriction on total number of pumping observation pairs is possible to reduce through using a sequential pumping scheme neuman et al 1984 the methods were then extended to estimate three dimensional 3d transmissivity components way and mckee 1982 hsieh and neuman 1985 another way for determining the horizontal anisotropic transmissivities is through the scaler transformation technique bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 in this method the scale of the flow region in the directions of maximum and minimum principle transmissivities is firstly transformed reduced and increased respectively by a factor defined by the anisotropy ratio such that the anisotropic medium is converted to an equivalent isotropic one the traditional analytical solutions derived based on isotropic medium assumption can then be applied once the equivalent hydraulic parameters are determined an inverse transformation is then applied to calculate the true anisotropic parameters based on this principle mutch 2005 has developed a distance drawdown method where the classical cooper jacob method was applied to determine the components of anisotropic transmissivity tensor all of the above mentioned developments are based on idealized assumptions of homogeneous formations and of noise free data collection when significant heterogeneity occurs or when the recorded hydraulic data are subject to significant noise the use of three or less observation wells in different directions to define the principle transmissivities may not always yield a physically plausible solution neuman et al 1984 to solve this problem least square optimizations can be applied in conjunction with the papadopulos method such that drawdown responses from a large number of observation wells can be integrated to balance the effects of aquifer heterogeneity and imperfect data sampling maslia and randolph 1987 according to our best knowledge existing analytical methods for determining anisotropic transmissivity tensor are all based on pumping tests hydraulic responses to slug tests that are much more easily accessible have not yet been used comparing to pumping tests slug tests are much easier to perform and the test duration is much shorter since there is no water produced during a test at sites that are potentially contaminated slug tests have become a primary method for determining aquifer transmissivity with modern equipment larger and sharper perturbations can be generated such that stronger signals can be accurately detected at observational locations far away from the source well paradis et al 2016 the cross well response data can provide extra information regarding inter well hydraulic connections that are very helpful in characterizing preferential flow directions these important advantages of slug tests have motivated us to devise a new interpretation method for evaluating transmissivity tensors in anisotropic aquifers using cross hole slug test data here we focus only on the detection of the horizontal transmissivity anisotropy based on a two dimensional depth integrated model configuration however it should be noted that the presented model can be extended to three dimensional and to include the vertical anisotropy when interference signals are collected from multilevel slug tests with packer installations freeze and cherry 1979 paradis and lefebvre 2013 the theoretical feasibility of using cross hole slug test for estimating transmissivity tensors stems from its close relation to pumping tests it has been demonstrated that slug tests can be represented as a specialized form of constant rate pumping tests novakowski 1989 peres et al 1989 spane 1996 and spane et al 1996 has applied the method of peres et al 1989 to convert slug test data collected from an unconfined aquifer to equivalent constant rate drawdown responses the converted responses were compared to real pumping test data collected from the same well a good match between the two sets of response was found and similar estimated values of transmissivity and storativity were calculated using the two types of data on the other hand recent studies have performed resolution analyses of tomographic i e sequential cross hole slug test data numerical simulations paradis et al 2015 paradis et al 2016 results have shown that comparing to tomographic pumping test data the tomographic slug test data hold the equivalent potential of conveying important information regarding resolving coarse scale heterogeneity and anisotropy of aquifer transmissivity moreover inversions of cross hole slug test data have also been successfully performed in recent field investigations brauchler et al 2010 paradis et al 2016 in short results from theoretical numerical and field studies have demonstrated the strong relevance of using cross hole slug test to determine aquifer anisotropy depending on the type of aquifers being tests a number of analytical and semi analytical models for interpreting cross hole slug tests have been presented in the literature e g karasaki et al 1988 novakowski 1989 hyder et al 1994 butler and zhan 2004 malama et al 2016 among others the solution of hyder et al 1994 also known as the kgs model is widely used in the hydrogeological community belitz and dripps 1999 in this work we also choose to use this solution due to the representativeness of the conceptual model related to the kgs method for the specific hydrogeological configuration of our field site the complete kgs solution includes a wide variety of parameters such as the aquifer transmissivity storativity vertical to horizontal transmissivity ratio finite radius of source well wellbore skin as well as upper and lower boundaries hyder et al 1994 although it is possible to consider all the parameters in the proposed methodology for the sake of brevity here we will only focus on the effect of aquifer transmissivity and storativity we first demonstrate the validity of the method using numerical simulations and then apply it to a field example justifications for validity of the adopted simplification for our field analysis are detailed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 discussions on the effect of aquifer heterogeneity measurement scale and on the emergent transmissivity tensors are presented in section 5 2 theory the diffusion process of groundwater flow in response to an instantaneous change in water level obeys the basic law of mass conservation this is reflected by the characteristic relationship between a scale measure for instance the slug observation well distance d ow and the aquifer storativity s the only scaler term appears in the diffusivity equation as given by 1 d ow 2 s const if the finite radius of the source well r s is taken into account the following relationship also holds 2 d ow r s const eqs 1 and 2 imply that the displacement i e water level change predicted by the cross hole slug test solution remain unchanged if d ow and r s is doubled and s quartered or if d ow and r s is halved and s quadrupled this characteristic relationship is validated using the kgs model fig 1 using the hydraulic parameters presented in table 1 in anisotropic aquifers the relations shown by eqs 3 and 4 may be defined in a certain radial direction but is not applicable for all other directions this is because in anisotropic media the direction of hydraulic gradient does not coincide with the direction of discharge thereby the transmissivity is defined as a second rank tensor in two dimension which can be understood as a linear transformation relating the two directions marcus 1962 in an arbitrary r direction the directional transmissivity is given by bear 1972 3 t r t g t min t max cos 2 θ t max t min sin 2 θ where t max and t min are maximum and minimum transmissivities respectively θ represents the angle between the direction of t max and that of t r t g is the geometric mean of transmissivity 4 t g t max t min essentially eq 3 describes an ellipse with t max and t min being its long and short semi axes ideally a plot of t r in the direction of observation well on polar coordinate paper should depict an ellipse that characterizes horizontal anisotropy however due to the radially diffusive nature of hydraulic tests responses t r cannot be readily derived from conventional hydraulic test results even when multiple observation wells located along various direction to the source well are used in the analysis instead the calculated transmissivity value from the cross hole tests are the approximation of the geometric mean t g regardless of the relative location of source and observation wells and of whether the tested aquifer is anisotropic or isotropic hantush 1966a b through applying scaler transformation the ellipse can be converted to a concentric circle of equal area accordingly the original anisotropic medium is converted into an equivalent isotropic one freeze and cherry 1979 mutch 2005 specifically the observation distance d ow needs to be scaled by 5 d ow d ow t min t max cos 2 θ t max t min sin 2 θ 1 2 where d ow is the skewed observation distance for the equivalent isotropic medium similar scaling is needed for the source well radius according to eq 2 eqs 1 and 5 imply that the hydraulic test interpretation techniques derived for isotropic aquifers are still applicable for anisotropic aquifers as long as the aquifer storativity s is also skewed according to 6 s s t min t max cos 2 θ t max t min sin 2 θ similar to eq 3 eq 6 describe the trace of an ellipse the formal elliptical expression of eq 6 is 7 1 r 2 a 2 cos 2 θ r 2 b 2 sin 2 θ where 8 r 1 s 9 a 2 1 s t min t max 10 b 2 1 s t max t min 11 a b t max t min 12 1 ab s combing eqs 1 5 and 6 the following relation is obtained 13 t r t g s s taking square root on both side of eq 7 and rearrange we have 14 t r t g s 1 s since both t g and s are constants and direction independent eqs 5 and 14 thus imply that an alternative polar plot of 1 s in the direction of observation well would reveal an ellipse having the same shape as that defined by plotting t r but scaled by a factor of t g s once the major and minor semi axes of the ellipse are determined the major and minor principle transmissivities can then be calculated by combining eqs 4 and 11 as given by 15 t max t g a b 16 t min t g b a 3 a new anisotropy method based on cross hole slug test based on the mathematical theory presented in section 2 we propose to use cross hole slug test data to estimate horizontal anisotropy we choose to use a simplified version of the kgs solution hyder et al 1994 as the interpretation method among the hydraulic parameters in the kgs model that control interference response in an observation well here we practically focus on the aquifer transmissivity t and storativity s we note inclusion of the effect of other parameters is possible as long as the scaling relationship of the parameters can be properly defined as in the form of eqs 3 or 4 our method involves the following step by step procedures 1 interpret cross hole slug test data for each observation well by fitting the data to a selected solution in our case the kgs solution and determine the transmissivity t g and storativity s 2 calculate the 1 s for each observation well and plot the value in the direction of the observation well on a polar coordinate graph 3 fit the data points to an ellipse and obtain the major and minor semi axes and the tilted angle 4 calculate the major and minor principle transmissivities t max and t min using eqs 13 and 14 the anisotropy ratio from eq 9 and the storativity s from eq 10 the above workflow is applied to a numerical example for the validation purpose a finite element code is used to simulate a cross hole slug test the input anisotropic transmissivity for the simulation is defined by a second rank symmetric tensor t 1 0 0 4 1e 6 m2 s and thus an anisotropy of 2 is considered fig 2 a a constant uniform storativity of s 1e 6 is assigned to the entire simulation domain the source well is simulated as a circular high conductivity zone t 10 m2 s with a radius of 0 0825 m fig 2b the specific storage of these nodes was set to be 0 representing the fact that water is essentially incompressible the finite element nodes within this area is assigned an initial head of 1 5 m while the remaining nodes in the model are assigned an initial head of 0 m the transient simulation run for 2000s and the water level distribution at 100 s is shown in fig 2b as can be seen the equal potential lines are elliptical in shape the ratio between the lengths of the major and minor semi axes is equal to anisotropy ratio responses of water level change are monitored at the source well and two observation boreholes located at 7 5 m away from the source well in the north and east directions respectively fig 2c the simulated data were then analyzed with our method the estimates of anisotropic transmissivity components storativity and anisotropy ratio are in good agreement with the input values table 2 the small difference may be attributed to errors from numerical calculation and type curve matching nevertheless the results from the numerical experiment validates the proposed anisotropy evaluation method 4 field example in the following sections we apply the proposed method to a large set of slug test data collected at the sussargues field site fig 3 a we also investigate the effects of heterogeneity measurement scale and wellbore connectivity on the results of transmissivity tensor identification 4 1 field site and data collection the sussargues site is a research wellfield constructed by the hydroscience montpellier hsm institute at the university of montpellier with the purpose of providing a field scale experimental laboratory for quantitative investigation of the effect of sedimentary structures on the heterogeneity and anisotropy of permeability fields the field site is located about 20 km north east of the city of montpellier fig 3a the site consists of 13 vertical boreholes that are orthogonally arranged around a central well denoted p6 the longitudinal and transversal spacing between two adjacent boreholes is 7 5 m fig 3c all the wells are open holes through the entire drilled depth 35 m and have a same diameter of 0 0825 m short well casing were equipped in all boreholes which does not reach to the water table except for p6 p8 and p12 borehole which are cored the other boreholes were all drilled destructively because of the use of air lifting well finishing technique the disturbance of natural material near wellbore is considered to be minimal the sussargues site investigates a semi confined aquifer of about 10 m thickness at depth between 12 5 m and 22 5 m fig 4 the main aquifer unit composed of heterogeneous limestones of late burdigalian age the aquifer is sandwiched by two aquitards that consists of marly limestones the top aquitard is overlied by a coarse limestone layer whose hydraulic properties are similar to the main aquifer unit small scale permeability measurements show significant variations of more than 2 orders of magnitude in permeability between the main aquifer unit and adjacent aquitards fig 4 lateral heterogeneity is also evident from a preliminary analytical analysis of transmissivity using single well slug and pumping test data a series of cross hole pumping and slug tests were conducted at the sussargues field site with the aim of achieving an improved understanding of lateral variability of transmissivity at the site the pumping tests were performed at constant flow rates using a submersible pump the slug test data analyzed in this paper were collected using a hydraulic slug test tool developed and calibrated by the laboratoire hydrosciences montpellier prior to hydraulic tests the average initial water table level is measured at a depth of about 5 2 m which is above the upper confining aquitard unit fig 4 in this situation different responses are expected from pumping and slug tests due to difference in the connection condition between the wellbore and aquifer formations if a pumping test is performed the water table level in the pumping well will decrease continuously to a level below the depth of the main aquifer hence the pumping response is expected to reflect the hydraulic properties of the main aquifer unit in contract if a slug test is performed the water level will first increase and then decrease during the entire test period the water table level remains above the top of the upper aquitard consequently the early time slug test response is expected to reflect the hydrodynamics occurring in a multi layer system consists of the main aquifer unit and the high conductivity unit above the upper aquitard however as reduction of water column height in the source well with time the proportion of water that enters the main aquifer would increase gradually hence only the late time slug responses would be useful for the present analysis to demonstrate this effect pumping and slug test data collected from p6 borehole are plotted on log log graphs fig 5 the slug test data were converted to equivalent drawdown data using the method of peres et al 1989 the data were then normalized by multiplying the equivalent head response by the ratio of the average pumping test discharge rate to the instantaneous slug test constant rate discharge spane et al 1996 the conversion allows a direct comparison of data from hydraulic tests of different type in addition the diagnostic plot techniques developed for drawdown data can be performed on slug test data the evolution of time derivative of the pumping test data can be divided into three major regimes an early time regime dominated by wellbore storage a middle radial flow regime and a late time regime controlled by leakage from the confining aquitards fig 5a the existence of the radial flow regime confirms our expectation that during pumping test our system behaves like a typical confined aquifer and therefore justifies the assumption that our field site can be conceptualized as a quasi two dimensional system on the contrary the variation of log derivative of the slug test data with time shows a different and more complex trajectory overall three distinct regimes can be identified an early time regime dominated by wellbore storage effect a transient regime and a radial flow regime fig 5b the transient regime is characterized by a depression of the time derivative which is an indicator of dual porosity or multilayer reservoirs behavior in our system the latter is the case because there was no fracture or karst conduit seen in the investigated area according to drilling reports well loggings and downhole videos the onset time of radial flow in the pumping test data is earlier than that of the slug test data however the magnitude of both the drawdown and time derivative of the two datasets in the radial flow regime is in a good agreement this implies that the two hydraulic tests measure consistent formation hydraulic properties of a similar control volume this observation provides further support to the two dimensional hydraulic conceptual model of the system accordingly in this work only the data within the period of radial flow regime were used to estimate hydraulic parameters 4 2 anisotropy analysis the propose method see section 3 has been applied to the cross hole slug test of p6 to demonstrate the validity of the method the classical papadopulos s analysis was also performed on the cross hole pumping test data collected for same source well i e p6 the readers are referred to papadopulos 1965 and maslia and randolph 1987 for technical details of the papadoupulos method hydraulic responses taken at the boreholes forming the inner ring surrounding the source well i e at p0 p2 p3 p4 p7 p9 p10 and p11 wells were used in the anisotropy analysis as have discussed only the radial flow part of the data was analyzed see section 4 1 in the analysis of pumping test data a least square optimization algorithm similar to that considered in maslia and randolph 1987 was used to solve the equation system both the pumping and slug test analyses show variations of estimated t and s values the range of s variation is much larger than that of t this observation resonates with the findings reported by hantush 1966a b and streltsova 1988 that transmissivity estimated from pumping tests reflect the geometric mean in spite of sample direction while the variability of storativity is attributed to radial flow in homogeneous anisotropic aquifers certainly the variation in transmissivity presenting in our data is caused by formation heterogeneity the derived values of t r from cross hole pumping tests and 1 s from cross hole slug tests were plotted on polar coordinate graph fig 6 the 1 s values were normalized by the average value of t r estimates to make a direct comparison it can be seen from fig 6 that the results of our method using slug tests are quite consistent with that of the papadoupulos analysis of pumping tests thus it means that the propose method would provide consistent estimation of aquifer anisotropy with much lower costs in terms of equipment and test durations 5 discussion 5 1 effect of heterogeneity similar to the analytical anisotropy methods based on pumping tests the proposed method relies also on the assumption of homogeneous anisotropic media the presence of aquifer heterogeneity may affect significantly the anisotropy results a complication associated with all the analytical anisotropy methods that has not been discussed previously fig 7 presents the results of anisotropy identification using different combination of storativity estimates from boreholes located in different part of the aquifer from left to right in fig 7 the number of observation boreholes is increased and gradually covering all possible sampling direction defined by the well pattern fig 3c the identified anisotropy is represented by an ellipse in each graph the ellipses were obtained through fitting the scatter points using a least square optimization algorithm it is very clear from fig 7 that the identified anisotropy varies significantly as the number of boreholes increases the trend in terms of the major semi axis direction of the ellipses obtained using a small number of boreholes is entirely different almost rotated by 90 degrees from that obtained using all the boreholes forming the inner ring of sussargues well pattern fig 3c to demonstrate this effect is indeed caused by heterogeneity a numerical experiment is performed with the same well pattern and known hydraulic parameters that were identical to those used in the numerical model in section 3 fig 8 a presents the elliptical drawdown distribution at simulation time of 100 s the responses recorded at boreholes forming the inner ring of the well pattern marked in dark grey were analyzed to get storativity estimates in the direction of each observation well a perfect fit of the scattered storativity data to the ellipse function was found fig 8b the derived transmissivity tensor anisotropy ratio and storativity were respectively 0 98 0 0 3 97 10 6 m s 2 01 1 01 10 6 these were in good agreement with the input parameters see section 3 the comparison of the numerical and field analyses implies that in heterogeneous media the emergent anisotropy results from the proposed analytical anisotropy analysis may prone to significant errors the errors may be reduced only if a large number of observation points ideally uniformly distributed in all radial directions surrounding the source well is available vertical anisotropy caused by textural layering are typical in many depositional environments e g tidal or fluvial systems the impact of vertical anisotropy on responses to hydraulic tests is often taken into account in analytical models through introducing the vertical to horizontal transmissivity ratio kv kh it is noted that the adopted kgs slug test model has the ability to account for kv kh however in our analysis the vertical anisotropy is not considered due to the following reasons 1 analog studies on outcrops indicate that the vertical extent of typical main sedimentary units is on the same order as that of the borehole spacing while the lateral extent of these units are at least several times larger 2 well logging data and ct scan of the full diameter core of p12 show that although there may exist cross bedding structures in each sedimentary units the variation of hydraulic properties owing to the cross bedding is expected to be much lower than the hydraulic property contrast between the main aquifer unit and the adjacent aquitards fig 4 in the cases where vertical variation of hydraulic properties cannot be neglected the impact of vertical anisotropy can be considered in our two dimensional model through the inclusion of the kv kh ratio as one of the variables during the kgs model fitting process we further note that the results from our two dimensional analysis is based on the assumption that the lateral extent of the main units is much larger than the borehole spacing when the lateral extent of the sedimentary units is small a three dimensional analysis must be invoked in that case interference signals collected from multilevel slug tests with packer installations are required hsieh et al 1985 brauchler et al 2010 5 2 effects of measurement scale and near wellbore connectivity the scale effect is frequently invoked in well test analysis to explain variability in estimated hydraulic conductivity especially when measurements taken at various support volume are considered even though the explanations of the cause of the scale effect are controversial it has been widely observed that in sedimentary formations the average or equivalent hydraulic conductivity trends to first increase with the sampled rock volume and then become constant at regional scales schulze makuch and cherkauer 1997 existing analyses of scale effects were largely based on hydraulic conductivity estimates obtained on a well by well basis here we attempt to look at the issue of scale effects using an ensemble approach relying on transmissivity tensors which integrate the information contained in individual transmissivity estimates from single boreholes the unique configuration of wellbore pattern in the sussargues site allows transmissivity tensor analysis at the same source well but at two support scales or at the same support scale but at different source wells in the first analysis the set of cross hole data of slug test in p6 well have been divided into two groups the inner and outer rings according to the relative location of the observation well to the source well fig 9 a fig 9b and 9c present the result of tensor identification for inner ring and outer ring well groups respectively overall the results from two datasets show a high consistency in terms of both the size and principle axes directions of the identified tensors the geometric mean of the transmissivity tensor does not seem to increase with the increase of rock volume affected by the cross hole slug test even through other field factors may exert influences it seems that the variability in equivalent transmissivity tensor is minor when the anisotropy analysis is performed with slug test data recorded at different scales but for cross hole responses to the same source well in the second analysis we use a set of four sequential cross hole slug test data of p4 p5 p6 and p10 wells to identify anisotropy that is to say in one of the four tests one of the selected boreholes is used as source well while the other three are used as observation wells because the lateral area defined reciprocal distance between each source observation well pair is identical for the four tests it is thought that they investigate the same support volume of the aquifer fig 10 shows the tensor identified with the four cross hole slug tests it is evident that not only the size but also the principle axes orientations of the identified ellipse vary considerably this significant variation may be attributed to the difference in connectivity between boreholes and the heterogeneous medium the result seems to resonate with the finding of paradis et al 2016b that the reciprocity principle does not apply for cross hole slug test in heterogeneous medium otherwise identical transmissivity tensor is expected to obtain using the reciprocal source observation well pairs considered in the four tests the observations from the two analyses lead us to believe that correlation between variation in transmissivity and the change of scale may be deficient without taking into account the connectivity of medium the present results seem to show a disproof that transmissivity does not increase with measurement scale however the analysis presented in this paper is still preliminary a complete discussion of relationship between transmissivity tensor and measurement scale will be presented in the future the tensor method proposed here may also be useful to improve current understanding of the issue of scale effects previous studies on scale effects commonly define the support scale for a hydraulic test as some characteristic length for instance the distance between source and observation wells however the pressure diffusion generated by hydraulic tests is a three dimensional phenomenon consequently estimated parameters based on pressure data reflect the hydraulic properties of a rock volume in the presence of heterogeneity the real geometry of the affected rock volume by the pressure perturbation is complex therefore the frequently used scale measures defined in the form of characteristic length may not be representative this effect of the mismatch between scale and hydraulic parameter estimation has not been investigated in previous studies on scaling of hydraulic conductivity the support scale of hydraulic tests can be better defined by the tensor analysis presented in this paper because the tensor method integrates information from multiple observation boreholes the derived geometric mean of the transmissivity tensor may provide a more accurate approximation of the real average transmissivity of the affected rock volume between observation wells this is even more so for natural systems where directional features such as sedimentary channels or fractures are characteristic features with advanced geostatistical simulation methods such as transition probability based geostatistics carle and fogg 1996 carle 1999 multi point geostatistics mariethoz and caers 2014 and pluri gaussian simulations armstrong et al 2011 the complex connectivity of fracture or channel networks can be modeled the presented tensor identification method could then be applied in a systematic sensitivity analysis equipped with mcmc simulations to derive robust conclusions on the mechanism of the spatial averaging process of slug tests over the support volume and to quantify the influence of heterogeneities of various length scales on the tensor results this will be investigated in detail in a future paper 6 conclusions a new method for the identification of aquifer anisotropy using cross hole slug tests has been proposed the development of the method was based on a characteristic relationship between source to observation well distance and the storativity and scaler transformation the transformation converts an anisotropic medium to an equivalent isotropic medium such that existing analytical solutions to slug tests can be applied the feasibility of the proposed anisotropy method was first validated by a numerical experiment and then applied to a set of field cross hole slug test data a comparison analysis using the papadopulos method based on cross hole pumping tests was performed results show that the horizontal anisotropy depicted by our method with slug test data is consistent with that obtained by the papadopulos method and with ellipse of equal drawdown however in terms of efficiency e g equipment costs and time spent in testing and interpretation the new method outperforms the pumping test method by several hundred times because the method assumes homogeneous media when applying to heterogeneous aquifers significant errors may occur in the results especially when the number of observation boreholes is small however by careful selection of observation borehole location or by integrating information carried by a large number of boreholes the errors may be largely reduced based on the preliminary analysis the geometrical mean of the transmissivity tensor which is believed to be a better representative value for the effective transmissivity of rock volume affected by hydraulic tests does not seem to increase with the support volume in contrast the tensor results based on the cross hole slug tests are very sensitive to connectivity between the wells and the medium to demonstrate the feasibility of the new method a simplified kgs model was adopted to interpret cross hole slug tests in a semi confined aquifer however other existing analytical solutions for cross hole slug tests in a variety of aquifer and well conditions e g confined or unconfined with or without source well skin partial penetrating wells may also be incorporated in the tensor analysis provided that the existence of the important characteristic relationship between the measure scale and the aquifer storativity is verified acknowledgements we thank total s a for providing funding for the research we thank stephane chedeville julien gasser dorado marie leger for helping collecting some of

7055,traditional methods for characterizing horizontally anisotropic aquifers are all based on pumping tests in this paper we present a new method for the identification of horizontal anisotropy using cross hole slug tests which is much more easily accessible comparing to pumping tests through scaler transform an anisotropic medium was converted into an equivalent isotropic medium when applying the analytical solutions derived for isotropic media to interpret cross hole slug tests performed in anisotropic media the estimated transmissivity is the geometrical mean of the anisotropic transmissivity tensor regardless of sampling direction however the apparent storativity calculated from different observation wells is equal to the true storativity scaled by a factor defined by the formation anisotropy thus anisotropy can be resolved through apparent storativity that bears directional information the proposed method was first validated by a numerical experiment and then applied to field data it was found that the tensor results obtained by this new method with cross hole slug tests are consistent with that obtained by applying the classical papadopulos method with cross hole pumping tests conducted in the same wells when applied to heterogeneous media tensor results produced by the new method may be subject to considerable errors this is because the results are strongly sensitive to the connectivity between measurement boreholes and the formation medium to reduce the error level responses from a large number of observation wells located in various directions around the source well are needed in addition to the adopted kgs solution for confined aquifers the proposed methodology can be applied to incorporate other analytical methods for a variety of aquifer types as long as the characteristic relationship between the measure scale and the aquifer storativity can be established keywords aquifer anisotropy slug test transmissivity tensor storativity heterogeneity multi scale 1 introduction conventional single well hydraulic methods for the determination of aquifer transmissivity are based on a common assumption of homogeneous and isotropic formations however natural aquifers are often highly anisotropic because the formation of sedimentary aquifers is often driven by many highly directional processes such as streaming wind and faulting characterizations of groundwater flow patterns in natural systems maybe significantly in error if the aquifer anisotropy is not considered in the conceptual models in the middle 1960s analytical methods for estimating horizontal aquifer anisotropy using multiple observation wells were developed for confined aquifers papadopulos 1965 hantush 1966a b and leaky aquifers hantush and thomas 1966 these methods rely on the joint interpretation of time drawdown responses to a pumping recorded in at least three observational wells that are not radially aligned the restriction on total number of pumping observation pairs is possible to reduce through using a sequential pumping scheme neuman et al 1984 the methods were then extended to estimate three dimensional 3d transmissivity components way and mckee 1982 hsieh and neuman 1985 another way for determining the horizontal anisotropic transmissivities is through the scaler transformation technique bear 1972 freeze and cherry 1979 in this method the scale of the flow region in the directions of maximum and minimum principle transmissivities is firstly transformed reduced and increased respectively by a factor defined by the anisotropy ratio such that the anisotropic medium is converted to an equivalent isotropic one the traditional analytical solutions derived based on isotropic medium assumption can then be applied once the equivalent hydraulic parameters are determined an inverse transformation is then applied to calculate the true anisotropic parameters based on this principle mutch 2005 has developed a distance drawdown method where the classical cooper jacob method was applied to determine the components of anisotropic transmissivity tensor all of the above mentioned developments are based on idealized assumptions of homogeneous formations and of noise free data collection when significant heterogeneity occurs or when the recorded hydraulic data are subject to significant noise the use of three or less observation wells in different directions to define the principle transmissivities may not always yield a physically plausible solution neuman et al 1984 to solve this problem least square optimizations can be applied in conjunction with the papadopulos method such that drawdown responses from a large number of observation wells can be integrated to balance the effects of aquifer heterogeneity and imperfect data sampling maslia and randolph 1987 according to our best knowledge existing analytical methods for determining anisotropic transmissivity tensor are all based on pumping tests hydraulic responses to slug tests that are much more easily accessible have not yet been used comparing to pumping tests slug tests are much easier to perform and the test duration is much shorter since there is no water produced during a test at sites that are potentially contaminated slug tests have become a primary method for determining aquifer transmissivity with modern equipment larger and sharper perturbations can be generated such that stronger signals can be accurately detected at observational locations far away from the source well paradis et al 2016 the cross well response data can provide extra information regarding inter well hydraulic connections that are very helpful in characterizing preferential flow directions these important advantages of slug tests have motivated us to devise a new interpretation method for evaluating transmissivity tensors in anisotropic aquifers using cross hole slug test data here we focus only on the detection of the horizontal transmissivity anisotropy based on a two dimensional depth integrated model configuration however it should be noted that the presented model can be extended to three dimensional and to include the vertical anisotropy when interference signals are collected from multilevel slug tests with packer installations freeze and cherry 1979 paradis and lefebvre 2013 the theoretical feasibility of using cross hole slug test for estimating transmissivity tensors stems from its close relation to pumping tests it has been demonstrated that slug tests can be represented as a specialized form of constant rate pumping tests novakowski 1989 peres et al 1989 spane 1996 and spane et al 1996 has applied the method of peres et al 1989 to convert slug test data collected from an unconfined aquifer to equivalent constant rate drawdown responses the converted responses were compared to real pumping test data collected from the same well a good match between the two sets of response was found and similar estimated values of transmissivity and storativity were calculated using the two types of data on the other hand recent studies have performed resolution analyses of tomographic i e sequential cross hole slug test data numerical simulations paradis et al 2015 paradis et al 2016 results have shown that comparing to tomographic pumping test data the tomographic slug test data hold the equivalent potential of conveying important information regarding resolving coarse scale heterogeneity and anisotropy of aquifer transmissivity moreover inversions of cross hole slug test data have also been successfully performed in recent field investigations brauchler et al 2010 paradis et al 2016 in short results from theoretical numerical and field studies have demonstrated the strong relevance of using cross hole slug test to determine aquifer anisotropy depending on the type of aquifers being tests a number of analytical and semi analytical models for interpreting cross hole slug tests have been presented in the literature e g karasaki et al 1988 novakowski 1989 hyder et al 1994 butler and zhan 2004 malama et al 2016 among others the solution of hyder et al 1994 also known as the kgs model is widely used in the hydrogeological community belitz and dripps 1999 in this work we also choose to use this solution due to the representativeness of the conceptual model related to the kgs method for the specific hydrogeological configuration of our field site the complete kgs solution includes a wide variety of parameters such as the aquifer transmissivity storativity vertical to horizontal transmissivity ratio finite radius of source well wellbore skin as well as upper and lower boundaries hyder et al 1994 although it is possible to consider all the parameters in the proposed methodology for the sake of brevity here we will only focus on the effect of aquifer transmissivity and storativity we first demonstrate the validity of the method using numerical simulations and then apply it to a field example justifications for validity of the adopted simplification for our field analysis are detailed in sections 4 1 and 4 2 discussions on the effect of aquifer heterogeneity measurement scale and on the emergent transmissivity tensors are presented in section 5 2 theory the diffusion process of groundwater flow in response to an instantaneous change in water level obeys the basic law of mass conservation this is reflected by the characteristic relationship between a scale measure for instance the slug observation well distance d ow and the aquifer storativity s the only scaler term appears in the diffusivity equation as given by 1 d ow 2 s const if the finite radius of the source well r s is taken into account the following relationship also holds 2 d ow r s const eqs 1 and 2 imply that the displacement i e water level change predicted by the cross hole slug test solution remain unchanged if d ow and r s is doubled and s quartered or if d ow and r s is halved and s quadrupled this characteristic relationship is validated using the kgs model fig 1 using the hydraulic parameters presented in table 1 in anisotropic aquifers the relations shown by eqs 3 and 4 may be defined in a certain radial direction but is not applicable for all other directions this is because in anisotropic media the direction of hydraulic gradient does not coincide with the direction of discharge thereby the transmissivity is defined as a second rank tensor in two dimension which can be understood as a linear transformation relating the two directions marcus 1962 in an arbitrary r direction the directional transmissivity is given by bear 1972 3 t r t g t min t max cos 2 θ t max t min sin 2 θ where t max and t min are maximum and minimum transmissivities respectively θ represents the angle between the direction of t max and that of t r t g is the geometric mean of transmissivity 4 t g t max t min essentially eq 3 describes an ellipse with t max and t min being its long and short semi axes ideally a plot of t r in the direction of observation well on polar coordinate paper should depict an ellipse that characterizes horizontal anisotropy however due to the radially diffusive nature of hydraulic tests responses t r cannot be readily derived from conventional hydraulic test results even when multiple observation wells located along various direction to the source well are used in the analysis instead the calculated transmissivity value from the cross hole tests are the approximation of the geometric mean t g regardless of the relative location of source and observation wells and of whether the tested aquifer is anisotropic or isotropic hantush 1966a b through applying scaler transformation the ellipse can be converted to a concentric circle of equal area accordingly the original anisotropic medium is converted into an equivalent isotropic one freeze and cherry 1979 mutch 2005 specifically the observation distance d ow needs to be scaled by 5 d ow d ow t min t max cos 2 θ t max t min sin 2 θ 1 2 where d ow is the skewed observation distance for the equivalent isotropic medium similar scaling is needed for the source well radius according to eq 2 eqs 1 and 5 imply that the hydraulic test interpretation techniques derived for isotropic aquifers are still applicable for anisotropic aquifers as long as the aquifer storativity s is also skewed according to 6 s s t min t max cos 2 θ t max t min sin 2 θ similar to eq 3 eq 6 describe the trace of an ellipse the formal elliptical expression of eq 6 is 7 1 r 2 a 2 cos 2 θ r 2 b 2 sin 2 θ where 8 r 1 s 9 a 2 1 s t min t max 10 b 2 1 s t max t min 11 a b t max t min 12 1 ab s combing eqs 1 5 and 6 the following relation is obtained 13 t r t g s s taking square root on both side of eq 7 and rearrange we have 14 t r t g s 1 s since both t g and s are constants and direction independent eqs 5 and 14 thus imply that an alternative polar plot of 1 s in the direction of observation well would reveal an ellipse having the same shape as that defined by plotting t r but scaled by a factor of t g s once the major and minor semi axes of the ellipse are determined the major and minor principle transmissivities can then be calculated by combining eqs 4 and 11 as given by 15 t max t g a b 16 t min t g b a 3 a new anisotropy method based on cross hole slug test based on the mathematical theory presented in section 2 we propose to use cross hole slug test data to estimate horizontal anisotropy we choose to use a simplified version of the kgs solution hyder et al 1994 as the interpretation method among the hydraulic parameters in the kgs model that control interference response in an observation well here we practically focus on the aquifer transmissivity t and storativity s we note inclusion of the effect of other parameters is possible as long as the scaling relationship of the parameters can be properly defined as in the form of eqs 3 or 4 our method involves the following step by step procedures 1 interpret cross hole slug test data for each observation well by fitting the data to a selected solution in our case the kgs solution and determine the transmissivity t g and storativity s 2 calculate the 1 s for each observation well and plot the value in the direction of the observation well on a polar coordinate graph 3 fit the data points to an ellipse and obtain the major and minor semi axes and the tilted angle 4 calculate the major and minor principle transmissivities t max and t min using eqs 13 and 14 the anisotropy ratio from eq 9 and the storativity s from eq 10 the above workflow is applied to a numerical example for the validation purpose a finite element code is used to simulate a cross hole slug test the input anisotropic transmissivity for the simulation is defined by a second rank symmetric tensor t 1 0 0 4 1e 6 m2 s and thus an anisotropy of 2 is considered fig 2 a a constant uniform storativity of s 1e 6 is assigned to the entire simulation domain the source well is simulated as a circular high conductivity zone t 10 m2 s with a radius of 0 0825 m fig 2b the specific storage of these nodes was set to be 0 representing the fact that water is essentially incompressible the finite element nodes within this area is assigned an initial head of 1 5 m while the remaining nodes in the model are assigned an initial head of 0 m the transient simulation run for 2000s and the water level distribution at 100 s is shown in fig 2b as can be seen the equal potential lines are elliptical in shape the ratio between the lengths of the major and minor semi axes is equal to anisotropy ratio responses of water level change are monitored at the source well and two observation boreholes located at 7 5 m away from the source well in the north and east directions respectively fig 2c the simulated data were then analyzed with our method the estimates of anisotropic transmissivity components storativity and anisotropy ratio are in good agreement with the input values table 2 the small difference may be attributed to errors from numerical calculation and type curve matching nevertheless the results from the numerical experiment validates the proposed anisotropy evaluation method 4 field example in the following sections we apply the proposed method to a large set of slug test data collected at the sussargues field site fig 3 a we also investigate the effects of heterogeneity measurement scale and wellbore connectivity on the results of transmissivity tensor identification 4 1 field site and data collection the sussargues site is a research wellfield constructed by the hydroscience montpellier hsm institute at the university of montpellier with the purpose of providing a field scale experimental laboratory for quantitative investigation of the effect of sedimentary structures on the heterogeneity and anisotropy of permeability fields the field site is located about 20 km north east of the city of montpellier fig 3a the site consists of 13 vertical boreholes that are orthogonally arranged around a central well denoted p6 the longitudinal and transversal spacing between two adjacent boreholes is 7 5 m fig 3c all the wells are open holes through the entire drilled depth 35 m and have a same diameter of 0 0825 m short well casing were equipped in all boreholes which does not reach to the water table except for p6 p8 and p12 borehole which are cored the other boreholes were all drilled destructively because of the use of air lifting well finishing technique the disturbance of natural material near wellbore is considered to be minimal the sussargues site investigates a semi confined aquifer of about 10 m thickness at depth between 12 5 m and 22 5 m fig 4 the main aquifer unit composed of heterogeneous limestones of late burdigalian age the aquifer is sandwiched by two aquitards that consists of marly limestones the top aquitard is overlied by a coarse limestone layer whose hydraulic properties are similar to the main aquifer unit small scale permeability measurements show significant variations of more than 2 orders of magnitude in permeability between the main aquifer unit and adjacent aquitards fig 4 lateral heterogeneity is also evident from a preliminary analytical analysis of transmissivity using single well slug and pumping test data a series of cross hole pumping and slug tests were conducted at the sussargues field site with the aim of achieving an improved understanding of lateral variability of transmissivity at the site the pumping tests were performed at constant flow rates using a submersible pump the slug test data analyzed in this paper were collected using a hydraulic slug test tool developed and calibrated by the laboratoire hydrosciences montpellier prior to hydraulic tests the average initial water table level is measured at a depth of about 5 2 m which is above the upper confining aquitard unit fig 4 in this situation different responses are expected from pumping and slug tests due to difference in the connection condition between the wellbore and aquifer formations if a pumping test is performed the water table level in the pumping well will decrease continuously to a level below the depth of the main aquifer hence the pumping response is expected to reflect the hydraulic properties of the main aquifer unit in contract if a slug test is performed the water level will first increase and then decrease during the entire test period the water table level remains above the top of the upper aquitard consequently the early time slug test response is expected to reflect the hydrodynamics occurring in a multi layer system consists of the main aquifer unit and the high conductivity unit above the upper aquitard however as reduction of water column height in the source well with time the proportion of water that enters the main aquifer would increase gradually hence only the late time slug responses would be useful for the present analysis to demonstrate this effect pumping and slug test data collected from p6 borehole are plotted on log log graphs fig 5 the slug test data were converted to equivalent drawdown data using the method of peres et al 1989 the data were then normalized by multiplying the equivalent head response by the ratio of the average pumping test discharge rate to the instantaneous slug test constant rate discharge spane et al 1996 the conversion allows a direct comparison of data from hydraulic tests of different type in addition the diagnostic plot techniques developed for drawdown data can be performed on slug test data the evolution of time derivative of the pumping test data can be divided into three major regimes an early time regime dominated by wellbore storage a middle radial flow regime and a late time regime controlled by leakage from the confining aquitards fig 5a the existence of the radial flow regime confirms our expectation that during pumping test our system behaves like a typical confined aquifer and therefore justifies the assumption that our field site can be conceptualized as a quasi two dimensional system on the contrary the variation of log derivative of the slug test data with time shows a different and more complex trajectory overall three distinct regimes can be identified an early time regime dominated by wellbore storage effect a transient regime and a radial flow regime fig 5b the transient regime is characterized by a depression of the time derivative which is an indicator of dual porosity or multilayer reservoirs behavior in our system the latter is the case because there was no fracture or karst conduit seen in the investigated area according to drilling reports well loggings and downhole videos the onset time of radial flow in the pumping test data is earlier than that of the slug test data however the magnitude of both the drawdown and time derivative of the two datasets in the radial flow regime is in a good agreement this implies that the two hydraulic tests measure consistent formation hydraulic properties of a similar control volume this observation provides further support to the two dimensional hydraulic conceptual model of the system accordingly in this work only the data within the period of radial flow regime were used to estimate hydraulic parameters 4 2 anisotropy analysis the propose method see section 3 has been applied to the cross hole slug test of p6 to demonstrate the validity of the method the classical papadopulos s analysis was also performed on the cross hole pumping test data collected for same source well i e p6 the readers are referred to papadopulos 1965 and maslia and randolph 1987 for technical details of the papadoupulos method hydraulic responses taken at the boreholes forming the inner ring surrounding the source well i e at p0 p2 p3 p4 p7 p9 p10 and p11 wells were used in the anisotropy analysis as have discussed only the radial flow part of the data was analyzed see section 4 1 in the analysis of pumping test data a least square optimization algorithm similar to that considered in maslia and randolph 1987 was used to solve the equation system both the pumping and slug test analyses show variations of estimated t and s values the range of s variation is much larger than that of t this observation resonates with the findings reported by hantush 1966a b and streltsova 1988 that transmissivity estimated from pumping tests reflect the geometric mean in spite of sample direction while the variability of storativity is attributed to radial flow in homogeneous anisotropic aquifers certainly the variation in transmissivity presenting in our data is caused by formation heterogeneity the derived values of t r from cross hole pumping tests and 1 s from cross hole slug tests were plotted on polar coordinate graph fig 6 the 1 s values were normalized by the average value of t r estimates to make a direct comparison it can be seen from fig 6 that the results of our method using slug tests are quite consistent with that of the papadoupulos analysis of pumping tests thus it means that the propose method would provide consistent estimation of aquifer anisotropy with much lower costs in terms of equipment and test durations 5 discussion 5 1 effect of heterogeneity similar to the analytical anisotropy methods based on pumping tests the proposed method relies also on the assumption of homogeneous anisotropic media the presence of aquifer heterogeneity may affect significantly the anisotropy results a complication associated with all the analytical anisotropy methods that has not been discussed previously fig 7 presents the results of anisotropy identification using different combination of storativity estimates from boreholes located in different part of the aquifer from left to right in fig 7 the number of observation boreholes is increased and gradually covering all possible sampling direction defined by the well pattern fig 3c the identified anisotropy is represented by an ellipse in each graph the ellipses were obtained through fitting the scatter points using a least square optimization algorithm it is very clear from fig 7 that the identified anisotropy varies significantly as the number of boreholes increases the trend in terms of the major semi axis direction of the ellipses obtained using a small number of boreholes is entirely different almost rotated by 90 degrees from that obtained using all the boreholes forming the inner ring of sussargues well pattern fig 3c to demonstrate this effect is indeed caused by heterogeneity a numerical experiment is performed with the same well pattern and known hydraulic parameters that were identical to those used in the numerical model in section 3 fig 8 a presents the elliptical drawdown distribution at simulation time of 100 s the responses recorded at boreholes forming the inner ring of the well pattern marked in dark grey were analyzed to get storativity estimates in the direction of each observation well a perfect fit of the scattered storativity data to the ellipse function was found fig 8b the derived transmissivity tensor anisotropy ratio and storativity were respectively 0 98 0 0 3 97 10 6 m s 2 01 1 01 10 6 these were in good agreement with the input parameters see section 3 the comparison of the numerical and field analyses implies that in heterogeneous media the emergent anisotropy results from the proposed analytical anisotropy analysis may prone to significant errors the errors may be reduced only if a large number of observation points ideally uniformly distributed in all radial directions surrounding the source well is available vertical anisotropy caused by textural layering are typical in many depositional environments e g tidal or fluvial systems the impact of vertical anisotropy on responses to hydraulic tests is often taken into account in analytical models through introducing the vertical to horizontal transmissivity ratio kv kh it is noted that the adopted kgs slug test model has the ability to account for kv kh however in our analysis the vertical anisotropy is not considered due to the following reasons 1 analog studies on outcrops indicate that the vertical extent of typical main sedimentary units is on the same order as that of the borehole spacing while the lateral extent of these units are at least several times larger 2 well logging data and ct scan of the full diameter core of p12 show that although there may exist cross bedding structures in each sedimentary units the variation of hydraulic properties owing to the cross bedding is expected to be much lower than the hydraulic property contrast between the main aquifer unit and the adjacent aquitards fig 4 in the cases where vertical variation of hydraulic properties cannot be neglected the impact of vertical anisotropy can be considered in our two dimensional model through the inclusion of the kv kh ratio as one of the variables during the kgs model fitting process we further note that the results from our two dimensional analysis is based on the assumption that the lateral extent of the main units is much larger than the borehole spacing when the lateral extent of the sedimentary units is small a three dimensional analysis must be invoked in that case interference signals collected from multilevel slug tests with packer installations are required hsieh et al 1985 brauchler et al 2010 5 2 effects of measurement scale and near wellbore connectivity the scale effect is frequently invoked in well test analysis to explain variability in estimated hydraulic conductivity especially when measurements taken at various support volume are considered even though the explanations of the cause of the scale effect are controversial it has been widely observed that in sedimentary formations the average or equivalent hydraulic conductivity trends to first increase with the sampled rock volume and then become constant at regional scales schulze makuch and cherkauer 1997 existing analyses of scale effects were largely based on hydraulic conductivity estimates obtained on a well by well basis here we attempt to look at the issue of scale effects using an ensemble approach relying on transmissivity tensors which integrate the information contained in individual transmissivity estimates from single boreholes the unique configuration of wellbore pattern in the sussargues site allows transmissivity tensor analysis at the same source well but at two support scales or at the same support scale but at different source wells in the first analysis the set of cross hole data of slug test in p6 well have been divided into two groups the inner and outer rings according to the relative location of the observation well to the source well fig 9 a fig 9b and 9c present the result of tensor identification for inner ring and outer ring well groups respectively overall the results from two datasets show a high consistency in terms of both the size and principle axes directions of the identified tensors the geometric mean of the transmissivity tensor does not seem to increase with the increase of rock volume affected by the cross hole slug test even through other field factors may exert influences it seems that the variability in equivalent transmissivity tensor is minor when the anisotropy analysis is performed with slug test data recorded at different scales but for cross hole responses to the same source well in the second analysis we use a set of four sequential cross hole slug test data of p4 p5 p6 and p10 wells to identify anisotropy that is to say in one of the four tests one of the selected boreholes is used as source well while the other three are used as observation wells because the lateral area defined reciprocal distance between each source observation well pair is identical for the four tests it is thought that they investigate the same support volume of the aquifer fig 10 shows the tensor identified with the four cross hole slug tests it is evident that not only the size but also the principle axes orientations of the identified ellipse vary considerably this significant variation may be attributed to the difference in connectivity between boreholes and the heterogeneous medium the result seems to resonate with the finding of paradis et al 2016b that the reciprocity principle does not apply for cross hole slug test in heterogeneous medium otherwise identical transmissivity tensor is expected to obtain using the reciprocal source observation well pairs considered in the four tests the observations from the two analyses lead us to believe that correlation between variation in transmissivity and the change of scale may be deficient without taking into account the connectivity of medium the present results seem to show a disproof that transmissivity does not increase with measurement scale however the analysis presented in this paper is still preliminary a complete discussion of relationship between transmissivity tensor and measurement scale will be presented in the future the tensor method proposed here may also be useful to improve current understanding of the issue of scale effects previous studies on scale effects commonly define the support scale for a hydraulic test as some characteristic length for instance the distance between source and observation wells however the pressure diffusion generated by hydraulic tests is a three dimensional phenomenon consequently estimated parameters based on pressure data reflect the hydraulic properties of a rock volume in the presence of heterogeneity the real geometry of the affected rock volume by the pressure perturbation is complex therefore the frequently used scale measures defined in the form of characteristic length may not be representative this effect of the mismatch between scale and hydraulic parameter estimation has not been investigated in previous studies on scaling of hydraulic conductivity the support scale of hydraulic tests can be better defined by the tensor analysis presented in this paper because the tensor method integrates information from multiple observation boreholes the derived geometric mean of the transmissivity tensor may provide a more accurate approximation of the real average transmissivity of the affected rock volume between observation wells this is even more so for natural systems where directional features such as sedimentary channels or fractures are characteristic features with advanced geostatistical simulation methods such as transition probability based geostatistics carle and fogg 1996 carle 1999 multi point geostatistics mariethoz and caers 2014 and pluri gaussian simulations armstrong et al 2011 the complex connectivity of fracture or channel networks can be modeled the presented tensor identification method could then be applied in a systematic sensitivity analysis equipped with mcmc simulations to derive robust conclusions on the mechanism of the spatial averaging process of slug tests over the support volume and to quantify the influence of heterogeneities of various length scales on the tensor results this will be investigated in detail in a future paper 6 conclusions a new method for the identification of aquifer anisotropy using cross hole slug tests has been proposed the development of the method was based on a characteristic relationship between source to observation well distance and the storativity and scaler transformation the transformation converts an anisotropic medium to an equivalent isotropic medium such that existing analytical solutions to slug tests can be applied the feasibility of the proposed anisotropy method was first validated by a numerical experiment and then applied to a set of field cross hole slug test data a comparison analysis using the papadopulos method based on cross hole pumping tests was performed results show that the horizontal anisotropy depicted by our method with slug test data is consistent with that obtained by the papadopulos method and with ellipse of equal drawdown however in terms of efficiency e g equipment costs and time spent in testing and interpretation the new method outperforms the pumping test method by several hundred times because the method assumes homogeneous media when applying to heterogeneous aquifers significant errors may occur in the results especially when the number of observation boreholes is small however by careful selection of observation borehole location or by integrating information carried by a large number of boreholes the errors may be largely reduced based on the preliminary analysis the geometrical mean of the transmissivity tensor which is believed to be a better representative value for the effective transmissivity of rock volume affected by hydraulic tests does not seem to increase with the support volume in contrast the tensor results based on the cross hole slug tests are very sensitive to connectivity between the wells and the medium to demonstrate the feasibility of the new method a simplified kgs model was adopted to interpret cross hole slug tests in a semi confined aquifer however other existing analytical solutions for cross hole slug tests in a variety of aquifer and well conditions e g confined or unconfined with or without source well skin partial penetrating wells may also be incorporated in the tensor analysis provided that the existence of the important characteristic relationship between the measure scale and the aquifer storativity is verified acknowledgements we thank total s a for providing funding for the research we thank stephane chedeville julien gasser dorado marie leger for helping collecting some of

7056,we use synoptic surveys of stream discharge stable isotopes and dissolved noble gases to identify the source of groundwater discharge to the verde river in central arizona the verde river more than doubles in discharge in mormon pocket over a 1 4 km distance that includes three discrete locations of visible spring input to the river and other diffuse groundwater inputs a detailed study of the verde river between mormon pocket and the usgs clarkdale gage was conducted to better constrain the location of groundwater inputs the geochemical signature and constrain the source of groundwater input discharge water quality parameters temperature ph specific conductance and dissolved oxygen stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h noble gases he ne ar kr and xe and radon 222rn from river water were collected groundwater samples from springs and wells in the area were collected and analyzed for tracers measured in the stream along with some additional analytes major ions strontium isotopes 87sr 86sr carbon 14 δ13c and tritium groundwater isotopic signature is consistent with a regional groundwater source groundwater springs discharging to the river have a depleted stable isotopic signature indicating recharge source up to 1000 m higher than the discharge location in the verde river and are significantly fresher than stream water spring water has a radiocarbon age of several thousand years and some areas have tritium less than the laboratory reporting level or low concentrations of tritium 1 5 tu the strontium isotopes indicate groundwater interaction with tertiary volcanic rock and paleozoic sedimentary rocks along the study reach with distance downstream verde stream water chemistry shows increased 222rn freshening increased 4he and isotopic depletion with distance downstream we estimated total groundwater discharge by inverting a stream transport model against 222rn and discharge measured in the stream the salinity 4he and stable isotope composition of discharging groundwater was then estimated by fitting modeled values to observed in stream values estimated groundwater inflow to the stream was well within the ranges observed in springs indicating that the main source of streamflow is deep regional groundwater these results show that synoptic surveys of environmental tracers in streams can be used to estimate the isotopic composition and constrain the source of groundwater discharging to streams our data provide direct field evidence that deep regional groundwater discharge can be a significant source of streamflow generation in arid topographically complex watersheds keywords radon helium groundwater discharge geochemistry groundwater 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of streamflow generation providing baseflow

streamflow resilience to changes in climate land use and water resource extraction disturbances is a function of streamflow source e g tague and grant 2009 longer groundwater residence times and flow paths lead to larger stability in baseflow but increase the total area over which groundwater and stream must be co managed shorter groundwater residence times and flow paths will translate to high variability and susceptibility of baseflow but decrease the area of management of water resources manga 1996 gardner et al 2010 solder et al 2016 additionally the mean residence time of water through a catchment can exceed the hydrologic pressure response by orders of magnitude mcdonnell and beven 2014 hrachowitz et al 2016 knowing the age and scale of groundwater circulation is critical for predicting streamflow response to climatic and anthropogenic disturbance deep regional groundwater discharge to streams remains one of the least understood portions of the watershed budget the volume of deep groundwater discharge is important in determining stream response to climatic changes in snowmelt dominated catchments tague and grant 2009 genereux et al 2013 show that regional groundwater is critical for understanding watershed scale nutrient and carbon cycling the age distribution of groundwater discharging to the stream controls the water quality of baseflow and the migration and discharge of anthropogenic nutrients gilmore et al 2016 the volume of regional groundwater discharge should be known in order to accurately predict watershed quantity and quality regional groundwater has been theoretically shown to be an important component of streamflow generation topography precipitation and geology combine to determine the relative contribution of regional groundwater haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 gleeson and manning 2008 found that the high topography and low precipitation of the western us indicate that much of the groundwater discharge to rivers in this area should be dominated by regional groundwater flow regional scale coupled surface and groundwater models have shown that mean residence times in streams range from 1 to 10 years in upland catchments to greater than 10 000 years in larger arid catchments in the western us maxwell et al 2016 theoretical studies of regional groundwater contributions to streams have had some initial field verification using stream chemistry regional groundwater flow has been shown to be important in streamflow generation in mountainous areas of colorado frisbee et al 2011 gardner et al 2011 used dissolved 4he and 222rn measured to calculate the fraction of total groundwater coming from regional groundwater discharge to rivers this technique has been shown to work in other basins with different geology smerdon et al 2012 by increasing the number of age tracers which provide information over a broader range of residence times a more detailed look at the distribution of flow paths can be accomplished stolp et al 2010 smerdon et al 2012 harrington et al 2013 solomon et al 2015 at the continental scale the majority of active groundwater circulation may be young in age gleeson et al 2015 and the majority of streamflow has a short residence time jasechko et al 2016 however regional groundwater discharge should be important in arid locations with high topographic relief haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 these two juxtaposing arguments indicate that the relative role and amount of regional groundwater discharge is an open question in watershed hydrology and field based studies are required to help solve this conundrum the amount of regional groundwater discharge to rivers has not been quantified by field observation in most hydrogeological settings including the geologically hydrologically and topographically complex western us where regional groundwater flow may be a large component in this study we used a comprehensive analytical suite of both physical and chemical indicators of groundwater input to a river the results of the study were modeled to provide a better understanding of how knowledge of groundwater geochemistry can inform in stream measurements of groundwater contribution the results of this study can help inform future investigations as to which analytes are needed for understanding groundwater contribution to surface waters when a comprehensive analytical suite can not be measured specifically this study used synoptic differential stream gaging combined with 222rn dissolved noble gases including 4he stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h and stream conductivity to investigate the isotopic composition and thus source of groundwater discharge in a strongly gaining reach of the verde river by combining measurements of stream discharge and isotopic composition we use the stream chemistry to infer groundwater composition and source this technique allows us to constrain the source location and flow and path length for groundwater discharge and to identify the role of regional groundwater contribution these results show that stream surveys of discharge 4he δ18o and δ2h and stream conductivity can be used to identify the role regional groundwater discharge and provide direct evidence of the role of regional discharge in arid high topography areas 1 1 hydrogeologic setting the verde river is one of the largest perennial

pocket fig 1 lehner 1958 but there are no mapped structural features within mormon pocket on the map from dewitt et al 2008 the railroad fault splits just north of the verde river and rock units are displaced along the fault where the verde river crosses the fault expression dewitt et al 2008 the railroad fault displaces the devonian martin formation and cambrian tapeats sandstone to the course of the verde river upstream of the confluence with sycamore creek the usgs clarkdale gage is located just upstream of tertiary alkali basalt deposits forming a steep canyon through which the verde river flows the redwall limestone is a regional aquifer in the area and there are some springs discharging from the supai group near the grand canyon to the north of the study area two springs entering the verde river at the upper side of mormon pocket are discharging from the redwall limestone and one discharges from the supai group within mormon pocket another spring enters the verde river from the supai group just upstream of the usgs clarkdale gage in sycamore canyon sycamore creek begins perennial flow at parsons spring and then gains flow from summers spring which discharges

modeled stream discharge and solute concentration using a numerical solution of the coupled mass balance equations for streamflow and stream solute concentration the mass balance equation for fluid

and 2 are a set of partial differential equation which are coupled through the discharge and stream geometry we solve these equations using a fully implicit finite volume method based on fipy a python finite volume solver library guyer et al 2009 for a forward run we solve eq 1 for the discharge along the stream reach q given the spatially distributed amount of groundwater gain and loss stream geometry the stream tributary and diversion discharges precipitation and evaporation rates we then solve eq 2 for the stream concentration profile of each tracer given the concentration of tracers measured in groundwater flow along the reach and the tracer dependent gas exchange velocity decay coefficient and the atmospheric equilibrium concentration 2 3 2 boundary conditions the stream reach is discretized from the upstream to downstream extents of the study for this study the total reach length investigated was 11 3 km the reach is discretized at roughly 1 m grid spacing constant discharge and constant concentration dirichlet boundary conditions set to the measured discharge and concentration at the upstream sampling site are implemented at the upstream end of the stream transport model constant concentration gradient neumann and constant discharge diriclet boundary conditions are set at the bottom end of the reach atmospheric equilibration is only active for dissolved gases where the gas exchange coefficient is greater than zero atmospheric equilibrium concentration of dissolved noble gases in water ccstp g was calculated using 3 c i x a p i k h t v m m h

average elevation of the reach the gas dependent henry s coefficient was calculated for the measured stream temperature using henry s coefficient relationships summarized in ballentine et al 2002 for non volatile tracers the gas exchange coefficient and atmospheric equilibrium gas concentrations are both set to zero which removes the gas exchange terms from eq 2 2 3 3 parameterization parameters were chosen to represent characteristic site conditions at the time of the synoptic survey atmospheric equilibrium concentration for 4he was calculated using the henry s coefficient at the given air temperature from ballentine et al 2002 for 222rn the atmospheric equilibrium concentration was set to zero atmospheric 4he was set to the standard atmospheric concentration at 1100 m elevation and 21 degrees celsius of 4e 8 ccstp g all other tracers are assumed to be non volatile and not exchange with the atmosphere over the reach length longitudinal dispersivity was set to zero which means that numerical dispersion with dispersivity of the grid cell spacing 1 m controls the dispersive flux given our fully implicit solution technique the only decaying tracer simulated is 222rn for which a decay coefficient of 3 82 d 1 was assigned cook and herczeg 2000 stream widths and average depths were measured at each discharge measurement cross section then were linearly interpolated along the stream profile between measurement locations for the model fig 4 stream cross sectional area along the model domain was then calculated as the width times the average depth we estimate the gas exchange coefficient for 4he and 222rn using stream hydraulics and temperature after raymond et al 2012 and references therein first we calculate the k600 gas exchange velocity which is the gas exchange velocity for a schmidt number of 600 co2 at 20 c using the average slope s velocity v and depth d in eq 4 4 k 600 5037 vs 0 89 d 0 54 the gas specific exchange velocity is then found by calculating the schmidt number sc for the gas of interest at the stream temperature and using the relationship in eq 5 raymond et al 2012 5 k g 1 k 600 s c g 1 600 1 2 we estimate a gas exchange velocity of 4 7 m d for 222rn and 11 4 m d for 4he table 1 2 3 4 modeling strategy we estimate the average groundwater discharge to the stream in over 1 km steps in the following manner groundwater discharge was assumed to follow as a step function with a 1 km step length groundwater concentrations of tracers were measured in springs at several sites along the reach we assume that all groundwater discharge has reached secular equilibrium and is equal to the concentration sampled in springs along the river the concentration of 222rn in the groundwater for each inflow step was assigned along the model profile by the nearest neighbor of sampled groundwater we then estimate the total groundwater inflow along the reach by fitting our stream transport model to the observations of stream discharge and 222rn concentration in the stream using a marquart levenberg optimization routine which minimized the chi squared residual between model and observed 222rn and stream discharge using the estimated distributed groundwater discharge the concentration of 4he stable isotopes and conductivity in the discharging groundwater was then estimated by fitting the observed stream concentration of these tracers the estimated isotopic concentrations can then be compared to those measured in springs and the isotopic signature used to assess whether a regional source similar to that feeding springs in the area is the dominant source of groundwater flow to the stream 3 results and discussion the location of the sample sites in this study are presented in table 2 3 1

on recharge elevation zuber et al 1995 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 manning and solomon 2003 a temperature lapse rate ta was calculated for the verde river watershed presented in eq 8 using mean annual air temperature from available weather stations located at different elevations with a decrease of 8 1 degrees celsius per 1000 m fig 7 which is similar to the slope of 8 7 degrees celsius per 1000 m

maximum and minimum noble gas recharge temperatures were computed for each groundwater sample where the minimum value is the spring discharge elevation and the maximum is 2400 m data indicate that the groundwater samples recharged from cooler temperatures and higher elevations from where they discharge near the verde river recharge temperatures ranged from 11 1 to 14 4 degrees celsius and

fig 7 recharge elevations determined from noble gas and stable isotope data provides a valuable opportunity to compare recharge elevations calculated by each method which are presented in table 3 recharge elevations determined from δ2h were the highest stable isotope recharge elevations were determined from empirical data collected from recent precipitation beisner et al 2016 which may not be representative of groundwater recharge during past climate conditions the fit of the noble gas data to the model used to calculate recharge parameters can be effected by degassing prior or during sample collection two of the springs were sampled previously for carbon 14 and tritium and contain old water datable by radiocarbon methods shea spring 30 1 pmc corrected age 2211 to 5069 years before

2007 and 0 7055 from groundwater near stoneman lake johnson et al 2012 which may reflect interaction with tertiary volcanic rocks groundwater from springs in mormon pocket values are between the paleozoic sedimentary rock that the springs discharge from and the tertiary volcanic values and may suggest a component of water interacting primarily with volcanic rock and some interaction with paleozoic sedimentary rocks fig 2 3 2 seepage analysis 3 2 1 discharge streamflow in late june 2016 increased from 0 57 m3 s to 1 27 m3 s within approximately 1 4 km as the verde river flows through mormon pocket fig 9 there are three distinct visible spring discharge locations in this reach that contribute to increases in flow but their combined flow of 0 21 m3 s does not account for all of the discharge increase of 0 7 m3 s there appear to be other locations of diffuse groundwater input to the verde river in this reach downstream of mormon pocket the river gains 0 15 m3 s in the next 5 km to a total flow value of 1 42 m3 s the verde river gains approximately 0 18 m3 s from sycamore creek 8 4 km downstream of the beginning of the study reach in mormon pocket the flow at the usgs clarkdale gage downstream of sycamore creek was 1 68 1 71 m3 s on 6 29 2016 and indicates there may be 0 1 0 13 m3 s input of flow between the inflow from sycamore creek and the usgs clarkdale gage there was one small spring inflow observed just upstream of the usgs clarkdale gage but not enough to account for the discharge difference alone the discharge at the usgs clarkdale gage fluctuated daily during the june 2016 investigation on the order of 0 03 m3 s fig 10 a small discharge peak was observed at the usgs clarkdale gage starting late 6 29 2016 which rose 0 86 m3 s over a period of 2 h and 15 min the peak receded 0 8 m3 s in 8 h and 30 min to a value 0 06 m3 s greater than the value before the peak the peak was not recorded at the usgs verde river at paulden gage and indicates that the inflow occurred from tributaries between the two gages the majority of the 2016 samples 15 out of 20 and discharge measurements 13 out of 14 were collected before the peak 3 2 2 radon and helium 222rn of in surface water indicates the nearby input of groundwater with large concentrations of 222rn 222rn samples were collected at discharge measurement locations and additional sites to obtain a good spatial coverage of data replicate samples of 222rn showed good agreement 1 with a 2 pci l difference 2 with a 2 pci l difference and 30 with a 16 3 pci l difference 222rn was measured at all but one of the surface water sites and 4he was measured on a subset of the surface water samples collected in june 2016 222rn concentrations in june 2016 were below the laboratory reporting level and 4he concentration was similar to atmospheric concentration 4e 8 ccstp g in the verde river at the most upstream site in mormon pocket 5 3e 8 ccstp g fig 12 downstream of the uppermost site is a small spring input from the right bank and the next downstream verde river sample had a 4he concentration of 8 6e 8 ccstp g double the atmospheric equilibrium and associated with an increase of 222rn to 46 pci l fig 12 222rn concentration decreased to 77 pci l about 0 1 km downstream of the previous site following a stretch of riffle flow with whitewater where there may be some mixture with air and possible loss of 222rn 4he concentration in the verde river downstream of visible seepage of presumed groundwater from the left bank near 1 km downstream was 3 8e 7 ccstp g an order of magnitude greater compared with the uppermost sample and 222rn increased to a value of 107 pci l fig 11 the 4he concentration in the river decreased to 8 7e 8 ccstp g at 6 4 km downstream of the uppermost sample just above the crossing with the railroad fault where 222rn is also less than the laboratory reporting level fig 12 downstream of the fault two continuous spatial samples had 222rn values of 13 2 and 13 1 pci l indicating the potential input of groundwater unresolvable within the error of the discharge measurements and the 4he concentration was also slightly higher at 7 5e 8 ccstp g these low level values are below the laboratory reporting level of 20 pci l but were determined by the laboratory to represent a quantifiable concentration 222rn concentrations in the verde river above the confluence with sycamore creek were below the laboratory reporting level as was sycamore creek just before entering the verde river summers spring which contributes almost half of the water to sycamore creek had a 4he concentration of 4 1e 6 ccstp g and most of the 4he had left the water in sycamore creek 8 0e 8 ccstp g in 2015 and 222rn was less than the laboratory reporting level just before the confluence with the verde river fig 12 the verde river at the usgs clarkdale gage had a 222rn value of 28 5 pci l which may indicate the presence of groundwater input to the river downstream of the confluence with sycamore creek increases of 222rn and 4he concentration in the verde river were observed below visible spring input locations as well as three areas with no observed inputs fig 11 these areas of increase in dissolved gases may represent areas of groundwater input to the stream beneath the streambed 3 2 3 stable isotopes stable isotopes can serve as indicators of recharge elevation evaporation and provide quantification of water from different sources stable isotope values in verde river water collected in june 2016 become more depleted with input of groundwater along with an increase in 222rn and 4he concentration fig 12 the groundwater samples from springs in the study area had the lowest stable isotope values followed by sycamore creek fig 13 the stable isotope value from the usgs clarkdale gage from june 2016 plotted between the upstream most samples from this study in mormon pocket and the groundwater spring samples and had the lowest stable isotopic values of all surface water samples the surface water samples from the verde river plot along the lmwl from blasch et al 2006 and may represent an evaporated signature two of the samples collected following the peak in discharge at the usgs clarkdale gage figs 10 and 13 were collected downstream of the crossing of a normal fault where there was a slight increase of 222rn concentration fig 12 these two samples plot farther to the left compared with the other surface water samples and closer to the gmwl fig 13 discharge increased 65 percent from the uppermost site in mormon pocket and the usgs clarkdale gage between june 27 and 30 2016 the proportion of groundwater at the usgs clarkdale gage was computed using a simple 2 end member mixing model as presented in beisner et al 2014 with a groundwater endmember of 11 75 and 82 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively and a surface water endmember of the uppermost verde river water with values of 9 85 and 73 5 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the proportion of groundwater calculated for δ18o was 57 percent and for δ2h was 74 percent 3 3 modeling groundwater spring composition along the reach in june 2016 shows several isotopic indicators of regional groundwater flow with a high elevation low evaporation recharge zone including high noble gas recharge elevations elevated radiogenic 4he and significantly lighter stable isotope signatures the surface water composition in the verde river upstream of mormon pocket is more consistent with a higher evaporation low elevation surface water and in general has higher conductivity and is heavier isotopically the verde systematically gained streamflow over the study reach during june 2016 fig 14 the majority of this gain comes from subsurface discharge as only one tributary joins the verde along the reach estimated groundwater discharge along reach determined by inversion against the stream discharge and 222rn concentrations shows most of the groundwater gain occurs in the first km of the reach figs 14 and 15 over this section we see a significant decrease in conductivity fig 14 an increase in 222rn and 4he fig 15 and a shift to lighter isotopic compositions fig 16 the trend in stream chemistry is indicative of addition of a regional groundwater source the model accurately captures the total discharge and 222rn via inversion figs 14 and 15 because all water over 2 weeks in age should have relatively similar 222rn composition this inversion provides a reasonable and quantitative estimate of the total groundwater discharge to the stream over the reach but does not distinguish between regional and other more shallow or local groundwater sources comparison of the subsequently estimated conductivity stable isotope and 4he composition of discharge groundwater with those observed in springs can be used to determine the dominant source of the groundwater discharge the estimated groundwater discharge composition from the model was specific conductance of 360 40 µs cm 4he of 1 1e 6 4e 8 ccstp g δ18o of 11 4 0 8 per mil δ2h of 81 5 5 per mil where the uncertainty in given by 95 linear confidence interval from the least squares inversion modeled conductivity stable isotope signatures and 4he fit the observed data from the verde river well figs 14 16 the three stable isotope samples collected in the verde river following a small peak in surface water discharge on june 30 fig 10 were on the order of 0 3 per mil for δ18o and 3 per mil for δ2h greater compared to river samples prior to the peak and therefore are offset from the modeled data by a similar magnitude fig 16 the groundwater chemistry for springs discharging in mormon pocket during this study fall within the range of predicted groundwater composition from the model for specific conductance δ18o and δ2h which provides a valuable check on the model modeled 4he values are the same order of magnitude as several springs and springs with an order of magnitude less 4he may represent sites where degassing may be occurring prior to sample collection the elevated 4he concentration in groundwater is two orders of magnitude above atmospheric compositions and thus indicative of significantly greater than 1000 years old the isotopic compositions predicted by the model are significantly lighter than verde river water and agree well with spring water compositions indicating a high elevation recharge area given the total isotopic composition of groundwater entering the stream it is clear that all the groundwater discharge along the reach is from a regional source similar to that feeding the springs and very little if any groundwater discharge is from local sources such as local hyporheic exchange or alluvial groundwater discharge the parameter with the highest degree of uncertainty for the current study is the gas exchange coefficient no tracer injection test was performed during the sampling period significantly limiting our knowledge of this parameter we estimated this parameter using published relationships derived large datasets of stream hydraulics and re aeration coefficients these relationships provide a reasonable estimate the for the gas exchange coefficient but have significant uncertainty associated with them we assess the uncertainty associated with the gas exchange coefficient using bayesian analysis assuming our best groundwater inflows we use a markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling technique to sample from the posterior distribution of gas exchange coefficients which best fit the observed data we assume a prior distribution as a gamma distribution with the mean given by our calculated value 4 7 m d and a standard deviation of 1 m d we then use gibbs sampler which draws samples of the gas exchange coefficient run the forward model and compare the modeled data to the observed data to estimate the likelihood of that gas exchange value we draw 1000 samples from posterior distribution which gives us the best estimate of our knowledge of the gas exchange coefficient given our observed data and the observation error our mcmc results indicate that the best fit mean gas exchange coefficient is 4 55 m d with a standard deviation of 0 4 m d and 95 linear confidence bounds of 3 85 m d and 5 24 m d we estimate the predictive uncertainty due to uncertainty in the 222rn gas exchange coefficient by re running the groundwater inflow and then concentration estimation routines using the 95 confidence intervals using this analysis the estimated groundwater concentrations for conductivity 4he and stable isotopes change by less than 1 significantly less than the stated uncertainty in groundwater estimation least squares fit these uncertainty results indicate that our estimate of groundwater isotopic composition is robust and linear 95 confidence intervals derived from the least squares fit does an adequate job of characterizing the uncertainty of our estimate the age of streamflow is an open question in hydrology mcdonnell et al 2010 recent synthesis papers have demonstrated that streamflow and groundwater have short residence times globally gleeson et al 2016 jasechko et al 2016 however continental scale surface and groundwater models indicate that the portion of old stream water is highly dependent upon the regional topographic geologic and climatic conditions maxwell et al 2016 more field studies which directly investigate the role of regional groundwater discharge are required to understand the location distribution and amount of regional groundwater discharge in streamflow generation here we use a unique set of isotopes which allow for the identification of deep regional groundwater discharge we modify the technique used by gardner et al 2011 and smerdon et al 2012 by directly estimating the groundwater inflow composition rather than assuming it based upon nearby groundwater samples this paradigm builds of that of stolp et al 2010 and solomon et al 2015 which both attempt to determine groundwater characteristics from stream samples however here we utilize a set of tracers which specifically target old water rather than modern tracers our results give definitive evidence that the majority of streamflow addition to this reach of the verde river comes from old regional groundwater recharged at high elevations our results clearly illustrate that regional groundwater discharge can play an important role in streamflow generation these field based results are in agreement with theoretical papers that suggest arid watersheds with high topography should be regional groundwater importers gleeson and manning 2008 taking these lines of evidence together we argue that more field based investigations are required to fully constrain the role of regional groundwater discharge especially in arid basins of high topographic relief 4 conclusions we investigate a highly gaining reach of verde river in arizona to estimate the location of recharge and the role of regional groundwater discharge in streamflow generation in arid mountainous landscapes the verde river more than doubles in discharge over the study reach the majority of this increase is coming from groundwater discharge springs sampled in the area show lighter stable isotopic composition lower conductivity high noble gas recharge elevations and elevated radiogenic 4he and 222rn when compared to local stream water these isotopic signatures are consistent with a long residence time regional flow path recharged at high elevations distal to the verde river along the reach the composition of the verde river clearly shifts towards this regional end member we used observed discharge and 222rn concentration along with stream transport modeling to estimate the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge to the verde river and estimate the conductivity stable isotope and 4he composition of the groundwater discharging to the stream groundwater discharge is focused in the upper kilometer of the reach modeled stable isotopic composition conductivity and 4he strongly indicate that long regional groundwater flow paths are discharging to the stream and that similar flow paths contribute to nearby springs these modeling results show that virtually all of the streamflow gain over this section of the verde river is coming from regional groundwater flow with little to no indication of significant local hyporheic or alluvial groundwater discharge thus streamflow generation over this reach can not be explained by local hillslope response or shallow young groundwater additions the tight spatial location of recharge from a single regional source indicates that streamflow generation in arid environments is highly heterogeneous and can be dominated by old water these results indicate that more field based study is required to constrain the role of regional groundwater in these systems and that globally aggregated trends in stream and groundwater age may underestimate the role of old water in these settings once geochemistry has been established for groundwater in a study area the model presented in

7056,we use synoptic surveys of stream discharge stable isotopes and dissolved noble gases to identify the source of groundwater discharge to the verde river in central arizona the verde river more than doubles in discharge in mormon pocket over a 1 4 km distance that includes three discrete locations of visible spring input to the river and other diffuse groundwater inputs a detailed study of the verde river between mormon pocket and the usgs clarkdale gage was conducted to better constrain the location of groundwater inputs the geochemical signature and constrain the source of groundwater input discharge water quality parameters temperature ph specific conductance and dissolved oxygen stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h noble gases he ne ar kr and xe and radon 222rn from river water were collected groundwater samples from springs and wells in the area were collected and analyzed for tracers measured in the stream along with some additional analytes major ions strontium isotopes 87sr 86sr carbon 14 δ13c and tritium groundwater isotopic signature is consistent with a regional groundwater source groundwater springs discharging to the river have a depleted stable isotopic signature indicating recharge source up to 1000 m higher than the discharge location in the verde river and are significantly fresher than stream water spring water has a radiocarbon age of several thousand years and some areas have tritium less than the laboratory reporting level or low concentrations of tritium 1 5 tu the strontium isotopes indicate groundwater interaction with tertiary volcanic rock and paleozoic sedimentary rocks along the study reach with distance downstream verde stream water chemistry shows increased 222rn freshening increased 4he and isotopic depletion with distance downstream we estimated total groundwater discharge by inverting a stream transport model against 222rn and discharge measured in the stream the salinity 4he and stable isotope composition of discharging groundwater was then estimated by fitting modeled values to observed in stream values estimated groundwater inflow to the stream was well within the ranges observed in springs indicating that the main source of streamflow is deep regional groundwater these results show that synoptic surveys of environmental tracers in streams can be used to estimate the isotopic composition and constrain the source of groundwater discharging to streams our data provide direct field evidence that deep regional groundwater discharge can be a significant source of streamflow generation in arid topographically complex watersheds keywords radon helium groundwater discharge geochemistry groundwater 1 introduction groundwater is an important source of streamflow generation providing baseflow during periods of no precipitation and maintaining water quantity the recharge source flow path length and age of groundwater discharging to the stream control baseflow discharge quantity and quality streamflow resilience to changes in climate land use and water resource extraction disturbances is a function of streamflow source e g tague and grant 2009 longer groundwater residence times and flow paths lead to larger stability in baseflow but increase the total area over which groundwater and stream must be co managed shorter groundwater residence times and flow paths will translate to high variability and susceptibility of baseflow but decrease the area of management of water resources manga 1996 gardner et al 2010 solder et al 2016 additionally the mean residence time of water through a catchment can exceed the hydrologic pressure response by orders of magnitude mcdonnell and beven 2014 hrachowitz et al 2016 knowing the age and scale of groundwater circulation is critical for predicting streamflow response to climatic and anthropogenic disturbance deep regional groundwater discharge to streams remains one of the least understood portions of the watershed budget the volume of deep groundwater discharge is important in determining stream response to climatic changes in snowmelt dominated catchments tague and grant 2009 genereux et al 2013 show that regional groundwater is critical for understanding watershed scale nutrient and carbon cycling the age distribution of groundwater discharging to the stream controls the water quality of baseflow and the migration and discharge of anthropogenic nutrients gilmore et al 2016 the volume of regional groundwater discharge should be known in order to accurately predict watershed quantity and quality regional groundwater has been theoretically shown to be an important component of streamflow generation topography precipitation and geology combine to determine the relative contribution of regional groundwater haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 gleeson and manning 2008 found that the high topography and low precipitation of the western us indicate that much of the groundwater discharge to rivers in this area should be dominated by regional groundwater flow regional scale coupled surface and groundwater models have shown that mean residence times in streams range from 1 to 10 years in upland catchments to greater than 10 000 years in larger arid catchments in the western us maxwell et al 2016 theoretical studies of regional groundwater contributions to streams have had some initial field verification using stream chemistry regional groundwater flow has been shown to be important in streamflow generation in mountainous areas of colorado frisbee et al 2011 gardner et al 2011 used dissolved 4he and 222rn measured to calculate the fraction of total groundwater coming from regional groundwater discharge to rivers this technique has been shown to work in other basins with different geology smerdon et al 2012 by increasing the number of age tracers which provide information over a broader range of residence times a more detailed look at the distribution of flow paths can be accomplished stolp et al 2010 smerdon et al 2012 harrington et al 2013 solomon et al 2015 at the continental scale the majority of active groundwater circulation may be young in age gleeson et al 2015 and the majority of streamflow has a short residence time jasechko et al 2016 however regional groundwater discharge should be important in arid locations with high topographic relief haitjema and mitchell bruker 2005 these two juxtaposing arguments indicate that the relative role and amount of regional groundwater discharge is an open question in watershed hydrology and field based studies are required to help solve this conundrum the amount of regional groundwater discharge to rivers has not been quantified by field observation in most hydrogeological settings including the geologically hydrologically and topographically complex western us where regional groundwater flow may be a large component in this study we used a comprehensive analytical suite of both physical and chemical indicators of groundwater input to a river the results of the study were modeled to provide a better understanding of how knowledge of groundwater geochemistry can inform in stream measurements of groundwater contribution the results of this study can help inform future investigations as to which analytes are needed for understanding groundwater contribution to surface waters when a comprehensive analytical suite can not be measured specifically this study used synoptic differential stream gaging combined with 222rn dissolved noble gases including 4he stable isotopes of water δ18o and δ2h and stream conductivity to investigate the isotopic composition and thus source of groundwater discharge in a strongly gaining reach of the verde river by combining measurements of stream discharge and isotopic composition we use the stream chemistry to infer groundwater composition and source this technique allows us to constrain the source location and flow and path length for groundwater discharge and to identify the role of regional groundwater contribution these results show that stream surveys of discharge 4he δ18o and δ2h and stream conductivity can be used to identify the role regional groundwater discharge and provide direct evidence of the role of regional discharge in arid high topography areas 1 1 hydrogeologic setting the verde river is one of the largest perennial sources of water in arizona flowing from near paulden az to the salt river near fountain hills az a portion of the verde river downstream of the study area is designated as wild and scenic verde river arizona 2017 and another portion is part of the state parks system as the verde river greenway state natural area verde river greenway 2017 yavapai county is one of the fastest growing rural counties in the united states blasch et al 2006 increased population growth will result in increased demand on the region s water resources blasch et al 2006 and a better understanding of the system is needed to understand the possible effects to the verde river better knowledge of the location of groundwater contributions to the river are also needed to refine groundwater models of the area to understand impacts from future changes to the groundwater system using discharge measurements on a broad scale throughout the middle verde river blasch et al 2006 and bills et al 2007 found a large increase in discharge near a bend in the river known as mormon pocket fig 1 the study described herein focuses on the area of the verde river from mormon pocket to the usgs verde river near clarkdale streamgage hereafter referred to as the usgs clarkdale gage fig 1 the stratigraphic section in the study area consists of a sequence of cambrian to permian sedimentary rocks overlain by tertiary volcanic rocks and younger alluvial sedimentary deposits the mississippian redwall limestone is the dominant lithology at the upper and lower ends of mormon pocket with the supai group cropping out at the verde river between due to dip of 5 to 10 degrees to the northeast of the beds in the area lehner 1958 fig 2 a fault cuts across the verde river on the east side of the bend in the verde river near mormon pocket fig 1 lehner 1958 but there are no mapped structural features within mormon pocket on the map from dewitt et al 2008 the railroad fault splits just north of the verde river and rock units are displaced along the fault where the verde river crosses the fault expression dewitt et al 2008 the railroad fault displaces the devonian martin formation and cambrian tapeats sandstone to the course of the verde river upstream of the confluence with sycamore creek the usgs clarkdale gage is located just upstream of tertiary alkali basalt deposits forming a steep canyon through which the verde river flows the redwall limestone is a regional aquifer in the area and there are some springs discharging from the supai group near the grand canyon to the north of the study area two springs entering the verde river at the upper side of mormon pocket are discharging from the redwall limestone and one discharges from the supai group within mormon pocket another spring enters the verde river from the supai group just upstream of the usgs clarkdale gage in sycamore canyon sycamore creek begins perennial flow at parsons spring and then gains flow from summers spring which discharges from the redwall limestone near a fault expression the study area is located in a semidesert grassland and surrounded by great basin conifer woodland biotic communities habimap arizona 2018 annual precipitation varies from around 25 38 cm in the basins to around 51 101 cm at the crest of the mountains blasch et al 2006 precipitation primarily occurs in two seasons summer monsoon characterized by short lived intense and localized convective rainstorms july through september and the other characterized by longer lived less intense and more regional frontal precipitation events december through march june is typically a month with low precipitation in central arizona occurring prior to the summer monsoon rain flow in the verde river during june represents primarily baseflow

modeled stream discharge and solute concentration using a numerical solution of the coupled mass balance equations for streamflow and stream solute concentration the mass balance equation for fluid flow along the reach is given by 1 q x q tr x p w e w q gi w q go w q p x where q is the stream discharge m3 s x is the discretized distance downstream m q tr is spatially distributed location of tributary discharge m3 s p is the precipitation rate m s e is the evaporation rate m s q gi is the groundwater discharge gain flux m s q go is the groundwater loss flux m s q p is the spatially distributed locations of stream diversion m3 s and w is the stream width m for 1 d advective dispersive transport in the stream with groundwater inflow atmospheric gas exchange and first order solute decay mass balance gives 2 c x x d a q c x q gi w q c gw q go w q c k w q c c atm a q λ c 1 q q tr x c tr 1 q q p x c where c is the stream concentration mol m3 d is the longitudinal hydrodynamic

the tracer mol m3 λ is the decay coefficient s 1 c tr is the concentration of the tributary at the confluence mol m3 and all other variables have been defined for eq 1 2 3 1 solution technique eqs 1 and 2 are a set of partial differential equation which are coupled through the discharge and stream geometry we solve these equations using a fully implicit finite volume method based on fipy a python finite volume solver library guyer et al 2009 for a forward run we solve eq 1 for the discharge along the stream reach q given the spatially distributed amount of groundwater gain and loss stream geometry the stream tributary and diversion discharges precipitation and evaporation rates we then solve eq 2 for the stream concentration profile of each tracer given the concentration of tracers measured in groundwater flow along the reach and the tracer dependent gas exchange velocity decay coefficient and the atmospheric equilibrium concentration 2 3 2 boundary conditions the stream reach is discretized from the upstream to downstream extents of the study for this study the total reach length investigated was 11 3 km the reach is discretized at roughly 1 m grid spacing constant discharge and constant concentration dirichlet boundary conditions set to the measured discharge and concentration at the upstream sampling site are implemented at the upstream end of the stream transport model constant concentration gradient neumann and constant discharge diriclet boundary conditions are set at the bottom end of the reach atmospheric equilibration is only active for dissolved gases where the gas exchange coefficient is greater than zero atmospheric equilibrium concentration of dissolved noble gases in water ccstp g was calculated using 3 c i x a p i k h t v m m h 2 o given the known atmospheric concentration x z mixing ratio the henry s coefficient k h t in gpa and stream temperature t in degrees c atmospheric pressure p in gpa the standard molar volume v m and the molar mass of water m h 2 o t was set as the average temperature for all sampling times atmospheric pressure was estimated from a standard atmospheric adiabatic lapse rate curve and the average elevation of the reach the gas dependent henry s coefficient was calculated for the measured stream temperature using henry s coefficient relationships summarized in ballentine et al 2002 for non volatile tracers the gas exchange coefficient and atmospheric equilibrium gas concentrations are both set to zero which removes the gas exchange terms from eq 2 2 3 3 parameterization parameters were chosen to represent characteristic site conditions at the time of the synoptic survey atmospheric equilibrium concentration for 4he was calculated using the henry s coefficient at the given air temperature from ballentine et al 2002 for 222rn the atmospheric equilibrium concentration was set to zero atmospheric 4he was set to the standard atmospheric concentration at 1100 m elevation and 21 degrees celsius of 4e 8 ccstp g all other tracers are assumed to be non volatile and not exchange with the atmosphere over the reach length longitudinal dispersivity was set to zero which means that numerical dispersion with dispersivity of the grid cell spacing 1 m controls the dispersive flux given our fully implicit solution technique the only decaying tracer simulated is 222rn for which a decay coefficient of 3 82 d 1 was assigned cook and herczeg 2000 stream widths and average depths were measured at each discharge measurement cross section then were linearly interpolated along the stream profile between measurement locations for the model fig 4 stream cross sectional area along the model domain was then calculated as the width times the average depth we estimate the gas exchange coefficient for 4he and 222rn using stream hydraulics and temperature after raymond et al 2012 and references therein first we calculate the k600 gas exchange velocity which is the gas exchange velocity for a schmidt number of 600 co2 at 20 c using the average slope s velocity v and depth d in eq 4 4 k 600 5037 vs 0 89 d 0 54 the gas specific exchange velocity is then found by calculating the schmidt number sc for the gas of interest at the stream temperature and using the relationship in eq 5 raymond et al 2012 5 k g 1 k 600 s c g 1 600 1 2 we estimate a gas exchange velocity of 4 7 m d for 222rn and 11 4 m d for 4he table 1 2 3 4 modeling strategy we estimate the average groundwater discharge to the stream in over 1 km steps in the following manner groundwater discharge was assumed to follow as a step function with a 1 km step length groundwater concentrations of tracers were measured in springs at several sites along the reach we assume that all groundwater discharge has reached secular equilibrium and is equal to the concentration sampled in springs along the river the concentration of 222rn in the groundwater for each inflow step was assigned along the model profile by the nearest neighbor of sampled groundwater we then estimate the total groundwater inflow along the reach by fitting our stream transport model to the observations of stream discharge and 222rn concentration in the stream using a marquart levenberg optimization routine which minimized the chi squared residual between model and observed 222rn and stream discharge using the estimated distributed groundwater discharge the concentration of 4he stable isotopes and conductivity in the discharging groundwater was then estimated by fitting the observed stream concentration of these tracers the estimated isotopic concentrations can then be compared to those measured in springs and the isotopic signature used to assess whether a regional source similar to that feeding springs in the area is the dominant source of groundwater flow to the stream 3 results and discussion the location of the sample sites in this study are presented in table 2 3 1 geochemistry of contributing springs general chemistry of the groundwater sites in this study are circumneutral ph 6 8 7 9 water temperature ranging from 18 2 to 21 2 degrees celsius low specific conductance 318 555 µs cm and dissolved oxygen ranging from 6 4 to 7 5 mg l the three sampled springs discharging in mormon pocket were on the lower end of the range of specific conductance 318 375 µs

83 4 to 81 1 per mil for δ18o and δ2h respectively fig 6 all of the samples plotted between the local meteoric water lines lmwl for the verde river watershed from blasch et al 2006 determined from precipitation in flagstaff between 1962 and 1974 and beisner et al 2016 determined from precipitation between 2003 and 2014 recharge elevation from stable isotope values can be calculated using eqs 6 and 7 from beisner et al 2016 converted to represent elevation in meters presented here as eqs 6 and 7 equations were determined empirically from precipitation collectors throughout the verde river watershed over a period of 10 years it does not account for evaporation prior to recharge 6 δ 18 o 0 001312 z 8 87 7 δ 2 h 0 009514 z 59 8 where z represents the recharge elevation in meters the range of recharge elevation for the group of spring samples contributing groundwater to the study area 11 59 to 11 9 and 81 1 to 83 4 per mil for δ18o and δ2h respectively ranges from 2073 to 2309 m for δ18o and 2239 to 2480 m for δ2h table 3 the elevation of the uppermost verde river sample from mormon pocket from this study is 1120 m and the lowest elevation is from the usgs clarkdale gage at 1067 m noble gas samples were collected from groundwater samples and represent a more direct measurement of recharge temperature and elevation 4he concentrations in groundwater samples ranged from 4 1e to 6 to 8 2e 7 cc g of water at standard temperature and pressure stp 222rn concentration in the groundwater samples ranged from 92 to 440 pci l recharge temperature and elevation were calculated using ne ar kr and xe table 3 with the closed system equilibration model ce aeschbach hertig et al 2000 using a standard inverse technique newton method to minimize the error weighted misfit χ2 between measured and modeled values aeschbach hertig et al 1999 ballentine and hall 1999 manning and solomon 2003 a local relationship between recharge temperature and elevation can place useful constraints on recharge elevation zuber et al 1995 aeschbach hertig et al 1999 manning and solomon 2003 a temperature lapse rate ta was calculated for the verde river watershed presented in eq 8 using mean annual air temperature from available weather stations located at different elevations with a decrease of 8 1 degrees celsius per 1000 m fig 7 which is similar to the slope of 8 7 degrees celsius per 1000 m from johnson et al 2012 from the verde river watershed 8 ta 0 0081 z 25 432 where ta represents the recharge temperature in degrees celsius and z represents the recharge elevation in meters water table temperatures and thus recharge temperatures for typical depths below ground surface of 5 50 m are generally 0 3 degrees celsius above ta domenico and schwartz 1990 lee and hahn 2006 cey 2009 maximum and minimum noble gas recharge temperatures were computed for each groundwater sample where the minimum value is the spring discharge elevation and the maximum is 2400 m data indicate that the groundwater samples recharged from cooler temperatures and higher elevations from where they discharge near the verde river recharge temperatures ranged from 11 1 to 14 4 degrees celsius and elevations from 1550 to 1850 m using the closed system equilibrium model aeschbach hertig et al 2000 for the three springs discharging in mormon pocket a 17 02 03aab2 a 18 02 34dcc1 and a 17 02 03aaa1 fig 7 recharge elevations determined from noble gas and stable isotope data provides a valuable opportunity to compare recharge elevations calculated by each method which are presented in table 3 recharge elevations determined from δ2h were the highest stable isotope recharge elevations were determined from empirical data collected from recent precipitation beisner et al 2016 which may not be representative of groundwater recharge during past climate conditions the fit of the noble gas data to the model used to calculate recharge parameters can be effected by degassing prior or during sample collection two of the springs were sampled previously for carbon 14 and tritium and contain old water datable by radiocarbon methods shea spring 30 1 pmc corrected age 2211 to 5069 years before present beisner et al 2014 and summers spring 35 1 pmc corrected age 4600 years before present bills et al 2007 shea spring tritium value was below the laboratory reporting level 1 1 tu in 2011 beisner et al 2014 and summers spring tritium value was above the laboratory reporting level at 1 1 tu in 2003 bills et al 2007 and 1 5 tu in 2011 strontium isotopic ratio in groundwater samples collected during this study ranged from 0 70664 to 0 70739 fig 8 groundwater samples from springs in mormon pocket had lower strontium isotopic values 0 70664 0 70677 compared with the groundwater at summers spring bills et al 2007 and shea spring 0 7073 0 7077 fig 8 tertiary volcanic rocks including basalt have the lowest measured strontium isotopic values 0 70463 0 70535 bills et al 2007 paleozoic sedimentary rocks have intermediate strontium isotopic values 0 70756 0 70930 bills et al 2007 and precambrian igneous rocks had the most radiogenic values 0 71618 0 76912 bills et al 2007 precipitation values have been reported to range from 0 7098 to 0 7107 frost and toner 2004 groundwater from the western flagstaff area have low strontium isotopic values 0 70588 0 70655 bills et al 2007 and 0 7055 from groundwater near stoneman lake johnson et al 2012 which may reflect interaction with tertiary volcanic rocks groundwater from springs in mormon pocket values are between the paleozoic sedimentary rock that the springs discharge from and the tertiary volcanic values and may suggest a component of water interacting primarily with volcanic rock and some interaction with paleozoic sedimentary rocks fig 2 3 2 seepage analysis 3 2 1 discharge streamflow in late june 2016 increased from 0 57 m3 s to 1 27 m3 s within approximately 1 4 km as the verde river flows through mormon pocket fig 9 there are three distinct visible spring discharge locations in this reach that contribute to increases in flow but their combined flow of 0 21 m3 s does not account for all of the discharge increase of 0 7 m3 s there appear to be other locations of diffuse groundwater input to the verde river in this reach downstream of mormon pocket the river gains 0 15 m3 s in the next 5 km to a total flow value of 1 42 m3 s the verde river gains approximately 0 18 m3 s from sycamore creek 8 4 km downstream of the beginning of the study reach in mormon pocket the flow at the usgs clarkdale gage downstream of sycamore creek was 1 68 1 71 m3 s on 6 29 2016 and indicates there may be 0 1 0 13 m3 s input of flow between the inflow from sycamore creek and the usgs clarkdale gage there was one small spring inflow observed just upstream of the usgs clarkdale gage but not enough to account for the discharge difference alone the discharge at the usgs clarkdale gage fluctuated daily during the june 2016 investigation on the order of 0 03 m3 s fig 10 a small discharge peak was observed at the usgs clarkdale gage starting late 6 29 2016 which rose 0 86 m3 s over a period of 2 h and 15 min the peak receded 0 8 m3 s in 8 h and 30 min to a value 0 06 m3 s greater than the value before the peak the peak was not recorded at the usgs verde river at paulden gage and indicates that the inflow occurred from tributaries between the two gages the majority of the 2016 samples 15 out of 20 and discharge measurements 13 out of 14 were collected before the peak 3 2 2 radon and helium 222rn of in surface water indicates the nearby input of groundwater with large concentrations of 222rn 222rn samples were collected at discharge measurement locations and additional sites to obtain a good spatial coverage of data replicate samples of 222rn showed good agreement 1 with a 2 pci l difference 2 with a 2 pci l difference and 30 with a 16 3 pci l difference 222rn was measured at all but one of the surface water sites and 4he was measured on a subset of the surface water samples collected in june 2016 222rn concentrations in june 2016 were below the laboratory reporting level and 4he concentration was similar to atmospheric concentration 4e 8 ccstp g in the verde river at the most upstream site in mormon pocket 5 3e 8 ccstp g fig 12 downstream of the uppermost site is a small spring input from the right bank and the next downstream verde river sample had a 4he concentration of 8 6e 8 ccstp g double the atmospheric equilibrium and associated with an increase of 222rn to 46 pci l fig 12 222rn concentration decreased to 77 pci l about 0 1 km downstream of the previous site following a stretch of riffle flow with whitewater where there may be some mixture with air and possible loss of 222rn 4he concentration in the verde river downstream of visible seepage of presumed groundwater from the left bank near 1 km downstream was 3 8e 7 ccstp g an order of magnitude greater compared with the uppermost sample and 222rn increased to a value of 107 pci l fig 11 the 4he concentration in the river decreased to 8 7e 8 ccstp g at 6 4 km downstream of the uppermost sample just above the crossing with the railroad fault where 222rn is also less than the laboratory reporting level fig 12 downstream of the fault two continuous spatial samples had 222rn values of 13 2 and 13 1 pci l indicating the potential input of groundwater unresolvable within the error of the discharge measurements and the 4he concentration was also slightly higher at 7 5e 8 ccstp g these low level values are below the laboratory reporting level of 20 pci l but were determined by the laboratory to represent a quantifiable concentration 222rn concentrations in the verde river above the confluence with sycamore creek were below the laboratory reporting level as was sycamore creek just before entering the verde river summers spring which contributes almost half of the water to sycamore creek had a 4he concentration of 4 1e 6 ccstp g and most of the 4he had left the water in sycamore creek 8 0e 8 ccstp g in 2015 and 222rn was less than the laboratory reporting level just before the confluence with the verde river fig 12 the verde river at the usgs clarkdale gage had a 222rn value of 28 5 pci l which may indicate the presence of groundwater input to the river downstream of the confluence with sycamore creek increases of 222rn and 4he concentration in the verde river were observed below visible spring input locations as well as three areas with no observed inputs fig 11 these areas of increase in dissolved gases may represent areas of groundwater input to the stream beneath the streambed 3 2 3 stable isotopes stable isotopes can serve as indicators of recharge elevation evaporation and provide quantification of water from different sources stable isotope values in verde river water collected in june 2016 become more depleted with input of groundwater along with an increase in 222rn and 4he concentration fig 12 the groundwater samples from springs in the study area had the lowest stable isotope values followed by sycamore creek fig 13 the stable isotope value from the usgs clarkdale gage from june 2016 plotted between the upstream most samples from this study in mormon pocket and the groundwater spring samples and had the lowest stable isotopic values of all surface water samples the surface water samples from the verde river plot along the lmwl from blasch et al 2006 and may represent an evaporated signature two of the samples collected following the peak in discharge at the usgs clarkdale gage figs 10 and 13 were collected downstream of the crossing of a normal fault where there was a slight increase of 222rn concentration fig 12 these two samples plot farther to the left compared with the other surface water samples and closer to the gmwl fig 13 discharge increased 65 percent from the uppermost site in mormon pocket and the usgs clarkdale gage between june 27 and 30 2016 the proportion of groundwater at the usgs clarkdale gage was computed using a simple 2 end member mixing model as presented in beisner et al 2014 with a groundwater endmember of 11 75 and 82 2 for δ18o and δ2h respectively and a surface water endmember of the uppermost verde river water with values of 9 85 and 73 5 for δ18o and δ2h respectively the proportion of groundwater calculated for δ18o was 57 percent and for δ2h was 74 percent 3 3 modeling groundwater spring composition along the reach in june 2016 shows several isotopic indicators of regional groundwater flow with a high elevation low evaporation recharge zone including high noble gas recharge elevations elevated radiogenic 4he and significantly lighter stable isotope signatures the surface water composition in the verde river upstream of mormon pocket is more consistent with a higher evaporation low elevation surface water and in general has higher conductivity and is heavier isotopically the verde systematically gained streamflow over the study reach during june 2016 fig 14 the majority of this gain comes from subsurface discharge as only one tributary joins the verde along the reach estimated groundwater discharge along reach determined by inversion against the stream discharge and 222rn concentrations shows most of the groundwater gain occurs in the first km of the reach figs 14 and 15 over this section we see a significant decrease in conductivity fig 14 an increase in 222rn and 4he fig 15 and a shift to lighter isotopic compositions fig 16 the trend in stream chemistry is indicative of addition of a regional groundwater source the model accurately captures the total discharge and 222rn via inversion figs 14 and 15 because all water over 2 weeks in age should have relatively similar 222rn composition this inversion provides a reasonable and quantitative estimate of the total groundwater discharge to the stream over the reach but does not distinguish between regional and other more shallow or local groundwater sources comparison of the subsequently estimated conductivity stable isotope and 4he composition of discharge groundwater with those observed in springs can be used to determine the dominant source of the groundwater discharge the estimated groundwater discharge composition from the model was specific conductance of 360 40 µs cm 4he of 1 1e 6 4e 8 ccstp g δ18o of 11 4 0 8 per mil δ2h of 81 5 5 per mil where the uncertainty in given by 95 linear confidence interval from the least squares inversion modeled conductivity stable isotope signatures and 4he fit the observed data from the verde river well figs 14 16 the three stable isotope samples collected in the verde river following a small peak in surface water discharge on june 30 fig 10 were on the order of 0 3 per mil for δ18o and 3 per mil for δ2h greater compared to river samples prior to the peak and therefore are offset from the modeled data by a similar magnitude fig 16 the groundwater chemistry for springs discharging in mormon pocket during this study fall within the range of predicted groundwater composition from the model for specific conductance δ18o and δ2h which provides a valuable check on the model modeled 4he values are the same order of magnitude as several springs and springs with an order of magnitude less 4he may represent sites where degassing may be occurring prior to sample collection the elevated 4he concentration in groundwater is two orders of magnitude above atmospheric compositions and thus indicative of significantly greater than 1000 years old the isotopic compositions predicted by the model are significantly lighter than verde river water and agree well with spring water compositions indicating a high elevation recharge area given the total isotopic composition of groundwater entering the stream it is clear that all the groundwater discharge along the reach is from a regional source similar to that feeding the springs and very little if any groundwater discharge is from local sources such as local hyporheic exchange or alluvial groundwater discharge the parameter with the highest degree of uncertainty for the current study is the gas exchange coefficient no tracer injection test was performed during the sampling period significantly limiting our knowledge of this parameter we estimated this parameter using published relationships derived large datasets of stream hydraulics and re aeration coefficients these relationships provide a reasonable estimate the for the gas exchange coefficient but have significant uncertainty associated with them we assess the uncertainty associated with the gas exchange coefficient using bayesian analysis assuming our best groundwater inflows we use a markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling technique to sample from the posterior distribution of gas exchange coefficients which best fit the observed data we assume a prior distribution as a gamma distribution with the mean given by our calculated value 4 7 m d and a standard deviation of 1 m d we then use gibbs sampler which draws samples of the gas exchange coefficient run the forward model and compare the modeled data to the observed data to estimate the likelihood of that gas exchange value we draw 1000 samples from posterior distribution which gives us the best estimate of our knowledge of the gas exchange coefficient given our observed data and the observation error our mcmc results indicate that the best fit mean gas exchange coefficient is 4 55 m d with a standard deviation of 0 4 m d and 95 linear confidence bounds of 3 85 m d and 5 24 m d we estimate the predictive uncertainty due to uncertainty in the 222rn gas exchange coefficient by re running the groundwater inflow and then concentration estimation routines using the 95 confidence intervals using this analysis the estimated groundwater concentrations for conductivity 4he and stable isotopes change by less than 1 significantly less than the stated uncertainty in groundwater estimation least squares fit these uncertainty results indicate that our estimate of groundwater isotopic composition is robust and linear 95 confidence intervals derived from the least squares fit does an adequate job of characterizing the uncertainty of our estimate the age of streamflow is an open question in hydrology mcdonnell et al 2010 recent synthesis papers have demonstrated that streamflow and groundwater have short residence times globally gleeson et al 2016 jasechko et al 2016 however continental scale surface and groundwater models indicate that the portion of old stream water is highly dependent upon the regional topographic geologic and climatic conditions maxwell et al 2016 more field studies which directly investigate the role of regional groundwater discharge are required to understand the location distribution and amount of regional groundwater discharge in streamflow generation here we use a unique set of isotopes which allow for the identification of deep regional groundwater discharge we modify the technique used by gardner et al 2011 and smerdon et al 2012 by directly estimating the groundwater inflow composition rather than assuming it based upon nearby groundwater samples this paradigm builds of that of stolp et al 2010 and solomon et al 2015 which both attempt to determine groundwater characteristics from stream samples however here we utilize a set of tracers which specifically target old water rather than modern tracers our results give definitive evidence that the majority of streamflow addition to this reach of the verde river comes from old regional groundwater recharged at high elevations our results clearly illustrate that regional groundwater discharge can play an important role in streamflow generation these field based results are in agreement with theoretical papers that suggest arid watersheds with high topography should be regional groundwater importers gleeson and manning 2008 taking these lines of evidence together we argue that more field based investigations are required to fully constrain the role of regional groundwater discharge especially in arid basins of high topographic relief 4 conclusions we investigate a highly gaining reach of verde river in arizona to estimate the location of recharge and the role of regional groundwater discharge in streamflow generation in arid mountainous landscapes the verde river more than doubles in discharge over the study reach the majority of this increase is coming from groundwater discharge springs sampled in the area show lighter stable isotopic composition lower conductivity high noble gas recharge elevations and elevated radiogenic 4he and 222rn when compared to local stream water these isotopic signatures are consistent with a long residence time regional flow path recharged at high elevations distal to the verde river along the reach the composition of the verde river clearly shifts towards this regional end member we used observed discharge and 222rn concentration along with stream transport modeling to estimate the spatial distribution of groundwater discharge to the verde river and estimate the conductivity stable isotope and 4he composition of the groundwater discharging to the stream groundwater discharge is focused in the upper kilometer of the reach modeled stable isotopic composition conductivity and 4he strongly indicate that long regional groundwater flow paths are discharging to the stream and that similar flow paths contribute to nearby springs these modeling results show that virtually all of the streamflow gain over this section of the verde river is coming from regional groundwater flow with little to no indication of significant local hyporheic or alluvial groundwater discharge thus streamflow generation over this reach can not be explained by local hillslope response or shallow young groundwater additions the tight spatial location of recharge from a single regional source indicates that streamflow generation in arid environments is highly heterogeneous and can be dominated by old water these results indicate that more field based study is required to constrain the role of regional groundwater in these systems and that globally aggregated trends in stream and groundwater age may underestimate the role of old water in these settings once geochemistry has been established for groundwater in a study area the model presented in

7057,the shortage of water resources and the increasing competition among water users have highlighted the importance of the water allocation problem water availability is crucial for water resource allocation and changes frequently leading to the necessity to predict available water this paper develops a framework aimed to plan regional water allocations under different representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios using an interval parameter conditional value at risk cvar two stage stochastic programming model this framework combines prediction and optimization to reflect climate change the uncertainty of water system and the coordination between water resources allocation and risk the feasibility and practicality of the framework are demonstrated by its application in a real world case study in the lower songhua river basin in northeast china comparison between the results of the developed model and actual conditions show that 11 61 108 m3 volume of water supply can be saved after optimization indicating that the developed model tends to allocate water in a more efficient way the ratio of surface water to groundwater is reduced from 2 1 to 1 62 1 the proposed model has practical relevance for saving water and alleviating groundwater overexploitation the approach is applicable to most areas with severe water shortages and groundwater overexploitation and decision makers can determine the appropriate options for water resources allocation based on risk preferences and actual conditions keywords regional water resources allocation interval two stage stochastic model cvar rcp 1 introduction with the development of society and the expansion of cities the unsustainable planning and management of regional water resources have intensified the imbalance between water supply and demand resulting in a serious waste of surface water and severe exploitation of groundwater asefa et al 2014 fu et al 2018a in addition extreme weather conditions influence the uncertainty of the available water supplies and lead to economic risk for water management systems thus creating a barrier to the allocation of water resources hu et al 2016a b therefore water allocation based on reasonable and available water prediction is an intense global issue the available surface water is a critical factor for regional water resources planning runoff is the main source of surface water and is influenced by uncertain climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation najafi and moradkhani 2015 milly et al 2008 to quantify these uncertainties many studies have coupled the representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios that were proposed in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report ipcc ar5 intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 with multiple general circulation models gcms to predict the future climate gcms are considered the best available tools for modelling the future climate wang et al 2017a b the variable infiltration capacity vic model can simulate the available runoff zhang et al 2012 used the vic model to explore the change trend of water resources in the huaihe river basin under global warming these studies enable the accurate prediction of the available surface water based on the prediction of available surface water corresponding to different climate change scenarios regional water resources can be planned through optimization techniques li et al 2015 developed the two level linear fractional water management tlfwm model and the stochastic two level linear fractional chance constrained water management stlfcwm model to identify desired water resources management policies considering various uncertainties hu et al 2016a used the compromise programming cp method to trade off economic benefit efficiency and equity in the water allocation li et al 2017 developed an intuitionistic fuzzy multi objective non linear programming ifmonlp model that solved multiple problems including crop yield increases blue water savings and water supply cost reductions however there are many uncertainties such as water availability variations water price fluctuations and allocation target changes in regional water systems therefore incorporating uncertainty programming methods into the optimization models for regional water allocation is necessary maqsood et al 2005 the interval two stage stochastic programming itsp model is widely used in many uncertainty optimization models lin et al 2009 lu et al 2009 the itsp model can overcome the complexity and uncertainty of water resource systems by using interval parameters and probability distribution such as unit product income upstream water quantity and changes in ecological water demand in different sectors these uncertainties can lead to multiple uncertainties and uncertain amplifications via their interaction fu et al 2018b in summary to ensure the sustainable development of water resources and improve their utilization rate the itsp model can optimally plan the allocation of water resource systems because water shortages are exacerbated by climate change the allocation risks should be considered in water allocations to ensure the coordinated development of the regional economy and water resources shao et al 2011 wang et al 2017a integrated conditional value at risk cvar into factorial stochastic programming to solve the random uncertainties and interactions in water resource systems hu et al 2016b used cvar to control the risk of economic efficiency loss corresponding to variations in water availability cvar which is an improved value at risk var method is an investment risk measurement method rockfellar 2000 and is effectively used in optimization models for regional water allocation because it is based on a simple calculation and it provides a better reflection of potential risks xu and yu 2014 yamout et al 2007 further using cvar can ensure fair water allocations and balance the system benefits and expected losses accordingly incorporating cvar into the itsp model is useful for analysing the fairness of water resources allocation unfortunately using such an integrated model to plan regional water resources based on water balance simulations under different climate change scenarios has been limited thus far therefore it is significant to integrate the water availability prediction results and the cvar model in a water allocation optimization model however a limited number of studies have reported such an integration this paper aims to plan regional water allocations under different rcp scenarios using an interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model the proposed approach is capable of 1 alleviating the imbalance between water supply and demand through the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater 2 promoting the economic benefits of the water resource system while simultaneously considering the penalties and risks due to violated policies 3 reflecting uncertainties expressed as discrete intervals and probability distributions and 4 obtaining various water planning alternatives under different climate change scenarios 2 problem description 2 1 overview of the problem in the past studies on the optimal allocation of water resources the available water resource is usually derived from the planning report to provide a credible water resources allocation plan for decision makers the available water prediction is very important with the rcp and gcms employed to predict temperature and precipitation under various climate change scenarios a vic model was used to simulate the water balance and a simulated runoff was obtained to ensure the ecological sustainability of the river basin a 70 runoff volume is needed to meet the ecological water demand in the basin then the remaining 30 is used as the available surface water that combines with groundwater allocated to the municipal industrial and agricultural sectors in the basin cvar is introduced into the water allocation model to ensure fair water allocation the decision procedure of the developed framework for water resources planning is illustrated in fig 1 the framework includes three modules 1 the weather generator module that generates the future climatic conditions under various rcp scenarios by gcms 2 the hydrologic module that uses the vic model to simulate and predict the runoff volume and 3 the optimization module that obtains the operating rules for the best economic effect using the interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model additionally in step 4 the results analysis and a discussion according to the different scenarios are included 2 2 motivation for water resources allocation under the prediction of the available water the fluctuation in the available water of the river basin causes great difficulties for water allocation different runoff volumes under different climate change scenarios can be obtained and the allocation of water resources can serve as a reference for decision makers therefore reliable weather generator selection is necessary the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 is a comprehensive assessment of the various gcms of the current coupled model intercomparison project phase in the fifth phase cmip5 based on the performance of these gcms in china wang et al 2017b and the detailed comparison of gcms presented by yan et al 2015 the ability of each gcm to simulate different variables is different pierce et al 2008 reported that a multi model combined average is superior to the estimate given by any one individual model the present paper selected five gcms that are suitable for the study area to comprehensively predict the climate as shown in table 1 this paper only considers the rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 scenarios combined with the 5 gcms the temperature and precipitation data under each rcp scenario are obtained which lay the foundation for the next research among the various methods the vic model a macro scale distributed hydrologic model originally developed by liang et al 1994 is widely used for runoff prediction the vic model has some significant characteristics in that the hydrologic cycle process the water balance and the energy balance can be considered simultaneously along with the parameterization of the two runoff components of surface runoff and base flow this model is widely used to study the impact of climate change on river flows zhai and tao 2017 xie et al 2003 lohmann et al 1998 the prediction results of the five gcms under the three rcp scenarios were coupled with the vic model to predict the runoff change trends in the study area in 2050 to verify the reliability of the model this paper used taylor diagrams to validate the monthly maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation from 1961 to 1990 section 4 3 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and normalized root mean square deviation nrmsd were used in the calibration the nse is an indicator that is widely used to evaluate the performance of the hydrological model the formula is as follows 1 nse 1 t 1 t q 0 t q m t 2 t 1 t q 0 t q 0 2 where q 0 t is the observed runoff volume at moment t 108 m3 q m t is the simulated runoff volume at moment t 108 m3 and q 0 is the average observed runoff volume 108 m3 the value of nse ranges from to 1 a value of nse of 1 indicates that the simulation result is perfect with high reliability a value of nse close to 0 indicates that the simulation result is close to the average observation result that is the overall result is credible but with a large simulation error when the value of nse is far less than 0 then the model is not credible the nrmsd indicates the standard deviation of the differences between simulations and observations lombard et al 2009 this variable is calculated as follows 2 nrmsd t 1 n q 0 t q m t 2 n q max q min where q max is the maximum observed runoff volume 108 m3 and q min is the minimum observed runoff volume 108 m3 consequently the vic model can simulate the reliable runoff volume to provide a basis to obtain the available surface water 2 3 coping with risk resulting from inequity for different sectors the economic benefits produced by each water supply unit are quite different likely leading to an unfair allocation of water resources generally the risk is proportional to the return such that more water allocation to the industrial sector results in greater economic benefits however the competition for water becomes more pronounced among the sectors leading to a higher risk of water system failure therefore managing the inequity of water allocation is very important to prevent an unequal water allocation cvar which can better balance the conflict between system benefits and system risk is integrated to obtain a more reasonable and effective water allocation scheme the formula of cvar is as follows 3 min x x e f x ω λ ρ q x ζ ω where x is the decision variable ω is a random variable e f x ω is the value of the expected return function λ λ 0 1 is the non negative weight coefficient or risk coefficient to trade off the expected penalty with risk which is determined by the risk preferences of the decision makers thus resulting in different optimization solutions ρ is a risk measurement model q is a continuous loss function and ζ ω is a random function the conditional value at risk of random variables at confidence level α α 0 1 can be defined as follows fu et al 2017 4 ρ λ η 1 1 α e p h v h where η is the maximum loss of the system under a given t confidence level and α is the confidence level usually set to 0 90 0 95 or 0 99 qiu et al 2014 this paper selects α 0 95 for the results to facilitate the calculation vh is a positive auxiliary variable obviously with cvar the decision makers can achieve a more reasonable water allocation scheme 3 modelling 3 1 notation an interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model for regional water allocation is developed in this part to present the model a list of notations is provided in table 2 3 2 objective functions the purpose of optimizing water resources allocation is to determine how much water from different water sources can be used to meet the water demands of each sector and maximize the system benefits in water resources allocation systems the total water supply is the sum of the water supply amount of each sector however the water supply of each sector varies with time and the future available water is uncertain therefore it is necessary to forecast the water supply for each sector based on the historical data of the water supply and the regional economic development plans then the predicted water demand can be regarded as the water supply target if the actual water supply to each sector meets the corresponding water target then the ideal system benefits can be obtained if the actual water supply to each sector does not satisfy the target then a water shortage will occur consequently generating a water shortage penalty that will reduce the system benefits to express the uncertainty of the water supply target the per unit water supply benefits the penalty coefficient and the interval parameter can be introduced to solve the problem therefore the itsp model is adopted in this paper the objective function of the model is to maximize the system benefits subject to a series of constraints associated with water resources such as the available water water demand and water shortage constraints according to the principle of the itsp model the first stage of the model is to allocate water i e the water target to different sectors under different rcp scenarios directly leading to various water resource availabilities the second stage will be composed of the sectors to calculate the loss of benefits resulting from water shortage the itsp model can be expressed as follows 5 max f i 1 i j 1 j b ij w ij e i 1 i j 1 j c ij s ijh where indicates the upper limit of the parameter and indicates the lower limit of the parameter the water deficits of different rcp scenarios in the target year are treated as discrete functions therefore the interval two stage stochastic programming model can be expressed as follows 6 max f i 1 i j 1 j b ij w ij i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h p h c ij s ijh with the integration of the itsp and cvar models an interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model can be formulated and expressed as follows objective function 7 max f i 1 i j 1 j b ij w ij i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h p h c ij s ijh λ η 1 1 α h 1 h p h v h 3 3 constraints 1 available water constraints the availability of water for sectors is limited the available surface water for each sector must not exceed the total available water this constraint can be expressed as 8 q ijh w ij s ijh 2 water demand constraints to ensure basic use and development the minimum water demand for each sector should be satisfied meanwhile the water allocated to each sector should be no more than its maximum expected volume to avoid waste and improve water use efficiency this constraint can be expressed as 9 w ij max w ij w ij min 3 water shortage constraints the volume of the water shortage in each sector should be less than the volume of the water requirement during all water allocation stages this constraint can be expressed as 10 s ijh w ij 4 technical constraints to consider the balance between the system benefits and the system risk cvar constraints are required as follows 11 v h i 1 i j 1 j c ij s ijh η 5 non negative constraints the water allocated to the study area from the surface water and groundwater should not be negative this constraint can be expressed as 12 s ijh 0 13 v h 0 14 η 0 in this model w ij is an uncertain parameter in the form of an interval number that cannot be solved directly through the interval algorithm therefore according to zhang et al 2009 decision variables zij zij 0 1 are introduced to solve the model then the interval parameter w ij can be converted to a deterministic parameter let w ij w ij δ w ij z ij and δ w ij w ij w ij when zij 0 w ij equals the lower limit of the interval while when zij 1 w ij equals the upper limit of the interval finding the optimal solution of decision variables zijopt enables the optimal solution of w ij to be obtained as follows w ijopt w ij δ w ij z ijopt 3 4 global model combing the interval algorithm the above formulas 7 14 can be transformed into two deterministic submodels since the objective function seeks the maximum system benefits the upper bound of the submodel is solved first as follows 15 max f i 1 i j 1 j b ij w ij δ w ij z ij i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h p h c ij s ijh λ η 1 1 α h 1 h p h v h 16 q ijh w ij δ w

ijhopt and f opt are solutions of the upper bound of the submodel then w ijopt can be obtained based on zijopt in the same way the lower bound of the submodel is expressed as follows 23 max f i 1 i j 1 j b ij w ij δ w ij z ijopt i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h p h c ij s ijh λ η 1 1 α h 1 h p h v h constraint conditions 24 q ijh w ij δ w ij z ijopt s ijh 25 w ij max w ij δ w ij z ijopt w ij min 26 s ijh w ij δ w ij z ijopt 27 v h i 1 i j 1 j c ij s ijh η 28 s ijh s ijhopt 0 29 v h 0 s ijopt f opt can be obtained by solving the lower bound of the submodel thus the optimal solutions of the interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model are f opt f opt f opt s ijhopt s ijhopt s ijhopt and the optimal water allocation amount can be calculated by op t ij w ijopt s ijopt 4 case study 4 1 study area the study area is the lower songhua river basin which is located in northeast china 124 04 to 132 52 e and 42 72 to 48 96 n fig 2 this basin is an important commodity grain production base the nenjiang river and the upper songhua river flow into the lower songhua river the main stream of the lower songhua river travels a total distance of 939 km and drains an area of 184 600 km2 and the average annual precipitation of this area is 591 6 mm the multiannual average volumes of surface water and groundwater are 35 968 billion m3 and 13 611 billion m3 respectively historically the utilization rate of transit water resources in the study area has remained at approximately 30 and these are the main water resources for production and livelihood in the basin to promote the steady development of the social economy in the river region an adequate water supply for municipal industrial and agricultural sectors should be provided the annual temperature range in this area is from 25 83 c to 26 5 c so the main water inflow is concentrated from june to september due to the long frost period hence to meet the requirements of the ecological water demand of the river and to meet the increasing demand for water in each water sector it is necessary to reasonably allocate water resources and to solve the competing interests of the water sectors in the lower songhua river basin 4 2 data collection long term hydrological and meteorological data are critical for predicting river flow trends climate change mainly precipitation and temperature significantly affects the volume of runoff in the study area considering the availability of data 5 hydrometric stations on the main stream 4 hydrometric stations on the tributaries and 13 national meteorological stations in the lower songhua river basin are selected to collect monthly runoff volume precipitation and temperature data from 1961 to 1990 which can be used for testing the model performance the runoff volume data of the above hydrometric stations are from the hydrographic office in heilongjiang province china the information regarding the meteorological stations is from the china meteorological data service center cmdc table 3 provides basic information regarding the 10 hydrometric stations the amounts of groundwater and the water supply targets are obtained from the songliao water resources bulletin 2001 2015 the heilongjiang almanacs the statistical almanacs of heilongjiang province and field research data watch forcing data wfd 1958 2001 and watch forcing data era interim wfdei 1979 2010 downloaded from http www eu watch org are used to calibrate and validate the vic model because they are specifically designed to drive land surface models and hydrological models weedon et al 2011 weedon et al 2015 yan et al 2015 previously verified the accuracy and reliability of the wfd and wfdei data 4 3 results analysis 4 3 1 temperature and precipitation simulation to verify the simulation accuracy of the maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and precipitation pre under the selected five gcm scenarios in the study area this paper first used the gcms shown in fig 3 to simulate the tmax tmin and pre of the years 1961 1990 with a resolution of 0 5 0 5 then the data were extracted and sorted using arcgis and the annual monthly average values of tmax tmin and pre of the study area were obtained the simulated results were compared and verified with the monthly average values of the corresponding meteorological elements obtained from the selected 13 national meteorological stations see fig 2 from 1961 to 1990 the simulation results are shown in fig 3 fig 3 a shows the comparison between the simulated data and the measured data the simulation results and the measured values of tmax and tmin are relatively consistent for pre the simulated values coincide with the measured data in the dry season because there was less precipitation in the dry season there was a long frost period in the dry season and the precipitation changes over the 30 year period were relatively stable however for the pre in the flood season the simulation results are higher than the measured data especially in july the main reason for this finding is that there is remarkable variation in the precipitation amounts in the flood season over the study period and the changes are irregular the d value between the measured maximum and minimum precipitation values in july of 1961 1990 was 426 2 mm fig 3 b is a taylor diagram that can quantify the correspondence ratio between the simulation results and the measured data including the pearson correlation coefficient the root mean square error rmse and the standard deviation as seen from the diagram the pearson correlation coefficients between the simulated values and the measured values of tmax tmin and pre are 0 994 0 993 and 0 905 respectively the rmses are 0 11 0 12 and 0 49 respectively and the standard deviations are 0 985 1 003 and 1 063 respectively the correspondence ratio between the simulation results and the measured data shows that the results of the gcm simulations are better therefore the simulation outputs corresponding to the gcms can provide meteorological driving data in 2050 for the vic model 4 3 2 runoff volume simulation based on the simulated outputs of gcms this paper used vic to simulate the water balance of the study area the volumes of runoff on each grid were output by running the vic then the runoff on each grid was collected in the outlet section of the river basin by coupling with the concentration model to tailor the model to the study area it was necessary to calibrate and validate the vic model by using the wfd 1958 2001 and wfdei 1979 2012 after the vic model was calibrated it was evaluated using the measured runoff volume data from 2006 to 2010 taking two hydrometric stations on the main stream of the songhua river as an example i e the jiamusi and harbin stations the verification results of the simulated and measured annual runoff volume data and average monthly runoff volume data for many years are shown in fig 4 from the overall verification conditions of the two hydrological stations the simulated runoff volume obtained by the vic was relatively high the simulated runoff volume during the dry season was relatively accurate while during the flood season the simulation values were higher than the average monthly values the main reason for this result is that the vic model took into account conditions with more floods in the songhua river during the flood season and these results were in accordance with the results of zhai and tao 2017 the nse and the nrmsd of jiamusi were 0 79 and 0 073 respectively the nse and the nrmsd of harbin were 0 67 and 0 077 respectively these results showed that the model performance was relatively stable and that the simulated runoff volume could be used in the subsequent water resources planning the calibrated vic model was used to simulate runoff volume under different rcp scenarios the corresponding results are illustrated in fig 5 as shown in the figure the runoff volume will decrease to different extents under different scenarios in the future and the trend of the future runoff volume will decrease under the rcp4 5 scenario the predicted runoff volume and the historical runoff volume mostly overlapped and these occasions mainly occurred in the dry season the predicted runoff volume during the flood season was slightly lower than the historical runoff volume but the overall trend was relatively consistent under the rcp6 0 scenario the extreme range of the predicted runoff volume was reduced relative to the rcp4 5 scenario and the predicted runoff volume exceeded the historical runoff volume only from january to march while in the remaining months the predicted runoff volume was lower than the historical volume under the rcp8 5 scenario the predicted runoff volume peaked during the spring floods indicating that climate warming had a significant effect on the melting rate of snow which caused a sharp increase in runoff volume 4 3 3 optimal water allocation results the predicted runoff volumes under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 were obtained based on the vic according to the p iii curve the occurrence probabilities of the three scenarios were 0 3 0 5 and 0 2 respectively to address the problem in which the predicted runoff volume from the vic model is high this paper employed the correction method proposed by zhai and tao 2017 considering the actual situation of surface water utilized in the study area the utilization factor of the runoff was determined and the available surface water was obtained table 4 lists the upper and lower limits of the surface water and groundwater availabilities under different rcp scenarios in water resources planning if the available water can satisfy the water targets of different sectors then the economic benefits can be maximized however if the water targets are not satisfied then a water shortage penalty will occur table 5 provides information on the maximum and minimum water targets for each sector the unit water supply benefits and the unit water shortage penalties based on the research data of the study area and data from rockfellar 2000 the optimal water allocation results of the interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model i e formulas 15 29 were obtained with the combined use of matlab 2014 and excel 2016 the optimal water targets of surface water and groundwater for different sectors can be obtained by w ij w ij δ w ij z ij the amounts of water shortages under different rcp scenarios in the target years were calculated according to the upper and lower bounds of the submodels the results are shown in table 6 1 combined utilization of surface water and groundwater considering the scarcity of groundwater and the high cost of exploitation the allocation of water is mainly based on surface water and groundwater that is used as an auxiliary the model regulates the overexploitation of groundwater in the study area and the water supply of the municipal industrial and agricultural sectors accounts for 32 48 26 29 and 34 98 of the total water supply respectively 2 the impact of water shortage penalties on the system economy an increase in the water shortage leads to a reduction in the system economy in the decision making process it is necessary to balance the degree of water shortage penalties among various water sectors and to improve the economic efficiency of the system as long as the basic constraints of the model are met from the three water demand sectors the agricultural sector needs the largest amount of water and its optimal water supply target reaches 186 39 108 m3 the water shortage is relatively high but its water shortage penalty is relatively low in addition decision makers can arrange the scheduling of extraneous water in advance according to different water shortage levels 3 solve the problem of the system uncertainty by simulating the available water under different climate scenarios the probability of different water flows is determined by the p iii curve and the probability of the occurrence of the three scenarios is 0 3 0 5 and 0 2 historical data are used to help determine the range of parameters and then obtain the interval results in short the interval parameters probability distribution and the amount of water inflow into the solution process are introduced to solve the system uncertainty problem 4 water planning under different climate change scenarios under the rcp4 5 scenario the supply for the municipal sectors fully meets the targets without a water shortage under the scenarios of rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 different degrees of water shortage occurred and the rcp8 5 scenario experienced the most serious water shortage from the water allocation results in table 5 the impact of climate change on the water allocation problem cannot be ignored 4 3 4 risk analysis under different rcp scenarios the objective function of the model was to maximize the system benefits when λ 0 the maximum system benefit f opt is 31111 93 33019 05 108 yuan in this situation the cvar was not considered in the process of solving the model thus the fairness of the water allocation was not considered this paper analysed the changes in system benefits with changes in the risk coefficient λ ranging from 0 to 1 as shown in fig 6 fig 6 also shows that the economic benefit of the optimal water resources allocation in 2050 decreases as the value of λ increased when λ 1 the maximum benefit of the water resource system f opt is 30868 22 32442 64 108 yuan the analysis of the above results shows that the solution of the model at λ 0 reflects the characteristics of the itsp model with the objective of maximizing the system benefits under water shortage conditions the municipal sector had the greatest benefit but the penalty was also the largest the benefits and penalties produced by the industrial sectors were smaller and those in the agricultural sector were the smallest hence the model gave priority to satisfying the water targets of the municipal sector this decision caused the largest water shortages and the most serious penalty to occur in the agricultural sector this water allocation model did not achieve a fair allocation by introducing the cvar model into the itsp model the risk preference of water resources managers in water allocation planning can be considered and with the increased level of risk aversion coefficient λ the water allocation schemes seemed more conservative the water supply to the municipal sector decreased and the economic benefit decreased accordingly the water supply to the agricultural sector increased as a result however the economic performance of the agricultural sector per unit water supply was lower than that of the municipal sector and the overall economic benefit of the region still decreased considering cvar in the model can help decision makers control the conflicts among different water sectors select the appropriate optimization plans for water resources regulate surface water and groundwater more reasonably and obtain sustainable economic benefits according to risk preferences and the water supply under different rcp scenarios 5 discussion the total water supply in the target year is 220 18 108 m3 and the multiannual average water supply is 231 79 108 m3 saving a volume of 11 61 108 m3 of water resources based on the results the optimal water use structure can be obtained the ratio of surface water to groundwater is close to 2 1 the ratio of surface water to groundwater of the multiannual mean is 1 62 1 through model optimization the utilization of surface water tends to increase which has practical relevance for alleviating groundwater overexploitation in the study area the total supply is 220 18 108 m3 according to the model for the target year while the multiannual average total water supply in the study area is 247 62 108 m3 the total water supply is reduced by the model optimization so the model also contributes to water savings in summary the framework developed in this paper can help the regions suffering from severe water shortages to save water and adjust the proportion of surface water and groundwater allocation table 7 6 conclusion this study developed a framework that included the generation of climate change scenarios and water balance simulations based on the vic model for regional water resources planning based on an interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model moreover the water planning for municipal industrial and agricultural sectors under different scenarios was optimized in accordance with their penalties and benefits the case study of the lower songhua river basin revealed that the model was reasonable the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the uncertainty of the system can be overcome by the framework gcms simulated the temperature and precipitation and the vic model accurately simulated the runoff then the amount of available water obtained under different rcp scenarios was more reliable in addition the interval parameters and probability distributions were used to further control the uncertainty of water resources in the model establishment 2 the water shortage caused by competition was intensified among the water demand sectors the result of water allocation in the agricultural sector was not obviously affected by the economic benefits of the unit water supply the second stage of the model introduced a water shortage penalty function that can avoid this problem 3 introduction of the cvar can guarantee the fairness and sustainability of water allocations by balancing the income risk between different water demand sectors decision makers can select the water allocation plans based on their risk preferences and the actual conditions the developed framework considering rcp scenarios is beneficial to optimally allocate regional water resources especially for the regions suffering from severe water shortages and groundwater overexploitation however multiple uncertainties exist in regional water planning and the joint optimization of both water quality and quantity increases the complexity of regional water resources planning thus these topics deserve future study acknowledgements this research was supported by funds from the national key r d plan

7057,the shortage of water resources and the increasing competition among water users have highlighted the importance of the water allocation problem water availability is crucial for water resource allocation and changes frequently leading to the necessity to predict available water this paper develops a framework aimed to plan regional water allocations under different representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios using an interval parameter conditional value at risk cvar two stage stochastic programming model this framework combines prediction and optimization to reflect climate change the uncertainty of water system and the coordination between water resources allocation and risk the feasibility and practicality of the framework are demonstrated by its application in a real world case study in the lower songhua river basin in northeast china comparison between the results of the developed model and actual conditions show that 11 61 108 m3 volume of water supply can be saved after optimization indicating that the developed model tends to allocate water in a more efficient way the ratio of surface water to groundwater is reduced from 2 1 to 1 62 1 the proposed model has practical relevance for saving water and alleviating groundwater overexploitation the approach is applicable to most areas with severe water shortages and groundwater overexploitation and decision makers can determine the appropriate options for water resources allocation based on risk preferences and actual conditions keywords regional water resources allocation interval two stage stochastic model cvar rcp 1 introduction with the development of society and the expansion of cities the unsustainable planning and management of regional water resources have intensified the imbalance between water supply and demand resulting in a serious waste of surface water and severe exploitation of groundwater asefa et al 2014 fu et al 2018a in addition extreme weather conditions influence the uncertainty of the available water supplies and lead to economic risk for water management systems thus creating a barrier to the allocation of water resources hu et al 2016a b therefore water allocation based on reasonable and available water prediction is an intense global issue the available surface water is a critical factor for regional water resources planning runoff is the main source of surface water and is influenced by uncertain climatic factors such as temperature and precipitation najafi and moradkhani 2015 milly et al 2008 to quantify these uncertainties many studies have coupled the representative concentration pathways rcp scenarios that were proposed in the intergovernmental panel on climate change fifth assessment report ipcc ar5 intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2013 with multiple general circulation models gcms to predict the future climate gcms are considered the best available tools for modelling the future climate wang et al 2017a b the variable infiltration capacity vic model can simulate the available runoff zhang et al 2012 used the vic model to explore the change trend of water resources in the huaihe river basin under global warming these studies enable the accurate prediction of the available surface water based on the prediction of available surface water corresponding to different climate change scenarios regional water resources can be planned through optimization techniques li et al 2015 developed the two level linear fractional water management tlfwm model and the stochastic two level linear fractional chance constrained water management stlfcwm model to identify desired water resources management policies considering various uncertainties hu et al 2016a used the compromise programming cp method to trade off economic benefit efficiency and equity in the water allocation li et al 2017 developed an intuitionistic fuzzy multi objective non linear programming ifmonlp model that solved multiple problems including crop yield increases blue water savings and water supply cost reductions however there are many uncertainties such as water availability variations water price fluctuations and allocation target changes in regional water systems therefore incorporating uncertainty programming methods into the optimization models for regional water allocation is necessary maqsood et al 2005 the interval two stage stochastic programming itsp model is widely used in many uncertainty optimization models lin et al 2009 lu et al 2009 the itsp model can overcome the complexity and uncertainty of water resource systems by using interval parameters and probability distribution such as unit product income upstream water quantity and changes in ecological water demand in different sectors these uncertainties can lead to multiple uncertainties and uncertain amplifications via their interaction fu et al 2018b in summary to ensure the sustainable development of water resources and improve their utilization rate the itsp model can optimally plan the allocation of water resource systems because water shortages are exacerbated by climate change the allocation risks should be considered in water allocations to ensure the coordinated development of the regional economy and water resources shao et al 2011 wang et al 2017a integrated conditional value at risk cvar into factorial stochastic programming to solve the random uncertainties and interactions in water resource systems hu et al 2016b used cvar to control the risk of economic efficiency loss corresponding to variations in water availability cvar which is an improved value at risk var method is an investment risk measurement method rockfellar 2000 and is effectively used in optimization models for regional water allocation because it is based on a simple calculation and it provides a better reflection of potential risks xu and yu 2014 yamout et al 2007 further using cvar can ensure fair water allocations and balance the system benefits and expected losses accordingly incorporating cvar into the itsp model is useful for analysing the fairness of water resources allocation unfortunately using such an integrated model to plan regional water resources based on water balance simulations under different climate change scenarios has been limited thus far therefore it is significant to integrate the water availability prediction results and the cvar model in a water allocation optimization model however a limited number of studies have reported such an integration this paper aims to plan regional water allocations under different rcp scenarios using an interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model the proposed approach is capable of 1 alleviating the imbalance between water supply and demand through the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater 2 promoting the economic benefits of the water resource system while simultaneously considering the penalties and risks due to violated policies 3 reflecting uncertainties expressed as discrete intervals and probability distributions and 4 obtaining various water planning alternatives under different climate change scenarios 2 problem description 2 1 overview of the problem in the past studies on the optimal allocation of water resources the available water resource is usually derived from the planning report to provide a credible water resources allocation plan for decision makers the available water prediction is very important with the rcp and gcms employed to predict temperature and precipitation under various climate change scenarios a vic model was used to simulate the water balance and a simulated runoff was obtained to ensure the ecological sustainability of the river basin a 70 runoff volume is needed to meet the ecological water demand in the basin then the remaining 30 is used as the available surface water that combines with groundwater allocated to the municipal industrial and agricultural sectors in the basin cvar is introduced into the water allocation model to ensure fair water allocation the decision procedure of the developed framework for water resources planning is illustrated in fig 1 the framework includes three modules 1 the weather generator module that generates the future climatic conditions under various rcp scenarios by gcms 2 the hydrologic module that uses the vic model to simulate and predict the runoff volume and 3 the optimization module that obtains the operating rules for the best economic effect using the interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model additionally in step 4 the results analysis and a discussion according to the different scenarios are included 2 2 motivation for water resources allocation under the prediction of the available water the fluctuation in the available water of the river basin causes great difficulties for water allocation different runoff volumes under different climate change scenarios can be obtained and the allocation of water resources can serve as a reference for decision makers therefore reliable weather generator selection is necessary the ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 is a comprehensive assessment of the various gcms of the current coupled model intercomparison project phase in the fifth phase cmip5 based on the performance of these gcms in china wang et al 2017b and the detailed comparison of gcms presented by yan et al 2015 the ability of each gcm to simulate different variables is different pierce et al 2008 reported that a multi model combined average is superior to the estimate given by any one individual model the present paper selected five gcms that are suitable for the study area to comprehensively predict the climate as shown in table 1 this paper only considers the rcp8 5 rcp6 0 and rcp4 5 scenarios combined with the 5 gcms the temperature and precipitation data under each rcp scenario are obtained which lay the foundation for the next research among the various methods the vic model a macro scale distributed hydrologic model originally developed by liang et al 1994 is widely used for runoff prediction the vic model has some significant characteristics in that the hydrologic cycle process the water balance and the energy balance can be considered simultaneously along with the parameterization of the two runoff components of surface runoff and base flow this model is widely used to study the impact of climate change on river flows zhai and tao 2017 xie et al 2003 lohmann et al 1998 the prediction results of the five gcms under the three rcp scenarios were coupled with the vic model to predict the runoff change trends in the study area in 2050 to verify the reliability of the model this paper used taylor diagrams to validate the monthly maximum temperature minimum temperature and precipitation from 1961 to 1990 section 4 3 1 the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse coefficient and normalized root mean square deviation nrmsd were used in the calibration the nse is an indicator that is widely used to evaluate the performance of the hydrological model the formula is as follows 1 nse 1 t 1 t q 0 t q m t 2 t 1 t q 0 t q 0 2 where q 0 t is the observed runoff volume at moment t 108 m3 q m t is the simulated runoff volume at moment t 108 m3 and q 0 is the average observed runoff volume 108 m3 the value of nse ranges from to 1 a value of nse of 1 indicates that the simulation result is perfect with high reliability a value of nse close to 0 indicates that the simulation result is close to the average observation result that is the overall result is credible but with a large simulation error when the value of nse is far less than 0 then the model is not credible the nrmsd indicates the standard deviation of the differences between simulations and observations lombard et al 2009 this variable is calculated as follows 2 nrmsd t 1 n q 0 t q m t 2 n q max q min where q max is the maximum observed runoff volume 108 m3 and q min is the minimum observed runoff volume 108 m3 consequently the vic model can simulate the reliable runoff volume to provide a basis to obtain the available surface water 2 3 coping with risk resulting from inequity for different sectors the economic benefits produced by each water supply unit are quite different likely leading to an unfair allocation of water resources generally the risk is proportional to the return such that more water allocation to the industrial sector results in greater economic benefits however the competition for water becomes more pronounced among the sectors leading to a higher risk of water system failure therefore managing the inequity of water allocation is very important to prevent an unequal water allocation cvar which can better balance the conflict between system benefits and system risk is integrated to obtain a more reasonable and effective water allocation scheme the formula of cvar is as follows 3 min x x e f x ω λ ρ q x ζ ω where x is the decision variable ω is a random variable e f x ω is the value of the expected return function λ λ 0 1 is the non negative weight coefficient or risk coefficient to trade off the expected penalty with risk which is determined by the risk preferences of the decision makers thus resulting in different optimization solutions ρ is a risk measurement model q is a continuous loss function and ζ ω is a random function the conditional value at risk of random variables at confidence level α α 0 1 can be defined as follows fu et al 2017 4 ρ λ η 1 1 α e p h v h where η is the maximum loss of the system under a given t confidence level and α is the confidence level usually set to 0 90 0 95 or 0 99 qiu et al 2014 this paper selects α 0 95 for the results to facilitate the calculation vh is a positive auxiliary variable obviously with cvar the decision makers can achieve a more reasonable water allocation scheme 3 modelling 3 1 notation an interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model for regional water allocation is developed in this part to present the model a list of notations is provided in table 2 3 2 objective functions the purpose of optimizing water resources allocation is to determine how much water from different water sources can be used to meet the water demands of each sector and maximize the system benefits in water resources allocation systems the total water supply is the sum of the water supply amount of each sector however the water supply of each sector varies with time and the future available water is uncertain therefore it is necessary to forecast the water supply for each sector based on the historical data of the water supply and the regional economic development plans then the predicted water demand can be regarded as the water supply target if the actual water supply to each sector meets the corresponding water target then the ideal system benefits can be obtained if the actual water supply to each sector does not satisfy the target then a water shortage will occur consequently generating a water shortage penalty that will reduce the system benefits to express the uncertainty of the water supply target the per unit water supply benefits the penalty coefficient and the interval parameter can be introduced to solve the problem therefore the itsp model is adopted in this paper the objective function of the model is to maximize the system benefits subject to a series of constraints associated with water resources such as the available water water demand and water shortage constraints according to the principle of the itsp model the first stage of the model is to allocate water i e the water target to different sectors under different rcp scenarios directly leading to various water resource availabilities the second stage will be composed of the sectors to calculate the loss of benefits resulting from water shortage the itsp model can be expressed as follows 5 max f i 1 i j 1 j b ij w ij e i 1 i j 1 j c ij s ijh where indicates the upper limit of the parameter and indicates the lower limit of the parameter the water deficits of different rcp scenarios in the target year are treated as discrete functions therefore the interval two stage stochastic programming model can be expressed as follows 6 max f i 1 i j 1 j b ij w ij i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h p h c ij s ijh with the integration of the itsp and cvar models an interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model can be formulated and expressed as follows objective function 7 max f i 1 i j 1 j b ij w ij i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h p h c ij s ijh λ η 1 1 α h 1 h p h v h 3 3 constraints 1 available water constraints the availability of water for sectors is limited the available surface water for each sector must not exceed the total available water this constraint can be expressed as 8 q ijh w ij s ijh 2 water demand constraints to ensure basic use and development the minimum water demand for each sector should be satisfied meanwhile the water allocated to each sector should be no more than its maximum expected volume to avoid waste and improve water use efficiency this constraint can be expressed as 9 w ij max w ij w ij min 3 water shortage constraints the volume of the water shortage in each sector should be less than the volume of the water requirement during all water allocation stages this constraint can be expressed as 10 s ijh w ij 4 technical constraints to consider the balance between the system benefits and the system risk cvar constraints are required as follows 11 v h i 1 i j 1 j c ij s ijh η 5 non negative constraints the water allocated to the study area from the surface water and groundwater should not be negative this constraint can be expressed as 12 s ijh 0 13 v h 0 14 η 0 in this model w ij is an uncertain parameter in the form of an interval number that cannot be solved directly through the interval algorithm therefore according to zhang et al 2009 decision variables zij zij 0 1 are introduced to solve the model then the interval parameter w ij can be converted to a deterministic parameter let w ij w ij δ w ij z ij and δ w ij w ij w ij when zij 0 w ij equals the lower limit of the interval while when zij 1 w ij equals the upper limit of the interval finding the optimal solution of decision variables zijopt enables the optimal solution of w ij to be obtained as follows w ijopt w ij δ w ij z ijopt 3 4 global model combing the interval algorithm the above formulas 7 14 can be transformed into two deterministic submodels since the objective function seeks the maximum system benefits the upper bound of the submodel is solved first as follows 15 max f i 1 i j 1 j b ij w ij δ w ij z ij i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h p h c ij s ijh λ η 1 1 α h 1 h p h v h 16 q ijh w ij δ w

ijhopt and f opt are solutions of the upper bound of the submodel then w ijopt can be obtained based on zijopt in the same way the lower bound of the submodel is expressed as follows 23 max f i 1 i j 1 j b ij w ij δ w ij z ijopt i 1 i j 1 j h 1 h p h c ij s ijh λ η 1 1 α h 1 h p h v h constraint conditions 24 q ijh w ij δ w ij z ijopt s ijh 25 w ij max w ij δ w ij z ijopt w ij min 26 s ijh w ij δ w ij z ijopt 27 v h i 1 i j 1 j c ij s ijh η 28 s ijh s ijhopt 0 29 v h 0 s ijopt f opt can be obtained by solving the lower bound of the submodel thus the optimal solutions of the interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model are f opt f opt f opt s ijhopt s ijhopt s ijhopt and the optimal water allocation amount can be calculated by op t ij w ijopt s ijopt 4 case study 4 1 study area the study area is the lower songhua river basin which is located in northeast china 124 04 to 132 52 e and 42 72 to 48 96 n fig 2 this basin is an important commodity grain production base the nenjiang river and the upper songhua river flow into the lower songhua river the main stream of the lower songhua river travels a total distance of 939 km and drains an area of 184 600 km2 and the average annual precipitation of this area is 591 6 mm the multiannual average volumes of surface water and groundwater are 35 968 billion m3 and 13 611 billion m3 respectively historically the utilization rate of transit water resources in the study area has remained at approximately 30 and these are the main water resources for production and livelihood in the basin to promote the steady development of the social economy in the river region an adequate water supply for municipal industrial and agricultural sectors should be provided the annual temperature range in this area is from 25 83 c to 26 5 c so the main water inflow is concentrated from june to september due to the long frost period hence to meet the requirements of the ecological water demand of the river and to meet the increasing demand for water in each water sector it is necessary to reasonably allocate water resources and to solve the competing interests of the water sectors in the lower songhua river basin 4 2 data collection long term hydrological and meteorological data are critical for predicting river flow trends climate change mainly precipitation and temperature significantly affects the volume of runoff in the study area considering the availability of data 5 hydrometric stations on the main stream 4 hydrometric stations on the tributaries and 13 national meteorological stations in the lower songhua river basin are selected to collect monthly runoff volume precipitation and temperature data from 1961 to 1990 which can be used for testing the model performance the runoff volume data of the above hydrometric stations are from the hydrographic office in heilongjiang province china the information regarding the meteorological stations is from the china meteorological data service center cmdc table 3 provides basic information regarding the 10 hydrometric stations the amounts of groundwater and the water supply targets are obtained from the songliao water resources bulletin 2001 2015 the heilongjiang almanacs the statistical almanacs of heilongjiang province and field research data watch forcing data wfd 1958 2001 and watch forcing data era interim wfdei 1979 2010 downloaded from http www eu watch org are used to calibrate and validate the vic model because they are specifically designed to drive land surface models and hydrological models weedon et al 2011 weedon et al 2015 yan et al 2015 previously verified the accuracy and reliability of the wfd and wfdei data 4 3 results analysis 4 3 1 temperature and precipitation simulation to verify the simulation accuracy of the maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin and precipitation pre under the selected five gcm scenarios in the study area this paper first used the gcms shown in fig 3 to simulate the tmax tmin and pre of the years 1961 1990 with a resolution of 0 5 0 5 then the data were extracted and sorted using arcgis and the annual monthly average values of tmax tmin and pre of the study area were obtained the simulated results were compared and verified with the monthly average values of the corresponding meteorological elements obtained from the selected 13 national meteorological stations see fig 2 from 1961 to 1990 the simulation results are shown in fig 3 fig 3 a shows the comparison between the simulated data and the measured data the simulation results and the measured values of tmax and tmin are relatively consistent for pre the simulated values coincide with the measured data in the dry season because there was less precipitation in the dry season there was a long frost period in the dry season and the precipitation changes over the 30 year period were relatively stable however for the pre in the flood season the simulation results are higher than the measured data especially in july the main reason for this finding is that there is remarkable variation in the precipitation amounts in the flood season over the study period and the changes are irregular the d value between the measured maximum and minimum precipitation values in july of 1961 1990 was 426 2 mm fig 3 b is a taylor diagram that can quantify the correspondence ratio between the simulation results and the measured data including the pearson correlation coefficient the root mean square error rmse and the standard deviation as seen from the diagram the pearson correlation coefficients between the simulated values and the measured values of tmax tmin and pre are 0 994 0 993 and 0 905 respectively the rmses are 0 11 0 12 and 0 49 respectively and the standard deviations are 0 985 1 003 and 1 063 respectively the correspondence ratio between the simulation results and the measured data shows that the results of the gcm simulations are better therefore the simulation outputs corresponding to the gcms can provide meteorological driving data in 2050 for the vic model 4 3 2 runoff volume simulation based on the simulated outputs of gcms this paper used vic to simulate the water balance of the study area the volumes of runoff on each grid were output by running the vic then the runoff on each grid was collected in the outlet section of the river basin by coupling with the concentration model to tailor the model to the study area it was necessary to calibrate and validate the vic model by using the wfd 1958 2001 and wfdei 1979 2012 after the vic model was calibrated it was evaluated using the measured runoff volume data from 2006 to 2010 taking two hydrometric stations on the main stream of the songhua river as an example i e the jiamusi and harbin stations the verification results of the simulated and measured annual runoff volume data and average monthly runoff volume data for many years are shown in fig 4 from the overall verification conditions of the two hydrological stations the simulated runoff volume obtained by the vic was relatively high the simulated runoff volume during the dry season was relatively accurate while during the flood season the simulation values were higher than the average monthly values the main reason for this result is that the vic model took into account conditions with more floods in the songhua river during the flood season and these results were in accordance with the results of zhai and tao 2017 the nse and the nrmsd of jiamusi were 0 79 and 0 073 respectively the nse and the nrmsd of harbin were 0 67 and 0 077 respectively these results showed that the model performance was relatively stable and that the simulated runoff volume could be used in the subsequent water resources planning the calibrated vic model was used to simulate runoff volume under different rcp scenarios the corresponding results are illustrated in fig 5 as shown in the figure the runoff volume will decrease to different extents under different scenarios in the future and the trend of the future runoff volume will decrease under the rcp4 5 scenario the predicted runoff volume and the historical runoff volume mostly overlapped and these occasions mainly occurred in the dry season the predicted runoff volume during the flood season was slightly lower than the historical runoff volume but the overall trend was relatively consistent under the rcp6 0 scenario the extreme range of the predicted runoff volume was reduced relative to the rcp4 5 scenario and the predicted runoff volume exceeded the historical runoff volume only from january to march while in the remaining months the predicted runoff volume was lower than the historical volume under the rcp8 5 scenario the predicted runoff volume peaked during the spring floods indicating that climate warming had a significant effect on the melting rate of snow which caused a sharp increase in runoff volume 4 3 3 optimal water allocation results the predicted runoff volumes under rcp4 5 rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 were obtained based on the vic according to the p iii curve the occurrence probabilities of the three scenarios were 0 3 0 5 and 0 2 respectively to address the problem in which the predicted runoff volume from the vic model is high this paper employed the correction method proposed by zhai and tao 2017 considering the actual situation of surface water utilized in the study area the utilization factor of the runoff was determined and the available surface water was obtained table 4 lists the upper and lower limits of the surface water and groundwater availabilities under different rcp scenarios in water resources planning if the available water can satisfy the water targets of different sectors then the economic benefits can be maximized however if the water targets are not satisfied then a water shortage penalty will occur table 5 provides information on the maximum and minimum water targets for each sector the unit water supply benefits and the unit water shortage penalties based on the research data of the study area and data from rockfellar 2000 the optimal water allocation results of the interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model i e formulas 15 29 were obtained with the combined use of matlab 2014 and excel 2016 the optimal water targets of surface water and groundwater for different sectors can be obtained by w ij w ij δ w ij z ij the amounts of water shortages under different rcp scenarios in the target years were calculated according to the upper and lower bounds of the submodels the results are shown in table 6 1 combined utilization of surface water and groundwater considering the scarcity of groundwater and the high cost of exploitation the allocation of water is mainly based on surface water and groundwater that is used as an auxiliary the model regulates the overexploitation of groundwater in the study area and the water supply of the municipal industrial and agricultural sectors accounts for 32 48 26 29 and 34 98 of the total water supply respectively 2 the impact of water shortage penalties on the system economy an increase in the water shortage leads to a reduction in the system economy in the decision making process it is necessary to balance the degree of water shortage penalties among various water sectors and to improve the economic efficiency of the system as long as the basic constraints of the model are met from the three water demand sectors the agricultural sector needs the largest amount of water and its optimal water supply target reaches 186 39 108 m3 the water shortage is relatively high but its water shortage penalty is relatively low in addition decision makers can arrange the scheduling of extraneous water in advance according to different water shortage levels 3 solve the problem of the system uncertainty by simulating the available water under different climate scenarios the probability of different water flows is determined by the p iii curve and the probability of the occurrence of the three scenarios is 0 3 0 5 and 0 2 historical data are used to help determine the range of parameters and then obtain the interval results in short the interval parameters probability distribution and the amount of water inflow into the solution process are introduced to solve the system uncertainty problem 4 water planning under different climate change scenarios under the rcp4 5 scenario the supply for the municipal sectors fully meets the targets without a water shortage under the scenarios of rcp6 0 and rcp8 5 different degrees of water shortage occurred and the rcp8 5 scenario experienced the most serious water shortage from the water allocation results in table 5 the impact of climate change on the water allocation problem cannot be ignored 4 3 4 risk analysis under different rcp scenarios the objective function of the model was to maximize the system benefits when λ 0 the maximum system benefit f opt is 31111 93 33019 05 108 yuan in this situation the cvar was not considered in the process of solving the model thus the fairness of the water allocation was not considered this paper analysed the changes in system benefits with changes in the risk coefficient λ ranging from 0 to 1 as shown in fig 6 fig 6 also shows that the economic benefit of the optimal water resources allocation in 2050 decreases as the value of λ increased when λ 1 the maximum benefit of the water resource system f opt is 30868 22 32442 64 108 yuan the analysis of the above results shows that the solution of the model at λ 0 reflects the characteristics of the itsp model with the objective of maximizing the system benefits under water shortage conditions the municipal sector had the greatest benefit but the penalty was also the largest the benefits and penalties produced by the industrial sectors were smaller and those in the agricultural sector were the smallest hence the model gave priority to satisfying the water targets of the municipal sector this decision caused the largest water shortages and the most serious penalty to occur in the agricultural sector this water allocation model did not achieve a fair allocation by introducing the cvar model into the itsp model the risk preference of water resources managers in water allocation planning can be considered and with the increased level of risk aversion coefficient λ the water allocation schemes seemed more conservative the water supply to the municipal sector decreased and the economic benefit decreased accordingly the water supply to the agricultural sector increased as a result however the economic performance of the agricultural sector per unit water supply was lower than that of the municipal sector and the overall economic benefit of the region still decreased considering cvar in the model can help decision makers control the conflicts among different water sectors select the appropriate optimization plans for water resources regulate surface water and groundwater more reasonably and obtain sustainable economic benefits according to risk preferences and the water supply under different rcp scenarios 5 discussion the total water supply in the target year is 220 18 108 m3 and the multiannual average water supply is 231 79 108 m3 saving a volume of 11 61 108 m3 of water resources based on the results the optimal water use structure can be obtained the ratio of surface water to groundwater is close to 2 1 the ratio of surface water to groundwater of the multiannual mean is 1 62 1 through model optimization the utilization of surface water tends to increase which has practical relevance for alleviating groundwater overexploitation in the study area the total supply is 220 18 108 m3 according to the model for the target year while the multiannual average total water supply in the study area is 247 62 108 m3 the total water supply is reduced by the model optimization so the model also contributes to water savings in summary the framework developed in this paper can help the regions suffering from severe water shortages to save water and adjust the proportion of surface water and groundwater allocation table 7 6 conclusion this study developed a framework that included the generation of climate change scenarios and water balance simulations based on the vic model for regional water resources planning based on an interval parameter cvar two stage stochastic programming model moreover the water planning for municipal industrial and agricultural sectors under different scenarios was optimized in accordance with their penalties and benefits the case study of the lower songhua river basin revealed that the model was reasonable the following conclusions can be drawn 1 the uncertainty of the system can be overcome by the framework gcms simulated the temperature and precipitation and the vic model accurately simulated the runoff then the amount of available water obtained under different rcp scenarios was more reliable in addition the interval parameters and probability distributions were used to further control the uncertainty of water resources in the model establishment 2 the water shortage caused by competition was intensified among the water demand sectors the result of water allocation in the agricultural sector was not obviously affected by the economic benefits of the unit water supply the second stage of the model introduced a water shortage penalty function that can avoid this problem 3 introduction of the cvar can guarantee the fairness and sustainability of water allocations by balancing the income risk between different water demand sectors decision makers can select the water allocation plans based on their risk preferences and the actual conditions the developed framework considering rcp scenarios is beneficial to optimally allocate regional water resources especially for the regions suffering from severe water shortages and groundwater overexploitation however multiple uncertainties exist in regional water planning and the joint optimization of both water quality and quantity increases the complexity of regional water resources planning thus these topics deserve future study acknowledgements this research was supported by funds from the national key r d plan

7058,the objective of this research is to improve the understanding and recognition of the management challenges to flash flooding hazards and the potential adaptive measures within the arid urban areas through a socio hydrological framework considering the capital of sudan khartoum as an example of urban arid areas with increasing flash flood risk the analysis was founded on expert views and opinions collected from a range of different flood management actors following the 2013 and 2014 flash flood events the qualitative research methods included participant observation expert interviews and focus groups the main themes of management challenges recorded included weak institutional capacity bad governance limited resources and poor urban planning these four themes in turn included different types of challenges among which lack of civil society engagement and coordination of actors political will data and tools and effective urban development strategy shared the highest number of comments from the professional actors in each theme respectively these findings presented a management perspective to the lessons previously established and learned from an impact assessment accordingly the amalgamation of all the lessons learned from the flood research findings enabled a suitable master flash flood management plan maffmap to be proposed as a final product this plan would operate within an integrated flash flood management iffm framework the facets of the maffmap include steps toward improving the quantity and quality of data resources regarding this hazard aspects for use of these new datasets within a mixed measure structural and non structural approach from the authorities and programmes for building community and civil society capacity through improving awareness and engagement furthermore it is intended that this plan would be a replicable design which could therefore be adopted and implemented in the wider context of the urban arid regions keywords urban flash flood integrated flash flood management management challenges socio hydrology resilience sudan 1 introduction when recognizing that climate predictions warn of an increased frequency of extreme rainfall events it is important to understand that rainfall driven flash floods have been identified as the type of natural hazard most likely to increase in severity as a result houston et al 2011 ipcc 2012 one line of thought is that the increasing risk and impacts of global flood events is an effect of the intensifying role of climate change and variability creating greater probability levels of flood hazards kundzewicz et al 2014 it is also key to recognize that any intensification in a region s rainfall regime will put the highly populated urban areas in particular under increased risk from flash flood events as the effects of urban development have increased their vulnerability and exposure to such hazards ipcc 2012 kundzewicz et al 2002 2014 some of the main impacts of urban floods include the threat of fatalities destruction of homes and livelihoods and damages to economic assets and primary importance infrastructures douglas et al 2008 africa reported to be the world s fastest urbanizing continent has already experienced the effects of growing urbanization and the level of flood impacts di baldassarre et al 2010 directly connect the rapidly increased number of flood fatalities to the steady growth of urban population in africa for the period 1950 2010 for example 23 flash floods were recorded during the period 2003 2010 in some parts of ethiopia due to increase in rainfall intensity paired by a marked change in land use cover and management practices billi et al 2015 fatal and damaging floods due to heavy rainfall have also occurred in other parts of africa where populations have experienced increasing growth rate danumah et al 2016 epule et al 2017 report increasing frequency of floods over time in the african sahel and therefore recommend careful consideration of adaptations and land use policies to reinforce resilience to floods a recent integrated assessment of flash flood impacts on society property and infrastructure for the capital of sudan khartoum has estimated the risk as a function of hazard sensitivity vulnerability and adaptive to be 46 4 mahmood et al 2017 the same study has enabled deriving a number of 11 lessons that make similar areas to have faced increasing risk of this hazard mahmood et al 2017 rainfall in khartoum is characterized by irregular behaviour extreme seasonality such that almost all rain falls in 1 2 months and dependency of the annual rainfall on the very strong records i e daily rainfall of more than 30 mm mahmoud et al 2014 the rapid urbanization within khartoum hafazalla 2008 eltayeb 2003 hafazalla 2008 bannaga 2012 is symbolic of many other cities throughout africa as environmental e g drought or desertification socioeconomic and civil war refugees migrate from rural to urban areas babiker 1982 el nour 1989 verhoeven 2011 to escape the devastating problems only to put themselves within the risk of another type of problem such as the hazard of urban floods douglas et al 2008 the mass influx of migrants then exposed to already flood prone areas are made further vulnerable by the quick fix creations of informal settlements to accommodate them usually lacking any kind of planned drainage system wmo 2008 recognizing both lines of argument and the evidence of the recent severe flood events it could thus be argued that the combined impacts of climatic variability and anthropogenic pressures are increasing the risk of flash floods for khartoum mahmood et al 2017 therefore it can be assumed that 1 business as usual reactive flood management practice is unsustainable and 2 proactive flash flood planning should be adopted to build khartoum s preparedness and resilience to future heavy rain and flash flood events following on from these broad disaster management concepts to combat the increased levels of flood risk the integrated flash flood management iffm approach has been generally accepted as the doctrine to follow for actors working within the flood management field as noted above it is believed that iffm operates within the framework of socio hydrology socio hydrology is defined by sivapalan et al 2012 as an interdisciplinary but quantitative science focusing on observing understanding and predicting future trajectories of co evolution of coupled human water systems thus underpinning the practice of integrated water resources management iwrm i e underpinning sustainable water management in the context of socio hydrological analysis of flood risk di baldassarre et al 2013 presented a conceptualization of the dominant dynamics in floodplains as fully coupled human flood systems with hydrological economical political technological and social processes simplified as much as possible another fundamental principle underpinning iffm is the adoption of a participatory approach engaging with the community to build preparedness and resilience to flood events furthermore iffm should implement a mix of strategies to reduce flood risk meaning both structural and non structural measures wmo 2009 in the development of urban floodplains another study analysed the interplay of community risk coping culture flooding damage and economic growth in a conceptual way to create a socio hydrological discussion among researches from natural and social sciences viglione et al 2014 viglione et al 2014 recommended further interesting research directions such as using an analogous conceptual framework to investigate how communities adjust or may adjust toward developing a suitable culture for their environment they also recommended a focus on which role different community agents e g institutions and public have in the process of decision making regarding for example flood risk management while examples of the emerging challenges for flood risk management and relevant strategies are available for some developing regions in the humid environments e g hoang et al 2018 such challenges have rarely if ever been identified and addressed in developing arid regions the establishment of flood resilient communities provides an added value and effective means to operational and adaptive management of flood disasters in a changing world schelfaut et al 2011 therefore the objective of this study is to build a good level of understanding over the management challenges to flash floods from the khartoum case of arid regions to be able to design and propose a practical adaptive management plan which would aim to reduce the risk to flash flooding there are various components to the importance of this study first there is a need to recognize the relevance and applicability of integrated management principles as a suitable framework for proactive adaptive flash flood management measures to operate within this improves preparedness and resilience to future flood events second this study represents an amalgamation of all the lessons learned from flood research findings in the case study area finally the proposed plan should be replicable to be adopted and implemented beyond the confines of the case study area i e in the wider arid region context this is fundamental to the building of a body of work related to the often marginalized increasing risk of urban flash flooding in arid regions to challenge the current dominant discourse of water scarcity issues tarhule 2005 tschakert et al 2010 epule et al 2017 2 methods this study analyses the main issues of a socio hydrological event faced within the capital of sudan khartoum in 2013 and 2014 based on a recent assessment of the risks and impacts and herein explored management challenges and potential adaptive measures to flash flooding events affecting the city the analysis was founded on expert views and opinions collected through qualitative research methods including participant observation expert interviews and focus groups it was important to speak to a range of different professional actors including those from governmental bodies research institutions academia international agencies non governmental organizations ngos and independent national experts in order to gain a well rounded holistic perspective on the subject schelfaut et al 2011 consider increasing the participation of all stakeholders and bottom up involvement as important factors in increasing the ownership of solutions and resilience to flood risk research involving stakeholder interviews was undertaken by mcewen and jones 2012 to explore the build up of sustainable local knowledge into community flood resilience planning after flood events in uk in the present study targeted flood management actors and the corresponding category of qualitative research methods conducted for them are listed in table 1 the targeting of experts should theoretically mean that the data collected are of higher quality as the interviewee will be more informed and interested in the subject matter dorussen et al 2005 2 1 participant observation participant observation involves the researcher not only observing but also participating to some extent in the activities in order to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon from the inside myres 2009 within this study the technique of participant observation was used effectively with two different actors in two events the first piece of participant observation took place in a public eco sustainability monthly forum hosted by the united nations office for project services unesco cousteau eco technie chair ucec at the future university sudan through participating in forum no 67 weather extreme events in sudan recent khartoum floods as an example valuable insight could be gained into the current debate over the risks causes impacts and management of flash flooding in khartoum the different concerns and opinions expressed from forum participants were recorded to be used later within the data analysis another use of participant observation was applied while partaking in a workshop on flood management organised by united nations office for project services unops for the khartoum state ministry of planning and infrastructures mopi the mopi is tasked with the job of designing and constructing flood mitigation structures including protection dams dykes and collection drainage channels participating in this workshop provided the opportunity to document the key flood management challenges faced by mopi as well as the potential adaptive measures recommended by unops as part of their capacity building approach i e the provision of infrastructure advisory services in order to build resilience of communities to flood events 2 2 expert interviews and focus groups in this study the interviews were semi structured whereby the researcher had a pre established set of topics they wish to discuss but can benefit from the flexibility of being able to add remove or vary the order of questions saunders et al 2003 this free flowing format enables the researcher to probe the interviewee further on specific subjects of interest in order to gain better understanding of the management challenges and potential adaptive measures characterizing the flash flood hazard berg and lune 2004 for some situations when dealing with several interviewees from the same professional background at once the qualitative research method of focus group interviewing was applied conducted very similarly to the semi structured interviews the focus groups required the researcher to facilitate the discussion in order to collect information regarding matters of interest to the research study berg and lune 2004 a focus group can be a highly rewarding and dynamic research technique as a synergistic group effect can occur due to the informal group discussion style whereby participant comments can trigger new interactions between group members and therefore generate a greater number of ideas compared to the individual interview format stewart and shamdasani 1990 sussman et al 1991 berg and lune 2004 2 3 data analysis for the primary data collected within the study area through the use of qualitative research methods i e participant observation interviews and focus groups another step of data analysis was required to transform this raw data into a valuable form of information which could therefore be used to achieve the study objectives a dictaphone was used to record the events these recordings could later be made into verbatim transcripts for coding during the data analysis stage the grounded theory approach was adopted to analyse the collected qualitative data transcripts strauss and corbin 1990 describe this approach as an inductive method that seeks to discover and develop themes during the analysis stage in the case of this study a core concept was found to be the challenges faced by the actors working within the flood management field in khartoum with the specific codes being the different types of challenges discussed which have been selectively further grouped into different themes of challenges 3 results and discussion 3 1 management challenges comments from actors were coded into 10 different types of challenges that could then be grouped into four main themes weak institutional capacity bad governance limited resources and poor urban planning fig 1 shows the full results displaying the different challenges themes and the number of comments attributed for each in total there were 231 comments recorded that could be categorized to a certain type of challenge code faced by the actors with 83 comments sharing over a third 36 of the total comments the weak institutional capacity was stated by the actors to be the most dominant challenges theme out of the 10 challenges identified the type with the most number of comments attached to it was the lack of an overall urban development strategy 34 comments a systematic review of each recorded challenge allows an overview of the main points raised for each 3 1 1 weak institutional capacity a national expert and experienced professional working within national adaptation programme for action napa blames this problem on a lack of care from both sides government and society and recalls of better community spirit in helping flood mitigation in the past during the flood management workshop by unops this lack of public engagement issue was one of the main focus points during discussions the unops representative emphasised the need to address this issue in sudan the ngo actor envi felt very strongly about this challenge as the problem of limited civil society engagement affected their work directly they blamed the government for 1 not utilizing the knowledge and expertise that civil society organizations ngos can offer 2 not telling the people of the flood risks within their informal settlements and 3 not providing suitable recovery support after flood events while at the same time collecting large land permit fees the lack of coordination between the different actors working within the flood management field was very evident during the data collection period as often it could be noted that the roles of various actors overlapped with each other but still there seemed to be limited proper knowledge sharing between them the mopi engineers complained of the lack of coordination between themselves and the housing planning sector claiming that new housing projects are being implemented within flood risk areas therefore creating fresh problems for their ministry to construct new embankments and drainage systems to prevent flooding impacts in those areas the humanitarian aid commission hac acting within the ministry of humanitarian affairs admitted this lack of coordination between actors to be one of their main challenges the problem of incoordination is also addressed by the ngo envi the lack of an effective institutional framework is another challenge that has been identified it can be directly linked to the previous challenge of the poor coordination of actors as this can be attributed to the lack of a proper framework which would work to identify the roles and responsibilities for each actor to achieve a shared set of objectives the unops workshop focussed on the problem of sudan s weak institutional capacity it was recommended that in order to improve institutional capacity there must be an effective framework to bring the various actors together as with the closely connected previous challenge hac identified this issue to be one of their biggest challenges 3 1 2 bad governance the lack of political will refers to the challenge that actors experienced from the governmental policy and decision makers to focus efforts to suitably address the annual flash flooding problem in khartoum this management challenge proved to be the second most discussed fig 1 the mopi engineers complained that drainage infrastructure projects are often disregarded and overlooked in favour of more eye catching constructions such as bridges this can be attributed to a lack of political will from the decision makers in not caring to focus upon projects that would help mitigate flash flood impacts during the wet season the focus group conducted with the remote sensing authority rsa revealed another aspect of the lack of political will that the actors have experienced in this case the application of remote sensing a potentially very effective tool for non structural flood management measures is stated to be underutilized by the decision makers despite the rsa being a fully functioning national institution for this technology this presents another sign of there being a certain lack of political will in the use of all possible resources to improve flash flood management for khartoum this point was supported by academics working at the unesco chair of water resources ucwr in khartoum who are employed by the government as a consultancy role on aspects of flood management like the rsa the ucwr lament the lack of utilization of their scientific studies by decision makers having an effective early warning system ews operating in khartoum would be a major positive step in improving flash flood preparedness for the city during the eco sustainability forum run by the ucec the reason for the lack of this non structural flood measure in khartoum was blamed on the lack of political will for it the lack of knowledge held by the top policy and decision makers was another challenge experienced by the actors working within the flood management field at ucwr they noted that government ministerial changes have been one of the reasons for the lack of decision maker expertise the ngo envi agreed with the ucwr comments explaining that the policy makers lacked sufficient knowledge and understanding of the flooding issues envi went on to discuss how they are never the ultimate decision makers although there are many experts working within the different authorities therefore envi felt that the decision makers must therefore coordinate and engage with other actors who have valuable expertise on the subject in order to improve their knowledge this is an example of how the challenges often closely overlapped with one another here the challenge of decision maker knowledge is closely tied to the lack of coordination of actors and civil society engagement that have been previously discussed it is well recognised that two of the most fundamental principles within good governance are accountability and transparency wilby and keenan 2012 however during the data collection phase various actors have reported that a challenge they face within the flood management field is that of a lack of accountability and transparency within the government as with many developing countries this is a common problem within governmental authorities as a national expert with the napa described it as being a deep rooted long running issue in sudan the mopi engineers reported that the government housing authorities are collecting fees without showing suitable accountability for the dangers these residents are now facing envi adds that the government is also lacking accountability and transparency when dealing with the recovery of flood affected areas after the 2013 floods the government of sudan received funds from several international donors to aid with the rehabilitation but envi questions the suitable utilization of this money 3 1 3 limited resources there was a general consensus from the actors working within the flood management field in khartoum that they had limited resources including a lack of accessibility to suitable data and tools this was recorded as the third most dominant challenge discussed during the research fig 1 the ucwr academics explained how this is a common problem for developing countries such as sudan here the ucwr emphasises how without the appropriate data it is very hard to effectively manage water resources if you are forced to estimate on important values like the potential flood volumes when designing flood protection structures there will always be the risk that the dimensions will not be suitable during the focus group discussion with the rsa they added that due to the united states digital technology sanctions on sudan the rsa faces major data accessibility problems the challenge of the lack of data was further discussed during the focus group with the flood task force ftf a specialist governmental unit started in 2013 to coordinate flood management efforts during the wet season an expert member of the ftf added to the debate over the frustrations of the lack of data which limits their abilities to utilize valuable modelling tools to improve flood forecasting and early warning here the lack of accessible data is attributed to it being fragmented between different actors hence linking to another challenges the lack of coordination the overlapping of these two challenges appears again when talking to the hac who complained about the rainfall data they receive from the sudan meteorological authority sma being only average values and not providing information on the distribution of rainfall during the ucec forum the lack of suitable rainfall data received further criticism as it was felt that the tools being used were not effective for flood forecasting early warning and therefore building flood preparedness in khartoum despite not being one of the most dominant challenges discussed it could still be assumed that budgetary and general financial constraints should be recognised as a fundamental reason for the limited management resources of course it should be noted that this is generally a problem throughout all aspects of flood management within a poor developing country such as sudan as discussed in the previous section the mopi spoke of the lack of budget allocation they receive for drainage projects in comparison to more eye catching structures such as buildings roads bridges etc the participants of the rsa focus group built on this concern of the government s budgetary focus and added that research and development institutes like themselves are suffering from a lack of funding this challenge was also fed back during the sma focus group with participants calling for decision makers to improve budgeting for flood prevention and response and that flooding is not seen as a priority issue in the hac interview they revealed how the different authorities and actors are facing the same financial challenges despite their different roles 3 1 4 poor urban planning the lack of an effective urban development strategy was the most prevalent challenge discussed amongst the actors during the data collection fig 1 the napa national expert regards khartoum s urban planning as the biggest problem and partly blames this on the top decision makers not following a long term development strategy for the city as mentioned previously the mopi engineers discussed how new housing settlement are being constructed in areas of flash flood risk making additional work for them to protect the areas the planning of housing within unsuitable flood risk areas was a dominant issue raised by many of the actors the ucwr adds to this with criticism over the building within wadi pathways without adequate drainage planning done beforehand giving an example of one of these new housing settlements that has been constructed within the wadis the view of the ucwr laments how absurd the planning policy is pointing to how ridiculous it is that the planners have even named the town wadi of course it must be understood that this desperate planning is a result of the huge growth in khartoum s population in recent years which is putting massive pressures on the authorities to find new settlement locations that are not always suitable these pressures were reaffirmed during the ftf focus group the sma focus group added that one of the main problems was that people have set up informal settlements themselves within lower areas of these natural flood pathways hence the natural drainage to the river is no longer existing as people have settled there reducing the natural vegetation creating more impervious surfaces and therefore increasing the runoff however the ngo envi sees the challenge from a different perspective laying blame with the government rather than the people despite having the lowest amounts of comments recorded fig 1 the issue of inadequate housing building and infrastructure quality is still a real problem for flood preparedness in khartoum this issue was clearly demonstrated by mahmood et al 2017 as follows the flood affected houses were predominantly constructed of the traditional sudanese dried mud building materials the housing specifications were not suitable as they were built in low lying depressions and hollows at the sides of elevated roads hence where urban diffuse runoff could therefore be collected and that various drainage structures had not been of the correct dimensions to cope with the volumes of water in the recent flash floods it is clear that this challenge of housing and infrastructure quality is strongly connected to other discussed challenges such as the lack of data and tools which are crucial when designing flooding structures and of course the budget financial constraints that must always be considered as a major factor for sudan envi goes on to link this challenge back to the urban planning problem they discussed how khartoum faces particularly severe flood impacts because of the high numbers of people within poorly planned settlements lacking adequate infrastructures 3 2 integrated flash flood management framework schelfaut et al 2011 see the resilience concept as as a multi disciplinary approach in which technical measures are integrated with economic environmental social and governance measures it is important to understand that the master plan proposed herein would look to operate within the framework of an integrated flash flood management iffm approach the majority of the management challenges collated exhibit the characteristics of an institutional setup that is lacking iffm principles therefore through the adoption of an iffm approach many of these challenges could be overcome therefore paving the way for an appropriate master flash flood management plan maffmap then to be implemented see fig 2 it is crucial to recognize the importance of adopting an iffm framework which would act as a platform for the management plan to work within table 2 shows each of the thematic management challenges could be successfully addressed through the endorsement of key iffm principles to ensure that the plan represents an adaptive strategy that is realistic practical and tangible for policy maker it was important to acknowledge these critiques when designing the maffmap in an attempt to address the issue of practicality best efforts have been made to utilize the opinions and views expressed from actors during the data collection phase this makes it possible to conceive a management plan that acknowledges the challenges of the professionals working within the field furthermore the plan uses lessons learned from other countries similar to sudan in terms of financial and institutional capacity capabilities but which adopted an adaptive flood management approach that has proved to be a resounding success for the nation in building community flood preparedness and resilience hence reducing flood risk and where community and civil society engagement was a key factor in improving the situation within the data collection phase during the participation of the unops flood management workshop given to the mopi non structural measures were promoted as being the most cost effective and practical forms of management adaptations that could be adopted for khartoum the lack of data on the wadi and khors systems was identified as a major constraint that must be addressed and can be done so through the creation of a special unit the collection and analysis of practical recommendations from experts working within the field was helpful for designing the maffmap fig 2 as there was additional justification and validation for certain aspects such as the key management components and processes operating within the iffm framework to be included in the plan the maffmap would begin with addressing the issue of the lack of data on flash floods as a first step i e the quantity and quality of data resources in khartoum as a first step development of new practical tools and transferring of technology is key to improving the knowledge sharing between management actors this can be better pursued through coordination of the actors to use all relevant expertise across the field as for example the better utilization of the rsa who have valuable skills and resources in processing satellite imagery only once a better level of data has been acquired it is then possible to build up on the other components of the management plan in this regard there is a need for employing high resolution satellite rainfall estimation products for accurate urban flash flood modelling analysis in areas where ground measured data are sparse hydrological simulation forced by satellite rainfall product help understand the possible role of rainfall in flood intensification in a region with sparse operational gauge network casse and gosset 2015 assessment of the performance of real time satellite rainfall estimates as input into appropriate hydrological models can help mitigate flood damage provide support to contingency planning and provide warning to people threatened by floods by preparing a flood hazard map bajracharya et al 2017 as the figure shows another key facet is the use of these new datasets within a mixed measure approach from the authorities i e integrating the use of structural and non structural measures as discussed the new evidence of the risks of natural drainage pathways wadis and khors must be integrated within the urban planning policy this of course connects back to the iffm framework as a prerequisite for the plan to function in that a holistic cross sectoral approach must ultimately be adopted whereby there is a shared set of objectives between land use planners and flood management actors the management plan would endorse the financing of more effective flood forecasting tools such as the development of radar technologies to improve detection a recommendation made during the data collection phase from the ucec besides a better development and adoption of early warning systems ews further dissemination techniques can be tested and developed such as the use of short message service sms texts a practical recommendation made by a project manager from the unops which could make use of the wide ownership of mobile phones amongst the communities of khartoum this view matches that made by mccallum et al 2016 that a great potential lies in the application of growing number of technologies existing in disaster prone regions but the most important barrier remaining to disaster preparedness solutions is a lack of awareness of this potential another key component of the master plan is the role of programmes of community capacity building for raising awareness an obvious strategy would be to collaborate with the education sector whereby programmes can aim to start with young children teaching them the basics of the risks and impacts of flash floods and how to properly respond in the case of these disasters other general public awareness campaigns could be implemented to improve people s understanding of the risk impacts and measures such as flood proofing of their properties improving the community and civil society engagement would go far in improving khartoum s flash flood resilience as the majority of civil society organizations are comprised of knowledgeable experts and academics who can share their valuable expertise but must be firstly allowed to participate according to envi improved consultation meetings between the governmental authorities and community civil society actors could look to better involve these stakeholders within the flood planning and implementation phases local governance structures can be better developed by the full engagement and training of water users associations wuas as recommended by a project manager from the unops how to enroll local knowledges into planning and governance structures for flood resilience planning in terms of monitoring preparedness and response seems to be a key practical and strategic question in developed countries as well mcewen and jones 2012 through engagement communities will be more willing to trust governmental measures therefore reducing problems such as the building of non authorized flood structures which were observed by mahmood et al 2017 for khartoum through these capacity building measures better preparedness and resilience to flash floods could be ensured for the people of khartoum finally all of the above components and processes would ultimately work toward achieving the overall goal of the maffmap i e building socio hydrological resilience and reducing the risk to flash flood events in khartoum 4 conclusions building upon the lessons learned from previous purely observational impact assessment of the flash flood hazard in khartoum the present study has utilized the contextual understanding of this hazard to analyse the exact kinds of challenges that are facing the different actors working with the flood management field four main themes addressing the management challenges have been found in the following order of dominance weak institutional capacity bad governance limited resources and poor urban planning in khartoum these challenges seem to match those identified elsewhere but for humid environments hoang et al 2018 each main theme is further sub divided into specific recorded challenges each representing an insightful lesson into the problems facing the flood management field in khartoum nevertheless one has to state the main research constraints and limitations faced during the research study process these limitations include the following 1 unconformity of the different interview sessions conducted in terms of the session duration number of questions asked and number of answers received due to time constraints dedicated by different actors to the researcher to conduct the session 2 lack of willingness from some of the interviewees to directly answer the given question due to a cautiousness or discomfort to criticise anything government related e g the bad governance challenges 3 the interviewees often digressing away from the initial question owing to the natural informal style of the discussions and 4 the interviews intentionally straying from the discussion topics in order to push another certain agenda therefore there was potential for biased findings as they do not display a fully impartial representation of the opinions felt by the actors however despite these constraints the methods were successful in giving a valuable overview of some of the main challenges faced as the actors represented a good level of diversity of the flood management field the study has emphasised the importance of recognizing that urban planning policy must be integrated with flood management strategy in order to reduce urban flash flood risk and pursue sustainable urban development therefore it has added a management perspective the facets of the maffmap include steps toward improving the quantity and quality of data resources regarding this hazard aspects for use of these new datasets within a multi measure structural and non structural approach from the authorities and programmes for building community and civil society capacity through improving awareness and engagement the implementation of the adaptive management plan framework approach is fundamental to the successful functioning of the management plan and is therefore defined as a prerequisite only with the full adoption of the iffm framework can the plan be a practical and effective option for khartoum this plan has also been designed to be a suitable flash flood management option for the arid areas therefore been replicable beyond the confines of the study area acknowledgements the authors are thankful to the staff members from the water research centre wrc of university of khartoum for the kind support during the research visit made by finlay horn to khartoum this field visit was funded through the enquiry

7058,the objective of this research is to improve the understanding and recognition of the management challenges to flash flooding hazards and the potential adaptive measures within the arid urban areas through a socio hydrological framework considering the capital of sudan khartoum as an example of urban arid areas with increasing flash flood risk the analysis was founded on expert views and opinions collected from a range of different flood management actors following the 2013 and 2014 flash flood events the qualitative research methods included participant observation expert interviews and focus groups the main themes of management challenges recorded included weak institutional capacity bad governance limited resources and poor urban planning these four themes in turn included different types of challenges among which lack of civil society engagement and coordination of actors political will data and tools and effective urban development strategy shared the highest number of comments from the professional actors in each theme respectively these findings presented a management perspective to the lessons previously established and learned from an impact assessment accordingly the amalgamation of all the lessons learned from the flood research findings enabled a suitable master flash flood management plan maffmap to be proposed as a final product this plan would operate within an integrated flash flood management iffm framework the facets of the maffmap include steps toward improving the quantity and quality of data resources regarding this hazard aspects for use of these new datasets within a mixed measure structural and non structural approach from the authorities and programmes for building community and civil society capacity through improving awareness and engagement furthermore it is intended that this plan would be a replicable design which could therefore be adopted and implemented in the wider context of the urban arid regions keywords urban flash flood integrated flash flood management management challenges socio hydrology resilience sudan 1 introduction when recognizing that climate predictions warn of an increased frequency of extreme rainfall events it is important to understand that rainfall driven flash floods have been identified as the type of natural hazard most likely to increase in severity as a result houston et al 2011 ipcc 2012 one line of thought is that the increasing risk and impacts of global flood events is an effect of the intensifying role of climate change and variability creating greater probability levels of flood hazards kundzewicz et al 2014 it is also key to recognize that any intensification in a region s rainfall regime will put the highly populated urban areas in particular under increased risk from flash flood events as the effects of urban development have increased their vulnerability and exposure to such hazards ipcc 2012 kundzewicz et al 2002 2014 some of the main impacts of urban floods include the threat of fatalities destruction of homes and livelihoods and damages to economic assets and primary importance infrastructures douglas et al 2008 africa reported to be the world s fastest urbanizing continent has already experienced the effects of growing urbanization and the level of flood impacts di baldassarre et al 2010 directly connect the rapidly increased number of flood fatalities to the steady growth of urban population in africa for the period 1950 2010 for example 23 flash floods were recorded during the period 2003 2010 in some parts of ethiopia due to increase in rainfall intensity paired by a marked change in land use cover and management practices billi et al 2015 fatal and damaging floods due to heavy rainfall have also occurred in other parts of africa where populations have experienced increasing growth rate danumah et al 2016 epule et al 2017 report increasing frequency of floods over time in the african sahel and therefore recommend careful consideration of adaptations and land use policies to reinforce resilience to floods a recent integrated assessment of flash flood impacts on society property and infrastructure for the capital of sudan khartoum has estimated the risk as a function of hazard sensitivity vulnerability and adaptive to be 46 4 mahmood et al 2017 the same study has enabled deriving a number of 11 lessons that make similar areas to have faced increasing risk of this hazard mahmood et al 2017 rainfall in khartoum is characterized by irregular behaviour extreme seasonality such that almost all rain falls in 1 2 months and dependency of the annual rainfall on the very strong records i e daily rainfall of more than 30 mm mahmoud et al 2014 the rapid urbanization within khartoum hafazalla 2008 eltayeb 2003 hafazalla 2008 bannaga 2012 is symbolic of many other cities throughout africa as environmental e g drought or desertification socioeconomic and civil war refugees migrate from rural to urban areas babiker 1982 el nour 1989 verhoeven 2011 to escape the devastating problems only to put themselves within the risk of another type of problem such as the hazard of urban floods douglas et al 2008 the mass influx of migrants then exposed to already flood prone areas are made further vulnerable by the quick fix creations of informal settlements to accommodate them usually lacking any kind of planned drainage system wmo 2008 recognizing both lines of argument and the evidence of the recent severe flood events it could thus be argued that the combined impacts of climatic variability and anthropogenic pressures are increasing the risk of flash floods for khartoum mahmood et al 2017 therefore it can be assumed that 1 business as usual reactive flood management practice is unsustainable and 2 proactive flash flood planning should be adopted to build khartoum s preparedness and resilience to future heavy rain and flash flood events following on from these broad disaster management concepts to combat the increased levels of flood risk the integrated flash flood management iffm approach has been generally accepted as the doctrine to follow for actors working within the flood management field as noted above it is believed that iffm operates within the framework of socio hydrology socio hydrology is defined by sivapalan et al 2012 as an interdisciplinary but quantitative science focusing on observing understanding and predicting future trajectories of co evolution of coupled human water systems thus underpinning the practice of integrated water resources management iwrm i e underpinning sustainable water management in the context of socio hydrological analysis of flood risk di baldassarre et al 2013 presented a conceptualization of the dominant dynamics in floodplains as fully coupled human flood systems with hydrological economical political technological and social processes simplified as much as possible another fundamental principle underpinning iffm is the adoption of a participatory approach engaging with the community to build preparedness and resilience to flood events furthermore iffm should implement a mix of strategies to reduce flood risk meaning both structural and non structural measures wmo 2009 in the development of urban floodplains another study analysed the interplay of community risk coping culture flooding damage and economic growth in a conceptual way to create a socio hydrological discussion among researches from natural and social sciences viglione et al 2014 viglione et al 2014 recommended further interesting research directions such as using an analogous conceptual framework to investigate how communities adjust or may adjust toward developing a suitable culture for their environment they also recommended a focus on which role different community agents e g institutions and public have in the process of decision making regarding for example flood risk management while examples of the emerging challenges for flood risk management and relevant strategies are available for some developing regions in the humid environments e g hoang et al 2018 such challenges have rarely if ever been identified and addressed in developing arid regions the establishment of flood resilient communities provides an added value and effective means to operational and adaptive management of flood disasters in a changing world schelfaut et al 2011 therefore the objective of this study is to build a good level of understanding over the management challenges to flash floods from the khartoum case of arid regions to be able to design and propose a practical adaptive management plan which would aim to reduce the risk to flash flooding there are various components to the importance of this study first there is a need to recognize the relevance and applicability of integrated management principles as a suitable framework for proactive adaptive flash flood management measures to operate within this improves preparedness and resilience to future flood events second this study represents an amalgamation of all the lessons learned from flood research findings in the case study area finally the proposed plan should be replicable to be adopted and implemented beyond the confines of the case study area i e in the wider arid region context this is fundamental to the building of a body of work related to the often marginalized increasing risk of urban flash flooding in arid regions to challenge the current dominant discourse of water scarcity issues tarhule 2005 tschakert et al 2010 epule et al 2017 2 methods this study analyses the main issues of a socio hydrological event faced within the capital of sudan khartoum in 2013 and 2014 based on a recent assessment of the risks and impacts and herein explored management challenges and potential adaptive measures to flash flooding events affecting the city the analysis was founded on expert views and opinions collected through qualitative research methods including participant observation expert interviews and focus groups it was important to speak to a range of different professional actors including those from governmental bodies research institutions academia international agencies non governmental organizations ngos and independent national experts in order to gain a well rounded holistic perspective on the subject schelfaut et al 2011 consider increasing the participation of all stakeholders and bottom up involvement as important factors in increasing the ownership of solutions and resilience to flood risk research involving stakeholder interviews was undertaken by mcewen and jones 2012 to explore the build up of sustainable local knowledge into community flood resilience planning after flood events in uk in the present study targeted flood management actors and the corresponding category of qualitative research methods conducted for them are listed in table 1 the targeting of experts should theoretically mean that the data collected are of higher quality as the interviewee will be more informed and interested in the subject matter dorussen et al 2005 2 1 participant observation participant observation involves the researcher not only observing but also participating to some extent in the activities in order to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon from the inside myres 2009 within this study the technique of participant observation was used effectively with two different actors in two events the first piece of participant observation took place in a public eco sustainability monthly forum hosted by the united nations office for project services unesco cousteau eco technie chair ucec at the future university sudan through participating in forum no 67 weather extreme events in sudan recent khartoum floods as an example valuable insight could be gained into the current debate over the risks causes impacts and management of flash flooding in khartoum the different concerns and opinions expressed from forum participants were recorded to be used later within the data analysis another use of participant observation was applied while partaking in a workshop on flood management organised by united nations office for project services unops for the khartoum state ministry of planning and infrastructures mopi the mopi is tasked with the job of designing and constructing flood mitigation structures including protection dams dykes and collection drainage channels participating in this workshop provided the opportunity to document the key flood management challenges faced by mopi as well as the potential adaptive measures recommended by unops as part of their capacity building approach i e the provision of infrastructure advisory services in order to build resilience of communities to flood events 2 2 expert interviews and focus groups in this study the interviews were semi structured whereby the researcher had a pre established set of topics they wish to discuss but can benefit from the flexibility of being able to add remove or vary the order of questions saunders et al 2003 this free flowing format enables the researcher to probe the interviewee further on specific subjects of interest in order to gain better understanding of the management challenges and potential adaptive measures characterizing the flash flood hazard berg and lune 2004 for some situations when dealing with several interviewees from the same professional background at once the qualitative research method of focus group interviewing was applied conducted very similarly to the semi structured interviews the focus groups required the researcher to facilitate the discussion in order to collect information regarding matters of interest to the research study berg and lune 2004 a focus group can be a highly rewarding and dynamic research technique as a synergistic group effect can occur due to the informal group discussion style whereby participant comments can trigger new interactions between group members and therefore generate a greater number of ideas compared to the individual interview format stewart and shamdasani 1990 sussman et al 1991 berg and lune 2004 2 3 data analysis for the primary data collected within the study area through the use of qualitative research methods i e participant observation interviews and focus groups another step of data analysis was required to transform this raw data into a valuable form of information which could therefore be used to achieve the study objectives a dictaphone was used to record the events these recordings could later be made into verbatim transcripts for coding during the data analysis stage the grounded theory approach was adopted to analyse the collected qualitative data transcripts strauss and corbin 1990 describe this approach as an inductive method that seeks to discover and develop themes during the analysis stage in the case of this study a core concept was found to be the challenges faced by the actors working within the flood management field in khartoum with the specific codes being the different types of challenges discussed which have been selectively further grouped into different themes of challenges 3 results and discussion 3 1 management challenges comments from actors were coded into 10 different types of challenges that could then be grouped into four main themes weak institutional capacity bad governance limited resources and poor urban planning fig 1 shows the full results displaying the different challenges themes and the number of comments attributed for each in total there were 231 comments recorded that could be categorized to a certain type of challenge code faced by the actors with 83 comments sharing over a third 36 of the total comments the weak institutional capacity was stated by the actors to be the most dominant challenges theme out of the 10 challenges identified the type with the most number of comments attached to it was the lack of an overall urban development strategy 34 comments a systematic review of each recorded challenge allows an overview of the main points raised for each 3 1 1 weak institutional capacity a national expert and experienced professional working within national adaptation programme for action napa blames this problem on a lack of care from both sides government and society and recalls of better community spirit in helping flood mitigation in the past during the flood management workshop by unops this lack of public engagement issue was one of the main focus points during discussions the unops representative emphasised the need to address this issue in sudan the ngo actor envi felt very strongly about this challenge as the problem of limited civil society engagement affected their work directly they blamed the government for 1 not utilizing the knowledge and expertise that civil society organizations ngos can offer 2 not telling the people of the flood risks within their informal settlements and 3 not providing suitable recovery support after flood events while at the same time collecting large land permit fees the lack of coordination between the different actors working within the flood management field was very evident during the data collection period as often it could be noted that the roles of various actors overlapped with each other but still there seemed to be limited proper knowledge sharing between them the mopi engineers complained of the lack of coordination between themselves and the housing planning sector claiming that new housing projects are being implemented within flood risk areas therefore creating fresh problems for their ministry to construct new embankments and drainage systems to prevent flooding impacts in those areas the humanitarian aid commission hac acting within the ministry of humanitarian affairs admitted this lack of coordination between actors to be one of their main challenges the problem of incoordination is also addressed by the ngo envi the lack of an effective institutional framework is another challenge that has been identified it can be directly linked to the previous challenge of the poor coordination of actors as this can be attributed to the lack of a proper framework which would work to identify the roles and responsibilities for each actor to achieve a shared set of objectives the unops workshop focussed on the problem of sudan s weak institutional capacity it was recommended that in order to improve institutional capacity there must be an effective framework to bring the various actors together as with the closely connected previous challenge hac identified this issue to be one of their biggest challenges 3 1 2 bad governance the lack of political will refers to the challenge that actors experienced from the governmental policy and decision makers to focus efforts to suitably address the annual flash flooding problem in khartoum this management challenge proved to be the second most discussed fig 1 the mopi engineers complained that drainage infrastructure projects are often disregarded and overlooked in favour of more eye catching constructions such as bridges this can be attributed to a lack of political will from the decision makers in not caring to focus upon projects that would help mitigate flash flood impacts during the wet season the focus group conducted with the remote sensing authority rsa revealed another aspect of the lack of political will that the actors have experienced in this case the application of remote sensing a potentially very effective tool for non structural flood management measures is stated to be underutilized by the decision makers despite the rsa being a fully functioning national institution for this technology this presents another sign of there being a certain lack of political will in the use of all possible resources to improve flash flood management for khartoum this point was supported by academics working at the unesco chair of water resources ucwr in khartoum who are employed by the government as a consultancy role on aspects of flood management like the rsa the ucwr lament the lack of utilization of their scientific studies by decision makers having an effective early warning system ews operating in khartoum would be a major positive step in improving flash flood preparedness for the city during the eco sustainability forum run by the ucec the reason for the lack of this non structural flood measure in khartoum was blamed on the lack of political will for it the lack of knowledge held by the top policy and decision makers was another challenge experienced by the actors working within the flood management field at ucwr they noted that government ministerial changes have been one of the reasons for the lack of decision maker expertise the ngo envi agreed with the ucwr comments explaining that the policy makers lacked sufficient knowledge and understanding of the flooding issues envi went on to discuss how they are never the ultimate decision makers although there are many experts working within the different authorities therefore envi felt that the decision makers must therefore coordinate and engage with other actors who have valuable expertise on the subject in order to improve their knowledge this is an example of how the challenges often closely overlapped with one another here the challenge of decision maker knowledge is closely tied to the lack of coordination of actors and civil society engagement that have been previously discussed it is well recognised that two of the most fundamental principles within good governance are accountability and transparency wilby and keenan 2012 however during the data collection phase various actors have reported that a challenge they face within the flood management field is that of a lack of accountability and transparency within the government as with many developing countries this is a common problem within governmental authorities as a national expert with the napa described it as being a deep rooted long running issue in sudan the mopi engineers reported that the government housing authorities are collecting fees without showing suitable accountability for the dangers these residents are now facing envi adds that the government is also lacking accountability and transparency when dealing with the recovery of flood affected areas after the 2013 floods the government of sudan received funds from several international donors to aid with the rehabilitation but envi questions the suitable utilization of this money 3 1 3 limited resources there was a general consensus from the actors working within the flood management field in khartoum that they had limited resources including a lack of accessibility to suitable data and tools this was recorded as the third most dominant challenge discussed during the research fig 1 the ucwr academics explained how this is a common problem for developing countries such as sudan here the ucwr emphasises how without the appropriate data it is very hard to effectively manage water resources if you are forced to estimate on important values like the potential flood volumes when designing flood protection structures there will always be the risk that the dimensions will not be suitable during the focus group discussion with the rsa they added that due to the united states digital technology sanctions on sudan the rsa faces major data accessibility problems the challenge of the lack of data was further discussed during the focus group with the flood task force ftf a specialist governmental unit started in 2013 to coordinate flood management efforts during the wet season an expert member of the ftf added to the debate over the frustrations of the lack of data which limits their abilities to utilize valuable modelling tools to improve flood forecasting and early warning here the lack of accessible data is attributed to it being fragmented between different actors hence linking to another challenges the lack of coordination the overlapping of these two challenges appears again when talking to the hac who complained about the rainfall data they receive from the sudan meteorological authority sma being only average values and not providing information on the distribution of rainfall during the ucec forum the lack of suitable rainfall data received further criticism as it was felt that the tools being used were not effective for flood forecasting early warning and therefore building flood preparedness in khartoum despite not being one of the most dominant challenges discussed it could still be assumed that budgetary and general financial constraints should be recognised as a fundamental reason for the limited management resources of course it should be noted that this is generally a problem throughout all aspects of flood management within a poor developing country such as sudan as discussed in the previous section the mopi spoke of the lack of budget allocation they receive for drainage projects in comparison to more eye catching structures such as buildings roads bridges etc the participants of the rsa focus group built on this concern of the government s budgetary focus and added that research and development institutes like themselves are suffering from a lack of funding this challenge was also fed back during the sma focus group with participants calling for decision makers to improve budgeting for flood prevention and response and that flooding is not seen as a priority issue in the hac interview they revealed how the different authorities and actors are facing the same financial challenges despite their different roles 3 1 4 poor urban planning the lack of an effective urban development strategy was the most prevalent challenge discussed amongst the actors during the data collection fig 1 the napa national expert regards khartoum s urban planning as the biggest problem and partly blames this on the top decision makers not following a long term development strategy for the city as mentioned previously the mopi engineers discussed how new housing settlement are being constructed in areas of flash flood risk making additional work for them to protect the areas the planning of housing within unsuitable flood risk areas was a dominant issue raised by many of the actors the ucwr adds to this with criticism over the building within wadi pathways without adequate drainage planning done beforehand giving an example of one of these new housing settlements that has been constructed within the wadis the view of the ucwr laments how absurd the planning policy is pointing to how ridiculous it is that the planners have even named the town wadi of course it must be understood that this desperate planning is a result of the huge growth in khartoum s population in recent years which is putting massive pressures on the authorities to find new settlement locations that are not always suitable these pressures were reaffirmed during the ftf focus group the sma focus group added that one of the main problems was that people have set up informal settlements themselves within lower areas of these natural flood pathways hence the natural drainage to the river is no longer existing as people have settled there reducing the natural vegetation creating more impervious surfaces and therefore increasing the runoff however the ngo envi sees the challenge from a different perspective laying blame with the government rather than the people despite having the lowest amounts of comments recorded fig 1 the issue of inadequate housing building and infrastructure quality is still a real problem for flood preparedness in khartoum this issue was clearly demonstrated by mahmood et al 2017 as follows the flood affected houses were predominantly constructed of the traditional sudanese dried mud building materials the housing specifications were not suitable as they were built in low lying depressions and hollows at the sides of elevated roads hence where urban diffuse runoff could therefore be collected and that various drainage structures had not been of the correct dimensions to cope with the volumes of water in the recent flash floods it is clear that this challenge of housing and infrastructure quality is strongly connected to other discussed challenges such as the lack of data and tools which are crucial when designing flooding structures and of course the budget financial constraints that must always be considered as a major factor for sudan envi goes on to link this challenge back to the urban planning problem they discussed how khartoum faces particularly severe flood impacts because of the high numbers of people within poorly planned settlements lacking adequate infrastructures 3 2 integrated flash flood management framework schelfaut et al 2011 see the resilience concept as as a multi disciplinary approach in which technical measures are integrated with economic environmental social and governance measures it is important to understand that the master plan proposed herein would look to operate within the framework of an integrated flash flood management iffm approach the majority of the management challenges collated exhibit the characteristics of an institutional setup that is lacking iffm principles therefore through the adoption of an iffm approach many of these challenges could be overcome therefore paving the way for an appropriate master flash flood management plan maffmap then to be implemented see fig 2 it is crucial to recognize the importance of adopting an iffm framework which would act as a platform for the management plan to work within table 2 shows each of the thematic management challenges could be successfully addressed through the endorsement of key iffm principles to ensure that the plan represents an adaptive strategy that is realistic practical and tangible for policy maker it was important to acknowledge these critiques when designing the maffmap in an attempt to address the issue of practicality best efforts have been made to utilize the opinions and views expressed from actors during the data collection phase this makes it possible to conceive a management plan that acknowledges the challenges of the professionals working within the field furthermore the plan uses lessons learned from other countries similar to sudan in terms of financial and institutional capacity capabilities but which adopted an adaptive flood management approach that has proved to be a resounding success for the nation in building community flood preparedness and resilience hence reducing flood risk and where community and civil society engagement was a key factor in improving the situation within the data collection phase during the participation of the unops flood management workshop given to the mopi non structural measures were promoted as being the most cost effective and practical forms of management adaptations that could be adopted for khartoum the lack of data on the wadi and khors systems was identified as a major constraint that must be addressed and can be done so through the creation of a special unit the collection and analysis of practical recommendations from experts working within the field was helpful for designing the maffmap fig 2 as there was additional justification and validation for certain aspects such as the key management components and processes operating within the iffm framework to be included in the plan the maffmap would begin with addressing the issue of the lack of data on flash floods as a first step i e the quantity and quality of data resources in khartoum as a first step development of new practical tools and transferring of technology is key to improving the knowledge sharing between management actors this can be better pursued through coordination of the actors to use all relevant expertise across the field as for example the better utilization of the rsa who have valuable skills and resources in processing satellite imagery only once a better level of data has been acquired it is then possible to build up on the other components of the management plan in this regard there is a need for employing high resolution satellite rainfall estimation products for accurate urban flash flood modelling analysis in areas where ground measured data are sparse hydrological simulation forced by satellite rainfall product help understand the possible role of rainfall in flood intensification in a region with sparse operational gauge network casse and gosset 2015 assessment of the performance of real time satellite rainfall estimates as input into appropriate hydrological models can help mitigate flood damage provide support to contingency planning and provide warning to people threatened by floods by preparing a flood hazard map bajracharya et al 2017 as the figure shows another key facet is the use of these new datasets within a mixed measure approach from the authorities i e integrating the use of structural and non structural measures as discussed the new evidence of the risks of natural drainage pathways wadis and khors must be integrated within the urban planning policy this of course connects back to the iffm framework as a prerequisite for the plan to function in that a holistic cross sectoral approach must ultimately be adopted whereby there is a shared set of objectives between land use planners and flood management actors the management plan would endorse the financing of more effective flood forecasting tools such as the development of radar technologies to improve detection a recommendation made during the data collection phase from the ucec besides a better development and adoption of early warning systems ews further dissemination techniques can be tested and developed such as the use of short message service sms texts a practical recommendation made by a project manager from the unops which could make use of the wide ownership of mobile phones amongst the communities of khartoum this view matches that made by mccallum et al 2016 that a great potential lies in the application of growing number of technologies existing in disaster prone regions but the most important barrier remaining to disaster preparedness solutions is a lack of awareness of this potential another key component of the master plan is the role of programmes of community capacity building for raising awareness an obvious strategy would be to collaborate with the education sector whereby programmes can aim to start with young children teaching them the basics of the risks and impacts of flash floods and how to properly respond in the case of these disasters other general public awareness campaigns could be implemented to improve people s understanding of the risk impacts and measures such as flood proofing of their properties improving the community and civil society engagement would go far in improving khartoum s flash flood resilience as the majority of civil society organizations are comprised of knowledgeable experts and academics who can share their valuable expertise but must be firstly allowed to participate according to envi improved consultation meetings between the governmental authorities and community civil society actors could look to better involve these stakeholders within the flood planning and implementation phases local governance structures can be better developed by the full engagement and training of water users associations wuas as recommended by a project manager from the unops how to enroll local knowledges into planning and governance structures for flood resilience planning in terms of monitoring preparedness and response seems to be a key practical and strategic question in developed countries as well mcewen and jones 2012 through engagement communities will be more willing to trust governmental measures therefore reducing problems such as the building of non authorized flood structures which were observed by mahmood et al 2017 for khartoum through these capacity building measures better preparedness and resilience to flash floods could be ensured for the people of khartoum finally all of the above components and processes would ultimately work toward achieving the overall goal of the maffmap i e building socio hydrological resilience and reducing the risk to flash flood events in khartoum 4 conclusions building upon the lessons learned from previous purely observational impact assessment of the flash flood hazard in khartoum the present study has utilized the contextual understanding of this hazard to analyse the exact kinds of challenges that are facing the different actors working with the flood management field four main themes addressing the management challenges have been found in the following order of dominance weak institutional capacity bad governance limited resources and poor urban planning in khartoum these challenges seem to match those identified elsewhere but for humid environments hoang et al 2018 each main theme is further sub divided into specific recorded challenges each representing an insightful lesson into the problems facing the flood management field in khartoum nevertheless one has to state the main research constraints and limitations faced during the research study process these limitations include the following 1 unconformity of the different interview sessions conducted in terms of the session duration number of questions asked and number of answers received due to time constraints dedicated by different actors to the researcher to conduct the session 2 lack of willingness from some of the interviewees to directly answer the given question due to a cautiousness or discomfort to criticise anything government related e g the bad governance challenges 3 the interviewees often digressing away from the initial question owing to the natural informal style of the discussions and 4 the interviews intentionally straying from the discussion topics in order to push another certain agenda therefore there was potential for biased findings as they do not display a fully impartial representation of the opinions felt by the actors however despite these constraints the methods were successful in giving a valuable overview of some of the main challenges faced as the actors represented a good level of diversity of the flood management field the study has emphasised the importance of recognizing that urban planning policy must be integrated with flood management strategy in order to reduce urban flash flood risk and pursue sustainable urban development therefore it has added a management perspective the facets of the maffmap include steps toward improving the quantity and quality of data resources regarding this hazard aspects for use of these new datasets within a multi measure structural and non structural approach from the authorities and programmes for building community and civil society capacity through improving awareness and engagement the implementation of the adaptive management plan framework approach is fundamental to the successful functioning of the management plan and is therefore defined as a prerequisite only with the full adoption of the iffm framework can the plan be a practical and effective option for khartoum this plan has also been designed to be a suitable flash flood management option for the arid areas therefore been replicable beyond the confines of the study area acknowledgements the authors are thankful to the staff

7059,groundwater on islands occurs in the form of freshwater lenses that serve as an important water resource for local inhabitants these lenses are highly vulnerable to salinization due to natural recharge variations and groundwater abstraction determining the sustainable yield from freshwater lenses is challenging because the lens response during drought periods and the long term effects of pumping are both difficult to predict the exceptionally detailed and long data record for bonriki island of the tarawa atoll kiribati made it possible to develop a three dimensional variable density model of the island field data and modelling results highlight the strong control of rainfall variability and pumping on the temporal dynamics of the freshwater lens the model reproduces the salinity observations in both monitoring and pumping wells reasonably well and provides a rare example of physically based island simulation based on an extensive data set it enables the analysis of freshwater volume and fluxes of submarine groundwater discharge which is impossible based on the field observations alone under natural as well as abstraction conditions submarine groundwater discharge responds rapidly and almost proportionally to recharge theoretical model scenarios with scaled abstraction rates show that lens contraction caused by pumping is a nearly linear function of the total pumped volume whereby the abstraction rate and the timing of depletion are approximately inversely proportional modelling indicates that when monthly recharge inputs fall below around 2500 m3 d i e a flux of 1 7 mm d plus the abstraction rate the lens tends to contract thus despite the highly distributed and extensive abstraction network on bonriki island a significant amount of recharge is eventually lost to submarine groundwater discharge the long term freshwater storage trend indicates that bonriki island s lens is still contracting after 27 5 years of pumping and lens thinning is threatening to impact the water supply salinity this means that even permeable small islands like bonriki may take at least two decades to realise new equilibrium conditions that reflect pumping stresses which is an important consideration in assessing the sustainable yield of small islands in particular those less resilient to pumping than bonriki keywords fresh groundwater lens salinity small islands kiribati atoll island water management 1 introduction water resource availability and sustainable management practices are recurring issues on islands in particular for the small island developing states sids a group of 52 developing countries on low lying carbonate and volcanic islands that share similar sustainable development challenges unesco 2016 the sids are faced with the need to secure reliable freshwater supplies despite increased climate variability sea level rise and in many locations population growth white and falkland 2012 allen et al 2014 on small islands rainwater and groundwater are the primary natural sources of water supply illangasekare et al 2006 liu et al 2006 groundwater on islands occurs in the form of freshwater lenses which necessitates a special form of management to mitigate the risk of salinization and other forms of anthropogenic contamination bailey et al 2010 white and falkland 2010 atoll and similar coral reef islands represent a specific subgroup of the broader category of small islands and have many common characteristics and management problems falkland 1991 the volume of freshwater stored within an atoll island depends on the balance between recharge from rainfall and losses through evapotranspiration discharge into the ocean and lagoon mixing with underlying seawater and groundwater abstraction for human use determination of the sustainable yield requires that these processes can be quantified including the transient nature of rainfall and the recharge generated from it in particular the response of the freshwater lens to droughts must be known as groundwater during these times becomes the primary or even the sole source of water supply white and falkland 2010 werner et al 2017 previous studies have shown that freshwater lenses respond to recharge events at timescales ranging from hours to months for example jones et al 2004 determined the response of a borehole salinity profile on grand cayman island to a heavy rainfall event and found that salinities decreased across the entire 12 m profile as early as 1 5 h after the storm lens behaviour over longer time scales for example in response to intra and inter annual variations in rainfall has been widely studied woodroffe and falkland 2004 showed how the base of the freshwater lens responded to recharge variation over an eight year period for two study sites in the cocos keeling islands they found that where the lens is bounded by the unconformity between holocene sediments and pleistocene limestone found at a maximum depth of 15 m below the ground surface fluctuations of the base of the lens with recharge tend to be more subdued than when the freshwater is contained principally within the holocene sediments nonetheless the effects of droughts lasting up to several months resulted in significant thinning of the lens in both cases van der velde et al 2006 found that the salinity of pumped freshwater on the island of tongatapu tonga fluctuated around its mean value in response to the el niño southern oscillation enso and that the southern oscillation index soi could be used to predict groundwater salinity with a lag time of 10 months they applied a time series model that was fitted to observed data by parameter optimization the method sometimes yielded parameter combinations representative of unrealistically long transit times between the point of infiltration and the well van der velde et al 2007 the response of small island freshwater lenses to changes in recharge has also been investigated using numerical models early studies underwood et al 1992 griggs and peterson 1993 showed that as expected the lens will decrease in thickness in response to a reduction in recharge comte et al 2014 highlighted the importance of vegetation which through its influence on groundwater recharge may exert a strong control on the thickness of the lens they found that reduced recharge due to transpiration promotes seawater intrusion but a feedback mechanism exists because the increased salinity affects the health of the vegetation which reduces transpiration and thus enhances recharge bailey et al 2014 used numerical simulations to infer the effect of variable rainfall on the thickness of freshwater lenses for atoll islands of the maldives their results showed that variations in lens thickness of up to 50 can occur but their simulations did not consider pumping and the hydraulic parameters were not varied between different islands a comprehensive calibrated model of home island part of the cocos keeling islands was produced by ghassemi et al 2000 the study highlighted the complications of modelling atoll island environments and the need for incorporation of system stresses at a temporal resolution of one month or less in order to capture the transient nature of the observed salinity variations based on a poor fit between model outcomes and field data the authors drew pessimistic conclusions about our capacity to model freshwater lens dynamics even if abundant field data are available holding and allen 2015 assessed the impact of reduced recharge due to climate change for andros island in the bahamas using a three dimensional model and concluded that this could lead to a loss of freshwater volume of up to 19 while the role of climate driven recharge variability in controlling lens behaviour has been well studied there are fewer investigations into the effect of pumping on lens dynamics in particular where historical trends and spatial variability in pumping are known and accounted for griggs and peterson 1993 conducted two dimensional numerical simulations of the freshwater lens for the laura area of the majuro atoll in the marshall islands they concluded that the sustainable yield is almost twice as high when infiltration galleries instead of vertical wells are used to abstract groundwater moreover they reported that for simulations with monthly averaged recharge a higher sustainable extraction was found than for yearly averaged recharge and that significant quantities of water could be abstracted from the lens during sustained periods of drought their simulations spanned a period of 3 years only though and were therefore not inclusive of multi decadal trends a need therefore remains for long term studies that investigate the combined effects of rainfall variability pumping and physical groundwater processes to better understand the resilience of island freshwater lenses against droughts and to guide management of the freshwater lens to ensure the supply of suitable quality water the multi decadal impact of abstraction on the freshwater volume in particular has not been investigated in detail previously even though this is crucial to the long term sustainability of island water supply systems furthermore werner et al 2017 call for the continued use of data from established and long running sites such as bonriki kiribati or cocos keeling islands to develop exemplar investigations to inform groundwater management accounting for the specific conditions of individual atoll island settings here we present a study of the freshwater lens on the island of bonriki south tarawa kiribati enso cycles have a direct impact on the recharge to groundwater on the atoll australian bureau of meteorology and csiro 2011 the detailed long term monitoring data that have been collected for more than three decades provide a unique case study of lens behaviour under the influence of variable recharge and increased pumping stress the dataset includes measurements of groundwater salinity rainfall and evaporation pumping records and pumped water salinity sinclair et al 2015 in terms of size measured by its maximum width 0 95 km bonriki is one of the larger islands in the pacific with 86 of 1035 islands 0 25 km being smaller stewart et al 2014 its geology i e thickness of the holocene sediment sediments changing from coral fragments on the ocean side to fine sand on the lagoon side and rainfall amount just like 886 out of 1035 islands 0 25 km bonriki falls in the 1500 mm year category of stewart et al 2014 are comparable to other islands the objective of the present study is to quantify the effect of recharge and abstraction on the freshwater lens of bonriki island because it is an exemplar system of dual aquifer carbonate islands worldwide werner et al 2017 dual aquifer carbonate islands are those in which holocene sands with a relatively low hydraulic conductivity overly more permeable pleistocene reef deposits vacher 2004 examples of similar islands include those in the majuro atoll marshall islands the cocos keeling islands diego garcia atoll as well as the lower florida keys and the bahamas a numerical model of variable density flow and solute transport was calibrated to reduce discrepancies between modelled and observed groundwater salinities the model was subsequently used to quantify the volumes and fluxes of fresh and saltwater to determine the long term fate of the freshwater lens following a similar approach to van loon and van lanen 2013 and knowling et al 2015 except in our case the model is a density dependent lens simulator the model was run for both natural and anthropogenic conditions to allow for the distinction of the impact of pumping from lens growth and shrinkage due to natural variations in recharge 2 study area the study area is the bonriki water reserve latitude 1 23 10 n longitude 173 8 50 e which forms part of the tarawa atoll in western kiribati fig 1 in the pacific region besides the bonriki freshwater lens the atoll s national water reserve includes the lens of buota island the lenses are the primary supply for the more than 56 000 residents 2015 census of south tarawa knso 2016 which experienced an annual 2 3 population growth rate between 2010 and 2015 the reticulated water system extends from buota and bonriki islands to some 30 km to the western island of betio fig 1 and provides potable water to at least 67 of south tarawa s population the topography is flat and the elevation of the land surface is generally between 2 and 4 m above mean sea level fig 2 presents an aerial depiction of the island with key water infrastructure labelled a water treatment plant and bonriki international airport are located centrally above the bonriki lens while residential areas occur around the lens fringes extensive vegetation primarily coconut trees otherwise covers the lens area the study area is bounded to the northeast by a tidal channel and a beach on a rock platform from which a reef flat extends into the ocean on the western side is the atoll s lagoon in which open water and sand flats with stands of mangrove alternate inland lakes occur in the northwestern corner of the reserve wetlands in fig 2 an aquaculture facility has been constructed to the south of the water reserve as indicated by approximately east west oriented saltwater ponds in fig 2 tarawa atoll is located in the hot humid tropical zone that extends over much of the equatorial pacific ocean and is influenced by the southeast trade winds for most of the year falkland 1992 falkland and woodroffe 2004 it is outside the area of cyclonic activity and enso cycles strongly affect the climate and in particular the rainfall burgess 1987 the southern oscillation index and tarawa s annual rainfall are strongly correlated white et al 2007 daily rainfall data are available from the meteorological station on betio from 1947 to the present the dry season generally occurs from may to november while the wet season is from december to april the average annual rainfall at betio from january 1947 to december 2013 was 1998 mm daily rainfall has also been recorded at bonriki airport since 2009 the rainfall on bonriki is on average 6 less than that on betio galvis rodriguez et al 2017 falkland 1992 estimated the potential evapotranspiration at the betio station from average monthly pan evaporation data measured between 1981 and 1991 the mean pan evaporation rate was 6 15 mm d with a minimum of 5 5 mm d in july and a maximum of 6 9 mm d in september and october thirty six boreholes have been drilled on bonriki sinclair et al 2015 geological profiles based on lithological descriptions of samples from these boreholes show that the subsurface can be divided into a holocene and an underlying pleistocene unit as illustrated in fig 3 the pleistocene limestone comprises skeletal wackestones and packstones that are sometimes fractured dunham 1962 jacobson and taylor 1981 karstification of the limestone occurred during sea level lowstands in glacial periods and consequently the topography of the limestone s palaeo surface is highly irregular limestone occurs at an elevation between approximately 12 m and 20 m below mean sea level and is unconformably covered by holocene granular deposits falkland and woodroffe 2004 jacobson and taylor 1981 the latter consist of i unconsolidated sand and gravel near the lagoon ii poorly cemented hard coral fragments inland and iii consolidated coral deposits at depth and towards the ocean side fig 3 there is a pronounced demarcation between the hydraulic properties of the holocene and pleistocene units of bonriki island falkland and woodroffe 2004 the hydraulic conductivity k of the holocene sediments varies from 5 to 20 m d whereas the k of the pleistocene limestone tends to increase with depth it ranges between 10 k 20 m d near the boundary with the holocene sediments to k 100 m d at greater depth falkland and woodroffe 2004 jacobson and taylor 1981 the salinity monitoring network on bonriki currently consists of 23 boreholes equipped with multi level observation wells fig 2 but this number has varied in time sinclair et al 2015 measurements of electrical conductivity ec from these wells are available from as early as 1980 although the bulk of the data was collected after the year 2000 the measurements have demonstrated the existence of fresh to brackish groundwater up to 25 m deep falkland 1992 sinclair et al 2015 as illustrated by the ec contour lines in the cross sections of fig 3 the high k of the pleistocene limestone enhances the mixing of freshwater and seawater and consequently a broad transition zone exists in this unit jacobson and taylor 1981 white et al 2008 the high rate of mixing in the pleistocene limestone largely restricts the presence of potable freshwater to the holocene strata sinclair et al 2015 fig 2 shows the location of the 21 currently operating horizontal collector wells commonly referred to as infiltration galleries utilization of the lens started at rates less than 100 m3 d in the mid 1970s with the installation of the first infiltration galleries mather 1973 wagner 1977 since then estimates of the sustainable yield have been updated a number of times and the capacity of the water supply system has expanded the chronology of the studies and the annual volumes of groundwater abstracted are summarised in fig 4 the water table occurs at up to 1 5 m above mean sea level sinclair et al 2015 fluctuations of the water table of up to 0 5 m occur in response to the tide in the lagoon and ocean making it difficult to ascertain long term water level trends from manual readings due to the heterogeneous nature of the subsurface the tidal fluctuations do not follow a systematic spatial pattern which is generally the case for atoll islands white and falkland 2010 3 numerical model 3 1 model setup seawat version 4 langevin et al 2008 was used to develop a transient flow and solute transport model seawat couples modflow and mt3dms to simulate variable density groundwater flow and solute transport and has been verified and used widely for simulating seawater intrusion the conceptual model for the numerical groundwater model was based on all aforementioned hydrogeological information and is depicted as a three dimensional block diagram in fig 5 the diagram includes a simplified geological setting and shows the dual nature of the aquifer system that results from the holocene sediments overlaying the pleistocene karstified limestone a transient model simulation was set up for the period 1 january 1948 to 30 june 2014 using monthly stress periods 798 in total the model covers an area of about 9 5 km2 and extends from the fishponds in the southeast to the channel between bonriki and buota in the west an aerial view of the model grid is given in fig 6 the model domain has a width of 2 8 km between the lagoon and the ocean northeast to southwest and a length of 3 4 km in a southeast to northwest direction below the ocean and the lagoon the model extends offshore to a distance of at least 100 m from the shoreline to minimize the influence of the aquifer truncation at the lateral boundaries on the prediction of the lens behaviour the finite difference grid was rotated in order to minimize the number of cells the model had 33 rows 52 columns and 36 layers with 58 678 active cells the layer thickness varied between 0 5 m for layer two to 25 m for the three deepest layers the thickness of the first layer varied according to the surface topography table s1 of the electronic supplementary material esm presents additional key metrics of the model s discretization 3 2 boundary conditions and stresses 3 2 1 boundary conditions specified heads were assigned to cells that sit below the ocean reef flat and or reef slope or the lagoon depending on the bathymetry cells of which the centre node was elevated above the ocean or lagoon floor were made inactive and only the cells in the first active layer were assigned specified heads except at the outer boundaries of the model grid where the heads were specified in all active model layers a saltwater head equal to mean sea level was assigned to all of the specified head cells the concentration of the specified head cells was allowed to vary during the simulations groundwater exiting the active region of the model domain carried the model calculated salt content of a boundary cell whereas water entering into the active domain was assigned the total dissolved solids tds concentration of seawater specified head cells were also assigned to the cells in model layer 1 in the fish ponds area see fig 6 cells in the topmost layer on the island were assigned a specified flux that varied in time depending on the calculated recharge rate see section 3 2 1 the tds concentration of the recharge was made dependent on the recharge rate to allow for the effect of evapotranspiration on the solute concentrations for recharge rates higher than 100 mm month the recharge tds was 0 31 kg m3 between 50 and 100 mm month the tds was 0 38 kg m3 and between 0 and 50 mm month the tds was 0 45 kg m3 recharge tds values were set to accord with shallow groundwater salinities and taking into account the higher evapo concentration of lower recharge rates 3 2 2 groundwater recharge the recharge was estimated using the water balance model watbal falkland 1992 falkland and woodroffe 2004 the program uses input time series of daily rainfall and evaporation and solves the following equation 1 r p e δ v where r is recharge p is rainfall e is evapotranspiration and δv is the change in storage within the soil moisture zone all quantities are expressed in units of mm d surface runoff was neglected because of the high infiltration capacity of the soils the flat topography and the lack of surface flow features on the island the evapotranspiration term includes evaporation from the soil surface transpiration by vegetation including from both soil water and groundwater and the interception of rainfall by tree canopies other features of the code are described by falkland 1992 alam et al 2002 and falkland and woodroffe 2004 for the input time series of p the rainfall on bonriki was used in this study see fig s1 of the esm which applying the aforementioned 6 correction factor was determined from the rainfall measured at betio between 1947 and 2009 for the period 2009 june 2014 the measured values at bonriki were used the evaporation was based on the monthly pan evaporation values reported by falkland 1992 other input parameters for the watbal code are listed in table s2 of the esm daily net recharge values from watbal modelling were aggregated into monthly totals for use in the groundwater model the average recharge produced by watbal was approximately 57 of the mean rainfall rate of 1887 mm year this can be compared to an estimated 11 of 847 mm year for kiribati s christmas island for the same degree of coconut tree cover but falkland and woodroffe 2004 considered this value to be an underestimate since monthly rainfall averages were used instead of daily values percentages for three of the cocos keeling islands were calculated to be 29 44 and 49 of 1950 mm year of rainfall for a coconut tree land cover fraction of 0 8 0 15 and 0 respectively for the period 1953 1993 falkland and woodroffe 2004 for this case the difference with bonriki island is mainly due to a higher soil zone thickness in the model of the cocos keeling islands 500 mm vs the 300 mm adopted for our study with our watbal parameters arguably being well constrained by detailed recharge studies conducted at bonriki by white et al 2002 on average evapotranspiration losses were partitioned into canopy interception 8 of rainfall and evapotranspiration from shallow and deep rooted vegetation 32 and 3 of rainfall respectively recharge was applied in the spatially distributed zones shown in fig 6 the values directly from the watbal model were used across most of the island zone 1 fig 6 whereas modifications were made for hydrogeological features in some areas that were not included in watbal calculations for example no recharge was applied to cells beneath the airstrip zone 5 while the cells adjacent to it were assigned a 50 higher recharge to account for the runoff from the tarmac zone 2 in zone 4 recharge was 40 lower than the watbal values to account for the presence of the reef flat rock which is thought to restrict recharge to the more permeable holocene sediments in combination with the higher density of deep rooted vegetation that are thought to tap directly into the groundwater galvis rodriguez et al 2017 sinclair et al 2015 in this zone a subdued response of the water level to rainfall was observed in comparison to the other parts of the lens reserve sinclair et al 2015 no recharge was applied where there is open water i e ocean lagoon fish ponds see fig 6 except at the wetlands zone 3 where the recharge rate was calculated as the rainfall minus the open water evaporation rate which was calculated by taking the pan evaporation values falkland 1992 multiplied by 0 7 negative recharge can occur during dry months in all zones except zone 5 in the wetlands zone 3 this occurs when evaporation exceeds precipitation while in zones 1 2 and 4 this occurs when groundwater usage by deep rooted vegetation exceeds the recharge to the water table from the soil zone 3 2 3 groundwater abstraction abstraction rates have been recorded regularly by kiribati s public utilities board pub since 1998 during the present study it was found that the flowmeters that were used to monitor the abstraction rates since 2004 were overestimating the abstracted volume due to improper installation based on a validation of the flowmeters in 2015 it was estimated that the actual flow rate is 18 lower than the recorded rates at the main trunk feeding into the water treatment plant loco 2017 the overestimation of flow rates at individual galleries was estimated to range from 6 5 at gallery 13 to 42 1 at gallery 21 based on these findings the recorded flow rates were adjusted revised rates are given in fig 4 in what follows reference to abstraction rates implies the corrected values the infiltration galleries were implemented in the model by assigning abstraction rates to the cells in the uppermost layer of the model grid that coincide with the location of the galleries monthly abstraction rates were assigned based on the values reported by pub corrected for the aforementioned flowmeter discrepancies the reported total abstraction rate for each well was equally apportioned to the model cells by dividing it by the number of cells that represent an infiltration gallery no measured abstraction rates are available for the period january 1987 to november 1998 and only a best estimate can be adopted based on published reports e g falkland 1992 therefore a constant abstraction rate of 850 m3 day was used in the model distributed between the 18 galleries existing at the time pumping rates were less than 100 m3 d before 1987 and since no detailed information about this period exists and the abstraction rates are small no pumping was simulated in the model prior to january 1987 to ascertain the degree to which changes in the freshwater lens volume are due to abstraction of groundwater or due to the rainfall conditions a model without groundwater abstraction was run more precisely in the model without abstraction pumping rates were reduced by a factor of 1000 so that the salinities at the pumping galleries could still be easily evaluated and compared to the model with abstraction in addition simulations with scaled abstraction rates with otherwise the same stresses and parameters were run to evaluate the long term behaviour of the lens under reduced rates of groundwater withdrawal specifically we sought to explore the level of pumping at which the lens would recover to natural conditions i e in the absence of pumping during high rainfall periods three additional scenarios were considered in which scaled abstraction rates were 75 50 and 25 of the abstraction rates used in the calibration simulation i e as listed in fig 4 3 3 model calibration the total simulation time was subdivided into a calibration period subsequent to 1 january 1997 and a validation period from 1 january 1948 to 31 december 1996 calibrated parameters were the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities kh kv porosity n and dispersivity horizontal longitudinal αl vertical longitudinal αv and transverse αt unique kh and kv values were assigned to the holocene sediments and upper and lower pleistocene layers whereas n and αl αt αv were the same for all layers previous studies e g alam et al 2002 that employed two dimensional cross sectional models provided initial estimates of these parameters calibration was undertaken using manual trial and error due to the run times around 3 5 h the initial heads and concentrations for the transient model were determined from the heads and concentrations after the final time step of the model with the updated calibration parameters but without abstraction since no data are available at the model starting time 1 january 1948 and no information is available about the antecedent recharge rates this is a somewhat arbitrary modelling choice however given the high permeability and small scale of the model the initial conditions have little effect on the final outcome for the period of main interest i e the post 1986 abstraction period ec values were available at the 22 multi level monitoring wells and for the 22 abstraction galleries totalling 6708 salinity data points during the calibration period measurement of the ec of abstraction galleries started in 1977 but regular readings from individual galleries have only been available since 2006 the ec of the water from the treatment plant representing the mixed water from all the galleries before it is fed into the trunk main pipeline is also available for comparison with the modelled tds concentrations the measured ec values in units of ms cm were converted to tds in units of kg m3 by multiplying by 0 72 the ec tds conversion was obtained from comparison between ec and tds where water chemistry data were available galvis rodriguez et al 2017 the concentrations of the multi level observation wells were compared to the model calculated concentrations in the cells corresponding to the location and depth of the measurement point the modelled concentrations of the cells corresponding to the abstraction galleries were used to calculate a flux weighted average concentration which could be compared to the measured values of the abstracted water from each gallery and from all galleries combined 3 4 output variables the modelled concentrations were used to determine the volume of the freshwater lens v f which was calculated by summing the saturated volume of all model cells in which the electrical conductivity was less than 2 5 ms cm at the end of each stress period the difference between the modelled freshwater lens volume without abstraction v f na and with abstraction v f a was δv f v f na v f a the difference between the freshwater volume between two consecutive stress periods was δv f v f sp v f sp 1 where sp in the subscript indicates the stress period number note that δv f is positive negative when the lens is growing shrinking the total abstracted volume of groundwater since the start of pumping on 1 january 1987 was defined as 2 v abs t o t 1 n q a i δ t i where q a i is the volumetric abstraction rate for month i m3 d and δti is the length of month i in days 28 δti 31 the total number of months in the simulation was n 798 the model results were compared to the 12 month percentile rainfall ranking r 12 which is used as a drought index in kiribati s water management and drought response plans e g white et al 2008 r 12 was calculated for each month by first summing the month s rainfall and that of the preceding 11 months this summed total was then ranked relative to other 12 month sums that include the same month sequence e g february to january may to april october to september etc within the simulation period january 1948 june 2014 thus an r 12 value of 100 means that the previous 12 months were wetter than any other 12 month period with the same start and end months 4 results 4 1 calibration results fig 7 shows the comparison of the salinities of the multi level observation wells with the modelled salinities for the calibration and validation periods the final root mean square error rmse was 3 58 kg m3 during the calibration period and 3 45 kg m3 during the validation period this represents scaled rmse barnett et al 2012 values of 10 2 and 9 9 respectively indicating an acceptable level of model measurement mismatch for the proposed application of the model particularly given the heterogeneous nature of the island s subsurface the high temporal dynamics and the manual approach to model calibration there are few previous attempts at physically based simulation of island lenses with which to compare our calibration statistics a comparable study is the modelling of kish island persian gulf by ataie ashtiani et al 2013 who produced a scaled rmse i e modelled versus measured salinity of 21 albeit their salinity data set was considerably smaller than that available for bonriki island the initial and calibrated parameters are shown in table 1 hydraulic conductivity values generally increased during the calibration process because the initial simulations underestimated concentrations i e overestimated lens thickness significant changes to transport parameters were required to improve the simulation of the freshwater seawater transition zone location and thickness including a reduction in αl to 0 8 m and an increase in porosity to 30 cross sectional depictions of the calibrated model s salinity predictions are presented in fig 3 with comparison to observed values the model matches reasonably well the geometry of the freshwater lens for both the pre abstraction validation period e g may 1985 fig 3a and after 27 years of abstraction e g june 2014 fig 3b the model s ability to recreate temporal salinity variations at the multi level observation wells was an important performance criterion given the use of the monitoring network in management decision making the transience of freshwater lens salinities is shown for bn27 on cross section a a and bn11 located near galleries 16 and 17 in fig 8 the vertical position of the ec 2 5 10 and 25 ms cm lines are represented fig 8 shows that the elevations of measured ec levels are reproduced by the model to within only a few metres whereas the temporal trends in the elevation of ec isolines are matched reasonably well by the model salinity contours exhibit highly dynamic vertical movements with displacements of 5 m occurring annually and long term changes of around 20 m recorded for the 2 5 ms cm ec contour water level responses to pumping and recharge over long timeframes are masked by tidal variations and are thus not particularly helpful for the calibration of the non tidal model of bonriki lens sinclair et al 2015 where water table changes have been observed the variation tends to be 1 m sinclair et al 2015 and thus changes to the storage of freshwater in bonriki island is associated more so with changes in the elevation of salinity rather than heads fig 9 illustrates measurements of the temporal variation in abstracted water ec with comparison to flow weighted mean ec values from the model the model appears to be underestimating the effect of the recharge variability on the temporal changes of salinity of the abstracted water prior to 2010 but after this variations in the pumped water salinity i e at the trunk main are closely matched by the model this is reflected by the value of the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is 0 02 for the entire period for which ec values at the trunk main were available march 1999 february 2014 but 0 83 for the period since january 2010 additional graphs extending the results shown in figs 8 and 9 are included in the esm figs s3 s60 to illustrate the comparison between model outcomes and salinity measurements at observation wells and pumping galleries in general the same patterns as evident in the trunk main fig 9 are apparent for most of the individual galleries see esm figs s3 s24 4 2 historical trends fig 10 shows the development of v f with time for the model simulation period superimposed on abstraction recharge and r 12 trends the results demonstrate that v f is controlled by both recharge and pumping as expected v f displays temporal trends that reflect those of r 12 for the model simulation that neglects pumping the impact of abstraction is especially evident during the last 10 years of the pumping simulation when v f shows a declining trend punctuated by short periods of partial recovery in 2014 the volume of freshwater seems to have reached an all time low within the same period the modelled salinities at the trunk main and at the individual galleries see esm figs s3 s24 become increasingly sensitive to dry phases especially after 2008 these trends are consistent with the cross sectional depictions of the lens for may 1985 and june 2014 fig 3 which clearly reveal that the lens has shrunk considerably since pumping began climate influences on the two lens snapshots i e 1985 and 2014 can be ascertained by considering respective r 12 values for the period may 1984 to april 1985 r 12 ranged between 15 and 42 while for june 2013 to may 2014 it ranged between 28 and 52 so while the rainfall during the one year period before june 2014 was higher than during the year leading up to may 1985 the freshwater volume was markedly lower the difference is therefore attributable to abstraction consistent with the significant difference in v f between simulations with and without abstraction fig 10 in the absence of pumping a decreasing trend in v f is also apparent for the period 2004 2014 although the rate of decline is rather subdued and the final value of v f for the no pumping case is within the range of values calculated during the previous time sequence i e 1948 2004 fig 10 an improved interpretation of the lens evolution is possible by plotting δv f versus v abs tot as given in fig 11 the intention here is to explore the key water balance elements that lead to the lens reduction shown in the previous figures blue bars are added to fig 11 to indicate periods when r 12 75 i e sequences of very high rainfall at the onset of the pumping period i e 1987 δv f shows an increasing trend which is due to the lens adjusting to the introduction of abstraction δv f subsequently falls during 1990 1995 due to above average rainfall despite continued abstraction throughout this time the declining trend in δv f indicates that the lens volume was being replenished following depletion during the prior period i e 1987 1990 however complete replenishment was not achieved i e δv f 0 fig 11 in the years following 1995 δv f increases almost monotonically with exception of the 2002 2004 wet period from fig 11 it can also be seen that by mid 2014 when 11 106 m3 of groundwater had been abstracted since 1987 δv f was almost 3 106 m3 this latter amount was taken from the store of freshwater that would have been available under natural conditions the rest of the nearly 11 106 m3 of abstracted groundwater represents captured freshwater discharge that would otherwise have been lost to the sea on the basis that gross recharge to the aquifer is independent of abstraction effects in the model fig 12 presents the δv f results of models with scaled abstraction rates fig 12a shows δv f behaviour as a function of time as expected lower abstraction rates lead to diminished depletion of the freshwater lens however the freshwater lens is not returned to its natural condition is any of the cases and only the 25 scenario shows extended periods of almost stable values i e independent of time of δv f after 2005 upward trends in fig 12a indicate that the lens volume has not yet reached a new equilibrium condition even where the pumping is reduced to as low as 25 of historical values the final values of δv f at the end of the simulations are displayed on the right hand side of fig 12a and as fractions of that from the calibration simulation i e 2 90 106 m3 fig 12a equate to 70 43 and 20 for the 75 50 and 25 scaled abstraction scenarios respectively this means that for reduced abstraction rates δv f is proportionally lower relative to v abs tot by extension a pumping rate at which δv f 0 would likely be around 5 of historical pumping rates given roughly consistent difference between δv f v abs tot 100 and scaled abstraction rates as above fig 12b is a similar graph to fig 11 but includes the results of models with reduced abstraction rates the lines follow approximately similar trajectories indicating that the gradient δv f v abs tot is not particularly sensitive to the abstraction rate in other words lower rates of abstraction lead to delayed contraction of the lens with the level of depletion being similar to that of higher abstraction rates except at a later time specifically as lens depletion appears to be mainly dependent on v abs tot fig 12b scaling the abstraction rate leads to an approximately inversely proportionate delay in the timing of lens depletion e g halving the abstraction rate leads to roughly doubling of the time before a particular level of lens depletion occurs one might expect though that quasi steady state conditions i e changes in v f in time become dependent only on changes in recharge with no further reduction due to pumping become established for the 25 scenario before the scenarios with the higher abstraction rates but the simulation period considered apparently was not yet long enough for this to become manifest fig 13 contains a comparison of monthly flow rates of recharge q r and net coastal discharge q coast for the entire model q r represents the integrated recharge through the top of the model domain while q coast is the integrated net inflow through specified head cells representing the ocean and lagoon floors negative values of q coast indicate that fresh groundwater is discharging to the ocean and lagoon i e submarine groundwater discharge sgd exceeds seawater influx to the aquifer whereas positive values indicate that sgd is less than the seawater influx and therefore the aquifer is accumulating seawater the colour of the data points reflects the value of δv f positive values indicate lens growth in accordance with the scale of the colour bar the general downward sloping trend of the data points in fig 13 shows that the outflow to the lagoon and ocean is high when recharge is high as expected for the small size and high permeability of bonriki island conversely when recharge is low there is the possibility of significant net inflows of seawater to the aquifer i e positive q coast events more so when abstraction is included in the model compare fig 13a and b the relatively narrow band of data points around the 1 1 line suggests that a the rate of net seaward discharge is closely linked to recharge rates and b q coast and recharge trends are approximately concomitant because significant time lags would be expected to widen the data cluster data points above the 1 1 line in fig 13 indicate that net discharge to the sea is less than net recharge i e q coast q r whereas data points below the 1 1 line identify periods when net seaward discharge exceeds recharge i e q coast q r the former situation tends to occur more so under the highest recharge rates i e as a result of freshwater lens growth and when abstraction is considered i e seawater discharge is reduced by pumping the latter situation i e q coast q r is more prevalent in the absence of abstraction and during low recharge periods because these conditions particularly in combination are associated with sgd that persists during periods of low rainfall through losses to the lens freshwater storage both situations are associated with time lags between recharge events and responses in sgd periods of lens contraction indicated by yellow to red symbols i e δv f 0 in fig 13 occur predominantly under conditions of net outflow through the coastal boundary q coast 0 that is despite that net recharge exceeds extraction causing coastal outflow of freshwater the lens declines most of the yellow symbols in fig 13a i e δv f 0 occur at q r values of around 2500 m3 d i e a flux of 1 7 mm d based on the island s area of 1 47 km2 whereas in fig 13b they occur mostly around 4000 m3 d 2 7 mm d the difference between these numbers is roughly equal to the mean abstraction rate since 2006 moreover under conditions of no abstraction positive values of q coast occur only when q r 0 whereas with abstraction this becomes when q r 1500 m3 d approximately this is the intuitive consequence of less sgd or more seawater intrusion under the abstraction regime than under no abstraction conditions for the same amount of recharge we can also interpret from this that recharge rates of approximately 2500 m3 d plus the total rate of pumping are required for stable lens conditions on bonriki island inspection of figs 8 10 show that recharge commonly falls below this threshold for significant periods of time over the available rainfall record leading to lens contractions that are further evident from increases in measured and modelled ec values fig 10 5 discussion the strong dependency of bonriki island s freshwater volume and the pumped water salinity on recharge rates are in accordance with findings from other freshwater lens systems on atoll islands bailey et al 2014 van der velde et al 2006 this temporal variability is captured reasonably well by the numerical model albeit our assessment of the calibration fit is largely subjective the calibration result and the use of model input parameters that fall within expected values lead us to conclude that the model is an adequate tool for exploring lens behaviour including under various abstraction scenarios our application of the model provides new insights into the lens that are important for both management decision making and for understanding the physical processes that occur within atoll island settings for example the importance of pumping is evident from the comparison between model simulations with and without abstraction wells this adds to previous studies of pumping impacts that adopt similar strategies except using density independent groundwater models e g knowling et al 2015 indeed climate drivers alone are unable to explain the lens thinning and shallow groundwater salinity increases that have become apparent in the field data over the last two decades therefore trends of lens contraction are primarily caused by the exploitation of fresh groundwater and not by changing recharge conditions the numerical model presented here is comparable to that of the freshwater lens on home island of the south keeling atoll by ghassemi et al 2000 in terms of hydrogeological conditions spatial scale and data availability ghassemi et al 2000 stated that their modelling exercise failed and although they did not did not define criteria for calibration success they concluded calibration could not be achieved which they attributed to the karstic nature of the system they did not show the differences between measured and modelled concentrations for their entire dataset so it is impossible to make a direct quantitative comparison between the performance of the bonriki model and their model yet although the bonriki model also shows some significant deviations between the measured and modelled configuration of the freshwater lens at individual observation wells see figs 3 7 and 8 and esm figs s25 s60 as well as for the salinities of some of the galleries see esm figs s3 s24 we contend that a more optimistic conclusion about the usefulness of numerical models to simulate freshwater lenses in atoll environments is warranted indeed given the karstic nature of the system it is unlikely that a high degree of model accuracy can be achieved no matter how comprehensive the dataset and calibration effort moreover a numerical model should not be expected to be able to accurately forecast salinities at individual pumping wells as has been found for coastal aquifer models more generally e g sanford and pope 2010 werner et al 2013 despite such limitations though the bonriki model was useful in analysing long term trends of the volume of the freshwater resource and in distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic impacts this ability makes the model an important instrument to support the sustainable management of water supply and serves as a benchmark for atoll island investigation under natural conditions decreases in lens volume occur i during periods of low or negative recharge when the coastal discharge of freshwater exceeds net recharge and ii when freshwater losses due to mixing of freshwater and seawater within the aquifer due to hydrodynamic dispersion exceed the difference between freshwater inflows and losses these processes combine to create complex relationships between the volume of fresh groundwater and sgd and recharge as demonstrated by the spread of data points representing δv f 0 in fig 13a abstraction influences the aforementioned factors controlling lens volume potentially enhancing dispersive effects and raising the recharge threshold at which the lens volume can increase as described in the previous section both modelled and measured salinity trends indicate that significant increases in lens volume are apparent only when high recharge rates are sustained over periods of several months or more fig 10 surprisingly storage increases during sustained recharge events are generally similar with or without abstraction effects leading to a somewhat linear relationship between lens volume and v abs tot which is largely independent of the abstraction rate i e fig 12b in a similar manner q r and q coast are correlated at the one month temporal resolution of the model fig 13 this means that a large fraction of the recharge is probably lost to sgd within one month or less this finding is consistent with that of jocson et al 2002 who analysed the relationship between water level and recharge for the northern guam lens aquifer and argued that it was likely that high recharge rates would cause a rapid increase of the flow of groundwater to the sea the median ratio of the yearly volumetric abstraction rate over the yearly volumetric recharge rate during the period 2004 2014 was 36 the median abstraction rate over the same period was 1526 m3 d which is below the 1660 m3 d currently considered to be the sustainable rate fig 4 nonetheless the bonriki freshwater lens appears to be in a state of decline this is apparent from the virtually linear shrinkage of the freshwater volume attributable to pumping since 2004 fig 12 cross sections showing the change in lens geometry between 1985 and 2014 fig 3 support this assertion moreover the salinities of the abstracted water are becoming increasingly sensitive to droughts as evidenced towards the end of the simulation period fig 9 and esm figs s3 s24 that is the salinities rise after a series of dry months but do not completely recover to pre drought levels during the following wet phase in the model scenario without abstraction the salinity of the groundwater at the location of the abstraction galleries shows hardly any variability with time fig 9 these results indicate that abstraction is causing thinning of the freshwater lens in a thick lens the volume of freshwater varies with time as recharge conditions vary but this hardly affects the salinities of the abstracted groundwater as the saltwater at depth does not reach the galleries under the current pumping regime however thinning of the freshwater lens has brought saltwater closer to the galleries subsequently some of the abstraction galleries collect brackish water during dry periods causing a marked rise in salinity at specific locations the model calculated freshwater volumes indicate that v f 4 3 106 m3 at the end of the simulation period in june 2014 whereas on average it was v f 7 7 106 m3 prior to pumping in 1987 which means that almost half of the volume of freshwater 3 4 106 m3 has been lost this is because of mixing by hydrodynamic dispersion and a decrease of the freshwater storage by both lowering of the water table and rising salinity during periods of low recharge as discussed in the previous section under groundwater abstraction conditions the recharge rate required to cause the freshwater lens to grow becomes higher than under natural conditions fig 10 provides initial evidence that supports the application of r 12 as an approximate and informative indicator of v f attributable to climatic conditions in the absence of pumping this is an important finding given that lens volumes in islands and coastal areas more broadly are challenging to determine based on ec measurements and ascertaining the climate induced lens performance using only field data is almost impossible water levels are also a poor indicator of lens conditions as they do not reflect the volume of freshwater lost from an aquifer when the loss is partially compensated by seawater intrusion morgan et al 2012 moreover the r 12 parameter is easy to calculate if rainfall records are available and less cumbersome to implement than the time series models by van der velde et al 2006 which are based on a convolution integral that also captures the antecedent rainfall conditions but in a less intuitive way the results of our study indicate that lens contraction caused by abstraction is a multi decadal process that is superimposed on natural variations and can become almost independent of climate drivers figs 11 and 12a while under natural conditions and during the early stages of abstraction shallow groundwater salinities and r 12 are essentially independent they become more strongly correlated at later times fig 9 this is apparent from the intensified fluctuations of the water salinity at the trunk main a result of the freshwater lens becoming thinner that follow the changes of r 12 therefore we suggest caution in the use of r 12 as a general indicator of the health of the bonriki groundwater system under the current stressed conditions since abstraction effects lead to relations between r 12 and v f as well as between r 12 and abstraction water salinity that do not remain fixed for management purposes it can thus be misleading to rely on r 12 only because salinities of the abstracted water in a thinned lens will start to show a stronger response to climatic variations and the evolution of these relationships unfortunately can not be easily predicted collecting rainfall measurements and other weather data is nonetheless critically important as is taking regular salinity measurements as this study has shown the response times of the lens even in permeable small scale lens systems like bonriki island make that monitoring needs to be sustained over many decades in order to fully capture the abstraction impacts while the salinities of the water abstracted from the galleries appear to respond stronger to droughts during recent years there are currently no immediate issues with the salinity of the water supply nevertheless the observed trends call for a reappraisal of the management strategies of the freshwater lens several options could be considered the pumping rates for individual galleries could be adjusted in such a way that those least sensitive to salinization pump more than those of which the salinity rises rapidly during dry phases however the long term effects of this strategy should be investigated moreover given the high water usage of the deep rooted palm trees vegetation management could be adopted that considers the trade off between the value of the trees for sustenance and environmental functioning and their negative impact on the lens through evapotranspiration withdrawals finally and importantly a salinity trigger level approach is considered important in providing early warning for a management response to preserve fresh groundwater and minimise the adverse effects of seawater intrusion when there are reduced inputs of recharge the threshold of 2500 m3 d plus abstraction devised in this study may serve as a management trigger in future water policy development the current trend of lens thinning may require water saving measures and alternative sources of freshwater to be identified which could include harvested rainwater or desalinated seawater 6 conclusions this study investigated the long term effects of pumping on a freshwater lens on an atoll island bonriki island tarawa atoll kiribati based on a comprehensive data set of meteorological geological and groundwater data a numerical model was constructed which was used to infer the development of the freshwater volume and the water balance components for the island between 1 january 1948 and 30 june 2014 abstraction was simulated during the last 27 5 years of the simulation i e since 1 january 1987 the results clearly show that under natural conditions the freshwater volume is subject to significant changes that are driven by the rainfall intensity by comparing model simulations with and without abstraction the effect of abstraction could be isolated from these natural variations in freshwater volume this showed that abstraction causes sustained contraction of the lens over the 27 5 years of pumping considered in this study the rate of decline of the freshwater volume did not show abatement over time which means that the freshwater volume has not yet reached a new equilibrium with respect to the pumping stresses this is the case even for hypothetical scaled abstraction scenarios where the pumping is reduced as low as 25 of historical values our finding that lens adjustment to the abstraction stresses spans a period of nearly three decades means that numerical simulations for the assessment of sustainable yield must be based on timescales of several decades even for small and permeable islands like bonriki island the efforts to monitor groundwater and abstraction water salinities over several decades have been proven essential in assessing the state of the freshwater resource reliance on drought indices like the r 12 used on tarawa is appropriate under unstressed conditions or for low abstraction rates but as thinning of the lens continues and shallow groundwater salinities become more variable with time the relationship between r 12 and abstraction water salinity is no longer fixed caution is therefore required to rely on such indicators to assess the health of the freshwater reserve because of its size and rainfall rates the bonriki freshwater lens is relatively resilient compared to other islands and this thus holds in particular for smaller islands with less recharge further work has to focus on management options for groundwater abstraction on bonriki island and a re evaluation of the appropriate sustainable yield amongst a range of options trigger level approaches based on salinity must be considered which will be the subject of future studies acknowledgements this study resulted

7059,groundwater on islands occurs in the form of freshwater lenses that serve as an important water resource for local inhabitants these lenses are highly vulnerable to salinization due to natural recharge variations and groundwater abstraction determining the sustainable yield from freshwater lenses is challenging because the lens response during drought periods and the long term effects of pumping are both difficult to predict the exceptionally detailed and long data record for bonriki island of the tarawa atoll kiribati made it possible to develop a three dimensional variable density model of the island field data and modelling results highlight the strong control of rainfall variability and pumping on the temporal dynamics of the freshwater lens the model reproduces the salinity observations in both monitoring and pumping wells reasonably well and provides a rare example of physically based island simulation based on an extensive data set it enables the analysis of freshwater volume and fluxes of submarine groundwater discharge which is impossible based on the field observations alone under natural as well as abstraction conditions submarine groundwater discharge responds rapidly and almost proportionally to recharge theoretical model scenarios with scaled abstraction rates show that lens contraction caused by pumping is a nearly linear function of the total pumped volume whereby the abstraction rate and the timing of depletion are approximately inversely proportional modelling indicates that when monthly recharge inputs fall below around 2500 m3 d i e a flux of 1 7 mm d plus the abstraction rate the lens tends to contract thus despite the highly distributed and extensive abstraction network on bonriki island a significant amount of recharge is eventually lost to submarine groundwater discharge the long term freshwater storage trend indicates that bonriki island s lens is still contracting after 27 5 years of pumping and lens thinning is threatening to impact the water supply salinity this means that even permeable small islands like bonriki may take at least two decades to realise new equilibrium conditions that reflect pumping stresses which is an important consideration in assessing the sustainable yield of small islands in particular those less resilient to pumping than bonriki keywords fresh groundwater lens salinity small islands kiribati atoll island water management 1 introduction water resource availability and sustainable management practices are recurring issues on islands in particular for the small island developing states sids a group of 52 developing countries on low lying carbonate and volcanic islands that share similar sustainable development challenges unesco 2016 the sids are faced with the need to secure reliable freshwater supplies despite increased climate variability sea level rise and in many locations population growth white and falkland 2012 allen et al 2014 on small islands rainwater and groundwater are the primary natural sources of water supply illangasekare et al 2006 liu et al 2006 groundwater on islands occurs in the form of freshwater lenses which necessitates a special form of management to mitigate the risk of salinization and other forms of anthropogenic contamination bailey et al 2010 white and falkland 2010 atoll and similar coral reef islands represent a specific subgroup of the broader category of small islands and have many common characteristics and management problems falkland 1991 the volume of freshwater stored within an atoll island depends on the balance between recharge from rainfall and losses through evapotranspiration discharge into the ocean and lagoon mixing with underlying seawater and groundwater abstraction for human use determination of the sustainable yield requires that these processes can be quantified including the transient nature of rainfall and the recharge generated from it in particular the response of the freshwater lens to droughts must be known as groundwater during these times becomes the primary or even the sole source of water supply white and falkland 2010 werner et al 2017 previous studies have shown that freshwater lenses respond to recharge events at timescales ranging from hours to months for example jones et al 2004 determined the response of a borehole salinity profile on grand cayman island to a heavy rainfall event and found that salinities decreased across the entire 12 m profile as early as 1 5 h after the storm lens behaviour over longer time scales for example in response to intra and inter annual variations in rainfall has been widely studied woodroffe and falkland 2004 showed how the base of the freshwater lens responded to recharge variation over an eight year period for two study sites in the cocos keeling islands they found that where the lens is bounded by the unconformity between holocene sediments and pleistocene limestone found at a maximum depth of 15 m below the ground surface fluctuations of the base of the lens with recharge tend to be more subdued than when the freshwater is contained principally within the holocene sediments nonetheless the effects of droughts lasting up to several months resulted in significant thinning of the lens in both cases van der velde et al 2006 found that the salinity of pumped freshwater on the island of tongatapu tonga fluctuated around its mean value in response to the el niño southern oscillation enso and that the southern oscillation index soi could be used to predict groundwater salinity with a lag time of 10 months they applied a time series model that was fitted to observed data by parameter optimization the method sometimes yielded parameter combinations representative of unrealistically long transit times between the point of infiltration and the well van der velde et al 2007 the response of small island freshwater lenses to changes in recharge has also been investigated using numerical models early studies underwood et al 1992 griggs and peterson 1993 showed that as expected the lens will decrease in thickness in response to a reduction in recharge comte et al 2014 highlighted the importance of vegetation which through its influence on groundwater recharge may exert a strong control on the thickness of the lens they found that reduced recharge due to transpiration promotes seawater intrusion but a feedback mechanism exists because the increased salinity affects the health of the vegetation which reduces transpiration and thus enhances recharge bailey et al 2014 used numerical simulations to infer the effect of variable rainfall on the thickness of freshwater lenses for atoll islands of the maldives their results showed that variations in lens thickness of up to 50 can occur but their simulations did not consider pumping and the hydraulic parameters were not varied between different islands a comprehensive calibrated model of home island part of the cocos keeling islands was produced by ghassemi et al 2000 the study highlighted the complications of modelling atoll island environments and the need for incorporation of system stresses at a temporal resolution of one month or less in order to capture the transient nature of the observed salinity variations based on a poor fit between model outcomes and field data the authors drew pessimistic conclusions about our capacity to model freshwater lens dynamics even if abundant field data are available holding and allen 2015 assessed the impact of reduced recharge due to climate change for andros island in the bahamas using a three dimensional model and concluded that this could lead to a loss of freshwater volume of up to 19 while the role of climate driven recharge variability in controlling lens behaviour has been well studied there are fewer investigations into the effect of pumping on lens dynamics in particular where historical trends and spatial variability in pumping are known and accounted for griggs and peterson 1993 conducted two dimensional numerical simulations of the freshwater lens for the laura area of the majuro atoll in the marshall islands they concluded that the sustainable yield is almost twice as high when infiltration galleries instead of vertical wells are used to abstract groundwater moreover they reported that for simulations with monthly averaged recharge a higher sustainable extraction was found than for yearly averaged recharge and that significant quantities of water could be abstracted from the lens during sustained periods of drought their simulations spanned a period of 3 years only though and were therefore not inclusive of multi decadal trends a need therefore remains for long term studies that investigate the combined effects of rainfall variability pumping and physical groundwater processes to better understand the resilience of island freshwater lenses against droughts and to guide management of the freshwater lens to ensure the supply of suitable quality water the multi decadal impact of abstraction on the freshwater volume in particular has not been investigated in detail previously even though this is crucial to the long term sustainability of island water supply systems furthermore werner et al 2017 call for the continued use of data from established and long running sites such as bonriki kiribati or cocos keeling islands to develop exemplar investigations to inform groundwater management accounting for the specific conditions of individual atoll island settings here we present a study of the freshwater lens on the island of bonriki south tarawa kiribati enso cycles have a direct impact on the recharge to groundwater on the atoll australian bureau of meteorology and csiro 2011 the detailed long term monitoring data that have been collected for more than three decades provide a unique case study of lens behaviour under the influence of variable recharge and increased pumping stress the dataset includes measurements of groundwater salinity rainfall and evaporation pumping records and pumped water salinity sinclair et al 2015 in terms of size measured by its maximum width 0 95 km bonriki is one of the larger islands in the pacific with 86 of 1035 islands 0 25 km being smaller stewart et al 2014 its geology i e thickness of the holocene sediment sediments changing from coral fragments on the ocean side to fine sand on the lagoon side and rainfall amount just like 886 out of 1035 islands 0 25 km bonriki falls in the 1500 mm year category of stewart et al 2014 are comparable to other islands the objective of the present study is to quantify the effect of recharge and abstraction on the freshwater lens of bonriki island because it is an exemplar system of dual aquifer carbonate islands worldwide werner et al 2017 dual aquifer carbonate islands are those in which holocene sands with a relatively low hydraulic conductivity overly more permeable pleistocene reef deposits vacher 2004 examples of similar islands include those in the majuro atoll marshall islands the cocos keeling islands diego garcia atoll as well as the lower florida keys and the bahamas a numerical model of variable density flow and solute transport was calibrated to reduce discrepancies between modelled and observed groundwater salinities the model was subsequently used to quantify the volumes and fluxes of fresh and saltwater to determine the long term fate of the freshwater lens following a similar approach to van loon and van lanen 2013 and knowling et al 2015 except in our case the model is a density dependent lens simulator the model was run for both natural and anthropogenic conditions to allow for the distinction of the impact of pumping from lens growth and shrinkage due to natural variations in recharge 2 study area the study area is the bonriki water reserve latitude 1 23 10 n longitude 173 8 50 e which forms part of the tarawa atoll in western kiribati fig 1 in the pacific region besides the bonriki freshwater lens the atoll s national water reserve includes the lens of buota island the lenses are the primary supply for the more than 56 000 residents 2015 census of south tarawa knso 2016 which experienced an annual 2 3 population growth rate between 2010 and 2015 the reticulated water system extends from buota and bonriki islands to some 30 km to the western island of betio fig 1 and provides potable water to at least 67 of south tarawa s population the topography is flat and the elevation of the land surface is generally between 2 and 4 m above mean sea level fig 2 presents an aerial depiction of the island with key water infrastructure labelled a water treatment plant and bonriki international airport are located centrally above the bonriki lens while residential areas occur around the lens fringes extensive vegetation primarily coconut trees otherwise covers the lens area the study area is bounded to the northeast by a tidal channel and a beach on a rock platform from which a reef flat extends into the ocean on the western side is the atoll s lagoon in which open water and sand flats with stands of mangrove alternate inland lakes occur in the northwestern corner of the reserve wetlands in fig 2 an aquaculture facility has been constructed to the south of the water reserve as indicated by approximately east west oriented saltwater ponds in fig 2 tarawa atoll is located in the hot humid tropical zone that extends over much of the equatorial pacific ocean and is influenced by the southeast trade winds for most of the year falkland 1992 falkland and woodroffe 2004 it is outside the area of cyclonic activity and enso cycles strongly affect the climate and in particular the rainfall burgess 1987 the southern oscillation index and tarawa s annual rainfall are strongly correlated white et al 2007 daily rainfall data are available from the meteorological station on betio from 1947 to the present the dry season generally occurs from may to november while the wet season is from december to april the average annual rainfall at betio from january 1947 to december 2013 was 1998 mm daily rainfall has also been recorded at bonriki airport since 2009 the rainfall on bonriki is on average 6 less than that on betio galvis rodriguez et al 2017 falkland 1992 estimated the potential evapotranspiration at the betio station from average monthly pan evaporation data measured between 1981 and 1991 the mean pan evaporation rate was 6 15 mm d with a minimum of 5 5 mm d in july and a maximum of 6 9 mm d in september and october thirty six boreholes have been drilled on bonriki sinclair et al 2015 geological profiles based on lithological descriptions of samples from these boreholes show that the subsurface can be divided into a holocene and an underlying pleistocene unit as illustrated in fig 3 the pleistocene limestone comprises skeletal wackestones and packstones that are sometimes fractured dunham 1962 jacobson and taylor 1981 karstification of the limestone occurred during sea level lowstands in glacial periods and consequently the topography of the limestone s palaeo surface is highly irregular limestone occurs at an elevation between approximately 12 m and 20 m below mean sea level and is unconformably covered by holocene granular deposits falkland and woodroffe 2004 jacobson and taylor 1981 the latter consist of i unconsolidated sand and gravel near the lagoon ii poorly cemented hard coral fragments inland and iii consolidated coral deposits at depth and towards the ocean side fig 3 there is a pronounced demarcation between the hydraulic properties of the holocene and pleistocene units of bonriki island falkland and woodroffe 2004 the hydraulic conductivity k of the holocene sediments varies from 5 to 20 m d whereas the k of the pleistocene limestone tends to increase with depth it ranges between 10 k 20 m d near the boundary with the holocene sediments to k 100 m d at greater depth falkland and woodroffe 2004 jacobson and taylor 1981 the salinity monitoring network on bonriki currently consists of 23 boreholes equipped with multi level observation wells fig 2 but this number has varied in time sinclair et al 2015 measurements of electrical conductivity ec from these wells are available from as early as 1980 although the bulk of the data was collected after the year 2000 the measurements have demonstrated the existence of fresh to brackish groundwater up to 25 m deep falkland 1992 sinclair et al 2015 as illustrated by the ec contour lines in the cross sections of fig 3 the high k of the pleistocene limestone enhances the mixing of freshwater and seawater and consequently a broad transition zone exists in this unit jacobson and taylor 1981 white et al 2008 the high rate of mixing in the pleistocene limestone largely restricts the presence of potable freshwater to the holocene strata sinclair et al 2015 fig 2 shows the location of the 21 currently operating horizontal collector wells commonly referred to as infiltration galleries utilization of the lens started at rates less than 100 m3 d in the mid 1970s with the installation of the first infiltration galleries mather 1973 wagner 1977 since then estimates of the sustainable yield have been updated a number of times and the capacity of the water supply system has expanded the chronology of the studies and the annual volumes of groundwater abstracted are summarised in fig 4 the water table occurs at up to 1 5 m above mean sea level sinclair et al 2015 fluctuations of the water table of up to 0 5 m occur in response to the tide in the lagoon and ocean making it difficult to ascertain long term water level trends from manual readings due to the heterogeneous nature of the subsurface the tidal fluctuations do not follow a systematic spatial pattern which is generally the case for atoll islands white and falkland 2010 3 numerical model 3 1 model setup seawat version 4 langevin et al 2008 was used to develop a transient flow and solute transport model seawat couples modflow and mt3dms to simulate variable density groundwater flow and solute transport and has been verified and used widely for simulating seawater intrusion the conceptual model for the numerical groundwater model was based on all aforementioned hydrogeological information and is depicted as a three dimensional block diagram in fig 5 the diagram includes a simplified geological setting and shows the dual nature of the aquifer system that results from the holocene sediments overlaying the pleistocene karstified limestone a transient model simulation was set up for the period 1 january 1948 to 30 june 2014 using monthly stress periods 798 in total the model covers an area of about 9 5 km2 and extends from the fishponds in the southeast to the channel between bonriki and buota in the west an aerial view of the model grid is given in fig 6 the model domain has a width of 2 8 km between the lagoon and the ocean northeast to southwest and a length of 3 4 km in a southeast to northwest direction below the ocean and the lagoon the model extends offshore to a distance of at least 100 m from the shoreline to minimize the influence of the aquifer truncation at the lateral boundaries on the prediction of the lens behaviour the finite difference grid was rotated in order to minimize the number of cells the model had 33 rows 52 columns and 36 layers with 58 678 active cells the layer thickness varied between 0 5 m for layer two to 25 m for the three deepest layers the thickness of the first layer varied according to the surface topography table s1 of the electronic supplementary material esm presents additional key metrics of the model s discretization 3 2 boundary conditions and stresses 3 2 1 boundary conditions specified heads were assigned to cells that sit below the ocean reef flat and or reef slope or the lagoon depending on the bathymetry cells of which the centre node was elevated above the ocean or lagoon floor were made inactive and only the cells in the first active layer were assigned specified heads except at the outer boundaries of the model grid where the heads were specified in all active model layers a saltwater head equal to mean sea level was assigned to all of the specified head cells the concentration of the specified head cells was allowed to vary during the simulations groundwater exiting the active region of the model domain carried the model calculated salt content of a boundary cell whereas water entering into the active domain was assigned the total dissolved solids tds concentration of seawater specified head cells were also assigned to the cells in model layer 1 in the fish ponds area see fig 6 cells in the topmost layer on the island were assigned a specified flux that varied in time depending on the calculated recharge rate see section 3 2 1 the tds concentration of the recharge was made dependent on the recharge rate to allow for the effect of evapotranspiration on the solute concentrations for recharge rates higher than 100 mm month the recharge tds was 0 31 kg m3 between 50 and 100 mm month the tds was 0 38 kg m3 and between 0 and 50 mm month the tds was 0 45 kg m3 recharge tds values were set to accord with shallow groundwater salinities and taking into account the higher evapo concentration of lower recharge rates 3 2 2 groundwater recharge the recharge was estimated using the water balance model watbal falkland 1992 falkland and woodroffe 2004 the program uses input time series of daily rainfall and evaporation and solves the following equation 1 r p e δ v where r is recharge p is rainfall e is evapotranspiration and δv is the change in storage within the soil moisture zone all quantities are expressed in units of mm d surface runoff was neglected because of the high infiltration capacity of the soils the flat topography and the lack of surface flow features on the island the evapotranspiration term includes evaporation from the soil surface transpiration by vegetation including from both soil water and groundwater and the interception of rainfall by tree canopies other features of the code are described by falkland 1992 alam et al 2002 and falkland and woodroffe 2004 for the input time series of p the rainfall on bonriki was used in this study see fig s1 of the esm which applying the aforementioned 6 correction factor was determined from the rainfall measured at betio between 1947 and 2009 for the period 2009 june 2014 the measured values at bonriki were used the evaporation was based on the monthly pan evaporation values reported by falkland 1992 other input parameters for the watbal code are listed in table s2 of the esm daily net recharge values from watbal modelling were aggregated into monthly totals for use in the groundwater model the average recharge produced by watbal was approximately 57 of the mean rainfall rate of 1887 mm year this can be compared to an estimated 11 of 847 mm year for kiribati s christmas island for the same degree of coconut tree cover but falkland and woodroffe 2004 considered this value to be an underestimate since monthly rainfall averages were used instead of daily values percentages for three of the cocos keeling islands were calculated to be 29 44 and 49 of 1950 mm year of rainfall for a coconut tree land cover fraction of 0 8 0 15 and 0 respectively for the period 1953 1993 falkland and woodroffe 2004 for this case the difference with bonriki island is mainly due to a higher soil zone thickness in the model of the cocos keeling islands 500 mm vs the 300 mm adopted for our study with our watbal parameters arguably being well constrained by detailed recharge studies conducted at bonriki by white et al 2002 on average evapotranspiration losses were partitioned into canopy interception 8 of rainfall and evapotranspiration from shallow and deep rooted vegetation 32 and 3 of rainfall respectively recharge was applied in the spatially distributed zones shown in fig 6 the values directly from the watbal model were used across most of the island zone 1 fig 6 whereas modifications were made for hydrogeological features in some areas that were not included in watbal calculations for example no recharge was applied to cells beneath the airstrip zone 5 while the cells adjacent to it were assigned a 50 higher recharge to account for the runoff from the tarmac zone 2 in zone 4 recharge was 40 lower than the watbal values to account for the presence of the reef flat rock which is thought to restrict recharge to the more permeable holocene sediments in combination with the higher density of deep rooted vegetation that are thought to tap directly into the groundwater galvis rodriguez et al 2017 sinclair et al 2015 in this zone a subdued response of the water level to rainfall was observed in comparison to the other parts of the lens reserve sinclair et al 2015 no recharge was applied where there is open water i e ocean lagoon fish ponds see fig 6 except at the wetlands zone 3 where the recharge rate was calculated as the rainfall minus the open water evaporation rate which was calculated by taking the pan evaporation values falkland 1992 multiplied by 0 7 negative recharge can occur during dry months in all zones except zone 5 in the wetlands zone 3 this occurs when evaporation exceeds precipitation while in zones 1 2 and 4 this occurs when groundwater usage by deep rooted vegetation exceeds the recharge to the water table from the soil zone 3 2 3 groundwater abstraction abstraction rates have been recorded regularly by kiribati s public utilities board pub since 1998 during the present study it was found that the flowmeters that were used to monitor the abstraction rates since 2004 were overestimating the abstracted volume due to improper installation based on a validation of the flowmeters in 2015 it was estimated that the actual flow rate is 18 lower than the recorded rates at the main trunk feeding into the water treatment plant loco 2017 the overestimation of flow rates at individual galleries was estimated to range from 6 5 at gallery 13 to 42 1 at gallery 21 based on these findings the recorded flow rates were adjusted revised rates are given in fig 4 in what follows reference to abstraction rates implies the corrected values the infiltration galleries were implemented in the model by assigning abstraction rates to the cells in the uppermost layer of the model grid that coincide with the location of the galleries monthly abstraction rates were assigned based on the values reported by pub corrected for the aforementioned flowmeter discrepancies the reported total abstraction rate for each well was equally apportioned to the model cells by dividing it by the number of cells that represent an infiltration gallery no measured abstraction rates are available for the period january 1987 to november 1998 and only a best estimate can be adopted based on published reports e g falkland 1992 therefore a constant abstraction rate of 850 m3 day was used in the model distributed between the 18 galleries existing at the time pumping rates were less than 100 m3 d before 1987 and since no detailed information about this period exists and the abstraction rates are small no pumping was simulated in the model prior to january 1987 to ascertain the degree to which changes in the freshwater lens volume are due to abstraction of groundwater or due to the rainfall conditions a model without groundwater abstraction was run more precisely in the model without abstraction pumping rates were reduced by a factor of 1000 so that the salinities at the pumping galleries could still be easily evaluated and compared to the model with abstraction in addition simulations with scaled abstraction rates with otherwise the same stresses and parameters were run to evaluate the long term behaviour of the lens under reduced rates of groundwater withdrawal specifically we sought to explore the level of pumping at which the lens would recover to natural conditions i e in the absence of pumping during high rainfall periods three additional scenarios were considered in which scaled abstraction rates were 75 50 and 25 of the abstraction rates used in the calibration simulation i e as listed in fig 4 3 3 model calibration the total simulation time was subdivided into a calibration period subsequent to 1 january 1997 and a validation period from 1 january 1948 to 31 december 1996 calibrated parameters were the horizontal and vertical hydraulic conductivities kh kv porosity n and dispersivity horizontal longitudinal αl vertical longitudinal αv and transverse αt unique kh and kv values were assigned to the holocene sediments and upper and lower pleistocene layers whereas n and αl αt αv were the same for all layers previous studies e g alam et al 2002 that employed two dimensional cross sectional models provided initial estimates of these parameters calibration was undertaken using manual trial and error due to the run times around 3 5 h the initial heads and concentrations for the transient model were determined from the heads and concentrations after the final time step of the model with the updated calibration parameters but without abstraction since no data are available at the model starting time 1 january 1948 and no information is available about the antecedent recharge rates this is a somewhat arbitrary modelling choice however given the high permeability and small scale of the model the initial conditions have little effect on the final outcome for the period of main interest i e the post 1986 abstraction period ec values were available at the 22 multi level monitoring wells and for the 22 abstraction galleries totalling 6708 salinity data points during the calibration period measurement of the ec of abstraction galleries started in 1977 but regular readings from individual galleries have only been available since 2006 the ec of the water from the treatment plant representing the mixed water from all the galleries before it is fed into the trunk main pipeline is also available for comparison with the modelled tds concentrations the measured ec values in units of ms cm were converted to tds in units of kg m3 by multiplying by 0 72 the ec tds conversion was obtained from comparison between ec and tds where water chemistry data were available galvis rodriguez et al 2017 the concentrations of the multi level observation wells were compared to the model calculated concentrations in the cells corresponding to the location and depth of the measurement point the modelled concentrations of the cells corresponding to the abstraction galleries were used to calculate a flux weighted average concentration which could be compared to the measured values of the abstracted water from each gallery and from all galleries combined 3 4 output variables the modelled concentrations were used to determine the volume of the freshwater lens v f which was calculated by summing the saturated volume of all model cells in which the electrical conductivity was less than 2 5 ms cm at the end of each stress period the difference between the modelled freshwater lens volume without abstraction v f na and with abstraction v f a was δv f v f na v f a the difference between the freshwater volume between two consecutive stress periods was δv f v f sp v f sp 1 where sp in the subscript indicates the stress period number note that δv f is positive negative when the lens is growing shrinking the total abstracted volume of groundwater since the start of pumping on 1 january 1987 was defined as 2 v abs t o t 1 n q a i δ t i where q a i is the volumetric abstraction rate for month i m3 d and δti is the length of month i in days 28 δti 31 the total number of months in the simulation was n 798 the model results were compared to the 12 month percentile rainfall ranking r 12 which is used as a drought index in kiribati s water management and drought response plans e g white et al 2008 r 12 was calculated for each month by first summing the month s rainfall and that of the preceding 11 months this summed total was then ranked relative to other 12 month sums that include the same month sequence e g february to january may to april october to september etc within the simulation period january 1948 june 2014 thus an r 12 value of 100 means that the previous 12 months were wetter than any other 12 month period with the same start and end months 4 results 4 1 calibration results fig 7 shows the comparison of the salinities of the multi level observation wells with the modelled salinities for the calibration and validation periods the final root mean square error rmse was 3 58 kg m3 during the calibration period and 3 45 kg m3 during the validation period this represents scaled rmse barnett et al 2012 values of 10 2 and 9 9 respectively indicating an acceptable level of model measurement mismatch for the proposed application of the model particularly given the heterogeneous nature of the island s subsurface the high temporal dynamics and the manual approach to model calibration there are few previous attempts at physically based simulation of island lenses with which to compare our calibration statistics a comparable study is the modelling of kish island persian gulf by ataie ashtiani et al 2013 who produced a scaled rmse i e modelled versus measured salinity of 21 albeit their salinity data set was considerably smaller than that available for bonriki island the initial and calibrated parameters are shown in table 1 hydraulic conductivity values generally increased during the calibration process because the initial simulations underestimated concentrations i e overestimated lens thickness significant changes to transport parameters were required to improve the simulation of the freshwater seawater transition zone location and thickness including a reduction in αl to 0 8 m and an increase in porosity to 30 cross sectional depictions of the calibrated model s salinity predictions are presented in fig 3 with comparison to observed values the model matches reasonably well the geometry of the freshwater lens for both the pre abstraction validation period e g may 1985 fig 3a and after 27 years of abstraction e g june 2014 fig 3b the model s ability to recreate temporal salinity variations at the multi level observation wells was an important performance criterion given the use of the monitoring network in management decision making the transience of freshwater lens salinities is shown for bn27 on cross section a a and bn11 located near galleries 16 and 17 in fig 8 the vertical position of the ec 2 5 10 and 25 ms cm lines are represented fig 8 shows that the elevations of measured ec levels are reproduced by the model to within only a few metres whereas the temporal trends in the elevation of ec isolines are matched reasonably well by the model salinity contours exhibit highly dynamic vertical movements with displacements of 5 m occurring annually and long term changes of around 20 m recorded for the 2 5 ms cm ec contour water level responses to pumping and recharge over long timeframes are masked by tidal variations and are thus not particularly helpful for the calibration of the non tidal model of bonriki lens sinclair et al 2015 where water table changes have been observed the variation tends to be 1 m sinclair et al 2015 and thus changes to the storage of freshwater in bonriki island is associated more so with changes in the elevation of salinity rather than heads fig 9 illustrates measurements of the temporal variation in abstracted water ec with comparison to flow weighted mean ec values from the model the model appears to be underestimating the effect of the recharge variability on the temporal changes of salinity of the abstracted water prior to 2010 but after this variations in the pumped water salinity i e at the trunk main are closely matched by the model this is reflected by the value of the nash sutcliffe coefficient nash and sutcliffe 1970 which is 0 02 for the entire period for which ec values at the trunk main were available march 1999 february 2014 but 0 83 for the period since january 2010 additional graphs extending the results shown in figs 8 and 9 are included in the esm figs s3 s60 to illustrate the comparison between model outcomes and salinity measurements at observation wells and pumping galleries in general the same patterns as evident in the trunk main fig 9 are apparent for most of the individual galleries see esm figs s3 s24 4 2 historical trends fig 10 shows the development of v f with time for the model simulation period superimposed on abstraction recharge and r 12 trends the results demonstrate that v f is controlled by both recharge and pumping as expected v f displays temporal trends that reflect those of r 12 for the model simulation that neglects pumping the impact of abstraction is especially evident during the last 10 years of the pumping simulation when v f shows a declining trend punctuated by short periods of partial recovery in 2014 the volume of freshwater seems to have reached an all time low within the same period the modelled salinities at the trunk main and at the individual galleries see esm figs s3 s24 become increasingly sensitive to dry phases especially after 2008 these trends are consistent with the cross sectional depictions of the lens for may 1985 and june 2014 fig 3 which clearly reveal that the lens has shrunk considerably since pumping began climate influences on the two lens snapshots i e 1985 and 2014 can be ascertained by considering respective r 12 values for the period may 1984 to april 1985 r 12 ranged between 15 and 42 while for june 2013 to may 2014 it ranged between 28 and 52 so while the rainfall during the one year period before june 2014 was higher than during the year leading up to may 1985 the freshwater volume was markedly lower the difference is therefore attributable to abstraction consistent with the significant difference in v f between simulations with and without abstraction fig 10 in the absence of pumping a decreasing trend in v f is also apparent for the period 2004 2014 although the rate of decline is rather subdued and the final value of v f for the no pumping case is within the range of values calculated during the previous time sequence i e 1948 2004 fig 10 an improved interpretation of the lens evolution is possible by plotting δv f versus v abs tot as given in fig 11 the intention here is to explore the key water balance elements that lead to the lens reduction shown in the previous figures blue bars are added to fig 11 to indicate periods when r 12 75 i e sequences of very high rainfall at the onset of the pumping period i e 1987 δv f shows an increasing trend which is due to the lens adjusting to the introduction of abstraction δv f subsequently falls during 1990 1995 due to above average rainfall despite continued abstraction throughout this time the declining trend in δv f indicates that the lens volume was being replenished following depletion during the prior period i e 1987 1990 however complete replenishment was not achieved i e δv f 0 fig 11 in the years following 1995 δv f increases almost monotonically with exception of the 2002 2004 wet period from fig 11 it can also be seen that by mid 2014 when 11 106 m3 of groundwater had been abstracted since 1987 δv f was almost 3 106 m3 this latter amount was taken from the store of freshwater that would have been available under natural conditions the rest of the nearly 11 106 m3 of abstracted groundwater represents captured freshwater discharge that would otherwise have been lost to the sea on the basis that gross recharge to the aquifer is independent of abstraction effects in the model fig 12 presents the δv f results of models with scaled abstraction rates fig 12a shows δv f behaviour as a function of time as expected lower abstraction rates lead to diminished depletion of the freshwater lens however the freshwater lens is not returned to its natural condition is any of the cases and only the 25 scenario shows extended periods of almost stable values i e independent of time of δv f after 2005 upward trends in fig 12a indicate that the lens volume has not yet reached a new equilibrium condition even where the pumping is reduced to as low as 25 of historical values the final values of δv f at the end of the simulations are displayed on the right hand side of fig 12a and as fractions of that from the calibration simulation i e 2 90 106 m3 fig 12a equate to 70 43 and 20 for the 75 50 and 25 scaled abstraction scenarios respectively this means that for reduced abstraction rates δv f is proportionally lower relative to v abs tot by extension a pumping rate at which δv f 0 would likely be around 5 of historical pumping rates given roughly consistent difference between δv f v abs tot 100 and scaled abstraction rates as above fig 12b is a similar graph to fig 11 but includes the results of models with reduced abstraction rates the lines follow approximately similar trajectories indicating that the gradient δv f v abs tot is not particularly sensitive to the abstraction rate in other words lower rates of abstraction lead to delayed contraction of the lens with the level of depletion being similar to that of higher abstraction rates except at a later time specifically as lens depletion appears to be mainly dependent on v abs tot fig 12b scaling the abstraction rate leads to an approximately inversely proportionate delay in the timing of lens depletion e g halving the abstraction rate leads to roughly doubling of the time before a particular level of lens depletion occurs one might expect though that quasi steady state conditions i e changes in v f in time become dependent only on changes in recharge with no further reduction due to pumping become established for the 25 scenario before the scenarios with the higher abstraction rates but the simulation period considered apparently was not yet long enough for this to become manifest fig 13 contains a comparison of monthly flow rates of recharge q r and net coastal discharge q coast for the entire model q r represents the integrated recharge through the top of the model domain while q coast is the integrated net inflow through specified head cells representing the ocean and lagoon floors negative values of q coast indicate that fresh groundwater is discharging to the ocean and lagoon i e submarine groundwater discharge sgd exceeds seawater influx to the aquifer whereas positive values indicate that sgd is less than the seawater influx and therefore the aquifer is accumulating seawater the colour of the data points reflects the value of δv f positive values indicate lens growth in accordance with the scale of the colour bar the general downward sloping trend of the data points in fig 13 shows that the outflow to the lagoon and ocean is high when recharge is high as expected for the small size and high permeability of bonriki island conversely when recharge is low there is the possibility of significant net inflows of seawater to the aquifer i e positive q coast events more so when abstraction is included in the model compare fig 13a and b the relatively narrow band of data points around the 1 1 line suggests that a the rate of net seaward discharge is closely linked to recharge rates and b q coast and recharge trends are approximately concomitant because significant time lags would be expected to widen the data cluster data points above the 1 1 line in fig 13 indicate that net discharge to the sea is less than net recharge i e q coast q r whereas data points below the 1 1 line identify periods when net seaward discharge exceeds recharge i e q coast q r the former situation tends to occur more so under the highest recharge rates i e as a result of freshwater lens growth and when abstraction is considered i e seawater discharge is reduced by pumping the latter situation i e q coast q r is more prevalent in the absence of abstraction and during low recharge periods because these conditions particularly in combination are associated with sgd that persists during periods of low rainfall through losses to the lens freshwater storage both situations are associated with time lags between recharge events and responses in sgd periods of lens contraction indicated by yellow to red symbols i e δv f 0 in fig 13 occur predominantly under conditions of net outflow through the coastal boundary q coast 0 that is despite that net recharge exceeds extraction causing coastal outflow of freshwater the lens declines most of the yellow symbols in fig 13a i e δv f 0 occur at q r values of around 2500 m3 d i e a flux of 1 7 mm d based on the island s area of 1 47 km2 whereas in fig 13b they occur mostly around 4000 m3 d 2 7 mm d the difference between these numbers is roughly equal to the mean abstraction rate since 2006 moreover under conditions of no abstraction positive values of q coast occur only when q r 0 whereas with abstraction this becomes when q r 1500 m3 d approximately this is the intuitive consequence of less sgd or more seawater intrusion under the abstraction regime than under no abstraction conditions for the same amount of recharge we can also interpret from this that recharge rates of approximately 2500 m3 d plus the total rate of pumping are required for stable lens conditions on bonriki island inspection of figs 8 10 show that recharge commonly falls below this threshold for significant periods of time over the available rainfall record leading to lens contractions that are further evident from increases in measured and modelled ec values fig 10 5 discussion the strong dependency of bonriki island s freshwater volume and the pumped water salinity on recharge rates are in accordance with findings from other freshwater lens systems on atoll islands bailey et al 2014 van der velde et al 2006 this temporal variability is captured reasonably well by the numerical model albeit our assessment of the calibration fit is largely subjective the calibration result and the use of model input parameters that fall within expected values lead us to conclude that the model is an adequate tool for exploring lens behaviour including under various abstraction scenarios our application of the model provides new insights into the lens that are important for both management decision making and for understanding the physical processes that occur within atoll island settings for example the importance of pumping is evident from the comparison between model simulations with and without abstraction wells this adds to previous studies of pumping impacts that adopt similar strategies except using density independent groundwater models e g knowling et al 2015 indeed climate drivers alone are unable to explain the lens thinning and shallow groundwater salinity increases that have become apparent in the field data over the last two decades therefore trends of lens contraction are primarily caused by the exploitation of fresh groundwater and not by changing recharge conditions the numerical model presented here is comparable to that of the freshwater lens on home island of the south keeling atoll by ghassemi et al 2000 in terms of hydrogeological conditions spatial scale and data availability ghassemi et al 2000 stated that their modelling exercise failed and although they did not did not define criteria for calibration success they concluded calibration could not be achieved which they attributed to the karstic nature of the system they did not show the differences between measured and modelled concentrations for their entire dataset so it is impossible to make a direct quantitative comparison between the performance of the bonriki model and their model yet although the bonriki model also shows some significant deviations between the measured and modelled configuration of the freshwater lens at individual observation wells see figs 3 7 and 8 and esm figs s25 s60 as well as for the salinities of some of the galleries see esm figs s3 s24 we contend that a more optimistic conclusion about the usefulness of numerical models to simulate freshwater lenses in atoll environments is warranted indeed given the karstic nature of the system it is unlikely that a high degree of model accuracy can be achieved no matter how comprehensive the dataset and calibration effort moreover a numerical model should not be expected to be able to accurately forecast salinities at individual pumping wells as has been found for coastal aquifer models more generally e g sanford and pope 2010 werner et al 2013 despite such limitations though the bonriki model was useful in analysing long term trends of the volume of the freshwater resource and in distinguishing between natural and anthropogenic impacts this ability makes the model an important instrument to support the sustainable management of water supply and serves as a benchmark for atoll island investigation under natural conditions decreases in lens volume occur i during periods of low or negative recharge when the coastal discharge of freshwater exceeds net recharge and ii when freshwater losses due to mixing of freshwater and seawater within the aquifer due to hydrodynamic dispersion exceed the difference between freshwater inflows and losses these processes combine to create complex relationships between the volume of fresh groundwater and sgd and recharge as demonstrated by the spread of data points representing δv f 0 in fig 13a abstraction influences the aforementioned factors controlling lens volume potentially enhancing dispersive effects and raising the recharge threshold at which the lens volume can increase as described in the previous section both modelled and measured salinity trends indicate that significant increases in lens volume are apparent only when high recharge rates are sustained over periods of several months or more fig 10 surprisingly storage increases during sustained recharge events are generally similar with or without abstraction effects leading to a somewhat linear relationship between lens volume and v abs tot which is largely independent of the abstraction rate i e fig 12b in a similar manner q r and q coast are correlated at the one month temporal resolution of the model fig 13 this means that a large fraction of the recharge is probably lost to sgd within one month or less this finding is consistent with that of jocson et al 2002 who analysed the relationship between water level and recharge for the northern guam lens aquifer and argued that it was likely that high recharge rates would cause a rapid increase of the flow of groundwater to the sea the median ratio of the yearly volumetric abstraction rate over the yearly volumetric recharge rate during the period 2004 2014 was 36 the median abstraction rate over the same period was 1526 m3 d which is below the 1660 m3 d currently considered to be the sustainable rate fig 4 nonetheless the bonriki freshwater lens appears to be in a state of decline this is apparent from the virtually linear shrinkage of the freshwater volume attributable to pumping since 2004 fig 12 cross sections showing the change in lens geometry between 1985 and 2014 fig 3 support this assertion moreover the salinities of the abstracted water are becoming increasingly sensitive to droughts as evidenced towards the end of the simulation period fig 9 and esm figs s3 s24 that is the salinities rise after a series of dry months but do not completely recover to pre drought levels during the following wet phase in the model scenario without abstraction the salinity of the groundwater at the location of the abstraction galleries shows hardly any variability with time fig 9 these results indicate that abstraction is causing thinning of the freshwater lens in a thick lens the volume of freshwater varies with time as recharge conditions vary but this hardly affects the salinities of the abstracted groundwater as the saltwater at depth does not reach the galleries under the current pumping regime however thinning of the freshwater lens has brought saltwater closer to the galleries subsequently some of the abstraction galleries collect brackish water during dry periods causing a marked rise in salinity at specific locations the model calculated freshwater volumes indicate that v f 4 3 106 m3 at the end of the simulation period in june 2014 whereas on average it was v f 7 7 106 m3 prior to pumping in 1987 which means that almost half of the volume of freshwater 3 4 106 m3 has been lost this is because of mixing by hydrodynamic dispersion and a decrease of the freshwater storage by both lowering of the water table and rising salinity during periods of low recharge as discussed in the previous section under groundwater abstraction conditions the recharge rate required to cause the freshwater lens to grow becomes higher than under natural conditions fig 10 provides initial evidence that supports the application of r 12 as an approximate and informative indicator of v f attributable to climatic conditions in the absence of pumping this is an important finding given that lens volumes in islands and coastal areas more broadly are challenging to determine based on ec measurements and ascertaining the climate induced lens performance using only field data is almost impossible water levels are also a poor indicator of lens conditions as they do not reflect the volume of freshwater lost from an aquifer when the loss is partially compensated by seawater intrusion morgan et al 2012 moreover the r 12 parameter is easy to calculate if rainfall records are available and less cumbersome to implement than the time series models by van der velde et al 2006 which are based on a convolution integral that also captures the antecedent rainfall conditions but in a less intuitive way the results of our study indicate that lens contraction caused by abstraction is a multi decadal process that is superimposed on natural variations and can become almost independent of climate drivers figs 11 and 12a while under natural conditions and during the early stages of abstraction shallow groundwater salinities and r 12 are essentially independent they become more strongly correlated at later times fig 9 this is apparent from the intensified fluctuations of the water salinity at the trunk main a result of the freshwater lens becoming thinner that follow the changes of r 12 therefore we suggest caution in the use of r 12 as a general indicator of the health of the bonriki groundwater system under the current stressed conditions since abstraction effects lead to relations between r 12 and v f as well as between r 12 and abstraction water salinity that do not remain fixed for management purposes it can thus be misleading to rely on r 12 only because salinities of the abstracted water in a thinned lens will start to show a stronger response to climatic variations and the evolution of these relationships unfortunately can not be easily predicted collecting rainfall measurements and other weather data is nonetheless critically important as is taking regular salinity measurements as this study has shown the response times of the lens even in permeable small scale lens systems like bonriki island make that monitoring needs to be sustained over many decades in order to fully capture the abstraction impacts while the salinities of the water abstracted from the galleries appear to respond stronger to droughts during recent years there are currently no immediate issues with the salinity of the water supply nevertheless the observed trends call for a reappraisal of the management strategies of the freshwater lens several options could be considered the pumping rates for individual galleries could be adjusted in such a way that those least sensitive to salinization pump more than those of which the salinity rises rapidly during dry phases however the long term effects of this strategy should be investigated moreover given the high water usage of the deep rooted palm trees vegetation management could be adopted that considers the trade off between the value of the trees for sustenance and environmental functioning and their negative impact on the lens through evapotranspiration withdrawals finally and importantly a salinity trigger level approach is considered important in providing early warning for a management response to preserve fresh groundwater and minimise the adverse effects of seawater intrusion when there are reduced inputs of recharge the threshold of 2500 m3 d plus abstraction devised in this study may serve as a management trigger in future water policy development the current trend of lens thinning may require water saving measures and alternative sources of freshwater to be identified which could include harvested rainwater or desalinated seawater 6 conclusions this study investigated the long term effects of pumping on a freshwater lens on an atoll island bonriki island tarawa atoll kiribati based on a comprehensive data set of meteorological geological and groundwater data a numerical model was constructed which was used to infer the development of the freshwater volume and the water balance components for the island between 1 january 1948 and 30 june 2014 abstraction was simulated during the last 27 5 years of the simulation i e since 1 january 1987 the results clearly show that under natural conditions the freshwater volume is subject to significant changes that are driven by the rainfall intensity by comparing model simulations with and without abstraction the effect of abstraction could be isolated from these natural variations in freshwater volume this showed that abstraction causes sustained contraction of the lens over the 27 5 years of pumping considered in this study the rate of decline of the freshwater volume did not show abatement over time which means that the freshwater volume has not yet reached a new equilibrium with respect to the pumping stresses this is the case even for hypothetical scaled abstraction scenarios where the pumping is reduced as low as 25 of historical values our finding that lens adjustment to the abstraction stresses spans a period of nearly three decades means that numerical simulations for the assessment of sustainable yield must be based on timescales of several decades even for small and permeable islands like bonriki island the efforts to monitor groundwater and abstraction water salinities over several decades have been proven essential in assessing the state of the freshwater resource reliance on drought indices like the r 12 used on tarawa is appropriate under unstressed conditions or for low abstraction rates but as thinning of the lens continues and shallow groundwater salinities become more variable with time the relationship between r 12 and abstraction water salinity is no longer fixed caution is therefore required to rely on such indicators to assess the health of the freshwater reserve because of its size and rainfall rates the bonriki freshwater lens is relatively resilient compared to other islands and this thus holds in particular for smaller islands with less recharge further work has to focus on management options for groundwater abstraction on bonriki island and a re evaluation of the appropriate sustainable yield amongst a range of options trigger level approaches based on salinity must be considered which will be the subject of future studies acknowledgements this study resulted
