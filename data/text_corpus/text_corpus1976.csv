9880,rapid changes in food habits climate and population size are expected to substantially challenge the sustainable use of china s agricultural water supply undoubtedly increasing the uncertainty of china s food security this study analyzes the change characteristics of china s food habits during 1981 2017 and the amount agricultural water for food production during peak population period 2029 2033 has also projected based on different food habits and climate scenarios the results show that china s food habits changed dramatically from mainly vegetable dominated to animal dominated during 1981 2017 compared to the historical period 2013 2017 the decrease in precipitation and the increase in evapotranspiration in the peak population period will increase the drought degree in china s thirteen main food producing provinces during peak population period the irrigation water demand will increase to 298 0 314 7 billion m3 under current food habits and 319 4 337 8 billion m3 under recommended food habits in different climate scenarios respectively these values are much higher than those of the historical period e g 195 7 billion m3 in 2017 moreover compared with 2017 china s future per capita irrigation water demand is expected to increase by 63 3 74 8 m3 due to climate change if food habit changes are further adopted then per capita irrigation water demand is expected to increase even more by 77 9 90 5 m3 this study also proposes various measures to ensure china s agricultural water security based on the presented findings key words agricultural water food habits climate change population china 1 introduction in many parts of the world especially in arid and semi arid regions the limited water resources is constitute a major constraint on the development of agricultural production at present agricultural water already accounts for 70 of global freshwater withdrawal shabbir et al 2014 given current global population expansion global agricultural water consumption may increase from the current 2700 billion m3 to 3200 billion m3 in 2050 by then about 6 billion people or 67 of the global population will face water shortage due to the extreme water withdrawals needed for food production united nations educational scientific and cultural organization 2012 2015 meanwhile increasing disturbance to the water cycle by extreme weather is also expected to increase the instability of the global agricultural water supply gosling and arnell 2016 as the most populous country in the world ensuring china s adequate food supply has always been a core issue of government concern in 2013 china s central government proposed the goal of guaranteeing the absolute safety of rations wheat and rice and in 2020 it further proposed a goal of strengthening national capacity to ensure adequate supplies of other important food items the state council 2020 however climate variation population expansion and changes in food habits have put tremendous pressure on the sustainable use of china s agricultural water he et al 2020 in order to prevent the rapid growth of water consumption from destroying water resources the chinese government published the report opinions of the state council on the implementation of the most stringent water resources management also called the three red lines policy of water resources in 2012 this report sets an upper limit target for agricultural water consumption to be met by 2030 the state council 2012 this policy will undoubtedly intensify the conflict between water resource protection and food security in china with the continuous increase of income the food habits shift from plant based to animal based has become a general trend in many developing countries behrens et al 2010 kumar et al 2012 this shift often means greater agricultural water consumption liu et al 2008 for example vanham et al 2016 analyzed the impact of food consumption on water resources in dutch cities finding that the per capita water footprint related to food consumption in some metropolitan areas such as amsterdam and rotterdam is 119 l cap day higher than other cities due to more meat and cereals and less potatoes consumption vanham also calculated the water footprint of austria for various diets vanham 2013 finding that the current austrian diet makes excessive use of sugar crop oils meat milk products and eggs in per capita terms this diet significantly increases the water footprint 3655 l day compared to a diet making more use of cereals rice potatoes vegetables and fruit similar findings were also determined for the case of california according to marlow et al 2009 a livestock dominated diet consumed 2 9 times more water than a vegetable dominated diet in california with beef consumption making the strongest contribution to the disparity food habit changes also pose great challenges for china s water resources based on the research of liu et al 2008 the global water crisis is expected to be driven by economic development and population expansion in china the drastic shift toward protein rich diets is the main cause of china s water shortage he et al 2019 evaluated the impact of china s food habit changes on agricultural water demand during 1981 2016 using data collected from multiple sources they concluded that china s irrigation water demand for food production increased from 159 billion m3 in 1981 184 billion m3 in 2016 as of 1996 food habit shifts have surpassed population expansion as the main reason for china s agricultural water growth the relationship between future agricultural water demand and food production has also been discussed mancosu et al 2015 ibarrola rivas et al 2017 these studies believe that food habits change will exacerbate the global water crisis and 40 of the global population in 2050 will live in countries with not enough water to meet the demands some particularly populous countries such as china and india will face greater pressure than others on water resources the impact of climate change on agricultural water security is another topic that has been widely discussed in recent years mathur and achutarao 2020 grusson et al 2021 generally climate affects agricultural water use in two ways on the one hand by changing the key elements of crop growth such as precipitation evaporation and radiation climate change will have a direct impact on agricultural water supply and demand on the other hand climate change has a significant impact on crop yields thereby affecting crop water productivity indirectly over the past few decades no significant change in global precipitation has been observed but the warming climate has caused a significant increase in average evaporation moreover intensified weather fluctuations have caused massive changes in the spatial characteristics of agricultural water supply and demand in various regions su and feng 2015 robert et al 2017 according to zhang and cai 2013 the climate change driven global water deficits for irrigation and rain fed crops during the period 2070 2099 will reach 1289 and 2871 km3 respectively compared to 1961 1990 india china and the united states will become the most water scarce countries in the future due to their huge food consumption demand rosa et al 2020 further analyzed the impact of climate change on agricultural water shortage from the perspective of water footprint they found that the current water shortage in india and china is mainly due to an insufficient supply of irrigation water while the united states and argentina suffer mainly from insufficient precipitation ko and ahuja 2013 used crop growth models to predict the impact of climate change on wheat and corn yields in the central great plains of the united states the results showed that the predicted yields of wheat and corn in 2050 and 2075 will be significantly reduced and water use efficiency will also decline due to the yield decreases for the combined climate change scenarios of co2 temperature and precipitation due to widespread food security concerns climate change research focused on china s agricultural water has increased over the years xu et al 2019 used five global climate models to analyze the impact of climate change on irrigation water demand in northeast china based their research average irrigation water demand has a 50 chance of increasing 1 1 8 times by the 2050 s under extreme climate conditions such an increase would cause a significant shortfall for local corn production guo and shen 2016 estimated the water availability and agricultural water demand under future climate change scenarios in arid northwest china they showed that irrigation water demand will increase by 4 27 6 15 billion m3 over the next 60 years due to temperature rise while annual runoff in this region will increase by 4 8 8 5 billion m3 however this increase in runoff may not be able to support the increase in irrigation water demand the macro or micro relationship in china between climate agricultural water drought and crop fields has also been studied extensively from a range of perspectives zhang et al 2018 amnuaylojaroen and chanvichit 2019 although existing studies have addressed individual intervariable relationships food habits water or climate water from various perspectives and presented many useful conclusions few studies have considered the comprehensive impact of multiple factors on agricultural water at a national level but in fact consideration of this comprehensive impact is of the greatest significance to ensuring national water and food security moreover to our knowledge there are no comprehensive analyses of the impacts of future food habit changes and climate variation on agricultural water requirements during peak population periods china remains the largest food consumer in the world so ensuring the sustainability of its water consumption for food production is significant not only for china s economic development and social stability but also for global food patterns given the the changing trend of developing countries food habits from plant based to animal based the present analysis of the impact of food habit shifts and climate variation on china s water security during its peak population period 2029 2033 can also provide a reference for other developing countries the remainder of this paper is organized as follows 1 changes in china s food habit patterns during the 1981 2017 period are introduced and climate characteristics during peak population period are estimated 2 china s total agricultural water and irrigation water requirements during the peak population period are projected under two food habit scenarios and three climate scenarios 3 strategies are put forward to ensure agricultural water security during china s peak population period based on the future water demand situation 2 methods and data 2 1 study area china consists of 32 provinces autonomous regions and municipal cities of which 13 provinces have been designated as main food producing areas by the china central government hebei nei mongolia liaoning jilin heilongjiang jiangsu anhui jiangxi shandong henan hubei hunan and sichuan fig 1 these main food producing provinces are considered the foundation for china s food security arable land in these 13 provinces accounts for 66 of arable land in china and food production in these 13 provinces accounts for more than 75 of the country s total china can be roughly divided into two parts south and north by the 800 mm isohyet however the arable land area in arid north china accounts for 60 of china s total arable land area he et al 2018 due to the large quantity of groundwater extraction for irrigation in north china china has become the world s second largest consumer of groundwater just behind india the plain of north china has also become one of the largest groundwater funnel areas in the world feng et al 2013 2 2 data sources the data used in this study can be divided into three categories 1 to reflect the rapid changes in china s food habits from 1981 to 2017 nine vegetable food items and seven animal food items were considered based on chinese eating habits considered vegetable foods included wheat rice maize fruits vegetable oils vegetables beans sugar and potatoes and other starchy roots considered animal foods included pork beef poultry eggs milk fish and seafood and mutton and goat meats the consumption data for these food items were collected from the china statistical yearbook and the china food yearbook 2 the historical climate data required to calculate reference evaporation et 0 mm and effective precipitation in years 2013 2017 were acquired from 777 national meteorological stations the daily records of these stations were collected from the national meteorological information center 3 future climate data were output by five global climate models ipsl cm5a lr gfdl esm2m noresm1 m hadgem2 es and miroc esm chem the national climate center of china used a statistical bias correction methodology to process climate data this bias correction based on a fitted histogram equalization function which was proposed by piani et al 2010 and has been proven to exhibit high accuracy moreover a bilinear interpolation method was used for downscaling climate data at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 the good accuracy of the resulting data produced by national climate center of china was demonstrated in the third national assessment report on climate change wang et al 2019 to calculate et 0 and effective precipitation in china during peak population we used eight climate elements for the years 2029 2033 under climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 mean maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation total solar radiation mean relative humidity ground pressure and near surface mean wind speed each climate element under scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 is obtained by averaging the relevant data of five global climate models 2 3 methods 2 3 1 agricultural water requirements for food consumption the annual per capita consumption of vegetable foods g i veg kg cap can be divided into two categories indirect and direct indirect vegetable foods f i veg ind kg cap such as vegetable oil and sugar need to be converted from other crops and the conversion efficiencies s i of vegetable oil and sugar in china are 17 and 13 respectively he et al 2021 direct vegetable foods f i veg dir kg cap can be eaten directly without conversion including wheat rice maize beans vegetables fruits and potatoes and other starchy roots the annual consumption of vegetable foods can be calculated as follows 1 g i v e g f i v e g ind s i f i v e g d i r the total agricultural water required for crop growth is equal to the sum of irrigation water and precipitation in growing seasons i e 2 w i v e g w i i r r i w i p r e c where w i veg w i irri and w i prec are the total agricultural water mm irrigation water mm and precipitation mm requirements of each type of crop growth in its growing season respectively the total agricultural water requirements for crop growth should compensate for evapotranspiration loss from a crop field which is related to et 0 and the crop coefficient jiang et al 2017 the penman monteith equation is widely used to evaluate et 0 and has been proven to exhibit high accuracy this equation is therefore also used in our study 3 w i veg et 0 k c i 4 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 273 t u 2 e a e d γ 1 0 34 u 2 where k c i is the crop coefficient of each type of crop i is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c r n and g are the net radiation mj m2 d and soil heat flux mj m2 d respectively γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c t is the mean daily air temperature c u 2 is the daily average wind speed m s at a height of 2 m and e a and e d are the saturation vapor pressure kpa and actual atmospheric water vapor pressure kpa respectively for crop growth only the effective precipitation that can be absorbed during the growth period in this study the usda scs equation was adopted to calculate effective precipitation 5 p i eff p 125 0 2 p 125 p 250 mm m 125 0 1 p p 250 mm m where p i eff and p are the monthly effective precipitation mm and monthly total precipitation mm respectively the irrigation water requirement is calculated as the difference between w i veg and p i eff when p i eff is greater than w i veg w i veg may be met by rainfall without irrigation regardless irrigation water is needed for crop growth during each crop s growing season 6 w i prec w i veg w i veg p i eff p i eff w i veg p i eff 7 w i irri w i veg p i eff w i veg p i eff in addition to climate factors the annual precipitation and irrigation water demands of vegetable foods are also related to china s population size the various cropping situations of different crops crop yield and food self sufficiency rate 8 t veg p r e c w i p r e c g i v e g b i m c i i r i s e l f p o p u l a t i o n 9 t veg irr w i irr g i v e g b i m c i i r i s e l f p o p u l a t i o n where t water prec and t water irri are the annual precipitation m3 and irrigation water m3 requirements for vegetable food consumption respectively b i is the area of arable land demand to produce 1 kg of each type of crop m2 kg mci i represents the multiple cropping index for each type of crop due to the wide variation of mci i across different crops and different regions the average mci i in china was used in our study according to he et al 2019 r i self is the food self sufficiency rate of each crop according to previous studies r i self was set at 95 zhao and cui 2013 the water requirements for animal food can be defined as the total water use required to grow the animal s feed clean its housing and provide its drinking water over its entire life span due to differences in climatic conditions and crop planting structure feed types vary greatly across countries according to wang and lv 2012 feed grain accounts for the majority of china s feed consumption with wheat corn and beans accounting for 18 59 and 23 of feed grain respectively therefore the annual precipitation and irrigation water requirements for feed growth can be calculated according to eqs 10 and 11 and the total water and irrigation water requirements for animal food consumption can be calculated according to eqs 12 and 13 10 w f e e d p r e c w w h e a t p r e c 18 w c o r n p r e c 59 w b e a n p r e c 23 11 w f e e d irri w w h e a t irri 18 w c o r n irri 59 w b e a n

water mm requirements for feed growth respectively w wheat prec w corn prec and w bean prec are the precipitation requirements for wheat corn and beans respectively during each crop s growing season mm w wheat irri w corn irri and w bean irri are the irrigation water requirements for wheat corn and beans respectively during each crop s growing season mm w i ani and w i ani irri are the total water and irrigation water respectively required to produce 1 kg of each type of animal food m3 kg and w i drink and w i clean respectively represent the drinking and cleaning water required to produce 1 kg of each type of animal food m3 kg as obtained from hoekstra and chapagain 2009 as in eqs 8 and 9 the total water t ani m3 and irrigation water t ani irri m3 demands for various animal foods can be calculated as follows 14 t ani w i a n i f i a n i z i f c r r i s e l f p o p u l a t i o n 15 t ani irri w i a n i i r r i f i a n i z i f c r r i s e l f p o p u l a t i o n where f i ani is the per capita annual consumption of animal food in category i kg cap z i fcr is the feed conversion ratio of animal food in category i according to a series of reports and academic journal articles in general the total water tw m3 and irrigation water requirements tw irri m3 for food consumption in china can be respectively calculated as 16 t w t veg p r e c t v e g i r r i t a n i 17 t w irri t veg irri t ani i r r i 2 3 2 china s peak population forecast population peak forecasting serves as the basis for any country s formulation of long term agricultural water management policies as the most populous country in the world china has been the subject of various studies of population growth scenario predictions table 1 these studies generally have found that due to the ever increasing pressure of life and work china s birth rate is expected to continue to decrease and the national population is expected to consequently peak in the next decade according to the research results shown in table 1 china s population will probably peak in 2029 2033 with a peak population of 1 42 1 50 billion therefore this study takes 2029 2033 as china s population peak period and selects the average population forecast 1 46 billion as the maximum population size 2 3 3 meteorological drought grade the relative humidity index rhi reflects the regional meteorological drought grade by considering the balance of water consumption due to the rhi is simple to calculate and has clear physical meaning it is have been widely used as the national recommended standards for evaluating meteorological drought in china guo et al 2016 zhang and wang 2021 as shown in table 2 the value of of rhi are given as five levels standardization administration of china 2017 and the rhi is expressed as eq 18 18 r h i p e t 0 e t 0 3 results 3 1 food habit changes in china from 1981 to 2017 with the rapid increase in income the food habits of chinese people has undergone significant changes over the last 36 years as the core of traditional chinese food habits the per capita consumption of grain wheat rice and maize continues to decline in 1981 the per capita annual consumption amounts of grain were 267 kg account for 62 of total vegetable food consumption whereas the consumption value of grain dropped to 124 kg in 2017 and the proportion also dropped to 42 in vegetable foods fig 2 although china accounts for 50 of global vegetable production annual domestic consumption of vegetables decreased from 138 kg person in 1981 99 kg person in 2017 a decline of 28 contrary to the change trend of grains and vegetables fruits is the fastest growing vegetable food item in china the per capita consumption amount of fruits increased by 5 4 times from 1981 to 2017 meanwhile the rapid growth of consumption of vegetable oil and beans has become a huge challenge to china s food security in recent years at present the domestic production of soybeans can only meet 15 of the demand soybean oil and soybeans account for approximately 50 of total vegetable oil consumption and 90 of bean consumption respectively china annually imports 90 million tons of soybeans or about a quarter of global production the per capita consumption of animal foods from 1981 to 2017 in china is provided in fig 3 which shows growth trends for all animal food items pork constitutes the majority of meat consumed in china its per capita consumption increased from 11 kg in 1981 to 21 kg in 2017 an increase of nearly 50 beef is considered a luxury food in china annual beef consumption accounted for only 2 0 3 kg person of total meat consumption in 1981 however this value increased to 6 2 8 kg person by 2017 among non traditional chinese food items milk and eggs saw 753 and 317 increases in consumption respectively over the 36 year period poultry consumption saw the most dramatic increase among all food items increasing by more than 1000 from 1981 to 2017 3 2 climate change during china s peak population period in order to better grasp the climate change characteristics during the peak population period which will directly impact future agricultural water supply and demand in china we compared possible climate change scenarios from rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the peak population period of 2029 2033 relative to the historical period of 2013 2017 based on data released by the national climate center of china the average annual precipitation and et 0 values from 2013 2017 are shown in fig 4 fig 4a shows a map of china s average annual precipitation which gradually increases from northwest to southeast during the historical period the mean annual precipitation was 635 mm and the area of relatively low precipitation 400 mm was 3 95 million km2 constituting about 41 of china s land area meanwhile the area of relatively high precipitation 800 mm accounted for only 27 of china s land area the spatial trend in average annual et 0 is opposite that of precipitation fig 4b northwest china is the region with the highest et 0 with values typically exceeding 1350 mm the lowest et 0 values in china are distributed in the northeast and southwest regions the mean annual et 0 in china was 842 mm over the 2013 2017 period this value was one third more than the mean annual precipitation fig 5 shows precipitation and et 0 during the peak population period and the historical period under various climate scenarios china s mean annual precipitation during the peak population period is expected to be lower than during the historical period the decrease is expected to be 3 5 613 mm 6 5 594 mm or 6 0 597 mm under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively the arid northwest is expected to become the region of greatest precipitation reduction in china with a decrease of more than 50 despite abundant precipitation in southeast china during the historical period fig 4a precipitation in this region is expected to decrease to various degrees in the future with the largest decrease appearing in the rcp4 5 scenario and the smallest decrease appearing in the rcp2 6 scenario fig 5a b c in contrast with precipitation et 0 during the population peak period is expected to generally be higher than during the historical period the expected increases under scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are 5 1 885 mm 7 4 904 mm and 6 1 893 mm respectively from a regional perspective the future et 0 is expected to decrease in the north while increasing in the south fig 5d e f the decrease in precipitation and the increase in et 0 will undoubtedly place new pressure on china s agricultural water supply security in the future this study uses rhi to reflect the impact of future climate change on meteorological drought in china s 13 main food producing provinces fig 6 as shown in fig 6 only hebei rhi 0 165 moderate drought and nei mongolia rhi 0 649 exceptionally drought faced drought in the historical period however the degree of meteorological drought in the main food producing provinces is expected to gradually deepen with climate change for example shandong and henan are expected to shift from no drought in the historical period to moderate drought in the peak population period under all three climate scenarios hebei is expected to shift to severe drought rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and the drought level in jinlin is expected to almost reach moderate drought under rcp8 5 the average rhi in the 13 main food producing provinces in the historical period was 0 678 and this value is expected to decrease to 0 095 0 021 or 0 039 under scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 although the average rhi in the peak population period did not reach drought level rhi 0 15 for the nation as a whole under these climate scenarios the decline in rhi means that china s agricultural water security will shift in an unfavorable direction 3 3 effects of change in food habits population scale and climate on agricultural water in china in the future the future levels of agricultural water demand depend largely on food habits future population scale and climate conditions at present china has surpassed the united states to become the world s most obese country and a dysfunctional food consumption pattern has become the main reason for the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in china abarca gomez et al 2018 in order to improve health conditions for people across the country nutritionists have recommended food habits suitable for the chinese people the physical condition activity intensity dietary preferences protein and calorie requirements of the chinese are considered by this recommended food habits chinese nutrition society 2016 compared with the current diet the recommended food habits suggest reducing the consumption of wheat and rice while increasing the consumption of vegetables fruits maize potatoes and other starchy roots in particular the recommended food habits emphasize the importance of drinking milk which is currently consumed at less than one sixth the recommended level table 3 to predict the impact of food habit changes population scale expansion and climate change on agricultural water demand in the peak population period the current food habits s1 and the recommended food habits s2 were used as two scenarios for predicting future diet under climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the average value of each food item in the recommended food habits was used in our research in addition this study assumed that the impact of climate change on crop yields and water use efficiency during the peak population period is the same as the historical period and that the agricultural technological conditions is equivalent in these two periods the total water required for food production during the peak population period is shown in fig 7 according to the calculation method proposed in this study under current food habits population growth and climate change are expected to increase china s agricultural water demand to 1601 3 1616 3 billion m3 under various climate scenarios this value is 34 37 higher than the 2017 value however adoption of the recommended food habits is expected to cause china to need more water during the peak population period than during the historical period so that 1725 6 1765 5 billion m3 of water are expected to instead be required milk consumption is the main reason for the higher water requirement for the recommended diet than for the current diet the change trend of irrigation water required is similar to the total agricultural water fig 8 in 2017 195 7 billion m3 of irrigation water was required for food consumption in china and this value is expected to reach 298 0 314 7 billion m3 current diet or 319 4 337 8 billion m3 recommended diet during the peak population period depending on the climate scenario although the diet recommended by nutritionists is conducive to people s health this food consumption pattern requires more water than the current diet further increasing pressure on china s food supply to isolate the impact of population on irrigation water demand this study analyzes the per capita water requirements for different food items in the future under various climate scenarios compared with 2017 china s per capita irrigation water demand is expected to increase due to climate change by 63 3 74 8 m3 among them the maximum water consumption under rcp4 5 is 215 6 m3 while the minimum water consumption under rcp2 6 is 204 1 m3 table 4 further considering changes in dietary structure the per capita irrigation water demand of each chinese will increase by 14 6 15 7 m3 compared to the current diet during the peak population period under recommended food habits meat milk vegetable oil and eggs will likely become the most water intensive food types these respectively account for 31 0 17 2 17 0 and 14 4 of future total food related water consumption 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis this study used multi source data to analyze china s water demand for food production during the historical period 2013 2017 and the agricultural water demand during the peak population period 2029 2033 was also predicted considering population increase climate change and dietary changes our research results is consistent with previous studies for example he et al 2021 compared total food consumption related water demand by urban and rural residents in china in 2016 revealing per capita water demand of 846 m3 and 684 m3 in urban and rural areas respectively for a national average of 765 m3 our study showed that per capita water demand in china in 2016 was 784 m3 agreeing with he et al s 2021 value within 5 according to liu s research 2007 global blue water consumption for crop growth accounted for 19 of total agricultural water consumption in our study this ratio was 17 for the 2013 2017 period agreeing with liu s 2007 value within 10 in addition ju 2017 estimated that 38 of the water consumption for meat production in china in 2014 this ratio is the similar to our study during the same period fig 7 future agricultural water demand is directly related to crop yields for each food type however our study assumed that the impact of climate change and agricultural technology on crop yields during the peak population period is the same as in 2017 this assumption constitutes a source of error for our future water demand predictions for arid regions soil water is an important water source to compensate et 0 during crop growth but our study ignores the contribution of soil water to agricultural water due to the lack of reliable national scale data which may lead to our overestimation of irrigation water consumption on the other hand this study did not consider the water demand of economic crops such as cotton medicinal materials tea and spices we also ignored food losses in production transportation and consumption which may lead to uncertainties in water requirements most areas in china use insufficient irrigation pattern to meet crop water needs however this parameter was not considered in this study this may lead to an overestimation of irrigation water in china finally a large quantity of additional water is needed to dilute agricultural pollutants such as fertilizers and pesticides in this study we did not consider the impact of agricultural pollution on the water environment which will cause errors in the calculation of china s future agricultural water demand 4 2 sustainability of agricultural water security during china s peak population period research on the relationship between climate change and food security has become the focus of global attention according to our research with the decrease of precipitation and the increase of et 0 china s 13 main food producing provinces will face a more serious threat of drought in the future he et al 2015 analyzed the relationship between climate change and grain production in china their research results showed that the reduction in precipitation will directly lead to a reduction in food production for every 1 reduction in precipitation rice production will decrease on average by 0 045 0 081 due to the huge population size of china changes in the agricultural water supply and demand caused by climate variation has become an important issue affecting china s food security facing a severe shortage of agricultural water resources china implemented a water consumption restriction policy beginning in 2012 zang et al 2016 according to this policy the mandatory target for national water consumption in 2030 is 696 billion m3 and the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water the ratio of surface water used by crops to the total irrigation volume applied must be improved from the current 0 55 0 6 by 2030 assuming that the industrial composition of china in 2030 will be similar to that in 2017 the difference between current irrigation water use and available water during the peak population period allowed by the policy inc irri is only 35 8 billion m3 and some main food producing provinces even have no additional irrigation water indicators table 4 provides a further analysis of the pressure on china s agriculture water security during the peak population period by comparing inc irri and irrigation water demand in the 13 main food producing provinces under various scenarios table 4 shows that recent increases in irrigation water demand in china are not expected to be able to be met in the peak population period neither in the main food producing provinces nor in the country as a whole during peak population periods china s irrigation water demand is expected to exceed that of the historical period by 102 3 142 1 billion m3 however the available water for agriculture during the same period is only 35 8 billion m3 and water demand is therefore expected to exceed supply by a factor of 2 5 although shandong has the best irrigation water supply 3 5 billion m3 among the 13 main food producing provinces agriculture in shandong is expected to become unsustainable even under the scenario with the smallest increase in irrigation water demand in the future s1 rcp2 6 3 6 billion m3 jiangsu and anhui have no potential additional capacity for irrigation water supply due to policy constraints but the irrigation water needs of these two provinces are expected to be as high as 11 9 16 6 billion m3 during peak population periods representing approximately 12 of the national total and 21 of the total across the main food producing provinces together population growth climate change and food habit changes are expected to significantly increase the difficulty of ensuring irrigation water security during the peak population period the achievement of future irrigation water security will be an urgent challenge for china s governments scientists and related practitioners table 5 4 3 strategic choice of china s food security guarantee under water shortage conditions given the severe agricultural water security situation several effective measures have been proposed in china for example the national water conservation action plan was introduced in 2019 by the central government this plan requires that all provinces vigorously promote the modernization of irrigation areas and improve the efficiency of irrigation water use according to this plan china is to establish 150 water saving irrigation areas and 100 agricultural water saving demonstration areas by 2022 taking into account the planting structure and climatic characteristics of different regions some agronomic water saving measures have been widely promoted and applied in china for example in the arid northwestern region drip irrigation under mulch is widely used in planting cotton and fruit in the northeastern and northern china drought resistant varieties of rice and wheat have been widely promoted in the past decades moreover china has conducted a large number of water saving planting experiments on various crops in order to scientifically reduce water consumption china also plans to reform agricultural water prices and establish a reasonable agricultural water subsidy policy at present the water price in china covers only 25 of its cost the cheap water price is considered to provide an insufficient incentive for farmers to conserve water the low water price also places financial pressure on the normal operation of water supply enterprises china s first national level water rights trading platform was established in 2016 the purpose of establishing this platform was to effectively manage water rights transactions in various regions and industries mainly agriculture as of 2020 approximately 272 million m3 of water have been traded with a total transaction value exceeding 300 million yuan in addition to the measures that have already been adopted there are three other promising options for ensuring agricultural water security during the peak population period in china the first is to reduce the ineffective waste of food in the process of production transportation and consumption the consumption of water condensed in food production is positively related to food consumption so food waste is a waste of water resources according to china urban food waste report world wide fund for nature 2018 the per capita food waste rate in china has reached 12 while the food waste rate at gatherings is as high as 38 which means that tens of billions of irrigation water are lost in vain every year there are many effective ways to reduce food waste such as shopping wisely avoiding overeating optimizing the food transportation network and mastering additional food preservation methods the second promising option is to moderately increase imports of water intensive foods meats milk vegetable oils and eggs are expected to be the most water intensive food types in china in the future but china does not have inherent advantages in the production of these four food items compared to other countries for example the average feed conversion ratio of chinese pork farming is 3 4 which is 21 higher than in the united states china s current soybean oil extraction rate is 17 while this ratio is about 20 in the united states and 19 in brazil therefore moderate imports of water intensive foods would help to close the gap between the supply and demand of agricultural water the third promising option is to develop an effective agricultural water management system although water resources have become an important factor affecting food security china s agricultural water resources are currently managed by various departments such as the ministry of agriculture the ministry of water resources the ministry of ecology and environment and the ministry of natural resources this management pattern undoubtedly increases the difficulty of implementing effective water use 5 conclusion food habit changes climate change and population expansion were examined as three key factors affecting global agricultural water security as the largest food and water consumer in the world evaluating the impact of these factors on china s agricultural water demand during peak population period is very important to ensure the security of food and water in this study data from multiple sources were collected and compiled to analyze changes in food habits during 1981 2017 and climate during the peak population period moreover the size of future agricultural water demand was also calculated under two food habit scenarios and three climate scenarios our results show that compared to the historical period china s mean annual precipitation during the peak population period is expected to be lower by 3 5 613 mm 6 5 594 mm or 6 0 597 mm under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively meanwhile reference evaporation during the population peak period is expected to generally be higher than during the historical period by 5 1 885 mm 7 4 904 mm or 6 1 893 mm for climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively this climate change pattern is expected to increase the drought degree of china s 13 main food producing provinces furthermore we project that if 2017 crop yields hold true in the future the irrigation water demand will increase to 298 0 314 7 billion m3 during china s peak population period under current food habits in different climate scenarios and 319 4 337 8 billion m3 of irrigation water will be required under recommended food habits from a per capita perspective due to climate change china s per capita irrigation water demand during the population peak period is expected to exceed the 2017 value by 63 3 74 8 m3 if the recommended diet is adopted then per capita irrigation water demand is expected to increase by a further 14 6 15 7 m3 meat milk vegetable oil and eggs will likely become the most water intensive food types in the population peak period adequate agricultural water supply is the basis for ensuring china s food safety during the peak population period however the recent increase in water demand has exceeded the upper limit of available agricultural water according to the government s water policy to ensure the coordinated security of water and food in china we propose three recommendations 1 reduce the ineffective waste of food in the process of production transportation and consumption 2 increase imports of water intensive foods from other counties 3 develop an effective agricultural water management system to replace the current system in which the agricultural water supply is jointly managed by multiple departments ensuring china s agricultural water safety is gradually becoming a huge challenge due to the increase in water demand and the decrease in water availability looking forward analysis of the comprehensive impact of a range of

9880,rapid changes in food habits climate and population size are expected to substantially challenge the sustainable use of china s agricultural water supply undoubtedly increasing the uncertainty of china s food security this study analyzes the change characteristics of china s food habits during 1981 2017 and the amount agricultural water for food production during peak population period 2029 2033 has also projected based on different food habits and climate scenarios the results show that china s food habits changed dramatically from mainly vegetable dominated to animal dominated during 1981 2017 compared to the historical period 2013 2017 the decrease in precipitation and the increase in evapotranspiration in the peak population period will increase the drought degree in china s thirteen main food producing provinces during peak population period the irrigation water demand will increase to 298 0 314 7 billion m3 under current food habits and 319 4 337 8 billion m3 under recommended food habits in different climate scenarios respectively these values are much higher than those of the historical period e g 195 7 billion m3 in 2017 moreover compared with 2017 china s future per capita irrigation water demand is expected to increase by 63 3 74 8 m3 due to climate change if food habit changes are further adopted then per capita irrigation water demand is expected to increase even more by 77 9 90 5 m3 this study also proposes various measures to ensure china s agricultural water security based on the presented findings key words agricultural water food habits climate change population china 1 introduction in many parts of the world especially in arid and semi arid regions the limited water resources is constitute a major constraint on the development of agricultural production at present agricultural water already accounts for 70 of global freshwater withdrawal shabbir et al 2014 given current global population expansion global agricultural water consumption may increase from the current 2700 billion m3 to 3200 billion m3 in 2050 by then about 6 billion people or 67 of the global population will face water shortage due to the extreme water withdrawals needed for food production united nations educational scientific and cultural organization 2012 2015 meanwhile increasing disturbance to the water cycle by extreme weather is also expected to increase the instability of the global agricultural water supply gosling and arnell 2016 as the most populous country in the world ensuring china s adequate food supply has always been a core issue of government concern in 2013 china s central government proposed the goal of guaranteeing the absolute safety of rations wheat and rice and in 2020 it further proposed a goal of strengthening national capacity to ensure adequate supplies of other important food items the state council 2020 however climate variation population expansion and changes in food habits have put tremendous pressure on the sustainable use of china s agricultural water he et al 2020 in order to prevent the rapid growth of water consumption from destroying water resources the chinese government published the report opinions of the state council on the implementation of the most stringent water resources management also called the three red lines policy of water resources in 2012 this report sets an upper limit target for agricultural water consumption to be met by 2030 the state council 2012 this policy will undoubtedly intensify the conflict between water resource protection and food security in china with the continuous increase of income the food habits shift from plant based to animal based has become a general trend in many developing countries behrens et al 2010 kumar et al 2012 this shift often means greater agricultural water consumption liu et al 2008 for example vanham et al 2016 analyzed the impact of food consumption on water resources in dutch cities finding that the per capita water footprint related to food consumption in some metropolitan areas such as amsterdam and rotterdam is 119 l cap day higher than other cities due to more meat and cereals and less potatoes consumption vanham also calculated the water footprint of austria for various diets vanham 2013 finding that the current austrian diet makes excessive use of sugar crop oils meat milk products and eggs in per capita terms this diet significantly increases the water footprint 3655 l day compared to a diet making more use of cereals rice potatoes vegetables and fruit similar findings were also determined for the case of california according to marlow et al 2009 a livestock dominated diet consumed 2 9 times more water than a vegetable dominated diet in california with beef consumption making the strongest contribution to the disparity food habit changes also pose great challenges for china s water resources based on the research of liu et al 2008 the global water crisis is expected to be driven by economic development and population expansion in china the drastic shift toward protein rich diets is the main cause of china s water shortage he et al 2019 evaluated the impact of china s food habit changes on agricultural water demand during 1981 2016 using data collected from multiple sources they concluded that china s irrigation water demand for food production increased from 159 billion m3 in 1981 184 billion m3 in 2016 as of 1996 food habit shifts have surpassed population expansion as the main reason for china s agricultural water growth the relationship between future agricultural water demand and food production has also been discussed mancosu et al 2015 ibarrola rivas et al 2017 these studies believe that food habits change will exacerbate the global water crisis and 40 of the global population in 2050 will live in countries with not enough water to meet the demands some particularly populous countries such as china and india will face greater pressure than others on water resources the impact of climate change on agricultural water security is another topic that has been widely discussed in recent years mathur and achutarao 2020 grusson et al 2021 generally climate affects agricultural water use in two ways on the one hand by changing the key elements of crop growth such as precipitation evaporation and radiation climate change will have a direct impact on agricultural water supply and demand on the other hand climate change has a significant impact on crop yields thereby affecting crop water productivity indirectly over the past few decades no significant change in global precipitation has been observed but the warming climate has caused a significant increase in average evaporation moreover intensified weather fluctuations have caused massive changes in the spatial characteristics of agricultural water supply and demand in various regions su and feng 2015 robert et al 2017 according to zhang and cai 2013 the climate change driven global water deficits for irrigation and rain fed crops during the period 2070 2099 will reach 1289 and 2871 km3 respectively compared to 1961 1990 india china and the united states will become the most water scarce countries in the future due to their huge food consumption demand rosa et al 2020 further analyzed the impact of climate change on agricultural water shortage from the perspective of water footprint they found that the current water shortage in india and china is mainly due to an insufficient supply of irrigation water while the united states and argentina suffer mainly from insufficient precipitation ko and ahuja 2013 used crop growth models to predict the impact of climate change on wheat and corn yields in the central great plains of the united states the results showed that the predicted yields of wheat and corn in 2050 and 2075 will be significantly reduced and water use efficiency will also decline due to the yield decreases for the combined climate change scenarios of co2 temperature and precipitation due to widespread food security concerns climate change research focused on china s agricultural water has increased over the years xu et al 2019 used five global climate models to analyze the impact of climate change on irrigation water demand in northeast china based their research average irrigation water demand has a 50 chance of increasing 1 1 8 times by the 2050 s under extreme climate conditions such an increase would cause a significant shortfall for local corn production guo and shen 2016 estimated the water availability and agricultural water demand under future climate change scenarios in arid northwest china they showed that irrigation water demand will increase by 4 27 6 15 billion m3 over the next 60 years due to temperature rise while annual runoff in this region will increase by 4 8 8 5 billion m3 however this increase in runoff may not be able to support the increase in irrigation water demand the macro or micro relationship in china between climate agricultural water drought and crop fields has also been studied extensively from a range of perspectives zhang et al 2018 amnuaylojaroen and chanvichit 2019 although existing studies have addressed individual intervariable relationships food habits water or climate water from various perspectives and presented many useful conclusions few studies have considered the comprehensive impact of multiple factors on agricultural water at a national level but in fact consideration of this comprehensive impact is of the greatest significance to ensuring national water and food security moreover to our knowledge there are no comprehensive analyses of the impacts of future food habit changes and climate variation on agricultural water requirements during peak population periods china remains the largest food consumer in the world so ensuring the sustainability of its water consumption for food production is significant not only for china s economic development and social stability but also for global food patterns given the the changing trend of developing countries food habits from plant based to animal based the present analysis of the impact of food habit shifts and climate variation on china s water security during its peak population period 2029 2033 can also provide a reference for other developing countries the remainder of this paper is organized as follows 1 changes in china s food habit patterns during the 1981 2017 period are introduced and climate characteristics during peak population period are estimated 2 china s total agricultural water and irrigation water requirements during the peak population period are projected under two food habit scenarios and three climate scenarios 3 strategies are put forward to ensure agricultural water security during china s peak population period based on the future water demand situation 2 methods and data 2 1 study area china consists of 32 provinces autonomous regions and municipal cities of which 13 provinces have been designated as main food producing areas by the china central government hebei nei mongolia liaoning jilin heilongjiang jiangsu anhui jiangxi shandong henan hubei hunan and sichuan fig 1 these main food producing provinces are considered the foundation for china s food security arable land in these 13 provinces accounts for 66 of arable land in china and food production in these 13 provinces accounts for more than 75 of the country s total china can be roughly divided into two parts south and north by the 800 mm isohyet however the arable land area in arid north china accounts for 60 of china s total arable land area he et al 2018 due to the large quantity of groundwater extraction for irrigation in north china china has become the world s second largest consumer of groundwater just behind india the plain of north china has also become one of the largest groundwater funnel areas in the world feng et al 2013 2 2 data sources the data used in this study can be divided into three categories 1 to reflect the rapid changes in china s food habits from 1981 to 2017 nine vegetable food items and seven animal food items were considered based on chinese eating habits considered vegetable foods included wheat rice maize fruits vegetable oils vegetables beans sugar and potatoes and other starchy roots considered animal foods included pork beef poultry eggs milk fish and seafood and mutton and goat meats the consumption data for these food items were collected from the china statistical yearbook and the china food yearbook 2 the historical climate data required to calculate reference evaporation et 0 mm and effective precipitation in years 2013 2017 were acquired from 777 national meteorological stations the daily records of these stations were collected from the national meteorological information center 3 future climate data were output by five global climate models ipsl cm5a lr gfdl esm2m noresm1 m hadgem2 es and miroc esm chem the national climate center of china used a statistical bias correction methodology to process climate data this bias correction based on a fitted histogram equalization function which was proposed by piani et al 2010 and has been proven to exhibit high accuracy moreover a bilinear interpolation method was used for downscaling climate data at a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 the good accuracy of the resulting data produced by national climate center of china was demonstrated in the third national assessment report on climate change wang et al 2019 to calculate et 0 and effective precipitation in china during peak population we used eight climate elements for the years 2029 2033 under climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 mean maximum and minimum air temperature precipitation total solar radiation mean relative humidity ground pressure and near surface mean wind speed each climate element under scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 is obtained by averaging the relevant data of five global climate models 2 3 methods 2 3 1 agricultural water requirements for food consumption the annual per capita consumption of vegetable foods g i veg kg cap can be divided into two categories indirect and direct indirect vegetable foods f i veg ind kg cap such as vegetable oil and sugar need to be converted from other crops and the conversion efficiencies s i of vegetable oil and sugar in china are 17 and 13 respectively he et al 2021 direct vegetable foods f i veg dir kg cap can be eaten directly without conversion including wheat rice maize beans vegetables fruits and potatoes and other starchy roots the annual consumption of vegetable foods can be calculated as follows 1 g i v e g f i v e g ind s i f i v e g d i r the total agricultural water required for crop growth is equal to the sum of irrigation water and precipitation in growing seasons i e 2 w i v e g w i i r r i w i p r e c where w i veg w i irri and w i prec are the total agricultural water mm irrigation water mm and precipitation mm requirements of each type of crop growth in its growing season respectively the total agricultural water requirements for crop growth should compensate for evapotranspiration loss from a crop field which is related to et 0 and the crop coefficient jiang et al 2017 the penman monteith equation is widely used to evaluate et 0 and has been proven to exhibit high accuracy this equation is therefore also used in our study 3 w i veg et 0 k c i 4 et 0 0 408 r n g γ 900 273 t u 2 e a e d γ 1 0 34 u 2 where k c i is the crop coefficient of each type of crop i is the slope of the vapor pressure curve kpa c r n and g are the net radiation mj m2 d and soil heat flux mj m2 d respectively γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c t is the mean daily air temperature c u 2 is the daily average wind speed m s at a height of 2 m and e a and e d are the saturation vapor pressure kpa and actual atmospheric water vapor pressure kpa respectively for crop growth only the effective precipitation that can be absorbed during the growth period in this study the usda scs equation was adopted to calculate effective precipitation 5 p i eff p 125 0 2 p 125 p 250 mm m 125 0 1 p p 250 mm m where p i eff and p are the monthly effective precipitation mm and monthly total precipitation mm respectively the irrigation water requirement is calculated as the difference between w i veg and p i eff when p i eff is greater than w i veg w i veg may be met by rainfall without irrigation regardless irrigation water is needed for crop growth during each crop s growing season 6 w i prec w i veg w i veg p i eff p i eff w i veg p i eff 7 w i irri w i veg p i eff w i veg p i eff in addition to climate factors the annual precipitation and irrigation water demands of vegetable foods are also related to china s population size the various cropping situations of different crops crop yield and food self sufficiency rate 8 t veg p r e c w i p r e c g i v e g b i m c i i r i s e l f p o p u l a t i o n 9 t veg irr w i irr g i v e g b i m c i i r i s e l f p o p u l a t i o n where t water prec and t water irri are the annual precipitation m3 and irrigation water m3 requirements for vegetable food consumption respectively b i is the area of arable land demand to produce 1 kg of each type of crop m2 kg mci i represents the multiple cropping index for each type of crop due to the wide variation of mci i across different crops and different regions the average mci i in china was used in our study according to he et al 2019 r i self is the food self sufficiency rate of each crop according to previous studies r i self was set at 95 zhao and cui 2013 the water requirements for animal food can be defined as the total water use required to grow the animal s feed clean its housing and provide its drinking water over its entire life span due to differences in climatic conditions and crop planting structure feed types vary greatly across countries according to wang and lv 2012 feed grain accounts for the majority of china s feed consumption with wheat corn and beans accounting for 18 59 and 23 of feed grain respectively therefore the annual precipitation and irrigation water requirements for feed growth can be calculated according to eqs 10 and 11 and the total water and irrigation water requirements for animal food consumption can be calculated according to eqs 12 and 13 10 w f e e d p r e c w w h e a t p r e c 18 w c o r n p r e c 59 w b e a n p r e c 23 11 w f e e d irri w w h e a t irri 18 w c o r n irri 59 w b e a n

water mm requirements for feed growth respectively w wheat prec w corn prec and w bean prec are the precipitation requirements for wheat corn and beans respectively during each crop s growing season mm w wheat irri w corn irri and w bean irri are the irrigation water requirements for wheat corn and beans respectively during each crop s growing season mm w i ani and w i ani irri are the total water and irrigation water respectively required to produce 1 kg of each type of animal food m3 kg and w i drink and w i clean respectively represent the drinking and cleaning water required to produce 1 kg of each type of animal food m3 kg as obtained from hoekstra and chapagain 2009 as in eqs 8 and 9 the total water t ani m3 and irrigation water t ani irri m3 demands for various animal foods can be calculated as follows 14 t ani w i a n i f i a n i z i f c r r i s e l f p o p u l a t i o n 15 t ani irri w i a n i i r r i f i a n i z i f c r r i s e l f p o p u l a t i o n where f i ani is the per capita annual consumption of animal food in category i kg cap z i fcr is the feed conversion ratio of animal food in category i according to a series of reports and academic journal articles in general the total water tw m3 and irrigation water requirements tw irri m3 for food consumption in china can be respectively calculated as 16 t w t veg p r e c t v e g i r r i t a n i 17 t w irri t veg irri t ani i r r i 2 3 2 china s peak population forecast population peak forecasting serves as the basis for any country s formulation of long term agricultural water management policies as the most populous country in the world china has been the subject of various studies of population growth scenario predictions table 1 these studies generally have found that due to the ever increasing pressure of life and work china s birth rate is expected to continue to decrease and the national population is expected to consequently peak in the next decade according to the research results shown in table 1 china s population will probably peak in 2029 2033 with a peak population of 1 42 1 50 billion therefore this study takes 2029 2033 as china s population peak period and selects the average population forecast 1 46 billion as the maximum population size 2 3 3 meteorological drought grade the relative humidity index rhi reflects the regional meteorological drought grade by considering the balance of water consumption due to the rhi is simple to calculate and has clear physical meaning it is have been widely used as the national recommended standards for evaluating meteorological drought in china guo et al 2016 zhang and wang 2021 as shown in table 2 the value of of rhi are given as five levels standardization administration of china 2017 and the rhi is expressed as eq 18 18 r h i p e t 0 e t 0 3 results 3 1 food habit changes in china from 1981 to 2017 with the rapid increase in income the food habits of chinese people has undergone significant changes over the last 36 years as the core of traditional chinese food habits the per capita consumption of grain wheat rice and maize continues to decline in 1981 the per capita annual consumption amounts of grain were 267 kg account for 62 of total vegetable food consumption whereas the consumption value of grain dropped to 124 kg in 2017 and the proportion also dropped to 42 in vegetable foods fig 2 although china accounts for 50 of global vegetable production annual domestic consumption of vegetables decreased from 138 kg person in 1981 99 kg person in 2017 a decline of 28 contrary to the change trend of grains and vegetables fruits is the fastest growing vegetable food item in china the per capita consumption amount of fruits increased by 5 4 times from 1981 to 2017 meanwhile the rapid growth of consumption of vegetable oil and beans has become a huge challenge to china s food security in recent years at present the domestic production of soybeans can only meet 15 of the demand soybean oil and soybeans account for approximately 50 of total vegetable oil consumption and 90 of bean consumption respectively china annually imports 90 million tons of soybeans or about a quarter of global production the per capita consumption of animal foods from 1981 to 2017 in china is provided in fig 3 which shows growth trends for all animal food items pork constitutes the majority of meat consumed in china its per capita consumption increased from 11 kg in 1981 to 21 kg in 2017 an increase of nearly 50 beef is considered a luxury food in china annual beef consumption accounted for only 2 0 3 kg person of total meat consumption in 1981 however this value increased to 6 2 8 kg person by 2017 among non traditional chinese food items milk and eggs saw 753 and 317 increases in consumption respectively over the 36 year period poultry consumption saw the most dramatic increase among all food items increasing by more than 1000 from 1981 to 2017 3 2 climate change during china s peak population period in order to better grasp the climate change characteristics during the peak population period which will directly impact future agricultural water supply and demand in china we compared possible climate change scenarios from rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for the peak population period of 2029 2033 relative to the historical period of 2013 2017 based on data released by the national climate center of china the average annual precipitation and et 0 values from 2013 2017 are shown in fig 4 fig 4a shows a map of china s average annual precipitation which gradually increases from northwest to southeast during the historical period the mean annual precipitation was 635 mm and the area of relatively low precipitation 400 mm was 3 95 million km2 constituting about 41 of china s land area meanwhile the area of relatively high precipitation 800 mm accounted for only 27 of china s land area the spatial trend in average annual et 0 is opposite that of precipitation fig 4b northwest china is the region with the highest et 0 with values typically exceeding 1350 mm the lowest et 0 values in china are distributed in the northeast and southwest regions the mean annual et 0 in china was 842 mm over the 2013 2017 period this value was one third more than the mean annual precipitation fig 5 shows precipitation and et 0 during the peak population period and the historical period under various climate scenarios china s mean annual precipitation during the peak population period is expected to be lower than during the historical period the decrease is expected to be 3 5 613 mm 6 5 594 mm or 6 0 597 mm under the rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively the arid northwest is expected to become the region of greatest precipitation reduction in china with a decrease of more than 50 despite abundant precipitation in southeast china during the historical period fig 4a precipitation in this region is expected to decrease to various degrees in the future with the largest decrease appearing in the rcp4 5 scenario and the smallest decrease appearing in the rcp2 6 scenario fig 5a b c in contrast with precipitation et 0 during the population peak period is expected to generally be higher than during the historical period the expected increases under scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 are 5 1 885 mm 7 4 904 mm and 6 1 893 mm respectively from a regional perspective the future et 0 is expected to decrease in the north while increasing in the south fig 5d e f the decrease in precipitation and the increase in et 0 will undoubtedly place new pressure on china s agricultural water supply security in the future this study uses rhi to reflect the impact of future climate change on meteorological drought in china s 13 main food producing provinces fig 6 as shown in fig 6 only hebei rhi 0 165 moderate drought and nei mongolia rhi 0 649 exceptionally drought faced drought in the historical period however the degree of meteorological drought in the main food producing provinces is expected to gradually deepen with climate change for example shandong and henan are expected to shift from no drought in the historical period to moderate drought in the peak population period under all three climate scenarios hebei is expected to shift to severe drought rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and the drought level in jinlin is expected to almost reach moderate drought under rcp8 5 the average rhi in the 13 main food producing provinces in the historical period was 0 678 and this value is expected to decrease to 0 095 0 021 or 0 039 under scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 although the average rhi in the peak population period did not reach drought level rhi 0 15 for the nation as a whole under these climate scenarios the decline in rhi means that china s agricultural water security will shift in an unfavorable direction 3 3 effects of change in food habits population scale and climate on agricultural water in china in the future the future levels of agricultural water demand depend largely on food habits future population scale and climate conditions at present china has surpassed the united states to become the world s most obese country and a dysfunctional food consumption pattern has become the main reason for the high incidence of cardiovascular disease in china abarca gomez et al 2018 in order to improve health conditions for people across the country nutritionists have recommended food habits suitable for the chinese people the physical condition activity intensity dietary preferences protein and calorie requirements of the chinese are considered by this recommended food habits chinese nutrition society 2016 compared with the current diet the recommended food habits suggest reducing the consumption of wheat and rice while increasing the consumption of vegetables fruits maize potatoes and other starchy roots in particular the recommended food habits emphasize the importance of drinking milk which is currently consumed at less than one sixth the recommended level table 3 to predict the impact of food habit changes population scale expansion and climate change on agricultural water demand in the peak population period the current food habits s1 and the recommended food habits s2 were used as two scenarios for predicting future diet under climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the average value of each food item in the recommended food habits was used in our research in addition this study assumed that the impact of climate change on crop yields and water use efficiency during the peak population period is the same as the historical period and that the agricultural technological conditions is equivalent in these two periods the total water required for food production during the peak population period is shown in fig 7 according to the calculation method proposed in this study under current food habits population growth and climate change are expected to increase china s agricultural water demand to 1601 3 1616 3 billion m3 under various climate scenarios this value is 34 37 higher than the 2017 value however adoption of the recommended food habits is expected to cause china to need more water during the peak population period than during the historical period so that 1725 6 1765 5 billion m3 of water are expected to instead be required milk consumption is the main reason for the higher water requirement for the recommended diet than for the current diet the change trend of irrigation water required is similar to the total agricultural water fig 8 in 2017 195 7 billion m3 of irrigation water was required for food consumption in china and this value is expected to reach 298 0 314 7 billion m3 current diet or 319 4 337 8 billion m3 recommended diet during the peak population period depending on the climate scenario although the diet recommended by nutritionists is conducive to people s health this food consumption pattern requires more water than the current diet further increasing pressure on china s food supply to isolate the impact of population on irrigation water demand this study analyzes the per capita water requirements for different food items in the future under various climate scenarios compared with 2017 china s per capita irrigation water demand is expected to increase due to climate change by 63 3 74 8 m3 among them the maximum water consumption under rcp4 5 is 215 6 m3 while the minimum water consumption under rcp2 6 is 204 1 m3 table 4 further considering changes in dietary structure the per capita irrigation water demand of each chinese will increase by 14 6 15 7 m3 compared to the current diet during the peak population period under recommended food habits meat milk vegetable oil and eggs will likely become the most water intensive food types these respectively account for 31 0 17 2 17 0 and 14 4 of future total food related water consumption 4 discussion 4 1 uncertainty analysis this study used multi source data to analyze china s water demand for food production during the historical period 2013 2017 and the agricultural water demand during the peak population period 2029 2033 was also predicted considering population increase climate change and dietary changes our research results is consistent with previous studies for example he et al 2021 compared total food consumption related water demand by urban and rural residents in china in 2016 revealing per capita water demand of 846 m3 and 684 m3 in urban and rural areas respectively for a national average of 765 m3 our study showed that per capita water demand in china in 2016 was 784 m3 agreeing with he et al s 2021 value within 5 according to liu s research 2007 global blue water consumption for crop growth accounted for 19 of total agricultural water consumption in our study this ratio was 17 for the 2013 2017 period agreeing with liu s 2007 value within 10 in addition ju 2017 estimated that 38 of the water consumption for meat production in china in 2014 this ratio is the similar to our study during the same period fig 7 future agricultural water demand is directly related to crop yields for each food type however our study assumed that the impact of climate change and agricultural technology on crop yields during the peak population period is the same as in 2017 this assumption constitutes a source of error for our future water demand predictions for arid regions soil water is an important water source to compensate et 0 during crop growth but our study ignores the contribution of soil water to agricultural water due to the lack of reliable national scale data which may lead to our overestimation of irrigation water consumption on the other hand this study did not consider the water demand of economic crops such as cotton medicinal materials tea and spices we also ignored food losses in production transportation and consumption which may lead to uncertainties in water requirements most areas in china use insufficient irrigation pattern to meet crop water needs however this parameter was not considered in this study this may lead to an overestimation of irrigation water in china finally a large quantity of additional water is needed to dilute agricultural pollutants such as fertilizers and pesticides in this study we did not consider the impact of agricultural pollution on the water environment which will cause errors in the calculation of china s future agricultural water demand 4 2 sustainability of agricultural water security during china s peak population period research on the relationship between climate change and food security has become the focus of global attention according to our research with the decrease of precipitation and the increase of et 0 china s 13 main food producing provinces will face a more serious threat of drought in the future he et al 2015 analyzed the relationship between climate change and grain production in china their research results showed that the reduction in precipitation will directly lead to a reduction in food production for every 1 reduction in precipitation rice production will decrease on average by 0 045 0 081 due to the huge population size of china changes in the agricultural water supply and demand caused by climate variation has become an important issue affecting china s food security facing a severe shortage of agricultural water resources china implemented a water consumption restriction policy beginning in 2012 zang et al 2016 according to this policy the mandatory target for national water consumption in 2030 is 696 billion m3 and the effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water the ratio of surface water used by crops to the total irrigation volume applied must be improved from the current 0 55 0 6 by 2030 assuming that the industrial composition of china in 2030 will be similar to that in 2017 the difference between current irrigation water use and available water during the peak population period allowed by the policy inc irri is only 35 8 billion m3 and some main food producing provinces even have no additional irrigation water indicators table 4 provides a further analysis of the pressure on china s agriculture water security during the peak population period by comparing inc irri and irrigation water demand in the 13 main food producing provinces under various scenarios table 4 shows that recent increases in irrigation water demand in china are not expected to be able to be met in the peak population period neither in the main food producing provinces nor in the country as a whole during peak population periods china s irrigation water demand is expected to exceed that of the historical period by 102 3 142 1 billion m3 however the available water for agriculture during the same period is only 35 8 billion m3 and water demand is therefore expected to exceed supply by a factor of 2 5 although shandong has the best irrigation water supply 3 5 billion m3 among the 13 main food producing provinces agriculture in shandong is expected to become unsustainable even under the scenario with the smallest increase in irrigation water demand in the future s1 rcp2 6 3 6 billion m3 jiangsu and anhui have no potential additional capacity for irrigation water supply due to policy constraints but the irrigation water needs of these two provinces are expected to be as high as 11 9 16 6 billion m3 during peak population periods representing approximately 12 of the national total and 21 of the total across the main food producing provinces together population growth climate change and food habit changes are expected to significantly increase the difficulty of ensuring irrigation water security during the peak population period the achievement of future irrigation water security will be an urgent challenge for china s governments scientists and related practitioners table 5 4 3 strategic choice of china s food security guarantee under water shortage conditions given the severe agricultural water security situation several effective measures have been proposed in china for example the national water conservation action plan was introduced in 2019 by the central government this plan requires that all provinces vigorously promote the modernization of irrigation areas and improve the efficiency of irrigation water use according to this plan china is to establish 150 water saving irrigation areas and 100 agricultural water saving demonstration areas by 2022 taking into account the planting structure and climatic characteristics of different regions some agronomic water saving measures have been widely promoted and applied in china for example in the arid northwestern region drip irrigation under mulch is widely used in planting cotton and fruit in the northeastern and northern china drought resistant varieties of rice and wheat have been widely promoted in the past decades moreover china has conducted a large number of water saving planting experiments on various crops in order to scientifically reduce water consumption china also plans to reform agricultural water prices and establish a reasonable agricultural water subsidy policy at present the water price in china covers only 25 of its cost the cheap water price is considered to provide an insufficient incentive for farmers to conserve water the low water price also places financial pressure on the normal operation of water supply enterprises china s first national level water rights trading platform was established in 2016 the purpose of establishing this platform was to effectively manage water rights transactions in various regions and industries mainly agriculture as of 2020 approximately 272 million m3 of water have been traded with a total transaction value exceeding 300 million yuan in addition to the measures that have already been adopted there are three other promising options for ensuring agricultural water security during the peak population period in china the first is to reduce the ineffective waste of food in the process of production transportation and consumption the consumption of water condensed in food production is positively related to food consumption so food waste is a waste of water resources according to china urban food waste report world wide fund for nature 2018 the per capita food waste rate in china has reached 12 while the food waste rate at gatherings is as high as 38 which means that tens of billions of irrigation water are lost in vain every year there are many effective ways to reduce food waste such as shopping wisely avoiding overeating optimizing the food transportation network and mastering additional food preservation methods the second promising option is to moderately increase imports of water intensive foods meats milk vegetable oils and eggs are expected to be the most water intensive food types in china in the future but china does not have inherent advantages in the production of these four food items compared to other countries for example the average feed conversion ratio of chinese pork farming is 3 4 which is 21 higher than in the united states china s current soybean oil extraction rate is 17 while this ratio is about 20 in the united states and 19 in brazil therefore moderate imports of water intensive foods would help to close the gap between the supply and demand of agricultural water the third promising option is to develop an effective agricultural water management system although water resources have become an important factor affecting food security china s agricultural water resources are currently managed by various departments such as the ministry of agriculture the ministry of water resources the ministry of ecology and environment and the ministry of natural resources this management pattern undoubtedly increases the difficulty of implementing effective water use 5 conclusion food habit changes climate change and population expansion were examined as three key factors affecting global agricultural water security as the largest food and water consumer in the world evaluating the impact of these factors on china s agricultural water demand during peak population period is very important to ensure the security of food and water in this study data from multiple sources were collected and compiled to analyze changes in food habits during 1981 2017 and climate during the peak population period moreover the size of future agricultural water demand was also calculated under two food habit scenarios and three climate scenarios our results show that compared to the historical period china s mean annual precipitation during the peak population period is expected to be lower by 3 5 613 mm 6 5 594 mm or 6 0 597 mm under rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios respectively meanwhile reference evaporation during the population peak period is expected to generally be higher than during the historical period by 5 1 885 mm 7 4 904 mm or 6 1 893 mm for climate scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively this climate change pattern is expected to increase the drought degree of china s 13 main food producing provinces furthermore we project that if 2017 crop yields hold true in the future the irrigation water demand will increase to 298 0 314 7 billion m3 during china s peak population period under current food habits in different climate scenarios and 319 4 337 8 billion m3 of irrigation water will be required under recommended food habits from a per capita perspective due to climate change china s per capita irrigation water demand during the population peak period is expected to exceed the 2017 value by 63 3 74 8 m3 if the recommended diet is adopted then per capita irrigation water demand is expected to increase by a further 14 6 15 7 m3 meat milk vegetable oil and eggs will likely become the most water intensive food types in the population peak period adequate agricultural water supply is the basis for ensuring china s food safety during the peak population period however the recent increase in water demand has exceeded the upper limit of available agricultural water according to the government s water policy to ensure the coordinated security of water and food in china we propose three recommendations 1 reduce the ineffective waste of food in the process of production transportation and consumption 2 increase imports of water intensive foods from other counties 3 develop an effective agricultural water management system to replace the current system in which the agricultural water supply is jointly managed by multiple departments ensuring china s agricultural water safety is gradually becoming a huge challenge due to the increase in water demand and the decrease in water availability looking forward analysis of the comprehensive impact of a range of factors on the water food nexus is needed in order to formulate effective and feasible response plans for the sustainable use of water resources declaration of competing interest the authors declare

optimum pasture growth condition soil water demand based just in time and demand and weather forecast based justified irrigation strategies resulted in similar water use metrics though the latter consistently and marginally outperformed the former even during irrigation seasons with below normal rainfall and average irrigation supply conditions though the demand and supply based strategies

irrigators in nz that a further 25 expansion of irrigated area is possible by 2025 this expansion has largely slowed down due to the lack of availability of reliable irrigation water most of country s relevant accessible surface water resources have been fully or over allocated for some time now tait 2010 initially farmers shifted from less efficient flood irrigation strategies to more efficient

watermetrics 2021 and researchers e g srinivasan et al 2017 have been advocating for demand and weather forecast based strategies that allow for careful application of irrigation in right amounts at right places and times thereby saving water for the times of need a listing of widely practised irrigation scheduling strategies as described by the united states department of agriculture usda can be found in taghvaeian et al 2020 the strategies can be broadly classified into two groups quantitative and qualitative quantitative approaches include both demand and supply based irrigation strategies demand based strategies may use a water balance mass conservation method or a sensor that provides an estimate soil water or crop physiological condition to trigger irrigation events supply based strategies rely solely on the availability of supply e g roster irrigation the qualitative approaches described in taghvaeian et al 2020 include irrigating when a neighbour does use of a personal calendar condition of crop feel of soil and others according to the usda survey of irrigators in 2014 and 2019 usda 2014 and 2019 qualitative approaches dominate irrigation scheduling with condition of crop and feel of soil topping at 76 and 38 respectively and the most recommended quantitative approach of soil water sensing 13 was less used in the us the wide use of rule of thumb qualitative strategies have been reported worldwide e g hornbuckle et al 2009 annandale et al 2011 lea cox 2012 keen and slavich 2012 stahlmann brown 2019 a survey of rural decision makers by manaaki whenua

sensing 30 are less well used though better than their us counterparts hornbuckle et al 2009 and lea cox 2012 indicated that the cost and complexity of irrigation scheduling technology may inhibit its adoption by farmers in many cases the technologies that support irrigation decisions are perceived as a burdensome layer of management and hence ignored lea cox 2012 we hypothesize that availability of tangible returns such as reduction in irrigation use frequency and amount without compromising on soil water conditions that support crop growth from improved irrigation strategies may trigger

irrigation events e g foundation for arable research 2008 hedley et al 2010 muller et al 2018 and others the goals of our study were to quantify the performance of various supply and demand based irrigation scheduling strategies on nz dairy farms and help farmers find an effective strategy that fits their farm conditions the farm conditions considered in this study are described in the methods section and are mainly linked to irrigation demand and supply irrigation infrastructure climatic conditions and soil type to achieve these goals we developed a physically based water balance tool irriset irrigation strategy evaluation tool that simulates water use metrics for various scheduling strategies encompassing on and off farm conditions irriset simulates hydrological and economic implications of various scheduling strategies in this paper we focused on its hydrological component the economics component of irriset is described in muller et al 2018 the specific objectives of this paper are to describe the hydrology component of irriset section three and using example applications demonstrate its use in selecting fit to farm irrigation scheduling strategy sections four and five an irrigated dairy farm in north canterbury nz was chosen for tool application and data from eighteen irrigation seasons were considered in the absence of data on qualitative scheduling practices described in taghvaeian et al 2020 for nz farms two quantitative approaches demand and supply based were considered additionally a third strategy that combined supply and demand together was considered these strategies are described in detail in section 2 1 2 material and methods the irrigation scheduling strategies were examined for the period between 1999 and 2017 comprising eighteen irrigation seasons providing a range of climatic and irrigation supply and demand conditions daily rainfall and estimated penman based reference crop evapotranspiration et data were obtained from the rangiora weather station 1568483 e 5202809 s located adjacent to the case study farm the weather station is operated by the national institute of water and atmospheric research ltd and the daily data were obtained from cliflo 2020 soil water holding capacity available as plant available water paw was derived from online soil databases fundamental soil layers and s map lilburne et al 2012 2 1 irrigation scheduling strategies the scheduling strategies considered in the study were classified as follows just in case jic just in time jit and justified irrigation ji jic is a supply based strategy jit is a demand based strategy and ji combines a demand based strategy with short term rainfall forecast supply to trigger irrigations with jic a fixed amount of irrigation is triggered at a fixed frequency roster irrigation with jit and ji strategies irrigations are triggered whenever a pre set available paw was reached deficit irrigation and stopped at a pre set soil water condition see table 1 for the triggers used in the study ji also incorporates a short term supply of rainfall forecast while scheduling an irrigation event irrigation season in the case study area usually extends from october to april the months of october march and april are considered as shoulder season and november to february as peak season peak season is characterised by a larger irrigation demand i e higher evaporative losses than the shoulder season to support pasture growth the irrigation triggers for the three strategies were designed to accommodate the differences in demand between shoulder and peak seasons as shown in table 1 ji start triggers were set higher and stop triggers lower than jit to accommodate the uncertainty associated with the rainfall forecast and to leave enough storage in the soil in case the forecast rainfall exceeds the prediction based on the irrigation start and stop triggers chosen jit would be considered a good management practice by the local regulatory agency mgm 2015 robson et al 2015 and ji regarded as the best management practice kc et al 2018 2 2 irrigation season rainfall and supply reliability for the study period the average rainfall during the irrigation season october april was 327 mm varying between 143 and 577 mm the monthly rainfall data indicated that the shoulder season often received more rainfall than peak season fig 1a the case study farm draws water from a nearby river waimakariri for irrigation and the abstractions are restricted whenever the river flow falls below the regulator set limit of 63 m3s 1 at a pre set location in the river based on the observed river flow data at this pre set location for the study period the days when irrigation abstraction would have been restricted were identified over the eighteen years just as rainfall varied supply restrictions ranged from 20 to 148 days during irrigation seasons on average the case study farm would have experienced supply restriction at the source waimakariri river for 84 out of 212 213 in case of leap years days of irrigation season fig 1b most of the supply restrictions occurred between january and march largely coinciding with the peak season the waimakariri river receives flows from rainfall runoff and snowmelt from the upper end of the catchment surface drainage area 3100 km2 which extends into the alpine mountains the abstraction point is located upstream of the farm hence any local rainfall within the farm region does not add to the river flows at the abstraction point 2 3 daily water balance tool a daily water balance tool irriset was developed to compare the scheduling strategies the tool considered rainfall irrigation reference crop et and changes to available soil water within the root zone since irriset was built for irrigated pasture a root zone depth of 600 mm was assumed following recommendations from porteous et al 1994 and others here the root zone describes a crop soil water reservoir from which roots source the majority of water the tool considered on and off farm variables that influence scheduling strategies table 2 the on farm variables were et paw the capacity of irrigation infrastructure to meet the demands irrigation application efficiency ratio of actual irrigation applied by the irrigator to what it was designed to apply and consented irrigation volume the off farm variables were rainfall and river flow with flow defining the supply availability the daily tool outputs were amount of irrigation applied drainage generated and available soil water within the pasture root zone 3 development of irriset within irriset a range of temporal scales was considered for input and output variables and input parameters details of the tool variables and parameters can be found in table 2 input variables such as rainfall reference crop et supply reliability irrigation infrastructure availability and weather forecast and output variables such as irrigation applied drainage generated and available soil water within the root zone were considered at a daily time scale input variables such as irrigation triggers start and stop and soil type used to trigger irrigation in case of demand based scheduling strategies the amount of irrigation applied per event and use of weather forecast to schedule irrigation for ji were altered at a monthly scale inputs such as paw irrigation allocation for the season irrigator return interval irrigation application efficiency and duration of irrigation season were maintained the same over the entire simulation period 3 1 tool assumptions during irriset development process concepts and observations from similar pre existing operational irrigation scheduling tools were considered e g porteous et al 1994 allen et al 1998 irriset was based on several assumptions and practical application considerations as listed below a as a water balance tool irriset considered matrix flow only no macro pore flow was considered b all triggered irrigation events were completed on the same day however in a real operational farm it may take the irrigator more than a day to irrigate the whole farm therefore an irrigator return interval was used to simulate irrigator s availability for successive irrigation events the irrigator return interval signifies the frequency of irrigation events c the tool did not consider irrigation distribution uniformity across an irrigator span d the irrigation application efficiency used in the tool is a ratio of actual irrigation applied to what the irrigator was designed to apply table 2 e an irrigation supply reliability was included based on irrigation abstraction restriction at the source in the case of a supply based scheduling strategy if a particular event was missed due to a lack of supply the next event was not simulated until the next rostered date in the case of demand based scheduling strategies irrigation was applied on the next date when the supply became available f even though the tool could simulate soil water conditions for multiple soil types soils with differing paw individually irrigations were triggered based on only one soil type and same amount of irrigation was applied to all soil types no variable rate irrigation was considered g while the removal of water in excess of paw was termed as drainage in irriset in reality the excess water could be lost as either drainage or overland flow no separation of pathways was made once removed the excess water was not tracked by the tool h slow drainage simulated by irriset represented extended periods of soil saturation following large rainfall or irrigation events the drainage rates were assumed same for all events and for the entire simulation period i when using ji if the cumulated rainfall during the forecast period exceeded cumulated evaporative losses corrected for crop coefficient and available soil water described in the next section then no irrigation was triggered in a real farm while actual irrigation water use may be available but data on what triggered the events are seldom recorded often farmers mix scheduling strategies during a season based on perceived supply and demand conditions taghvaeian et al 2020 in case of supply and demand based irrigation events the triggers could be deduced based on water use and soil water data respectively in case of qualitative approaches such trigger data are not always recorded or reported however irriset does not change the scheduling strategy within and between irrigation seasons thus irriset water use metrics could not be directly compared and validated against observations irriset is designed to compare scenarios and has been developed using established water balance and mass conservation principles as shown in fig 2 as a strategy tool irriset is designed to provide a driver to move towards a better scheduling strategy within on and off farm constraints and reduce instances of poor irrigation applications it can be used to evaluate strategic decisions such as irrigation infrastructure irrigator type and source and scheduling methods 3 2 corrections to reference crop evapotranspiration irriset uses reference crop et estimates to compute evaporative losses a proxy for plant water use and therefore demand two important adjustments were made to the reference crop et data firstly a crop coefficient factor was applied to reference crop et many researchers emphasise the need to dynamically change crop coefficient to reflect changes in available leaf area during growing season allen et al 1998 moriondo et al 2013 2015 vanino et al 2015 kc et al 2018 jensen 1968 defined crop coefficient as the ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration based on the recommendation by kisekka et al 2010 that a locally developed and verified crop coefficient should preferably be used we adopted the monthly crop coefficient values developed by van housen 2015 for north canterbury region this was based on a lysimeter drainage dataset from an irrigated pasture site nearby to the case study farm secondly based on other published studies e g allen et al 1998 kc et al 2018 the pasture growth was assumed to be optimal between 50 and 100 paw thus using water at crop coefficient corrected reference crop et rates aet or actual et when soil water is at or above 50 of soil paw when soil water was at 0 paw wilting point the evaporative losses were assumed to be zero between zero and 50 paw the evaporative losses were assumed to increase linearly from zero to aet 3 3 estimation of root zone soil water holding capacity plant available water within the root zone was one of the key tool inputs the published soil database fundamental soil layers fsl https soils landcareresearch co nz soil data fundamental soil layers provides soil paw for the top 900 mm of soil profile irriset considers 600 mm as the root zone depth and based on mcindoe et al 2017 pg 39 for irrigated canterbury soils the root zone paw was derived as follows the 200 mm of topsoil contributes 40 mm of water and the remainder of the soil profile down to a maximum of 900 mm contributes a constant amount of water per unit depth in stony soils the majority of the available water is within the top 500 mm of soil other more recent nz soil databases such as the s map lilburne et al 2012 publish paw at 300 600 and 900 mm within the soil profile when s map data were used the paw between 0 and 600 mm depth was assumed to be uniformly distributed 3 4 tool structure and operation the flow chart presented in fig 2 shows the logical structure of irriset the tool was operated on a daily time step at the start of each day an irrigation event was triggered based on available soil water at the end of previous day aet and irrigation availability based on supply reliability infrastructure availability and capacity and available allocation for a given scheduling strategy in the case of ji rainfall forecast was also considered at the end of each day the available soil water was estimated as a balance between gains rainfall irrigation soil water at the start of the day and loses evaporation drainage irriset simulates three water use metrics based on daily data i amount of irrigation applied ii drainage resulting from irrigation and iii duration during an irrigation season where the soil water was held at optimal growing conditions for pasture based on allen et al 1998 kc et al 2018 and others the optimal soil water condition was assumed to be between 50 and 100 paw we hypothesised that the ability of three irrigation strategies to maintain the optimal growing conditions together with a tightening regulatory framework e g essential freshwater from the ministry for the environment and ministry for primary industries 2018 would incentivise farmers to transition towards improved irrigation strategies i e strategies that improve water use without compromising on growing conditions 3 5 application of irriset to derive water use metrics for selected irrigation scenarios as a demonstration of its capability in choosing a scheduling strategy that accounts for on and off farm controls and irrigation demand and supply conditions irriset was applied to simulate water use metrics for three scenarios the scenarios are described in table 3 a selection of on and off farm controls were included in the example scenarios to demonstrate the application range of irriset in the region where the case study farm is located three dominant soil types have been mapped lilburne et al 2012 a light soil type stony to sandy texture with 60 mm of paw within the pasture root zone a medium soil type sandy to silty with 100 mm paw and a heavy soil type silt loam with 150 mm paw for all scenarios an irrigation application efficiency of 100 was assumed which meant the irrigator applied the designed irrigation amount in scenario one for a medium textured soil the water use metrics were calculated and compared for three jic jit and ji strategies see table 1 for irrigation trigger conditions and table 3 for irrigation scenarios the focus of this scenario was to capture the differences in water use metrics between three strategies for a given set of on and off farm controls in scenario two the use of a deficit irrigation strategy here jit was examined in a farm with a mix of soil types light and heavy there is a need to alter irrigation amount between soil types when irrigators go over more than one soil type that differs in paw in scenario two a non variable rate irrigator was considered and irriset was used to examine the choice of soil type to trigger irrigation and its impact on water use in this scenario a fixed irrigation amount per event 36 mm was assumed variables such as supply restriction stop trigger and irrigator return interval were not considered in scenario two as the focus of this scenario was to capture the influence of soil type on water use metrics in scenario three a regimented supply availability condition was examined for all three irrigation strategies jic jit and ji this represents a scenario where an irrigator could not alter irrigation amount applied between events and or irrigation supply consented volume available per event was limited and capped for scenario three the maximum depth of water available per irrigation event was limited to 20 mm and the irrigator return interval was set to four days for jit and ji practices irrigation start triggers as listed in table 1 were used and no stop trigger was used as the amount of irrigation applied was fixed for the purpose of comparison irrigation on a light soil paw 60 mm was simulated using the three strategies a supply restriction was also considered for this scenario 4 application of irriset to derive water use metrics for three scenarios 4 1 scenario one comparison of water use metrics for supply and demand based strategies on a medium soil the three water use metrics for jic jit and ji strategies with and without supply reliability using the irrigation trigger conditions listed in table 1 were compared details of scenario one are listed in table 3 for this scenario a medium soil type with a paw of 100 mm within the root zone was considered the annual summary data presented in fig 3 for jic jit and ji with and without supply reliability were averages from eighteen irrigation seasons at 100 supply reliability jic scenario resulted in an irrigation water use of 685 mm per season fig 3a which was more than twice that of average rainfall during an irrigation season see fig 1a for irrigation season rainfall average however based on observed river flow data none of the eighteen irrigation seasons recorded a 100 supply reliability data shown in fig 1b when the observed supply reliability data were included the average irrigation use for jic dropped by a third to 445 mm per season with jit and ji irrigation strategies the differences in the amount of irrigation applied with and without supply reliability was less than one sixth implying that the effect of supply was felt the most on jic the difference in drainage between jic and the other two scheduling strategies with and without supply reliability was substantial fig 3b jit and ji resulted in drainage that ranged between 5 and 7 of total irrigation season rainfall and irrigation for with and without supply reliability respectively while for jic this ranged between 24 with supply reliability and 33 with no supply reliability the difference in drainage between jit and ji strategies was small irrespective of supply conditions the three scheduling strategies were compared for their ability to maintain root zone soil water conditions within the optimal pasture growth zone 50 100 paw the jic strategy despite applying the most irrigation kept the soil water in the optimal conditions for less than 50 of irrigation season fig 3c for jic strategy with supply restriction included the soils tended to be either too dry below 50 paw or too wet above 100 paw for an equal length of time 26 of time each see fig 3c during the irrigation season on the other hand the jit and ji strategies irrespective of supply constraints maintained soil water in the optimal conditions for approximately 70 of the season for jit and ji when supply reliability conditions were included the soils tended to experience drier approximately 24 of the season than wetter conditions approximately 6 of season meaning very little over irrigation occurring with those two strategies the water use metrics for the three scheduling strategies were compared at a monthly scale for scenario one only metrics that included supply reliability are presented in figs 4 and 5 the monthly averages across the irrigation season indicate that during the shoulder season october march april see fig 4a the amounts of irrigation used were significantly greater for jic than for jit and ji practices and that the differences were minimal during the peak season november february this trend was also reflected in drainage estimates fig 4b a much greater amount of drainage resulted from jic during the shoulder season which contributed to a substantial proportion of irrigation season drainage for that practice for jit and ji practices monthly drainage amounts were small as those two strategies maintained the soil at or above saturation for less than 6 of irrigation season fig 3c however a substantial increase in drainage at the end of the irrigation season april for all three strategies was likely due to significant rainfall and reduced evaporative losses during that period since ji strategy used weather forecast to trigger irrigation it can be concluded that the large drainage during this period for all three strategies was likely due to rainfall events that exceeded root zone storage the monthly summaries of optimal soil water conditions were similar to those of annual trends compare figs 3c and 5 jic resulted in conditions that were least optimal for pasture growth fig 5a specifically almost half of february and march experienced below optimal soil water conditions and for one fifth of the time experienced above optimal conditions fig 5c thus when jic was applied the soil water was in optimal growth conditions for less than a third of the months of february and march fig 5b on the other hand jit and ji seldom resulted in above optimal soil water conditions during the peak season fig 5c both jit and ji strategies resulted in below optimal soil water conditions for a substantial part of february and march fig 5a suffering from lack of rainfall and river supply irrigation seasons with most average and fewest number of days of supply restrictions across the simulation period were compared to understand their impact on water use metrics the observed daily rainfall and supply reliability data and simulated daily soil water data for the three strategies are shown in fig 6 and table 4 when supply restrictions were the most severe fig 6a the amount of irrigation applied for the three irrigation strategies were very similar though jic maintained optimal growth conditions for 55 out of 212 days 26 of season see table 4 the corresponding figures for jit and ji strategies were 118 56 and 116 55 days respectively table 4 for the irrigation season with the fewest number of days of supply restriction during the simulation period fig 6b jic jit and ji maintained soil water conditions at optimal conditions for 43 84 and 95 respectively table 4 the ji strategy never let the soil water to drop below 50 paw fig 6b for an irrigation season with average number of days of supply restriction all three irrigation strategies experienced below optimal soil water conditions for a significant part of the irrigation season fig 6c and table 4 the supply restriction that began in mid january continued until mid april barring a few days in february sparse rainfall during this period did not improve the soil water condition 4 2 scenario two comparison of water use metrics when irrigations occur over multiple soil types with diverse plant available water in scenario two table 3 irrigation management on a mix of soil types varying paw was considered irrigations were triggered based on one soil type and the timing and amount of irrigation applied was not altered between soil types the purpose of the scenario was to compare the influence on soil types e g light and heavy on water use metrics for this demonstration only jit strategy was considered and a supply reliability of 100 was assumed light soil based deficit irrigation jit resulted in a larger application of irrigation early in the irrigation season october but for the rest of the season the irrigation amounts were comparable though consistently higher to those applied when using a heavy soil based irrigation trigger table 5 and fig 7 in october when soil water condition of light soil was used to trigger irrigation on average the amount of irrigation applied was 6 5 times greater than when heavy soil based irrigation trigger was used over the rest of the irrigation season the ratio between irrigation applied based on light soil to that of heavy soil trigger remained between 1 0 and 1 7 this was reflected in drainage amounts simulated fig 8a the higher ratio of seasonal drainage generated to irrigation applied based on light soils compared to heavy soil indicated that the former could be losing twice as much of irrigation to drainage than the latter table 5 the month of april recorded the largest drainage to irrigation ratio for both soil type triggers during this month based on average from eighteen seasons drainage was anywhere from 1 7 heavy soil based trigger to 3 5 light soil based times that of irrigation applied during that month table 5 irrigation applied based on a light soil trigger consistently resulted in the heavy soil remaining above optimal soil water conditions for longer periods fig 8a this indicated that the heavy soil was receiving more irrigation than could be held in the soil matrix when a light soil trigger was used a heavy soil based trigger produced an opposing effect on light soil which was held at below optimal growth conditions 50 paw for longer periods and more frequently fig 8b to further understand the differences caused by soil type used to trigger irrigation on water use metrics daily simulations of irrigations based on light and heavy soil triggers were compared for three irrigation seasons that received below average dry average and above average wet rainfall during the simulation period figs 9 and 10 represent light and heavy soil based irrigation respectively during a dry year a light soil based irrigation trigger was able to maintain the soil water within the optimal zone longer than a heavy soil based trigger compare figs 9a and 10a a heavy soil based trigger resulted in light soil dropping to below optimal conditions more often during a wet season a light soil based trigger maintained the heavy soil closer to saturation 100 paw often leaving little to no storage for rainfall fig 9b on the contrary the light soils experienced frequent and extended periods of below optimal growth conditions when a heavy soil trigger was used in a wet year fig 10b the conditions experienced by heavy and light soils during an average year figs 9c and 10c respectively were similar to that of a wet year the amount of irrigation applied during wet and average years when using heavy soil triggers was significantly less than those when using light soil triggers and the difference was negligible during a dry year in other words during a dry year soil type used to trigger irrigation did not make a difference to the water use metrics but it made a difference during average to wet years 4 3 scenario three comparison of water use metrics when irrigation applied per event was limited irriset was applied to simulate a condition where the amount of irrigation applied was limited scenario three table 3 this represented a condition where a user applied a fixed amount of irrigation due to either irrigator limitation capacity or available supply in this scenario an irrigation application of 20 mm per event and observed supply reliability were considered all three irrigation strategies were compared specifically for their ability to maintain optimal growing conditions under a limited supply condition the start triggers used for jit and ji were same as those listed in table 1 but no stop triggers were used as the amount of irrigation applied was fixed a light soil type paw 60 mm was considered jic strategy consistently and substantially during some of the irrigation months resulted in a larger irrigation application compared to jit and ji fig 11a owing to this large irrigation application jic also resulted in more drainage fig 11b and maintained optimal growing condition for less time compared to other two strategies fig 11c the differences between jit and ji strategies were small though the latter was marginally better during peak season 4 4 assessing the impact of supplies on water use metrics during irrigation seasons the soil water conditions in the case study farm were influenced by on farm rainfall and irrigation supply as controlled by river flow off farm influence results from irriset simulations for scenario one were examined to decipher the impact of river flows and rainfall on soil water conditions during the irrigation seasons 2012 13 and 2013 14 the river flow supply reliability was 60 supply restricted for 84 out of 212 days based on the number of days of supplies were restricted per season these two seasons are deemed average during these two seasons the flow restriction patterns were similar with most flow restrictions occurring during the months of february march and april figs 1 and 12 during those flow restricted periods none of the irrigation strategies would have worked and rainfall was the only input that could have influenced the soil water conditions during the 2013 14 season rainfall within the farm region during those months maintained an optimal even wet in april soil water conditions fig 12a however during the 2012 13 season when both on farm rainfall and river flow supply inputs were impacted the soil water conditions fell well below optimal conditions for all irrigation strategies fig 12b 5 discussion in this section based on the results from the three irrigation management scenarios presented above the application of irriset as a decision support tool at strategic e g assessment of irrigation infrastructure capacity tactical e g assessment and selection of a scheduling strategy to match supply and operational e g understanding the cause and effect of day to day irrigation application decisions levels are discussed at a strategic level the tool examines options and opportunities to improve water use across a spectrum of irrigation seasons at a tactical level the tool allows to compare options that are available within a season while at an operational level the tool relates the cause and effect of daily irrigation decisions 5 1 use of irriset as a strategy tool irriset was designed to estimate the water use metrics of irrigation strategies as influenced by soil type climate and irrigation infrastructure and supply the tool achieves this by facilitating an understanding of the linkage between three controls irrigation scheduling strategy jic jit and ji irrigation supply river flow and rainfall and irrigation infrastructure irrigation amount and frequency within the context of weather climate and soil type as a strategy tool irriset for a given geographical setting allows varying one or more of these controls and estimates its impact on water use metrics this can further be extended to identify those controls that can strategically be addressed to achieve an efficient water use for example for the case study farm based on the results from eighteen irrigation seasons for scenario one supply reliability was the key factor that impacted water use metrics during peak season irrespective of irrigation strategy chosen this meant that the farm may benefit by strategically investing on a secondary irrigation source e g groundwater or a storage pond that can be accessed during supply restricted periods with a secondary supply source the water use metrics could further be improved by adopting jit or ji approach irriset includes irrigation infrastructure as an input to assess if irrigations are impeded due to a lack of availability of irrigator or from an irrigation infrastructure that is unable to match the demand based on tool simulations for scenario two where there was a mix of light and heavy soils an assessment of water use metrics could be based on each soil type this would allow a justification for considering a strategic investment on an irrigator that could vary application to match soil type for example at the start of the irrigation season based on scenario two a light soil may need more water than a heavy soil table 5 which could be satisfied either by using a variable rate irrigator or by simply varying the speed of the irrigator similarly a large irrigation application to a heavy soil based on light soil trigger could result in drainage and potential nutrient loss from root zone when irrigators are operated over fields with multiple soil types and irrigations scheduled based on one soil type the differences in water use metrics between soil types can be substantially large light soil based irrigations were consistently and significantly larger than heavy soil based irrigations scenario two fig 7 this translated into more drainage loss and sub optimal too wet soil water conditions in heavy soils on the other hand a heavy soil based irrigation resulted in below optimal soil water conditions in light soil if the differences in water use metrics between light and heavy soil based irrigation triggers are substantial when there is a mix of soil types farmers may have to treat them individually and not use one trigger where the differences in soil types paw are substantial the metrics derived might be used as a justification to migrate towards an advanced irrigation system such as a variable rate irrigator also a comparison of irrigation triggers for light and heavy soil types indicated that at no time during the irrigation season would a combined trigger for the two soil types would work the differences between jit and ji strategies for the selected farm did not appear to be substantial when nutrient leaching is considered even a small difference in drainage events might prove substantial however uncertainty associated with weather conditions would mean that farms would need reliable supply sources and readily deployable irrigation infrastructures in case forecast rainfall does not eventuate as has been done in this study a marginally higher irrigation start trigger and lower stop trigger for ji compared to jit might mitigate the impact of incorrect rainfall forecast 5 2 use of irriset as a tactical tool in the region where the case study farm was located on average the shoulder season recorded more rainfall than peak see fig 1a for monthly rainfall data and the evaporative losses showed an opposing trend data not shown the inter seasonal variability in gains rainfall and losses evaporation implied that irrigation strategies need to be altered within a season to achieve an efficient water use for example if irrigations are scheduled by accounting for forecast rainfall during shoulder season it could reduce irrigation water use drainage and increase the duration of optimal soil water conditions however a supply based strategy such as jic does not allow for varying irrigation according to weather conditions on the other hand a demand based strategy such as jit and demand and forecast rainfall based strategy such as ji could take into account inter seasonal rainfall and evaporation variability and adjust irrigations accordingly figs 4a and 5a for farms that have supply limits such as seasonal maximum allowable irrigation volume allocation saving in irrigation during the shoulder season could be useful during the peak season pending no supply restriction while none of the scenarios described here included the option of a seasonal cap on irrigation volume the ji strategy which is based on current demand and current and future supplies captures the saving in irrigation water when selecting an irrigation scheduling strategy that includes supply restrictions it is important to consider the timing peak vs shoulder season duration number of days and pattern continuous vs discontinuous of supply restriction depending on the time of the season peak or shoulder a supply restriction of similar duration could have a differing impact on soil water conditions compare fig 12a and b however the choice of strategy may become important for the recovery of soil water conditions from below optimal to optimal conditions during these supply restricted periods even though all three irrigation strategies resulted in below optimal soil water conditions jic resulted in the driest soil water condition thus taking the longest time to recover to optimal conditions during the peak season the amount of irrigation water used did not differ between strategies compare the monthly irrigation summary data for jic jit and ji shown in fig 4a implying that the selection of strategy might not matter however a significantly large drainage recorded see monthly drainage summary data for different strategies in fig 4b and a reduced duration the soil water maintained within optimal growth condition for jic strategy compared to other strategies fig 5 implied that the timing of irrigation application in addition to the amount applied could make a difference to water use since jic does not consider weather conditions irrigation could happen either preceding during or immediately following rainfall events causing saturated soil conditions and drainage in case of jit as soil moisture was used as a trigger irrigations would unlikely be triggered during or immediately following rainfall events but could occur immediately before a forecast rainfall event if the forecast rainfall was greater than the storage available post irrigation then jit would result in drainage with ji since irrigations are scheduled around demand and future supply forecast rainfall such a wastage of rainfall as drainage would not happen except when the forecast rainfall exceeds soil water storage irriset is built to use standardised climate and soil databases which allows farmers and water resources managers to understand the differences in volumes of water needed during an irrigation season based on the strategy chosen by comparing water use metrics from multiple seasons for various irrigation strategies farmers might be able to build themselves a hybrid irrigation strategy that fits specific on and off farm controls for example a farm that has an annual allocation limit on irrigation volume may choose to use a strategy such as ji which carefully weaves in the use of rainfall to complement irrigation during the irrigation season as the irrigation demand and supply vary farmers may choose an irrigation strategy jic ji or jit and or irrigation triggers for demand based strategy e g varying start and stop triggers between shoulder and peak seasons to suit the seasonal weather and supply reliability patterns 5 3 application of irriset as an operational tool irriset uses a water balance approach fig 2 to estimate water use metrics such as the amount of irrigation used drainage generated and duration the soil water was maintained within optimal growing conditions on a daily basis the water balance approach though widely used has its own limitations because of its simplicity and not requiring on farm measurements such as soil moisture fereres et al 2003 it assumes a uniformity of properties such as the soil water holding capacity and inputs such as rainfall evaporation and irrigation the tool allows the farmer to balance various outcomes when making daily irrigation decisions and the ability to add forecast to this will further improve farmer decisions however for the tool to be operational it needs to be updated on a daily basis with rainfall reference crop et and irrigation supply and application data 6 conclusions a water balance tool irriset was developed to combine key on and off farm variables that influence irrigation scheduling strategies the factors selected addressed key operational irrigation management questions such as should i irrigate today and if so is the irrigator available to irrigate is there water available at the source for irrigation abstraction would the proposed irrigation be within the allowable seasonal irrigation allocation volume limit and is there a rainfall forecast in short term that could be used to defer the planned irrigation event the tool also simulates the cause and effect arising from these daily operational irrigation decisions on drainage and root zone soil water available for crop use the tool outputs three water use metrics amount of irrigation drainage resulting from poorly timed irrigations and duration during an irrigation season when the soil water conditions were maintained in an optimal range for pasture growth compared to demand based scheduling strategies supply based irrigation strategies that do not account for weather or soil water conditions consistently resulted in more irrigation applied more drainage generated and less optimal soil water conditions for pasture growth during the peak irrigation season november to march both demand and supply based scheduling strategies appeared to be using similar amounts of irrigations though the supply based strategies triggered irrigations at inopportune moments e g immediately before during or after a significant rainfall event resulting in larger drainage and below optimal soil water conditions compared to demand based practices irriset considers farm specific factors such as irrigation demand irrigation infrastructure climate soil type and supply limitations irriset assumes an unchanged irrigation scheduling strategy throughout an irrigation season however farmers are known to change their irrigation strategies during and between seasons as supply weather and other conditions e g a broken irrigator dictate for this reason irriset does not lend itself for direct comparison and validation using field based observations and thus should only be used as a tool to compare scenarios this tool facilitates strategic e g assessment of irrigation infrastructure over seasons tactical e g inter seasonal evaluation of scheduling practice and to a limited extent operational e g understanding the cause and effect of daily irrigation decisions decision making that supports

found in taghvaeian et al 2020 the strategies can be broadly classified into two groups quantitative and qualitative quantitative approaches include both demand and supply based irrigation strategies

strategies rely solely on the availability of supply e g roster irrigation the qualitative approaches described in taghvaeian et al 2020 include irrigating when a neighbour does use of a personal

irrigation scheduling strategies on nz dairy farms and help farmers find an effective strategy that fits their farm conditions the farm conditions considered in this study are described in the methods section and are mainly linked to irrigation demand and supply irrigation infrastructure climatic conditions and soil type to achieve these goals we developed a physically based water balance tool irriset irrigation strategy evaluation tool that simulates water use metrics for various scheduling strategies encompassing on and off farm conditions irriset simulates hydrological and economic implications of various scheduling strategies in this paper we focused on its hydrological component the economics component of irriset is described in muller et al 2018 the specific objectives of this paper are to describe the hydrology component of irriset section three and using example applications demonstrate its use in selecting fit to farm irrigation scheduling strategy sections four and five an irrigated dairy farm in north canterbury nz was chosen for tool application and data from eighteen irrigation seasons were considered in the absence of data on qualitative scheduling practices described in taghvaeian et al 2020 for nz farms two quantitative approaches demand and supply based were considered additionally a third strategy that combined supply and demand together was considered these strategies are described in detail in section 2 1 2 material and methods the irrigation scheduling strategies were examined for the period between 1999 and 2017 comprising eighteen irrigation seasons providing a range of climatic and irrigation supply and demand conditions daily rainfall and estimated penman based reference crop evapotranspiration et data were obtained from the rangiora weather station 1568483 e 5202809 s located adjacent to the case study farm the weather station is operated by the national institute of water and atmospheric research ltd and the daily data were obtained from cliflo 2020 soil water holding capacity available as plant available water paw was derived from online soil databases fundamental soil layers and s map lilburne et al 2012 2 1 irrigation scheduling strategies the scheduling strategies considered in the study were classified as follows just in case jic just in time jit and justified irrigation ji jic is a supply based strategy jit is a demand based strategy and ji combines a demand based strategy with short term rainfall forecast supply to trigger irrigations with jic a fixed amount of irrigation is triggered at a fixed frequency roster irrigation with jit and ji strategies irrigations are triggered whenever a pre set available paw was reached deficit irrigation and stopped at a pre set soil water condition see table 1 for the triggers used in the study ji also incorporates a short term supply of rainfall forecast while scheduling an irrigation event irrigation season in the case study area usually extends from october to april the months of october march and april are considered as shoulder season and november to february as peak season peak season is characterised by a larger irrigation demand i e higher evaporative losses than the shoulder season to support pasture growth the irrigation triggers for the three strategies were designed to accommodate the differences in demand between shoulder and peak seasons as shown in table 1 ji start triggers were set higher and stop triggers lower than jit to accommodate the uncertainty associated with the rainfall forecast and to leave enough storage in the soil in case the forecast rainfall exceeds the prediction based on the irrigation start and stop triggers chosen jit would be considered a good management practice by the local regulatory agency mgm 2015 robson et al 2015 and ji regarded as the best management practice kc et al 2018 2 2 irrigation season rainfall and supply reliability for the study period the average rainfall during the irrigation season october april was 327 mm varying between 143 and 577 mm the monthly rainfall data indicated that the shoulder season often received more rainfall than peak season fig 1a the case study farm draws water from a nearby river waimakariri for irrigation and the abstractions are restricted whenever the river flow falls below the regulator set limit of 63 m3s 1 at a pre set location in the river based on the observed river flow data at this pre set location for the study period the days when irrigation abstraction would have been restricted were identified over the eighteen years just as rainfall varied supply restrictions ranged from 20 to 148 days during irrigation seasons on average the case study farm would have experienced supply restriction at the source waimakariri river for 84 out of 212 213 in case of leap years days of irrigation season fig 1b most of the supply restrictions occurred between january and march largely coinciding with the peak season the waimakariri river receives flows from rainfall runoff and snowmelt from the upper end of the catchment surface drainage area 3100 km2 which extends into the alpine mountains the abstraction point is located upstream of the farm hence any local rainfall within the farm region does not add to the river flows at the abstraction point 2 3 daily water balance tool a daily water balance tool irriset was developed to compare the scheduling strategies the tool considered rainfall irrigation reference crop et and changes to available soil water within the root zone since irriset was built for irrigated pasture a root zone depth of 600 mm was assumed following recommendations from porteous et al 1994 and others here the root zone describes a crop soil water reservoir from which roots source the majority of water the tool considered on and off farm variables that influence scheduling strategies table 2 the on farm variables were et paw the capacity of irrigation infrastructure to meet the demands irrigation application efficiency ratio of actual irrigation applied by the irrigator to what it was designed to apply and consented irrigation volume the off farm variables were rainfall and river flow with flow defining the supply availability the daily tool outputs were amount of irrigation applied drainage generated and available soil water within the pasture root zone 3 development of irriset within irriset a range of temporal scales was considered for input and output variables and input parameters details of the tool variables and parameters can be found in table 2 input variables such as rainfall reference crop et supply reliability irrigation infrastructure availability and weather forecast and output variables such as irrigation applied drainage generated and available soil water within the root zone were considered at a daily time scale input variables such as irrigation triggers start and stop and soil type used to trigger irrigation in case of demand based scheduling strategies the amount of irrigation applied per event and use of weather forecast to schedule irrigation for ji were altered at a monthly scale inputs such as paw irrigation allocation for the season irrigator return interval irrigation application efficiency and duration of irrigation season were maintained the same over the entire simulation period 3 1 tool assumptions during irriset development process concepts and observations from similar pre existing operational irrigation scheduling tools were considered e g porteous et al 1994 allen et al 1998 irriset was based on several assumptions and practical application considerations as listed below a as a water balance tool irriset considered matrix flow only no macro pore flow was considered b all triggered irrigation events were completed on the same day however in a real operational farm it may take the irrigator more than a day to irrigate the whole farm therefore an irrigator return interval was used to simulate irrigator s availability for successive irrigation events the irrigator return interval signifies the frequency of irrigation events c the tool did not consider irrigation distribution uniformity across an irrigator span d the irrigation application efficiency used in the tool is a ratio of actual irrigation applied to what the irrigator was designed to apply table 2 e an irrigation supply reliability was included based on irrigation abstraction restriction at the source in the case of a supply based scheduling strategy if a particular event was missed due to a lack of supply the next event was not simulated until the next rostered date in the case of demand based scheduling strategies irrigation was applied on the next date when the supply became available f even though the tool could simulate soil water conditions for multiple soil types soils with differing paw individually irrigations were triggered based on only one soil type and same amount of irrigation was applied to all soil types no variable rate irrigation was considered g while the removal of water in excess of paw was termed as drainage in irriset in reality the excess water could be lost as either drainage or overland flow no separation of pathways was made once removed the excess water was not tracked by the tool h slow drainage simulated by irriset represented extended periods of soil saturation following large rainfall or irrigation events the drainage rates were assumed same for all events and for the entire simulation period i when using ji if the cumulated rainfall during the forecast period exceeded cumulated evaporative losses corrected for crop coefficient and available soil water described in the next section then no irrigation was triggered in a real farm while actual irrigation water use may be available but data on what triggered the events are seldom recorded often farmers mix scheduling strategies during a season based on perceived supply and demand conditions taghvaeian et al 2020 in case of supply and demand based irrigation events the triggers could be deduced based on water use and soil water data respectively in case of qualitative approaches such trigger data are not always recorded or reported however irriset does not change the scheduling strategy within and between irrigation seasons thus irriset water use metrics could not be directly compared and validated against observations irriset is designed to compare scenarios and has been developed using established water balance and mass conservation principles as shown in fig 2 as a strategy tool irriset is designed to provide a driver to move towards a better scheduling strategy within on and off farm constraints and reduce instances of poor irrigation applications it can be used to evaluate strategic decisions such as irrigation infrastructure irrigator type and source and scheduling methods 3 2 corrections to reference crop evapotranspiration irriset uses reference crop et estimates to compute evaporative losses a proxy for plant water use and therefore demand two important adjustments were made to the reference crop et data firstly a crop coefficient factor was applied to reference crop et many researchers emphasise the need to dynamically change crop coefficient to reflect changes in available leaf area during growing season allen et al 1998 moriondo et al 2013 2015 vanino et al 2015 kc et al 2018 jensen 1968 defined crop coefficient as the ratio between actual and potential evapotranspiration based on the recommendation by kisekka et al 2010 that a locally developed and verified crop coefficient should preferably be used we adopted the monthly crop coefficient values developed by van housen 2015 for north canterbury region this was based on a lysimeter drainage dataset from an irrigated pasture site nearby to the case study farm secondly based on other published studies e g allen et al 1998 kc et al 2018 the pasture growth was assumed to be optimal between 50 and 100 paw thus using water at crop coefficient corrected reference crop et rates aet or actual et when soil water is at or above 50 of soil paw when soil water was at 0 paw wilting point the evaporative losses were assumed to be zero between zero and 50 paw the evaporative losses were assumed to increase linearly from zero to aet 3 3 estimation of root zone soil water holding capacity plant available water within the root zone was one of the key tool inputs the published soil database fundamental soil layers fsl https soils landcareresearch co nz soil data fundamental soil layers provides soil paw for the top 900 mm of soil profile irriset considers 600 mm as the root zone depth and based on mcindoe et al 2017 pg 39 for irrigated canterbury soils the root zone paw was derived as follows the 200 mm of topsoil contributes 40 mm of water and the remainder of the soil profile down to a maximum of 900 mm contributes a constant amount of water per unit depth in stony soils the majority of the available water is within the top 500 mm of soil other more recent nz soil databases such as the s map lilburne et al 2012 publish paw at 300 600 and 900 mm within the soil profile when s map data were used the paw between 0 and 600 mm depth was assumed to be uniformly distributed 3 4 tool structure and operation the flow chart presented in fig 2 shows the logical structure of irriset the tool was operated on a daily time step at the start of each day an irrigation event was triggered based on available soil water at the end of previous day aet and irrigation availability based on supply reliability infrastructure availability and capacity and available allocation for a given scheduling strategy in the case of ji rainfall forecast was also considered at the end of each day the available soil water was estimated as a balance between gains rainfall irrigation soil water at the start of the day and loses evaporation drainage irriset simulates three water use metrics based on daily data i amount of irrigation applied ii drainage resulting from irrigation and iii duration during an irrigation season where the soil water was held at optimal growing conditions for pasture based on allen et al 1998 kc et al 2018 and others the optimal soil water condition was assumed to be between 50 and 100 paw we hypothesised that the ability of three irrigation strategies to maintain the optimal growing conditions together with a tightening regulatory framework e g essential freshwater from the ministry for the environment and ministry for primary industries 2018 would incentivise farmers to transition towards improved irrigation strategies i e strategies that improve water use without compromising on growing conditions 3 5 application of irriset to derive water use metrics for selected irrigation scenarios as a demonstration of its capability in choosing a scheduling strategy that accounts for on and off farm controls and irrigation demand and supply conditions irriset was applied to simulate water use metrics for three scenarios the scenarios are described in table 3 a selection of on and off farm controls were included in the example scenarios to demonstrate the application range of irriset in the region where the case study farm is located three dominant soil types have been mapped lilburne et al 2012 a light soil type stony to sandy texture with 60 mm of paw within the pasture root zone a medium soil type sandy to silty with 100 mm paw and a heavy soil type silt loam with 150 mm paw for all scenarios an irrigation application efficiency of 100 was assumed which meant the irrigator applied the designed irrigation amount in scenario one for a medium textured soil the water use metrics were calculated and compared for three jic jit and ji strategies see table 1 for irrigation trigger conditions and table 3 for irrigation scenarios the focus of this scenario was to capture the differences in water use metrics between three strategies for a given set of on and off farm controls in scenario two the use of a deficit irrigation strategy here jit was examined in a farm with a mix of soil types light and heavy there is a need to alter irrigation amount between soil types when irrigators go over more than one soil type that differs in paw in scenario two a non variable rate irrigator was considered and irriset was used to examine the choice of soil type to trigger irrigation and its impact on water use in this scenario a fixed irrigation amount per event 36 mm was assumed variables such as supply restriction stop trigger and irrigator return interval were not considered in scenario two as the focus of this scenario was to capture the influence of soil type on water use metrics in scenario three a regimented supply availability condition was examined for all three irrigation strategies jic jit and ji this represents a scenario where an irrigator could not alter irrigation amount applied between events and or irrigation supply consented volume available per event was limited and capped for scenario three the maximum depth of water available per irrigation event was limited to 20 mm and the irrigator return interval was set to four days for jit and ji practices irrigation start triggers as listed in table 1 were used and no stop trigger was used as the amount of irrigation applied was fixed for the purpose of comparison irrigation on a light soil paw 60 mm was simulated using the three strategies a supply restriction was also considered for this scenario 4 application of irriset to derive water use metrics for three scenarios 4 1 scenario one comparison of water use metrics for supply and demand based strategies on a medium soil the three water use metrics for jic jit and ji strategies with and without supply reliability using the irrigation trigger conditions listed in table 1 were compared details of scenario one are listed in table 3 for this scenario a medium soil type with a paw of 100 mm within the root zone was considered the annual summary data presented in fig 3 for jic jit and ji with and without supply reliability were averages from eighteen irrigation seasons at 100 supply reliability jic scenario resulted in an irrigation water use of 685 mm per season fig 3a which was more than twice that of average rainfall during an irrigation season see fig 1a for irrigation season rainfall average however based on observed river flow data none of the eighteen irrigation seasons recorded a 100 supply reliability data shown in fig 1b when the observed supply reliability data were included the average irrigation use for jic dropped by a third to 445 mm per season with jit and ji irrigation strategies the differences in the amount of irrigation applied with and without supply reliability was less than one sixth implying that the effect of supply was felt the most on jic the difference in drainage between jic and the other two scheduling strategies with and without supply reliability was substantial fig 3b jit and ji resulted in drainage that ranged between 5 and 7 of total irrigation season rainfall and irrigation for with and without supply reliability respectively while for jic this ranged between 24 with supply reliability and 33 with no supply reliability the difference in drainage between jit and ji strategies was small irrespective of supply conditions the three scheduling strategies were compared for their ability to maintain root zone soil water conditions within the optimal pasture growth zone 50 100 paw the jic strategy despite applying the most irrigation kept the soil water in the optimal conditions for less than 50 of irrigation season fig 3c for jic strategy with supply restriction included the soils tended to be either too dry below 50 paw or too wet above 100 paw for an equal length of time 26 of time each see fig 3c during the irrigation season on the other hand the jit and ji strategies irrespective of supply constraints maintained soil water in the optimal conditions for approximately 70 of the season for jit and ji when supply reliability conditions were included the soils tended to experience drier approximately 24 of the season than wetter conditions approximately 6 of season meaning very little over irrigation occurring with those two strategies the water use metrics for the three scheduling strategies were compared at a monthly scale for scenario one only metrics that included supply reliability are presented in figs 4 and 5 the monthly averages across the irrigation season indicate that during the shoulder season october march april see fig 4a the amounts of irrigation used were significantly greater for jic than for jit and ji practices and that the differences were minimal during the peak season november february this trend was also reflected in drainage estimates fig 4b a much greater amount of drainage resulted from jic during the shoulder season which contributed to a substantial proportion of irrigation season drainage for that practice for jit and ji practices monthly drainage amounts were small as those two strategies maintained the soil at or above saturation for less than 6 of irrigation season fig 3c however a substantial increase in drainage at the end of the irrigation season april for all three strategies was likely due to significant rainfall and reduced evaporative losses during that period since ji strategy used weather forecast to trigger irrigation it can be concluded that the large drainage during this period for all three strategies was likely due to rainfall events that exceeded root zone storage the monthly summaries of optimal soil water conditions were similar to those of annual trends compare figs 3c and 5 jic resulted in conditions that were least optimal for pasture growth fig 5a specifically almost half of february and march experienced below optimal soil water conditions and for one fifth of the time experienced above optimal conditions fig 5c thus when jic was applied the soil water was in optimal growth conditions for less than a third of the months of february and march fig 5b on the other hand jit and ji seldom resulted in above optimal soil water conditions during the peak season fig 5c both jit and ji strategies resulted in below optimal soil water conditions for a substantial part of february and march fig 5a suffering from lack of rainfall and river supply irrigation seasons with most average and fewest number of days of supply restrictions across the simulation period were compared to understand their impact on water use metrics the observed daily rainfall and supply reliability data and simulated daily soil water data for the three strategies are shown in fig 6 and table 4 when supply restrictions were the most severe fig 6a the amount of irrigation applied for the three irrigation strategies were very similar though jic maintained optimal growth conditions for 55 out of 212 days 26 of season see table 4 the corresponding figures for jit and ji strategies were 118 56 and 116 55 days respectively table 4 for the irrigation season with the fewest number of days of supply restriction during the simulation period fig 6b jic jit and ji maintained soil water conditions at optimal conditions for 43 84 and 95 respectively table 4 the ji strategy never let the soil water to drop below 50 paw fig 6b for an irrigation season with average number of days of supply restriction all three irrigation strategies experienced below optimal soil water conditions for a significant part of the irrigation season fig 6c and table 4 the supply restriction that began in mid january continued until mid april barring a few days in february sparse rainfall during this period did not improve the soil water condition 4 2 scenario two comparison of water use metrics when irrigations occur over multiple soil types with diverse plant available water in scenario two table 3 irrigation management on a mix of soil types varying paw was considered irrigations were triggered based on one soil type and the timing and amount of irrigation applied was not altered between soil types the purpose of the scenario was to compare the influence on soil types e g light and heavy on water use metrics for this demonstration only jit strategy was considered and a supply reliability of 100 was assumed light soil based deficit irrigation jit resulted in a larger application of irrigation early in the irrigation season october but for the rest of the season the irrigation amounts were comparable though consistently higher to those applied when using a heavy soil based irrigation trigger table 5 and fig 7 in october when soil water condition of light soil was used to trigger irrigation on average the amount of irrigation applied was 6 5 times greater than when heavy soil based irrigation trigger was used over the rest of the irrigation season the ratio between irrigation applied based on light soil to that of heavy soil trigger remained between 1 0 and 1 7 this was reflected in drainage amounts simulated fig 8a the higher ratio of seasonal drainage generated to irrigation applied based on light soils compared to heavy soil indicated that the former could be losing twice as much of irrigation to drainage than the latter table 5 the month of april recorded the largest drainage to irrigation ratio for both soil type triggers during this month based on average from eighteen seasons drainage was anywhere from 1 7 heavy soil based trigger to 3 5 light soil based times that of irrigation applied during that month table 5 irrigation applied based on a light soil trigger consistently resulted in the heavy soil remaining above optimal soil water conditions for longer periods fig 8a this indicated that the heavy soil was receiving more irrigation than could be held in the soil matrix when a light soil trigger was used a heavy soil based trigger produced an opposing effect on light soil which was held at below optimal growth conditions 50 paw for longer periods and more frequently fig 8b to further understand the differences caused by soil type used to trigger irrigation on water use metrics daily simulations of irrigations based on light and heavy soil triggers were compared for three irrigation seasons that received below average dry average and above average wet rainfall during the simulation period figs 9 and 10 represent light and heavy soil based irrigation respectively during a dry year a light soil based irrigation trigger was able to maintain the soil water within the optimal zone longer than a heavy soil based trigger compare figs 9a and 10a a heavy soil based trigger resulted in light soil dropping to below optimal conditions more often during a wet season a light soil based trigger maintained the heavy soil closer to saturation 100 paw often leaving little to no storage for rainfall fig 9b on the contrary the light soils experienced frequent and extended periods of below optimal growth conditions when a heavy soil trigger was used in a wet year fig 10b the conditions experienced by heavy and light soils during an average year figs 9c and 10c respectively were similar to that of a wet year the amount of irrigation applied during wet and average years when using heavy soil triggers was significantly less than those when using light soil triggers and the difference was negligible during a dry year in other words during a dry year soil type used to trigger irrigation did not make a difference to the water use metrics but it made a difference during average to wet years 4 3 scenario three comparison of water use metrics when irrigation applied per event was limited irriset was applied to simulate a condition where the amount of irrigation applied was limited scenario three table 3 this represented a condition where a user applied a fixed amount of irrigation due to either irrigator limitation capacity or available supply in this scenario an irrigation application of 20 mm per event and observed supply reliability were considered all three irrigation strategies were compared specifically for their ability to maintain optimal growing conditions under a limited supply condition the start triggers used for jit and ji were same as those listed in table 1 but no stop triggers were used as the amount of irrigation applied was fixed a light soil type paw 60 mm was considered jic strategy consistently and substantially during some of the irrigation months resulted in a larger irrigation application compared to jit and ji fig 11a owing to this large irrigation application jic also resulted in more drainage fig 11b and maintained optimal growing condition for less time compared to other two strategies fig 11c the differences between jit and ji strategies were small though the latter was marginally better during peak season 4 4 assessing the impact of supplies on water use metrics during irrigation seasons the soil water conditions in the case study farm were influenced by on farm rainfall and irrigation supply as controlled by river flow off farm influence results from irriset simulations for scenario one were examined to decipher the impact of river flows and rainfall on soil water conditions during the irrigation seasons 2012 13 and 2013 14 the river flow supply reliability was 60 supply restricted for 84 out of 212 days based on the number of days of supplies were restricted per season these two seasons are deemed average during these two seasons the flow restriction patterns were similar with most flow restrictions occurring during the months of february march and april figs 1 and 12 during those flow restricted periods none of the irrigation strategies would have worked and rainfall was the only input that could have influenced the soil water conditions during the 2013 14 season rainfall within the farm region during those months maintained an optimal even wet in april soil water conditions fig 12a however during the 2012 13 season when both on farm rainfall and river flow supply inputs were impacted the soil water conditions fell well below optimal conditions for all irrigation strategies fig 12b 5 discussion in this section based on the results from the three irrigation management scenarios presented above the application of irriset as a decision support tool at strategic e g assessment of irrigation infrastructure capacity tactical e g assessment and selection of a scheduling strategy to match supply and operational e g understanding the cause and effect of day to day irrigation application decisions levels are discussed at a strategic level the tool examines options and opportunities to improve water use across a spectrum of irrigation seasons at a tactical level the tool allows to compare options that are available within a season while at an operational level the tool relates the cause and effect of daily irrigation decisions 5 1 use of irriset as a strategy tool irriset was designed to estimate the water use metrics of irrigation strategies as influenced by soil type climate and irrigation infrastructure and supply the tool achieves this by facilitating an understanding of the linkage between three controls irrigation scheduling strategy jic jit and ji irrigation supply river flow and rainfall and irrigation infrastructure irrigation amount and frequency within the context of weather climate and soil type as a strategy tool irriset for a given geographical setting allows varying one or more of these controls and estimates its impact on water use metrics this can further be extended to identify those controls that can strategically be addressed to achieve an efficient water use for example for the case study farm based on the results from eighteen irrigation seasons for scenario one supply reliability was the key factor that impacted water use metrics during peak season irrespective of irrigation strategy chosen this meant that the farm may benefit by strategically investing on a secondary irrigation source e g groundwater or a storage pond that can be accessed during supply restricted periods with a secondary supply source the water use metrics could further be improved by adopting jit or ji approach irriset includes irrigation infrastructure as an input to assess if irrigations are impeded due to a lack of availability of irrigator or from an irrigation infrastructure that is unable to match the demand based on tool simulations for scenario two where there was a mix of light and heavy soils an assessment of water use metrics could be based on each soil type this would allow a justification for considering a strategic investment on an irrigator that could vary application to match soil type for example at the start of the irrigation season based on scenario two a light soil may need more water than a heavy soil table 5 which could be satisfied either by using a variable rate irrigator or by simply varying the speed of the irrigator similarly a large irrigation application to a heavy soil based on light soil trigger could result in drainage and potential nutrient loss from root zone when irrigators are operated over fields with multiple soil types and irrigations scheduled based on one soil type the differences in water use metrics between soil types can be substantially large light soil based irrigations were consistently and significantly larger than heavy soil based irrigations scenario two fig 7 this translated into more drainage loss and sub optimal too wet soil water conditions in heavy soils on the other hand a heavy soil based irrigation resulted in below optimal soil water conditions in light soil if the differences in water use metrics between light and heavy soil based irrigation triggers are substantial when there is a mix of soil types farmers may have to treat them individually and not use one trigger where the differences in soil types paw are substantial the metrics derived might be used as a justification to migrate towards an advanced irrigation system such as a variable rate irrigator also a comparison of irrigation triggers for light and heavy soil types indicated that at no time during the irrigation season would a combined trigger for the two soil types would work the differences between jit and ji strategies for the selected farm did not appear to be substantial when nutrient leaching is considered even a small difference in drainage events might prove substantial however uncertainty associated with weather conditions would mean that farms would need reliable supply sources and readily deployable irrigation infrastructures in case forecast rainfall does not eventuate as has been done in this study a marginally higher irrigation start trigger and lower stop trigger for ji compared to jit might mitigate the impact of incorrect rainfall forecast 5 2 use of irriset as a tactical tool in the region where the case study farm was located on average the shoulder season recorded more rainfall than peak see fig 1a for monthly rainfall data and the evaporative losses showed an opposing trend data not shown the inter seasonal variability in gains rainfall and losses evaporation implied that irrigation strategies need to be altered within a season to achieve an efficient water use for example if irrigations are scheduled by accounting for forecast rainfall during shoulder season it could reduce irrigation water use drainage and increase the duration of optimal soil water conditions however a supply based strategy such as jic does not allow for varying irrigation according to weather conditions on the other hand a demand based strategy such as jit and demand and forecast rainfall based strategy such as ji could take into account inter seasonal rainfall and evaporation variability and adjust irrigations accordingly figs 4a and 5a for farms that have supply limits such as seasonal maximum allowable irrigation volume allocation saving in irrigation during the shoulder season could be useful during the peak season pending no supply restriction while none of the scenarios described here included the option of a seasonal cap on irrigation volume the ji strategy which is based on current demand and current and future supplies captures the saving in irrigation water when selecting an irrigation scheduling strategy that includes supply restrictions it is important to consider the timing peak vs shoulder season duration number of days and pattern continuous vs discontinuous of supply restriction depending on the time of the season peak or shoulder a supply restriction of similar duration could have a differing impact on soil water conditions compare fig 12a and b however the choice of strategy may become important for the recovery of soil water conditions from below optimal to optimal conditions during these supply restricted periods even though all three irrigation strategies resulted in below optimal soil water conditions jic resulted in the driest soil water condition thus taking the longest time to recover to optimal conditions during the peak season the amount of irrigation water used did not differ between strategies compare the monthly irrigation summary data for jic jit and ji shown in fig 4a implying that the selection of strategy might not matter however a significantly large drainage recorded see monthly drainage summary data for different strategies in fig 4b and a reduced duration the soil water maintained within optimal growth condition for jic strategy compared to other strategies fig 5 implied that the timing of irrigation application in addition to the amount applied could make a difference to water use since jic does not consider weather conditions irrigation could happen either preceding during or immediately following rainfall events causing saturated soil conditions and drainage in case of jit as soil moisture was used as a trigger irrigations would unlikely be triggered during or immediately following rainfall events but could occur immediately before a forecast rainfall event if the forecast rainfall was greater than the storage available post irrigation then jit would result in drainage with ji since irrigations are scheduled around demand and future supply forecast rainfall such a wastage of rainfall as drainage would not happen except when the forecast rainfall exceeds soil water storage irriset is built to use standardised climate and soil databases which allows farmers and water resources managers to understand the differences in volumes of water needed during an irrigation season based on the strategy chosen by comparing water use metrics from multiple seasons for various irrigation strategies farmers might be able to build themselves a hybrid irrigation strategy that fits specific on and off farm controls for example a farm that has an annual allocation limit on irrigation volume may choose to use a strategy such as ji which carefully weaves in the use of rainfall to complement irrigation during the irrigation season as the irrigation demand and supply vary farmers may choose an irrigation strategy jic ji or jit and or irrigation triggers for demand based strategy e g varying start and stop triggers between shoulder and peak seasons to suit the seasonal weather and supply reliability patterns 5 3 application of irriset as an operational tool irriset uses a water balance approach fig 2 to estimate water use metrics such as the amount of irrigation used drainage generated and duration the soil water was maintained within optimal growing conditions on a daily basis the water balance approach though widely used has its own limitations because of its simplicity and not requiring on farm measurements such as soil moisture fereres et al 2003 it assumes a uniformity of properties such as the soil water holding capacity and inputs such as rainfall evaporation and irrigation the tool allows the farmer to balance various outcomes when making daily irrigation decisions and the ability to add forecast to this will further improve farmer decisions however for the tool to be operational it needs to be updated on a daily basis with rainfall reference crop et and irrigation supply and application data 6 conclusions a water balance tool irriset was developed to combine key on and off farm variables that influence irrigation scheduling strategies the factors selected addressed key operational irrigation management questions such as should i irrigate today and if so is the irrigator available to irrigate is there water available at the source for irrigation abstraction would the proposed irrigation be within the allowable seasonal irrigation allocation volume limit and is there a rainfall forecast in short term that could be used to defer the planned irrigation event the tool also simulates the cause and effect arising from these daily operational irrigation decisions on drainage and root zone soil water available for crop use the tool outputs three water use metrics amount of irrigation drainage resulting from poorly timed irrigations and duration during an irrigation season when the soil water conditions were maintained in an optimal range for pasture growth compared to demand based scheduling strategies supply based irrigation strategies that do not account for weather or soil water conditions consistently resulted in more irrigation applied more drainage generated and less optimal soil water conditions for pasture growth during the peak irrigation season november to march both demand and supply based scheduling strategies appeared to be using similar amounts of irrigations though the supply based strategies triggered irrigations at inopportune moments e g immediately before during or after a significant rainfall event resulting in larger drainage and below optimal soil water conditions compared to demand based practices irriset considers farm specific factors such as irrigation demand irrigation infrastructure climate soil type and supply limitations irriset assumes an unchanged irrigation scheduling strategy throughout an irrigation season however farmers are known to change their irrigation strategies during and between seasons as supply weather and other conditions e g a broken irrigator dictate for this reason irriset does not lend itself for direct comparison and validation using field based observations and thus should only be used as a tool to compare scenarios this tool facilitates strategic e g assessment of irrigation infrastructure over seasons tactical e g inter seasonal evaluation of scheduling practice and to a limited extent operational e g understanding the cause and effect of daily irrigation decisions decision making that supports

9882,the evaluation of the role of different agronomic strategies in achieving sustainable wheat yields under variable mediterranean climate conditions may involve the use of resource use indicators that combine productivity and environmental impact a two seasons field experiment was conducted in south portugal to study the effect of water regimes and nitrogen fertilization on wheat yield grain quality and water use evaluated with water productivity and water footprint indicators the water regime treatments were full irrigation supplemental irrigation and rainfed nitrogen fertilizer treatments including conventional and enhanced efficiency fertilizers eef were distinguished by n splitting and timing over the crop cycle contrasting meteorological variables in the two years caused distinct wheat productive responses although leading to lower grain yields supplemental irrigation guaranteed a water productivity similar to full irrigation the use of eefs in which 50 of the total nitrogen was applied at the booting phase had a positive significant effect on grain protein content and on dough rheologic properties indicating that late nitrogen applications benefit the technological quality of wheat the average total water footprints estimated for the two seasons showed no relevant differences but the partition of the green blue and grey components in irrigated wheat varied with an increased importance of blue water consumptive use in the second year of the experiment in fact the ratio blue water footprint green water footprint increased from 0 40 to 2 00 due to higher irrigation requirements high grey water footprint in rainfed wheat was mostly influenced by lower yields in 2018 2019 and by an advantageous rainfall distribution during the 2017 2018 season no significant reduction in grey water footprint was observed when using eefs a multivariate statistical approach through factor analysis fa and multivariate linear regression mlr was used to examine the data structure and correlation fa resulted in three factor models of yield and water use yield components and wheat quality in the first season in the second drier season variables most

anthesis maturation and or tillering graphical abstract ga1 keywords wheat water footprint irrigation water productivity nitrogen fertilization factor analysis multivariate linear regression 1 introduction inter annual and seasonal rainfall patterns variability and frequent occurrence of heat stress periods are features of the mediterranean climate and often promote situations of water deficit in the most water sensitive stages of wheat triticum aestivum l growth cycle leading to significant reductions in productivity mäkinen et al 2018 this unfavorable distribution tends to accentuate with climate change trnka et al 2011 contributing to the unpredictability of productive responses to the instability of a sector already weakened by income gaps and fluctuations and ultimately to the increase in the intensity of water and fertilizer use in order to achieve higher yields castellanos et al 2016 portugal is an importer of wheat in 2018 the portuguese wheat production was only 0 05 of the eu 28 total harvested production eurostat 2020 this trade deficit is difficult to overcome given the less than optimal market conditions and the increasing attractiveness to farmers of other crops that are more productive under the mediterranean climate that prevails in mainland portugal especially in the southern regions the need to reverse the downward trend in cereal production that has occurred in recent decades led the portuguese government to establish a national strategy to promote the development of the portuguese cereal production mafdr 2018 this policy identifies among other priority measures the need to improve the resource efficiency through the adoption of more efficient irrigation and fertilization management practices wheat sensitivity to water deficits and high temperatures varies through its growth cycle wheat response to water stress is more conspicuous from stem elongation to grain filling zhang and oweis 1999 during stem elongation and booting it can affect the potential grain number per unit area alghory and yazar 2018 at the reproductive stages of anthesis and grain filling the photosynthesis rate can be significantly affected therefore reducing the amount of assimilates available to the grains porter and gawith 1999 barnabás et al 2008 prasad and maduraimuthu 2014 water stress combined with nitrogen n deficiency can lead to the reduction in the number of grains per unit area grain yield and n use efficiency nue particularly if they occur around anthesis plaut et al 2004 albrizio et al 2010 liu et

or productivity indicators of water and nutrients used by crops under different water regimes has been the subject of several studies howell 2001 katerji et al 2008 zwart et al 2010 pereira et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 tomaz et al 2018 water productivity values expressed as the ratio between the product obtained grain yield and the input use crop evapotranspiration in the case of crop water productivity wpc and volume of irrigation water in the case of irrigation water productivity wpi are indicators to evaluate the impact of different options on resource productivity and on farm results levidow et al 2014 fernández et al 2020 moreover the assessment of the impact of human consumption on freshwater resources incorporated in industrial and or agricultural processes called virtual water has been carried out using the water footprint wf concept hoekstra 2003 the water footprint is a tool to calculate the water virtually embedded in commodities representative of the volume of water needed to produce goods and services hoekstra et al 2011 at the crop level it can be a quantifiable indicator for measuring the water applied by irrigation the water stored in the soil fractions consumed by the crop and the potentially contaminated water as a result of the adopted agronomical practices hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 therefore three components are considered in the water footprint i the green water footprint wfgreen representing the volume of water resulting from precipitation that does not runoff or recharge aquifers being consumed by the crop during its growth ii the blue water footprint wfblue representing the consumptive volume of surface and groundwater that is used in irrigation iii the grey water footprint wfgrey representing the volume of water that is necessary to assimilate the polluting load which in the case of agriculture is an indicator of the degree of water contamination associated with the leaching of chemicals used in the productive process hoekstra et al 2011 the consumptive wf per unit of product green and blue components can be interpreted as the inverse of water productivity and as such is relevant in discussions about resource efficiency hoekstra 2017 this standpoint is a basis to explore the water footprints of crop production based not only in large spatial and temporal scales as it has been largely conducted zeng et al 2012 ababaei and etedali 2014 ercin and hoekstra 2016 liu et al 2017 garofalo et al 2019 elbeltagi et al 2020 but also at the field level nogueira et al 2012 qin et al 2016 xinchun et al 2018 some constraints in wf accounting related to data quality and accuracy and or feasibility for comparisons between regions with different climates have been reported which constitutes an impairment for its use as a reliable indicator of agricultural water use huang et al 2019 laan et al 2019 liu et al 2017 expanding water footprint estimates from on field measurements in different agri environmental conditions can improve its benchmarking making this integrated indicator of crop water use a valuable tool for improving water productivity and for resources management hoekstra 2017 elbeltagi et al 2020 pardo et al 2020 as well as for delineating strategic policies regarding wheat production in water scarce regions as is the case of southern portugal taking the above into consideration the object of this study was to contribute to the adoption of more efficient irrigation and fertilization practices and to the economic and environmental sustainability of wheat production under mediterranean climatic conditions for this purpose we aimed to i evaluate the effects of different irrigation and nitrogen fertilization strategies on wheat yield water productivity and technological quality ii apply the water footprint indicators to a field experiment widening the base of results from the application of this methodology to field studies iii examine data structure and relationships between wheat grain yield water use indicators grain technological traits and ndvi measurements with proximal sensors through multivariate statistical techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design and site description the study took place during two seasons 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 in beja south portugal it consisted of two trials with the wheat cultivar

systems in the absence of data collected in situ or consistent information with respect to diffuse sources of water pollution in portuguese agricultural systems we used a value of a 10 for nitrogen fertilizers hoekstra et al 2011 franke et al 2013 in the literature we can find different values of c max and c nat leading to disparities in the wf grey assessments that could prevent this indicator to provide a consistent value for water quality and being a tool for sound policy supporting in the water sector mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 liu et al 2017 we followed the recommendation to use local information whenever available hoekstra et al 2011 and for the ambient water quality standard c max we used 50 mg n no3 l 1 the maximum allowable value concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources according to european eec 1991 and portuguese legislation decree law 236 98 on water quality assessment 1998 in the case of c nat for n many previous studies assumed the value 0 due to lack of data but this assumption leads to an underestimation of wf grey liu et al 2017 which we prevented by using the value 0 1 mg n no3 l 1 from franke et al 2013 2 4 statistical analyses for the statistical analyses of data statistica 7 statsoft inc two way analyses of variance anova were performed for the effects of irrigation and nitrogen strategies the anova were conducted separately for each growing season differences between means were compared using tukey s test p 0 05 factor analyses fa for each season were conducted to explore the data structure to describe how the original p variables depend on a small number k of latent variables or factors k p thus reducing correlated observed variables into a small number of independent variables härdle and simar 2015 the aim was to examine for each season latent unobserved common characteristics of the studied variables related with wheat grain yield technological quality and or water use the factors were extracted using the principal components analysis pca method and the matrix of factor loadings was submitted to varimax rotation to yield a factor structure simpler to interpret jagadamma et al 2008 factors were retained when presenting eigenvalues 1 a contribution for the proportion of variance 10 and at least two observed variables contribution with absolute factor loadings 0 40 variables with large in absolute value factor loadings are more likely to represent a common factor although there are no established or clear rules that help decide what is a large factor loading mallarino et al 1999 jagadamma et al 2008 variables were considered highly correlated whenever factor loadings were 0 50 and moderately correlated when loadings were 0 40 lee et al 2005 jagadamma et al 2008 if the variables are properly selected by studying the result of a factor analysis it is possible to make a fairly justified choice of the independent variables which can be included in a subsequent regression analysis ferrari et al 1957 for each season ndvi measurements and water footprints values were selected to perform stepwise multiple linear regressions mlr in order to examine the relationship between the ndvi measurements as independent variables and green blue or grey water footprint indicators as response dependent variables for these analyses the standard selection procedure to identify a single subset of independent variables was used by adding or deleting a variable at each step according to a given criterion stated on terms of the f statistic in this case f to enter 1 and f to remove 0 neter et al 1983 in a mlr model multiple r2 measures the proportionate reduction of total variation in the response variable associated with the use of the set of selected independent variables higher r2 values mean a good model fit for the data since r2 often can be made high by including a large number of independent variables a modified measure is also used the adjusted r2 which recognizes the number of independent variables in the model neter et al 1983 β are the standardized regression coefficients of the independent variables used to facilitate comparisons when different units are involved neter et al 1983 monaco and sali 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 phenology and biomass monitoring the temporal variation of the maximum and minimum temperatures as well as the total amount of rainfall over the wheat growth cycles under study was quite different fig 1 promoting different water requirements table 2 in 2017 2018 the distribution of precipitation particularly in the spring months march to may was more favorable as it coincided with some of the critical stages of wheat regarding water requirements like booting and flowering the contrasting meteorological variables in the two years influenced the crop phenological cycle fig 2 higher temperatures in february 2019 promoted an anticipation of tillering and booting fig 2b overall the 2018 2019 crop cycle was approximately one month shorter than in 2017 2018 but reduction was higher from sowing to anthesis 17 days than in the remaining growing season 12 days from anthesis to harvest thus the increase in evaporative demand of the atmosphere due to higher temperatures was counterbalanced by the reductions in the length of the phenological cycle the ndvi an indicator of chlorophyll concentration and canopy leaf area was used for the dynamic monitoring of the biomass change during the two growth seasons duan et al 2017 fig 3 in 2017 2018 no significative differences were found in ndvi values measured in the three water regimes at any stage of the growing cycle fig 3a table s1 the highest values were measured at the booting stage varying from 0 823 in r1 to 0 853 in r0 and the lowest were registered at maturation averaging 0 141 in the case of n fertilization ndvi values measured at booting were significatively higher in the n3 and n5 treatments 0 846 denoting a positive effect in the biomass of plants when stabilized or controlled release fertilizers are applied table s1 at the maturation phase ndvi was higher in the n4 treatment 0 147 indicating higher chlorophyll content thus some delay in maturation probably due to the late application of n at the booting stage in 2018 2019 ndvi values differed significantly for different water regimes in every stage except tillering ndvitill with the highest values measured at booting ndviboot and heading ndvihead in the full irrigation treatments 0 701 and 0 728 respectively and in the supplemental irrigation treatments 0 638 and 0 662 respectively fig 3b table s1 these results were in general below reference values in the literature where ndviboot in irrigated wheat ranged from 0 80 to 0 88 aparicio et al 2000 clay et al 2012 and ndvihead reached 0 91 duan et al 2017 the differences regarding values in the literature are even more pronounced in the advanced stages of the cycle since even in irrigated plants the ndvimat values measured 0 337 and 0 342 in r1 and r2 respectively were considerably lower than those reported by aparicio et al 2000 0 50 or naser et al 2020 0 58 these values indicate the effect of the high temperatures experienced during the final growing stages which induced a more rapid plant senescence nitrogen fertilizers type splitting and timing influenced ndvi values except at the anthesis phase table s1 the highest values were registered in the treatments with eefs totally applied at sowing n3 n5 and n7 at the booting stage 0 689 0 678 and 0 688 respectively and at the heading stage 0 706 0 689 and 0 701 respectively pointing to a positive influence of n gradual bio availability in the development of wheat biomass 3 2 grain yield and water use the results of grain yield and its components reflected the effect of temperatures and the quantity and distribution of rainfall recorded in each year especially during april and early may table 3 higher temperatures and lack of precipitation caused an increase in 2018 2019 irrigation requirements of approximately 1 7 times compared to the previous year in 2017 2018 with more abundant and better distributed rainfall in periods of higher crop demand there was a statistically significant effect of water regime both in the number of grains per m2 ng and 1000 grains weight 1000 gw showing an inverse compensation effect between these yield components that lead to no statistical differences in grain yield y 7286 kg ha 1 in r1 6932 kg ha 1 in r2 and 7083 kg ha 1 in r0 the occurrence of precipitation during the stages of heading and initial grain filling attenuated the differences between water regimes an effect which is even more pronounced when soils present a high water storage capacity as is the case of vertisols in 2018 2019 a shorter cycle and a shorter time for biomass accumulation resulted in lower yields in general the average yield obtained in 2018 2019 was about 38 lower than the previous year although no significant differences were observed in 1000 gw between water regimes there was a significantly higher ng in the irrigated treatments 13 338 per m2 in r1 and 12 695 per m2 in r2 when compared to the rainfed 6480 per m2 also the effect of irrigation on productivity had statistical significance with the r1 treatment presenting the highest yield values 5570 kg ha 1 followed by the r2 4956 kg ha 1 and r0 2629 kg ha 1 in a study on the interactive effects of water and nitrogen on the productive responses of durum wheat triticum durum desf grown in a mediterranean environment albrizio et al 2010 found similar results with the crop response being mostly influenced by nitrogen fertilization as a consequence of the occurrence of abundant rainfall during the experiment period in 2017 2018 the n1 and n2 fertilization treatments distinguished by different fractioning with a conventional n fertilizer showed the highest ng 16 158 per m2 and 16 145 per m2 respectively n1 and n2 were also the nitrogen fertilizer treatments with the highest y respectively 7378 kg ha 1 and 7337 kg ha 1 wpc 1 62 kg m 3 in n1 and 1 60 kg m 3 in n2 and wpi 5 28 kg m 3 in n1 and 5 35 kg m 3 in n2 this set of results indicates that gradual n release fertilizers had no distinctive effect on wheat productivity as found by maharjan et al 2014 or blandino et al 2015 probably because of n availability until advanced stages the n4 treatment showed the highest 1000 gw in both years 46 69 g and 42 61 g in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively in 2018 2019 the n7 treatment had the highest ng 12 065 grains per m2 y 4899 kg ha 1 and wpi 2 50 kg m 3 rainfed wheat used soil stored water more efficiently wpc of 1 77 kg m 3 in 2017 2018 and 1 86 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 furthermore the wpc of the two irrigated treatments did not differ statistically in any of the agricultural years 1 4 1 5 kg m 3 in 2017 2018 1 3 1 4 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 indicating that the supplemental irrigation strategy r2 adjusted so that the water supplies coincide with the crop critical stages although leading to lower grain yields guarantees an efficiency in the use of water similar to full irrigation r1 the agronomic practice of supplemental irrigation applied at the crop most sensitive periods to drought and heat stress is already commonly adopted in the mediterranean area and in many world regions on low value crops aiming to minimize yield variation and maintain production to an economically acceptable level daccache et al 2014 overall average wpc were in any water regime for both seasons higher than some of the reported in reference literature namely 0 47 kg m 3 chapagain and hoekstra 2004 0 39 kg m 3 liu et al 2007 or 0 64 kg m 3 to 1 82 kg m 3 zwart et al 2010 obtained for wheat yields in turkey and france respectively in fact the average values observed in r0 approached the potential value estimated by liu et al 2007 for portugal 1 85 kg m 3 corresponding to a potential yield of approximately 9000 kg ha 1 when analyzing the average values of wpi the results show that in 2017 2018 with reduced irrigation requirements due to a very beneficial distribution of rainfall during spring and the subsequent attainment of high yields wheat presented a high wpi of 5 10 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 the average values of wpi decreased to 2 18 kg m 3 the differences between r1 and r2 had no statistical significance in both years of the experiment a confirmation that irrigation applied at the beginning of stem extension booting anthesis and grain filling is used equally efficiently by the crop while using smaller volumes of irrigation water these results were in accordance to previous findings of this research team in a study during a very dry year in which the same wheat cultivar showed higher efficiency in the use of irrigation water under a supplemental irrigation management strategy oliveira et al 2019 no interaction water regime x n splitting timing occurred in grain yield yield components and water productivity 3 3 grain technological quality the effect of irrigation and n fertilization type splitting timing on grain quality traits differed in the two years of the experiment which indicates that as reported by lópez bellido et al 2001 the variability of the mediterranean climate also leads to irregular wheat quality table 4 in general there was no significant effect of the studied factors on hectoliter weight hw which seems to indicate that this grain quality trait is mainly linked to genetic factors borghi et al 1997 only in the year 2018 2019 the significantly higher value obtained in r0 stood out 82 4 kg hl 1 which may be related with the lower number of grains obtained in this water regime the grain protein content gpc is mainly influenced by the environmental conditions of each location and each year and by the dose and fractionation of n fertilization blandino et al 2015 and the results showed that this was the factor that most influenced gpc the treatments that led to higher levels of gpc were those corresponding to the application of eefs in which 50 of the total nitrogen was applied at the booting stage n4 n6 and n8 which evidences that late nitrogen applications benefit this grain quality parameter the higher average gpc in 2018 2019 in the n treatments 14 4 was related to lower grain yield r1 treatment showed a higher significant gpc of 14 8 while the lower value occurred in r2 12 4 in 2017 2018 there was no significant effect of the water regime the absence of this effect was certainly linked to the spring rainfall which attenuated the differences obtained under different water regimes the flour rheological properties strength w and tenacity extensibility ratio p l were also mainly influenced by nitrogen fertilization this factor clearly influenced the dough balance in 2017 2018 as p l values were lower and closer to the values required by the milling industry for a balanced wheat namely in the range 0 50 1 00 bordes et al 2008 when 50 of the total nitrogen was applied at the booting stage 0 87 in n4 0 97 in n6 and 0 97 in n8 it is also worth noting that the p l values were in general and especially in 2018 2019 high corresponding to very strong and moderately extensible dough which is likely related to the characteristics of the grain in this cultivar in 2017 2018 values of w above 300 10 4 j characteristic of good quality wheat bordes et al 2008 were obtained in the treatments with n fractioning and late application in 2018 2019 w values were higher than 350 10 4 j characteristic of strong improving wheats bordes et al 2008 valued by the milling industry occurred in the same n treatments these results indicate the advantage of this strategy to promote the technological quality of the grain the w values were in direct relation with gpc which is in accordance with the results by lópez bellido et al 2001 that found a significant correlation between variations in w and gpc when analyzing the bread making quality of hard red spring wheat under rainfed mediterranean conditions 3 4 water footprints the average total water footprints wf estimated for the two wheat seasons showed no relevant differences 694 3 m3 t 1 in 2017 2018 and 717 6 m3 t 1 in 2018 2019 but the partition of the three components of water footprint in irrigated wheat varied due to the increase in the relative importance of blue water consumption in the second year of the experiment fig 4 the total wf obtained for both seasons were approximately 2 5 times smaller than the crop benchmark reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 1827 m3 t 1 which includes wheat crops of humid climates as a result of the amount and beneficial distribution of rainfall in 2017 2018 there were no significant statistical differences between the values of wfgreen of the three irrigation regimes although the r2 value was approximately 25 m3 t 1 higher than the r1 value table s2 in 2018 2019 when a differentiation between water regimes took place the wfgreen value was significantly higher in the rainfed treatment 470 3 m3 t 1 overall the magnitude of the wfgreen indicator decreases with the increase in the amount of irrigation applied and its value is influenced by climatic conditions in 2018 2019 wfgreen in the r1 treatment was 212 8 m3 t 1 while the reference value for wheat reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 in their global assessment of the water footprint for the period 1996 2005 is 1277 m3 t 1 therefore there should be caution when comparing this indicator across areas with different climates pardo et al 2020 wfblue values in 2017 2018 198 4 m3 t 1 in r1 and 196 0 m3 t 1 in r2 respectively are of the order of magnitude of the reference value 140 m3 t 1 of southern europe obtained by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and are lower than the season wfgreen values contrary in the next year blue water was the primary water source for wheat growth fig 4b with wfblue reaching 478 8 m3 t 1 in the r2 treatment a value that is 40 higher than the benchmarks of the crop 324 m3 t 1 or of the region southern europe mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 the ratio wfblue wfgreen was of approximately 0 40 and 2 00 in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively showing that blue water use is of higher relevance in semi arid environments in general and particularly in dry years in regions with mediterranean climate where the achievement of sustainable crop yields is dependent on irrigation within the same region wfblue of a given crop may vary widely according to irrigation conditions from no irrigation to full irrigation and from highly efficient to non efficient systems recent studies have highlighted that in determining the blue component of the water footprint it is also necessary to account for the extra consumption of water that is often applied to compensate non uniform irrigation distribution percolation and runoff losses due to low efficiency of the irrigation systems or salts leaching fractions ababaei and etedali 2014 castellanos et al 2016 al muaini et al 2019 another important consideration is that blue water footprint is directly related to the carbon footprint whenever pressurized irrigation systems are used and therefore this indicator implies an impact of irrigated agriculture on global warming pardo et al 2020 no significant differences were found for wfgrey among water regimes in the first season but a significant effect was found for n fertilization with the lowest values observed in the conventional fertilizer treatments n1 and n2 these results were complementary of the results presented in section 3 2 for grain yield and water use table 3 therefore under mediterranean environment the wheat grey footprint related to nitrogen under the occurrence of advantageous rainfall amount and distribution during the growing cycle was mostly influenced by nitrogen fertilization with no benefit resulting from the use of the so called enhanced efficiency n fertilizers contrary to what could be expected in rainfed conditions where n leaching is lower thereby more likely to remain longer in the soil significant higher wfgrey was observed in the r0 treatment in 2018 2019 145 5 m3 t 1 this result primarily reflects the low yields of rainfed plants under less optimal rainfall distribution and temperatures but also the calculation of wfgrey using the same leaching fraction for rainfed and irrigated treatments nevertheless values of grey water footprint obtained for all treatments were lower than the reference value for wfgrey of wheat 207 m3 t 1 reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 the assessment of wfgrey related to nitrogen is affected by disparities in the selected quality standards and the leaching runoff rate considered for its computation liu et al 2017 these limitations in wfgrey calculations must be taken into consideration when comparing results from different studies as reported by laan et al 2019 the application of water footprint accounting is mostly done at large scales but the estimation of crop and region specific water footprints for up scaling is dependent on accurate and representative in field measurements 3 5 factor analysis and multiple linear regression the relationships observed among specific clusters of variables were translated into three factor models for both seasons tables 5 and 6 in 2017 2018 the three factors explained 68 2 of total variance and presented communality values generally high for all the variables factor 1 explained 38 3 of the variance and presented high positive loadings 0 50 of y 0 94 wpi 0 91 and ndvianth 0 54 high negative loadings in factor 1 0 50 belonged to wfgreen 0 94 wfblue 0 91 and wfgrey 0 94 and moderate positive factor loadings belonged to wpc 0 46 and ndviboot 0 40 thereby factor 1 describes yield and water use including water productivity and water footprint indicators given the high weights of y wp and wf factor 2 was responsible for explaining 16 2 of the total variance and represented a latent variable of yield components since it was mainly influence by ng 0 92 and 1000 gw 0 78 lastly factor 3 accounted with 13 6 of total variance and presented high positive correlations with gpc 0 89 and w 0 86 and negative correlation with p l 0 82 therefore corresponding to a grain quality factor in 2018 2019 the data were mainly determined by three factors that captured 73 9 of the total variance overall presenting high communalities table 6 the factors presented the following structure factor 1 accounting for 43 4 of total variance was highly correlated with y 0 91 ng 0 89 wfgreen 0 90 wfgrey 0 90 hw 0 64 ndvitill 0 51 ndvistem 0 73 ndviboot 0 91 ndvihead 0 92 ndvianth 0 78 and ndvimat 0 51 therefore denoted a yield and water footprint latent variable factor 2 accounting for 17 6 of total variance was a grain quality factor with high loadings of gpc 0 87 w 0 80 p l 0 78 and ndvimat 0 61 factor 3 which explained 13 0 of total variance was positively correlated with wpc 0 65 wpi 0 94 and wfblue 0 94 representing a latent variable of irrigation water productivity although with some similarities the comparison of the factor models obtained for the two seasons points to a shift in the contribution of the yield water use variables while the latent variables obtained in 2017 2018 may somewhat be described as of classical structure drawing out the separation between yield and water use parameters yield components and wheat quality characteristics lee et al 2005 leilah and al khateeb 2005 in 2018 2019 variables most related with blue water use were clustered in one detached factor which was probably related to a determining influence of the environmental conditions that lead to the differentiation in irrigation requirements and crop responses for this season furthermore measures of biomass progress ndvi from tillering to anthesis strongly participated the yield related latent variable highlighting that under dryer conditions there is consistent correlation between ndvi measured at early growing and anthesis stages and grain yield naser et al 2020 fa was conducted to combine the homogenous variables together thereby reducing the number of variables to be considered for further investigation based on this assumption multiple linear regression analysis mlr using the standard stepwise procedure were performed to identify a set of ndvi measurements at different stages of the growing cycle that could act as predictors of wheat wf specifically ndvi variables in each season were selected to examine its prediction capability of correlated water footprints the results of the mlr for the 2017 2018 season indicated that there was no collective significant effect between the three ndvi variables ndviboot ndvianth and ndvimat and water footprint green wfgreen or grey wfgrey table 7 ndvianth significantly predicted wfgreen β 0 512 p 0 000 but neither ndviboot nor ndvimat were significant predictors these variables explained 35 8 of the variance r2 0 358 f 2 93 17 110 p 0 000 ndviboot significantly predicted wfblue β 0 484 p 0 000 as well as ndvianth β 0 231 p 0 043 and ndvimat β 0 214 p 0 049 explaining 39 0 of the variance r2 0 390 f 2 61 12 795 p 0 000 ndviboot and ndvimat were

latent factors equal β and multiple r2 values found for the mlr of green and grey water footprints reflect a strong correlation between the ndvi values at different stages especially in 2018 2019 4 conclusions contrasting weather patterns typical of the mediterranean climate lead to distinct wheat productive responses the results of our study indicate that the occurrence of precipitation during the stages of heading and initial grain filling attenuated the differences between water regimes and the crop response was mostly influenced by nitrogen fertilization smaller amount of precipitation combined with higher average maximum temperatures during the wheat growth is cause for shorter time for biomass accumulation and therefore lower yields the supplemental irrigation strategy adjusted so that the water supplies coincided with the critical stages of the crop although leading to lower grain yields guaranteed crop water productivity and irrigation water productivity similar to full irrigation different effects of water regimes observed for the two years under study show that the influence of the mediterranean climate irregularity is determinant not only for yield variability but also for grain quality the application of enhanced efficient n fertilizers in which 50 of the total nitrogen was applied at the booting stage had a positive significant effect on grain protein content and in the values of the alveograph indicating that late nitrogen applications benefit the technological quality of wheat the average total water footprints estimated for the two seasons showed no relevant differences but the partition of the green blue and grey components in irrigated wheat varied with an increase in the blue water consumptive use in the second year of the experiment due to higher irrigation requirements in fact the ratio wfblue wfgreen was 5 times higher in the drier season which clearly shows that blue water use is most relevant in semi arid environments in general and in dry years in regions with mediterranean climate where the achievement of sustainable crop yields is dependent on irrigation the wheat wfgrey related to nitrogen under the occurrence of advantageous rainfall amount and distribution during wheat growing was mostly influenced by n fertilization furthermore no benefit resulted from the use of nitrogen eefs although it should be taken into account that the same leaching rate was used for the various types of nitrogen fertilizers the multivariate statistical analysis performed with factor analysis resulted in a combination of homogenous variables in three factor models obtained for each season the latent variables found in 2017 2018 were related to yield and water use relations yield components and wheat quality parameters in 2018 2019 indicators of blue water use were clustered in one detached factor probably expressing the determining influence of the environmental conditions that lead to the differentiation in irrigation requirements for this season the stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis allowed for the establishment of significant relationships between biomass development measured with ndvi proximal sensors at the stages of tillering booting anthesis and maturation and water footprints indicators of green and blue consumptive water as well as grey water that is necessary to assimilate the nitrogen load from mineral fertilization the results of the study pointed to a good prediction capability of wfblue using multiple linear regressions with ndvi registered at booting anthesis maturation and or tillering and of wfgreen and wfgrey using multiple linear relations with the ndvi registered at booting anthesis and maturation funding this research was supported by the project

9882,the evaluation of the role of different agronomic strategies in achieving sustainable wheat yields under variable mediterranean climate conditions may involve the use of resource use indicators that combine productivity and environmental impact a two seasons field experiment was conducted in south portugal to study the effect of water regimes and nitrogen fertilization on wheat yield grain quality and water use evaluated with water productivity and water footprint indicators the water regime treatments were full irrigation supplemental irrigation and rainfed nitrogen fertilizer treatments including conventional and enhanced efficiency fertilizers eef were distinguished by n splitting and timing over the crop cycle contrasting meteorological variables in the two years caused distinct wheat productive responses although leading to lower grain yields supplemental irrigation guaranteed a water productivity similar to full irrigation the use of eefs in which 50 of the total nitrogen was applied at the booting phase had a positive significant effect on grain protein content and on dough rheologic properties indicating that late nitrogen applications benefit the technological quality of wheat the average total water footprints estimated for the two seasons showed no relevant differences but the partition of the green blue and grey components in irrigated wheat varied with an increased importance of blue water consumptive use in the second year of the experiment in fact the ratio blue water footprint green water footprint increased from 0 40 to 2 00 due to higher irrigation requirements high grey water footprint in rainfed wheat was mostly influenced by lower yields in 2018 2019 and by an advantageous rainfall distribution during the 2017 2018 season no significant reduction in grey water footprint was observed when using eefs a multivariate statistical approach through factor analysis fa and multivariate linear regression mlr was used to examine the data structure and correlation fa resulted in three factor models of yield and water use yield components and wheat quality in the first season in the second drier season variables most related with irrigation water use were clustered in one detached factor the stepwise mlr pointed to a good prediction capability of water footprints from ndvi measured with proximal sensors at booting

introduction inter annual and seasonal rainfall patterns variability and frequent occurrence of heat stress periods are features of the mediterranean climate and often promote situations of water deficit in the most water sensitive stages of wheat triticum aestivum l growth cycle leading to significant reductions in productivity mäkinen et al 2018 this unfavorable distribution tends to accentuate with climate change trnka et al 2011 contributing to the unpredictability of productive responses to the instability of a sector already weakened by income gaps and fluctuations and ultimately to the increase in the intensity of water and fertilizer use in order to achieve higher yields castellanos et al 2016 portugal is an importer of wheat in 2018 the portuguese wheat production was only 0 05 of the eu 28 total harvested production eurostat 2020 this trade deficit is difficult to overcome given the less than optimal market conditions and the increasing attractiveness to farmers of other crops that are more productive under the mediterranean climate that prevails in mainland portugal especially in the southern regions the need to reverse the downward trend in cereal production that has occurred in recent decades led the portuguese government to establish a national strategy to promote the development of the portuguese cereal production mafdr 2018 this policy identifies among other priority measures the need to improve the resource efficiency through the adoption of more efficient irrigation and fertilization management practices wheat sensitivity to water deficits and high temperatures varies through its growth cycle wheat response to water stress is more conspicuous from stem elongation to grain filling zhang and oweis 1999 during stem elongation and booting it can affect the potential grain number per unit area alghory and yazar 2018 at the reproductive stages of anthesis and grain filling the photosynthesis rate can be significantly affected therefore reducing the amount of assimilates available to the grains porter and gawith 1999 barnabás et al 2008 prasad and maduraimuthu 2014 water stress combined with nitrogen n deficiency can lead to the reduction in the number of grains per unit area grain yield and n use efficiency nue particularly if they occur around anthesis plaut et al 2004 albrizio et al 2010 liu et al 2018 furthermore n content is widely considered as the main factor promoting protein storage and wheat grain quality blandino et al 2015 yu et al 2018 in order to face these constraints adapted agronomic practices have the potential to stabilize and or increase wheat yields in mediterranean areas ensuring higher water use efficiency wue nue and grain quality ali fallahi et al 2008 chen et al 2008 tomaz et al 2017a ul allah et al 2018 oliveira et al 2019 patanita et al 2019 this practices include supplemental irrigation oweis 1997 zhang et al 1999 zeleke and nendel 2016 liu et al 2018 combined with alternative n fertilization techniques such as time adjusted application or prolonged bioavailability through enhanced efficiency fertilizers eefs nitrogen eefs can be classified as slow release fertilizers obtained as condensation products of urea and urea aldehydes controlled release fertilizers that contain a conventional fertilizer whose nutrient release in the soil is regulated by sulfur or and polymer coatings stabilized fertilizers which are modified during the production process with a nitrification inhibitor or an urease inhibitor trenkel 1997 the use of efficiency and or productivity indicators of water and nutrients used by crops under different water regimes has been the subject of several studies howell 2001 katerji et al 2008 zwart et al 2010 pereira et al 2012 zhang et al 2017 tomaz et al 2018 water productivity values expressed as the ratio between the product obtained grain yield and the input use crop evapotranspiration in the case of crop water productivity wpc and volume of irrigation water in the case of irrigation water productivity wpi are indicators to evaluate the impact of different options on resource productivity and on farm results levidow et al 2014 fernández et al 2020 moreover the assessment of the impact of human consumption on freshwater resources incorporated in industrial and or agricultural processes called virtual water has been carried out using the water footprint wf concept hoekstra 2003 the water footprint is a tool to calculate the water virtually embedded in commodities representative of the volume of water needed to produce goods and services hoekstra et al 2011 at the crop level it can be a quantifiable indicator for measuring the water applied by irrigation the water stored in the soil fractions consumed by the crop and the potentially contaminated water as a result of the adopted agronomical practices hoekstra et al 2011 mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 therefore three components are considered in the water footprint i the green water footprint wfgreen representing the volume of water resulting from precipitation that does not runoff or recharge aquifers being consumed by the crop during its growth ii the blue water footprint wfblue representing the consumptive volume of surface and groundwater that is used in irrigation iii the grey water footprint wfgrey representing the volume of water that is necessary to assimilate the polluting load which in the case of agriculture is an indicator of the degree of water contamination associated with the leaching of chemicals used in the productive process hoekstra et al 2011 the consumptive wf per unit of product green and blue components can be interpreted as the inverse of water productivity and as such is relevant in discussions about resource efficiency hoekstra 2017 this standpoint is a basis to explore the water footprints of crop production based not only in large spatial and temporal scales as it has been largely conducted zeng et al 2012 ababaei and etedali 2014 ercin and hoekstra 2016 liu et al 2017 garofalo et al 2019 elbeltagi et al 2020 but also at the field level nogueira et al 2012 qin et al 2016 xinchun et al 2018 some constraints in wf accounting related to data quality and accuracy and or feasibility for comparisons between regions with different climates have been reported which constitutes an impairment for its use as a reliable indicator of agricultural water use huang et al 2019 laan et al 2019 liu et al 2017 expanding water footprint estimates from on field measurements in different agri environmental conditions can improve its benchmarking making this integrated indicator of crop water use a valuable tool for improving water productivity and for resources management hoekstra 2017 elbeltagi et al 2020 pardo et al 2020 as well as for delineating strategic policies regarding wheat production in water scarce regions as is the case of southern portugal taking the above into consideration the object of this study was to contribute to the adoption of more efficient irrigation and fertilization practices and to the economic and environmental sustainability of wheat production under mediterranean climatic conditions for this purpose we aimed to i evaluate the effects of different irrigation and nitrogen fertilization strategies on wheat yield water productivity and technological quality ii apply the water footprint indicators to a field experiment widening the base of results from the application of this methodology to field studies iii examine data structure and relationships between wheat grain yield water use indicators grain technological traits and ndvi measurements with proximal sensors through multivariate statistical techniques 2 materials and methods 2 1 study design and site description the study took place during two seasons 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 in beja south portugal it consisted of two trials with the wheat cultivar

systems in the absence of data collected in situ or consistent information with respect to diffuse sources of water pollution in portuguese agricultural systems we used a value of a 10 for nitrogen fertilizers hoekstra et al 2011 franke et al 2013 in the literature we can find different values of c max and c nat leading to disparities in the wf grey assessments that could prevent this indicator to provide a consistent value for water quality and being a tool for sound policy supporting in the water sector mekonnen and hoekstra 2015 liu et al 2017 we followed the recommendation to use local information whenever available hoekstra et al 2011 and for the ambient water quality standard c max we used 50 mg n no3 l 1 the maximum allowable value concerning the protection of waters against pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources according to european eec 1991 and portuguese legislation decree law 236 98 on water quality assessment 1998 in the case of c nat for n many previous studies assumed the value 0 due to lack of data but this assumption leads to an underestimation of wf grey liu et al 2017 which we prevented by using the value 0 1 mg n no3 l 1 from franke et al 2013 2 4 statistical analyses for the statistical analyses of data statistica 7 statsoft inc two way analyses of variance anova were performed for the effects of irrigation and nitrogen strategies the anova were conducted separately for each growing season differences between means were compared using tukey s test p 0 05 factor analyses fa for each season were conducted to explore the data structure to describe how the original p variables depend on a small number k of latent variables or factors k p thus reducing correlated observed variables into a small number of independent variables härdle and simar 2015 the aim was to examine for each season latent unobserved common characteristics of the studied variables related with wheat grain yield technological quality and or water use the factors were extracted using the principal components analysis pca method and the matrix of factor loadings was submitted to varimax rotation to yield a factor structure simpler to interpret jagadamma et al 2008 factors were retained when presenting eigenvalues 1 a contribution for the proportion of variance 10 and at least two observed variables contribution with absolute factor loadings 0 40 variables with large in absolute value factor loadings are more likely to represent a common factor although there are no established or clear rules that help decide what is a large factor loading mallarino et al 1999 jagadamma et al 2008 variables were considered highly correlated whenever factor loadings were 0 50 and moderately correlated when loadings were 0 40 lee et al 2005 jagadamma et al 2008 if the variables are properly selected by studying the result of a factor analysis it is possible to make a fairly justified choice of the independent variables which can be included in a subsequent regression analysis ferrari et al 1957 for each season ndvi measurements and water footprints values were selected to perform stepwise multiple linear regressions mlr in order to examine the relationship between the ndvi measurements as independent variables and green blue or grey water footprint indicators as response dependent variables for these analyses the standard selection procedure to identify a single subset of independent variables was used by adding or deleting a variable at each step according to a given criterion stated on terms of the f statistic in this case f to enter 1 and f to remove 0 neter et al 1983 in a mlr model multiple r2 measures the proportionate reduction of total variation in the response variable associated with the use of the set of selected independent variables higher r2 values mean a good model fit for the data since r2 often can be made high by including a large number of independent variables a modified measure is also used the adjusted r2 which recognizes the number of independent variables in the model neter et al 1983 β are the standardized regression coefficients of the independent variables used to facilitate comparisons when different units are involved neter et al 1983 monaco and sali 2018 3 results and discussion 3 1 phenology and biomass monitoring the temporal variation of the maximum and minimum temperatures as well as the total amount of rainfall over the wheat growth cycles under study was quite different fig 1 promoting different water requirements table 2 in 2017 2018 the distribution of precipitation particularly in the spring months march to may was more favorable as it coincided with some of the critical stages of wheat regarding water requirements like booting and flowering the contrasting meteorological variables in the two years influenced the crop phenological cycle fig 2 higher temperatures in february 2019 promoted an anticipation of tillering and booting fig 2b overall the 2018 2019 crop cycle was approximately one month shorter than in 2017 2018 but reduction was higher from sowing to anthesis 17 days than in the remaining growing season 12 days from anthesis to harvest thus the increase in evaporative demand of the atmosphere due to higher temperatures was counterbalanced by the reductions in the length of the phenological cycle the ndvi an indicator of chlorophyll concentration and canopy leaf area was used for the dynamic monitoring of the biomass change during the two growth seasons duan et al 2017 fig 3 in 2017 2018 no significative differences were found in ndvi values measured in the three water regimes at any stage of the growing cycle fig 3a table s1 the highest values were measured at the booting stage varying from 0 823 in r1 to 0 853 in r0 and the lowest were registered at maturation averaging 0 141 in the case of n fertilization ndvi values measured at booting were significatively higher in the n3 and n5 treatments 0 846 denoting a positive effect in the biomass of plants when stabilized or controlled release fertilizers are applied table s1 at the maturation phase ndvi was higher in the n4 treatment 0 147 indicating higher chlorophyll content thus some delay in maturation probably due to the late application of n at the booting stage in 2018 2019 ndvi values differed significantly for different water regimes in every stage except tillering ndvitill with the highest values measured at booting ndviboot and heading ndvihead in the full irrigation treatments 0 701 and 0 728 respectively and in the supplemental irrigation treatments 0 638 and 0 662 respectively fig 3b table s1 these results were in general below reference values in the literature where ndviboot in irrigated wheat ranged from 0 80 to 0 88 aparicio et al 2000 clay et al 2012 and ndvihead reached 0 91 duan et al 2017 the differences regarding values in the literature are even more pronounced in the advanced stages of the cycle since even in irrigated plants the ndvimat values measured 0 337 and 0 342 in r1 and r2 respectively were considerably lower than those reported by aparicio et al 2000 0 50 or naser et al 2020 0 58 these values indicate the effect of the high temperatures experienced during the final growing stages which induced a more rapid plant senescence nitrogen fertilizers type splitting and timing influenced ndvi values except at the anthesis phase table s1 the highest values were registered in the treatments with eefs totally applied at sowing n3 n5 and n7 at the booting stage 0 689 0 678 and 0 688 respectively and at the heading stage 0 706 0 689 and 0 701 respectively pointing to a positive influence of n gradual bio availability in the development of wheat biomass 3 2 grain yield and water use the results of grain yield and its components reflected the effect of temperatures and the quantity and distribution of rainfall recorded in each year especially during april and early may table 3 higher temperatures and lack of precipitation caused an increase in 2018 2019 irrigation requirements of approximately 1 7 times compared to the previous year in 2017 2018 with more abundant and better distributed rainfall in periods of higher crop demand there was a statistically significant effect of water regime both in the number of grains per m2 ng and 1000 grains weight 1000 gw showing an inverse compensation effect between these yield components that lead to no statistical differences in grain yield y 7286 kg ha 1 in r1 6932 kg ha 1 in r2 and 7083 kg ha 1 in r0 the occurrence of precipitation during the stages of heading and initial grain filling attenuated the differences between water regimes an effect which is even more pronounced when soils present a high water storage capacity as is the case of vertisols in 2018 2019 a shorter cycle and a shorter time for biomass accumulation resulted in lower yields in general the average yield obtained in 2018 2019 was about 38 lower than the previous year although no significant differences were observed in 1000 gw between water regimes there was a significantly higher ng in the irrigated treatments 13 338 per m2 in r1 and 12 695 per m2 in r2 when compared to the rainfed 6480 per m2 also the effect of irrigation on productivity had statistical significance with the r1 treatment presenting the highest yield values 5570 kg ha 1 followed by the r2 4956 kg ha 1 and r0 2629 kg ha 1 in a study on the interactive effects of water and nitrogen on the productive responses of durum wheat triticum durum desf grown in a mediterranean environment albrizio et al 2010 found similar results with the crop response being mostly influenced by nitrogen fertilization as a consequence of the occurrence of abundant rainfall during the experiment period in 2017 2018 the n1 and n2 fertilization treatments distinguished by different fractioning with a conventional n fertilizer showed the highest ng 16 158 per m2 and 16 145 per m2 respectively n1 and n2 were also the nitrogen fertilizer treatments with the highest y respectively 7378 kg ha 1 and 7337 kg ha 1 wpc 1 62 kg m 3 in n1 and 1 60 kg m 3 in n2 and wpi 5 28 kg m 3 in n1 and 5 35 kg m 3 in n2 this set of results indicates that gradual n release fertilizers had no distinctive effect on wheat productivity as found by maharjan et al 2014 or blandino et al 2015 probably because of n availability until advanced stages the n4 treatment showed the highest 1000 gw in both years 46 69 g and 42 61 g in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively in 2018 2019 the n7 treatment had the highest ng 12 065 grains per m2 y 4899 kg ha 1 and wpi 2 50 kg m 3 rainfed wheat used soil stored water more efficiently wpc of 1 77 kg m 3 in 2017 2018 and 1 86 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 furthermore the wpc of the two irrigated treatments did not differ statistically in any of the agricultural years 1 4 1 5 kg m 3 in 2017 2018 1 3 1 4 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 indicating that the supplemental irrigation strategy r2 adjusted so that the water supplies coincide with the crop critical stages although leading to lower grain yields guarantees an efficiency in the use of water similar to full irrigation r1 the agronomic practice of supplemental irrigation applied at the crop most sensitive periods to drought and heat stress is already commonly adopted in the mediterranean area and in many world regions on low value crops aiming to minimize yield variation and maintain production to an economically acceptable level daccache et al 2014 overall average wpc were in any water regime for both seasons higher than some of the reported in reference literature namely 0 47 kg m 3 chapagain and hoekstra 2004 0 39 kg m 3 liu et al 2007 or 0 64 kg m 3 to 1 82 kg m 3 zwart et al 2010 obtained for wheat yields in turkey and france respectively in fact the average values observed in r0 approached the potential value estimated by liu et al 2007 for portugal 1 85 kg m 3 corresponding to a potential yield of approximately 9000 kg ha 1 when analyzing the average values of wpi the results show that in 2017 2018 with reduced irrigation requirements due to a very beneficial distribution of rainfall during spring and the subsequent attainment of high yields wheat presented a high wpi of 5 10 kg m 3 in 2018 2019 the average values of wpi decreased to 2 18 kg m 3 the differences between r1 and r2 had no statistical significance in both years of the experiment a confirmation that irrigation applied at the beginning of stem extension booting anthesis and grain filling is used equally efficiently by the crop while using smaller volumes of irrigation water these results were in accordance to previous findings of this research team in a study during a very dry year in which the same wheat cultivar showed higher efficiency in the use of irrigation water under a supplemental irrigation management strategy oliveira et al 2019 no interaction water regime x n splitting timing occurred in grain yield yield components and water productivity 3 3 grain technological quality the effect of irrigation and n fertilization type splitting timing on grain quality traits differed in the two years of the experiment which indicates that as reported by lópez bellido et al 2001 the variability of the mediterranean climate also leads to irregular wheat quality table 4 in general there was no significant effect of the studied factors on hectoliter weight hw which seems to indicate that this grain quality trait is mainly linked to genetic factors borghi et al 1997 only in the year 2018 2019 the significantly higher value obtained in r0 stood out 82 4 kg hl 1 which may be related with the lower number of grains obtained in this water regime the grain protein content gpc is mainly influenced by the environmental conditions of each location and each year and by the dose and fractionation of n fertilization blandino et al 2015 and the results showed that this was the factor that most influenced gpc the treatments that led to higher levels of gpc were those corresponding to the application of eefs in which 50 of the total nitrogen was applied at the booting stage n4 n6 and n8 which evidences that late nitrogen applications benefit this grain quality parameter the higher average gpc in 2018 2019 in the n treatments 14 4 was related to lower grain yield r1 treatment showed a higher significant gpc of 14 8 while the lower value occurred in r2 12 4 in 2017 2018 there was no significant effect of the water regime the absence of this effect was certainly linked to the spring rainfall which attenuated the differences obtained under different water regimes the flour rheological properties strength w and tenacity extensibility ratio p l were also mainly influenced by nitrogen fertilization this factor clearly influenced the dough balance in 2017 2018 as p l values were lower and closer to the values required by the milling industry for a balanced wheat namely in the range 0 50 1 00 bordes et al 2008 when 50 of the total nitrogen was applied at the booting stage 0 87 in n4 0 97 in n6 and 0 97 in n8 it is also worth noting that the p l values were in general and especially in 2018 2019 high corresponding to very strong and moderately extensible dough which is likely related to the characteristics of the grain in this cultivar in 2017 2018 values of w above 300 10 4 j characteristic of good quality wheat bordes et al 2008 were obtained in the treatments with n fractioning and late application in 2018 2019 w values were higher than 350 10 4 j characteristic of strong improving wheats bordes et al 2008 valued by the milling industry occurred in the same n treatments these results indicate the advantage of this strategy to promote the technological quality of the grain the w values were in direct relation with gpc which is in accordance with the results by lópez bellido et al 2001 that found a significant correlation between variations in w and gpc when analyzing the bread making quality of hard red spring wheat under rainfed mediterranean conditions 3 4 water footprints the average total water footprints wf estimated for the two wheat seasons showed no relevant differences 694 3 m3 t 1 in 2017 2018 and 717 6 m3 t 1 in 2018 2019 but the partition of the three components of water footprint in irrigated wheat varied due to the increase in the relative importance of blue water consumption in the second year of the experiment fig 4 the total wf obtained for both seasons were approximately 2 5 times smaller than the crop benchmark reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 1827 m3 t 1 which includes wheat crops of humid climates as a result of the amount and beneficial distribution of rainfall in 2017 2018 there were no significant statistical differences between the values of wfgreen of the three irrigation regimes although the r2 value was approximately 25 m3 t 1 higher than the r1 value table s2 in 2018 2019 when a differentiation between water regimes took place the wfgreen value was significantly higher in the rainfed treatment 470 3 m3 t 1 overall the magnitude of the wfgreen indicator decreases with the increase in the amount of irrigation applied and its value is influenced by climatic conditions in 2018 2019 wfgreen in the r1 treatment was 212 8 m3 t 1 while the reference value for wheat reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 in their global assessment of the water footprint for the period 1996 2005 is 1277 m3 t 1 therefore there should be caution when comparing this indicator across areas with different climates pardo et al 2020 wfblue values in 2017 2018 198 4 m3 t 1 in r1 and 196 0 m3 t 1 in r2 respectively are of the order of magnitude of the reference value 140 m3 t 1 of southern europe obtained by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and are lower than the season wfgreen values contrary in the next year blue water was the primary water source for wheat growth fig 4b with wfblue reaching 478 8 m3 t 1 in the r2 treatment a value that is 40 higher than the benchmarks of the crop 324 m3 t 1 or of the region southern europe mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 the ratio wfblue wfgreen was of approximately 0 40 and 2 00 in 2017 2018 and 2018 2019 respectively showing that blue water use is of higher relevance in semi arid environments in general and particularly in dry years in regions with mediterranean climate where the achievement of sustainable crop yields is dependent on irrigation within the same region wfblue of a given crop may vary widely according to irrigation conditions from no irrigation to full irrigation and from highly efficient to non efficient systems recent studies have highlighted that in determining the blue component of the water footprint it is also necessary to account for the extra consumption of water that is often applied to compensate non uniform irrigation distribution percolation and runoff losses due to low efficiency of the irrigation systems or salts leaching fractions ababaei and etedali 2014 castellanos et al 2016 al muaini et al 2019 another important consideration is that blue water footprint is directly related to the carbon footprint whenever pressurized irrigation systems are used and therefore this indicator implies an impact of irrigated agriculture on global warming pardo et al 2020 no significant differences were found for wfgrey among water regimes in the first season but a significant effect was found for n fertilization with the lowest values observed in the conventional fertilizer treatments n1 and n2 these results were complementary of the results presented in section 3 2 for grain yield and water use table 3 therefore under mediterranean environment the wheat grey footprint related to nitrogen under the occurrence of advantageous rainfall amount and distribution during the growing cycle was mostly influenced by nitrogen fertilization with no benefit resulting from the use of the so called enhanced efficiency n fertilizers contrary to what could be expected in rainfed conditions where n leaching is lower thereby more likely to remain longer in the soil significant higher wfgrey was observed in the r0 treatment in 2018 2019 145 5 m3 t 1 this result primarily reflects the low yields of rainfed plants under less optimal rainfall distribution and temperatures but also the calculation of wfgrey using the same leaching fraction for rainfed and irrigated treatments nevertheless values of grey water footprint obtained for all treatments were lower than the reference value for wfgrey of wheat 207 m3 t 1 reported by mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 the assessment of wfgrey related to nitrogen is affected by disparities in the selected quality standards and the leaching runoff rate considered for its computation liu et al 2017 these limitations in wfgrey calculations must be taken into consideration when comparing results from different studies as reported by laan et al 2019 the application of water footprint accounting is mostly done at large scales but the estimation of crop and region specific water footprints for up scaling is dependent on accurate and representative in field measurements 3 5 factor analysis and multiple linear regression the relationships observed among specific clusters of variables were translated into three factor models for both seasons tables 5 and 6 in 2017 2018 the three factors explained 68 2 of total variance and presented communality values generally high for all the variables factor 1 explained 38 3 of the variance and presented high positive loadings 0 50 of y 0 94 wpi 0 91 and ndvianth 0 54 high negative loadings in factor 1 0 50 belonged to wfgreen 0 94 wfblue 0 91 and wfgrey 0 94 and moderate positive factor loadings belonged to wpc 0 46 and ndviboot 0 40 thereby factor 1 describes yield and water use including water productivity and water footprint indicators given the high weights of y wp and wf factor 2 was responsible for explaining 16 2 of the total variance and represented a latent variable of yield components since it was mainly influence by ng 0 92 and 1000 gw 0 78 lastly factor 3 accounted with 13 6 of total variance and presented high positive correlations with gpc 0 89 and w 0 86 and negative correlation with p l 0 82 therefore corresponding to a grain quality factor in 2018 2019 the data were mainly determined by three factors that captured 73 9 of the total variance overall presenting high communalities table 6 the factors presented the following structure factor 1 accounting for 43 4 of total variance was highly correlated with y 0 91 ng 0 89 wfgreen 0 90 wfgrey 0 90 hw 0 64 ndvitill 0 51 ndvistem 0 73 ndviboot 0 91 ndvihead 0 92 ndvianth 0 78 and ndvimat 0 51 therefore denoted a yield and water footprint latent variable factor 2 accounting for 17 6 of total variance was a grain quality factor with high loadings of gpc 0 87 w 0 80 p l 0 78 and ndvimat 0 61 factor 3 which explained 13 0 of total variance was positively correlated with wpc 0 65 wpi 0 94 and wfblue 0 94 representing a latent variable of irrigation water productivity although with some similarities the comparison of the factor models obtained for the two seasons points to a shift in the contribution of the yield water use variables while the latent variables obtained in 2017 2018 may somewhat be described as of classical structure drawing out the separation between yield and water use parameters yield components and wheat quality characteristics lee et al 2005 leilah and al khateeb 2005 in 2018 2019 variables most related with blue water use were clustered in one detached factor which was probably related to a determining influence of the environmental conditions that lead to the differentiation in irrigation requirements and crop responses for this season furthermore measures of biomass progress ndvi from tillering to anthesis strongly participated the yield related latent variable highlighting that under dryer conditions there is consistent correlation between ndvi measured at early growing and anthesis stages and grain yield naser et al 2020 fa was conducted to combine the homogenous variables together thereby reducing the number of variables to be considered for further investigation based on this assumption multiple linear regression analysis mlr using the standard stepwise procedure were performed to identify a set of ndvi measurements at different stages of the growing cycle that could act as predictors of wheat wf specifically ndvi variables in each season were selected to examine its prediction capability of correlated water footprints the results of the mlr for the 2017 2018 season indicated that there was no collective significant effect between the three ndvi variables ndviboot ndvianth and ndvimat and water footprint green wfgreen or grey wfgrey table 7 ndvianth significantly predicted wfgreen β 0 512 p 0 000 but neither ndviboot nor ndvimat were significant predictors these variables explained 35 8 of the variance r2 0 358 f 2 93 17 110 p 0 000 ndviboot significantly predicted wfblue β 0 484 p 0 000 as well as ndvianth β 0 231 p 0 043 and ndvimat β 0 214 p 0 049 explaining 39 0 of the variance r2 0 390 f 2 61 12 795 p 0 000 ndviboot and ndvimat were not predictors of wfgrey while ndvianth significantly predicted this indicator β 0 512 p 0 000 explaining 35 8 of the variance r2 0 358 f 2 93 17 110 p 0 000 since no collective significant effect was found between the ndvi records and green and grey water footprints values in the first season these relationships may be fairly explained using simple regressions in the case of the 2018 2019 data the results of mlr were as follow table 8 a collective significant effect was found between ndvi measurements and wfgreen f 5 90 56 839 p 0 000 r2 0 793 with significant predictors in ndviboot β 0 516 p 0 008 ndvianth β 0 258 p 0 004 and ndvimat β 0 304 p 0 000 ndvitill ndvianth and ndvimat respectively β 0 427 and p 0 002 β 0 581 and p 0 003 β 0 340 and p 0 024 significantly predicted wfblue explaining 38 2 of the variance r2 0 382 f 5 58 5 879 p 0 000 ndviboot β 0 526 p 0 008 ndvianth β 0 258 p 0 004 and ndvimat β 0 304 p 0 000 measurements significantly predicted wfgrey f 5 90 56 839 p 0 000 r2 0 793 the mlr models were in accordance with the factor models for the two years of the study whose results grouped in general water footprint indicators and ndvi measurements in the same latent factors equal β and multiple r2 values found for the mlr of green and grey water footprints reflect a strong correlation between the ndvi values at different stages especially in 2018 2019 4 conclusions contrasting weather patterns typical of the mediterranean climate lead to distinct wheat productive responses the results of our study indicate that the occurrence of precipitation during the stages of heading and initial grain filling attenuated the differences between water regimes and the crop response was mostly influenced by nitrogen fertilization smaller amount of precipitation combined with higher average maximum temperatures during the wheat growth is cause for shorter time for biomass accumulation and therefore lower yields the supplemental irrigation strategy adjusted so that the water supplies coincided with the critical stages of the crop although leading to lower grain yields guaranteed crop water productivity and irrigation water productivity similar to full irrigation different effects of water regimes observed for the two years under study show that the influence of the mediterranean climate irregularity is determinant not only for yield variability but also for grain quality the application of enhanced efficient n fertilizers in which 50 of the total nitrogen was applied at the booting stage had a positive significant effect on grain protein content and in the values of the alveograph indicating that late nitrogen applications benefit the technological quality of wheat the average total water footprints estimated for the two seasons showed no relevant differences but the partition of the green blue and grey components in irrigated wheat varied with an increase in the blue water consumptive use in the second year of the experiment due to higher irrigation requirements in fact the ratio wfblue wfgreen was 5 times higher in the drier season which clearly shows that blue water use is most relevant in semi arid environments in general and in dry years in regions with mediterranean climate where the achievement of sustainable crop yields is dependent on irrigation the wheat wfgrey related to nitrogen under the occurrence of advantageous rainfall amount and distribution during wheat growing was mostly influenced by n fertilization furthermore no benefit resulted from the use of nitrogen eefs although it should be taken into account that the same leaching rate was used for the various types of nitrogen fertilizers the multivariate statistical analysis performed with factor analysis resulted in a combination of homogenous variables in three factor models obtained for each season the latent variables found in 2017 2018 were related to yield and water use relations yield components and wheat quality parameters in 2018 2019 indicators of blue water use were clustered in one detached factor probably expressing the determining influence of the environmental conditions that lead to the differentiation in irrigation requirements for this season the stepwise multivariate linear regression analysis allowed for the establishment of significant relationships between biomass development measured with ndvi proximal sensors at the stages of tillering booting anthesis and maturation and water footprints indicators of green and blue consumptive water as well as grey water that is necessary to assimilate the nitrogen load from mineral fertilization the results of the study pointed to a good prediction capability of wfblue using multiple linear regressions with ndvi registered at booting anthesis maturation and or tillering and of wfgreen and wfgrey using multiple linear relations with the ndvi registered at booting anthesis and maturation funding this research was supported by the project

9883,the eu nitrates directive calls for urgent integration of process oriented indicators of nitrate fate with map overlay approaches for assessing nitrate vulnerable zones nvzs in the region of campania southern italy groundwater contamination represents a serious concern because of the presence of intensive agricultural practices and livestock farming a protocol was proposed to assess the probability distribution of the following three indicators of nitrate transport across the vadose zone i annual cumulative nitrate flux entering the shallow aquifer ii annual cumulative root nitrate uptake and iii nitrate transit time across the vadose zone this method involves numerical simulations of soil water flow and solute transport using hydrus 1d for a representative 10 m thick soil profile beneath an irrigated maize plot located in a study area within the sele plain campania two scenarios are built by running a set of one hundred 20 yr long simulations at a daily time resolution i 195 kg n ha 1 of nitrate fertilizer urea is applied annually to estimate the probability distributions of annual cumulative nitrate leaching and root nitrate uptake scenario 1 ii 195 kg n ha 1 of nitrate fertilizer urea is applied once to estimate the nitrate transit time distribution across the soil profile scenario 2 in each scenario the simulations consider two agricultural practices with either one or three annual nitrate fertilizer applications subject to randomly generated climate forcing using a monte carlo approach variations in soil and rainfall properties are described by the miller miller geometric similitude and the poisson parameterization respectively in scenario 1 roots absorb on average 80 3 kg n ha 1 every year corresponding to 40 of applied nitrate and the median annual cumulative nitrate flux across the soil profile bottom is 74 9 kg n ha 1 representing about 38 of applied nitrate when urea is applied in a single treatment in contrast when fertilizer is applied in three treatments 112 4 kg n ha 1 corresponding to almost 60 of applied nitrate of nitrate is removed by root water uptake and the median annual cumulative nitrate leaching is 52 4 kg n ha 1 corresponding to about 27 of applied nitrate in scenario 2 mean transit time values are 2741 days 2707 days and 2650 days when urea is applied on april 1st june 1st and august 1st respectively our model simulations provide useful indicators of nitrate transport and can be integrated with map overlay procedures for delineating nitrate vulnerable zones keywords groundwater nitrate leaching root uptake transit time distribution ttd hydrus 1d hypres database campania 1 introduction the agri food system is one of the main socio economic sectors in campania a region of southern italy where the most productive areas extend over the internal and coastal alluvial plains with rather intensive agricultural practices campania is also a renowned region worldwide for the breeding of buffaloes to produce mozzarella cheese and other excellent dairy products extensive fertilizers and animal manure applications boost crop production at the cost of polluting the environment infascelli et al 2009 the rapid deterioration of groundwater quality observed throughout the world over the last decades represents a serious concern particularly in campania where great attention is devoted to the transport toward shallow aquifers of potentially toxic elements ptes that are detrimental to human health for this reason european union eu policies aim at protecting shallow aquifers by promoting sustainable land management whose efficiency is entrusted to a reliable mapping of groundwater vulnerability mylevaganam and ray 2016 wall et al 2020 vulnerability can be conceptualized in different ways but in this study we follow the definitions given by national research council 1993 that groundwater vulnerability is viewed as the ease with which a pte applied on or near the land surface can migrate to the aquifer under a given set of agricultural agronomic practices contaminant characteristics and hydrogeological sensitivity conditions in most cases and especially with the help of geographic information system gis tools widespread approaches are based on mapping topographic hydrogeological pedological land use features controlling the propagation of ptes through the unsaturated and saturated zones scores and weights are assigned to the various environmental factors to obtain classes of groundwater vulnerability to contamination from a certain source following a map overlay procedure doerﬂiger et al 1999 rupert 2001 mclay et al 2001 antonakos and lambrakis 2007 the parameter weighting and rating approaches also known as point count system models e g drastic sintacs can be easily employed in large scale applications but express groundwater vulnerability in a rather empirical way and show the effect of a certain degree of subjectivity van stempvoort et al 1993 mclay et al 2001 panagopoulos et al 2006 huan et al 2012 in contrast the use of a process oriented model simulating water flow and solute transport in the porous media enables effective indicators sometimes also referred to as functional performance indicators of pte transport to be identified this represents a step forward and a more objective and efficient method to assess groundwater vulnerability especially for shallow aquifers however the prediction performance of these types of models is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of information on input data and system properties it seems still rather unfeasible to assess the groundwater vulnerability over relatively large spatial scales by using three dimensional 3d process oriented hydrological models however a viable way to provide details about solute transport is to implement one dimensional 1d models in spatially representative soil profiles of the area of interest the nitrates directive 91 676 eec reiterated by the new 2006 118 ec promoted by the european council aims at preventing and reversing groundwater degradation induced by nitrates due to agricultural practices this directive requires the member states to identify nitrate vulnerable zones nvzs allowing among other things for a threshold nitrate concentration value of 50 mg l 1 in the water bodies there is a vigorous debate in campania because of the update of the nvzs delimitation resulting from the regional council resolution n 762 2017 and the new regional action plan for nitrates vulnerable areas from agricultural sources busico et al 2019 a one off action plan of 100 million euros is about to start reducing the livestock load to vulnerable areas that since march 2020 have to be subjected to a spreading limit of 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year recent studies have reported that over the four year period of 2012 2015 nitrate concentrations in groundwater reached values higher than the drinking water threshold 50 mg l 1 in italy with an increasing trend in comparison to the previous four year period 2008 2011 ducci et al 2019 as also pointed out by gómez hernández and wen 1994 the main indicators controlling the vulnerability of shallow groundwater are obtained in the present study by simulating the nitrate fate across a 10 m thick layered soil profile using hydrus 1d mattern and vanclooster 2010 šimůnek et al 2016 sprenger et al 2016b mokari et al 2019 the goal is to build plausible scenario based model simulations to investigate the fate of nitrate within a stochastic framework under random generated mediterranean climate forcing conditions our investigations refer to the sele river alluvial plain in campania a renowned agri food district for agricultural produce and buffalo dairy products the probability distributions of three fundamental indicators are assessed to characterize the nitrate transport i annual nitrate leaching ii annual root nitrate uptake iii vadose zone nitrate transit time one hundred 20 yr long simulations were run for each scenario using hydrus 1d 1 scenario 1 assumes 195 kg n ha 1 of nitrate fertilizer urea applied annually to estimate the probability distributions of annual cumulative nitrate leaching and root nitrate uptake 2 scenario 2 instead assumes 195 kg n ha 1 of nitrate fertilizer urea applied only once to estimate the nitrate transit time distribution across the soil profile 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and available data set the sele alluvial plain covers an area of about 500 km2 that spans around the sele river near the city of

fennel lettuce sweet pepper tomatoes rocket salad broccoli cauliflower green beans eggplants cabbage and several others forages cover about 7481 ha and maize is the predominant forage subject to irrigation and fertilization practices considering the excessive fragmentation of vegetables we assumed the maize as the predominant land cover in the study s area and for this reason we consider maize in model simulations the hydrogeology of the sele plain belongs to the pliocene quaternary hydrogeological complex with porous aquifers formed by epiclastic deposits of alluvial and coastal

series considering an alternation of two 6 month lasting seasons see fig s4 in supplementary material a wet season includes the months of october november december january february and march when the sum of monthly average r is higher than the sum of monthly average et p while the remaining months define the dry season i e from april to september in each of these two seasons rainfall is modeled by a stochastic poisson point process with daily rainfall depth μ cm and occurrence λ d 1 a total of one hundred synthetic rainfall time series of 7304 daily values corresponding to 20 years were generated keeping constant parameters of the poisson process and daily rainfall parent distribution in each season in each modeling scenario the synthetic time series was then used as input for the hydrus 1d to evaluate the effects of rainfall seasonality on the water balance components the poisson parameters calculated from the daily rainfall values 1999 2018 measured at the battipaglia weather station are μ 0 88 cm and λ 0 39 d 1 for the wet season and μ 0 67 cm and λ 0 21 d 1 for the dry season table 3 reports basic statistics of et p components available from 1999 to 2018 at the battipaglia weather station a total of one hundred synthetic e p and t p time series of 7304 daily values corresponding to 20 years were then generated using random numbers drawn from a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation in each month of the year reported in table 3 a similar media scaling method was used in this study to characterize the soil hydraulic behavior of the study area this scaling approach is conceptualized by replacing the heterogeneous porous domain with a homogeneous soil domain when assuming the validity of the miller miller geometric similarity hypothesis miller and miller 1956 clausnitzer et al 1992 in other words the sparse point scale soil hydraulic functions over the heterogeneous spatial domain coalesce into a single reference soil hydraulic function a reference water retention function wrfref and a reference hydraulic conductivity function hcfref referring to a homogeneous spatially representative soil domain through a set of scaling factors nasta et al 2013 a representative soil profile was set with two functional soil layers a topsoil layer from the soil surface to the depth of 100 cm overlying a subsoil layer between soil depths of 100 cm and 1000 cm according to measurement depths described beforehand the five unknown soil hydraulic parameters α n θ r θ s and k s describing the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions for each of the two soil layers have been estimated in the study area by combining the hypres pedotransfer function ptf wösten et al 1999 with the miller miller geometric similarity theory clausnitzer et al 1992 gridded values 2 km grid size of sand silt and clay oven dry soil bulk density and soil organic carbon have been used as input of the hypres ptf to retrieve the soil hydraulic properties of both topsoil and subsoil layers whereas parameter θ r was set at zero more details are presented in supplemental materials fig s5 and table 4 reports the soil hydraulic parameters attributed to topsoil and subsoil in the representative soil profile initial conditions in the soil profile were set as the soil water content values at field capacity which is a reasonable condition on january 1st in the wet season some farmers were interviewed to investigate their irrigation management and the factors influencing the irrigation schedule the irrigation water volume and the duration of each irrigation event the irrigation schedule is based on farmers experience in detecting soil dryness it is impossible to quantify the exact amount of irrigation water and many farmers stop irrigation when infiltration decreases or water ponds are noticed the irrigation events start at the soil pressure head corresponding to field capacity and end at the soil pressure head at the maize initial root water stress romano and santini 2002 therefore to mimic farmers behavior as close as possible irrigation was triggered with zero lag time when the pressure head at the soil depth of 0 60 m the depth of a tensiometer and a corresponding control node in hydrus 1d reaches ψ at field capacity ψ fc bonfante et al 2019 given by the following physically based analytical equation proposed by assouline and or 2014 10 ψ fc 1 α n 1 n 1 2 n n to calculate the effective soil hydraulic parameters in the representative soil profile the parametric aggregation approach presented in nasta and romano 2016 was employed by obtaining ψ fc 207 cm the irrigation rate was set to 1 0 cm d 1 and the irrigation duration to 1 day urea and nitrate are assumed to be present only in the dissolved phase the distribution coefficient k d 0 cm3 g 1 ammonium was assumed to adsorb to the solid phase by setting k d 3 5 cm3 g 1 hanson et al 2006 the first order decay coefficients μ w for urea hydrolysis and ammonium nitrification were set to 0 38 d 1 and 0 2 d 1 respectively li et al 2015 recommended that the molecular diffusion coefficients in free water d w for nh4 and no3 were 1 52 and 1 64 cm2 d 1 respectively we assumed d w 1 52 cm2 d 1 also for urea the longitudinal dispersivity was assumed to be 10 cm 1 10th of the surface layer the tortuosity factor in the liquid phase τ w is calculated using the relationship proposed by millington and quirk 1961 unlimited passive uptake of both nh4 and no3 was allowed in the root solute uptake model šimůnek and hopmans 2009 by specifying the maximum allowed uptake concentration exceeding no3 concentrations recorded in the root zone fertilization is given in the form of urea solute 1 and a total annual amount of 195 kg n ha 1 y 1 is applied on the soil surface bonfante et al 2019 in two different agricultural practices 1 in a single treatment on april 1st agricultural practice 1 2 in a sequence of three treatments 65 kg n ha 1 on april 1st june 1st and august 1st agricultural practice 2 fertilization in hydrus 1d depends on the time dependent water flux precipitation and concentration called ctop at the soil surface boundary we imposed r net 1 0 cm e p to ensure solute entering the soil profile for example the amount of 195 kg n ha 1 corresponds to a solute mass per unit area of s 0 00195 g cm 2 therefore by specifying the water depth l r net 1 0 cm the nitrate concentration in water is ctop s l 0 00195 g cm 3 1950 mg l 1 2 4 scenario 1 assessment of root nitrate uptake and nitrate leaching in scenario 1 realistic agricultural management is mimicked when the total annual amount 195 kg n ha 1 of urea nh2 2co is applied every year for 20 years starting from the first year one set of one hundred model simulations was considered when the total amount of urea is applied with a single annual treatment agricultural practice 1 on april 1st and another set of one hundred model simulations was considered when the total amount of urea is applied in three treatments agricultural practice 2 on april 1st june 1st and august 1st fig 2 daily r e p and t p data were stochastically generated over 20 years to ensure the impact of the mediterranean seasonal climate regime on the water balance this exercise obtains probability distributions of annual cumulative nitrate flux at the soil profile bottom and root nitrate uptake a matlab script was used to automatically change daily r e p and t p values in the input text file atmosph in and extract results on nitrate from the output text files solute3 out and obs node out 2 5 scenario 2 assessment of nitrate transit time in scenario 2 the transit time is defined as the time required for a solute in this case urea solute 1 applied on a single day of a single specific year at the soil surface to transform into nitrate solute 3 and migrate to the soil profile bottom by entering the shallow aquifer fig 3 the transit time corresponds to the difference between the peak of the nitrate breakthrough curve btc at the soil profile bottom and fertilizer application date in the case of a single treatment agricultural practice 1 one fertilizer application is set with 1 95 mg cm 3 of urea nh2 2co corresponding to 195 kg n ha 1 applied at the soil surface on april 1st only in the third year in the case of three treatment applications agricultural practice 2 instead three individual sets of model simulations in the third year were organized the third year instead of the first year was selected to minimize the impact of unknown initial conditions the first two years of simulation thus represent a warm up period as mentioned above daily r e p and t p data were stochastically generated over 20 years this exercise was repeated one hundred times to obtain a transit time distribution ttd as above a matlab script was used to provide model inputs and extract model results automatically 3 results 3 1 results for scenario 1 assessment of root nitrate uptake and nitrate leaching a monte carlo analysis is performed with randomly generated boundary fluxes to determine the probability distributions of annual cumulative root nitrate uptake and nitrate leaching when fertilizer is applied every year recall that new synthetic time series of daily precipitation and crop specific potential evapotranspiration data were stochastically generated by considering the typical climate seasonality under mediterranean conditions one hundred simulated time series of daily root nitrate uptake and nitrate leaching under agricultural practice 1 and agricultural practice 2 are illustrated in fig 4 in general root nitrate uptake depends on the timing and amount of fertilization time variant maize characteristics and water balance which is influenced by precipitation crop specific potential evapotranspiration and irrigation crop specific potential evapotranspiration depends on the time variant crop coefficient that is maximum k c 1 05 for a short period from july 16th doy 197 to august 2nd doy 214 during tassel silking and blister kernel phases fig s2 july s highest crop coefficient value induces maximum crop specific potential evapotranspiration equal to 0 532 cm d 1 table 3 during the dry season soil water deficit causes a reduction of potential transpiration into actual transpiration irrigation mitigates soil water deficit during the dry season and helps reduce root water stress by increasing actual transpiration fluxes and consequently root nitrate uptake indeed while annual mean potential transpiration is 40 4 cm table 2 annual mean actual transpiration simulated in hydrus 1d is 32 5 cm about a 20 reduction of tp into ta annual cumulative irrigation simulated in hydrus 1d is between 36 9 cm corresponding to 3685 m3 per hectare and 40 7 cm corresponding to 4065 m3 per hectare with an average amount of 38 2 cm corresponding to 3819 m3 per hectare while this amount seems plausible some farmers might irrigate using even 50 more water http www agricoltura regione campania it irrigazione prci risultati html bonfante et al 2019 estimated total irrigation amounts on average between 2819 m3 ha 1 and 4699 m3 ha 1 under mediterranean semiarid climate conditions in northeast spain farmers apply on average 81 8 86 2 cm of irrigation water for maize considering annual mean precipitation of 34 7 44 3 cm and grass reference evapotranspiration of 123 0 133 1 cm malik et al 2019 nonetheless in this study the difference in root nitrate uptake between the two agricultural practices is caused solely by the timing and amount of fertilization since the water balance is the same under both agricultural practices in agricultural practice 1 195 kg n ha 1 applied on april 1st the applied nitrate easily bypasses the root zone because roots start growing on may 9th doy 129 fig s2 in contrast in agricultural practice 2 namely the 3 steps application nitrate derived from fertilizer applications on june 1st and august 1st is mostly taken up by roots root nitrate uptake increases linearly as a function of time eq s3 with a concurrent increase in potential evapotranspiration fig s3 moreover the lai reaches its maximum value lai 5 5 between july 16th doy 197 and august 2nd doy 214 fig s2 maximizing potential root water uptake and minimizing potential evaporation from the soil surface fig 5a actual transpiration reaches its maximum value at the beginning of the mature growth phase with favorable climate conditions from middle august fig 5a this interpretation highlights the importance of adequately describing various stages of the maize growing season which are well documented nasta and gates 2013 bonfante et al 2019 fig 5b shows median daily root nitrate uptake values under agricultural practice 1 red line and agricultural practice 2 blue line during the year with distinct maize growth phases the total nitrate removed by roots during crop planting emergence cpe tassel silking and blister kernel phases bk is 0 589 mg cm 2 58 9 kg n ha 1 and 0 648 mg cm 2 64 8 kg n ha 1 under agricultural practice 1 and agricultural practice 2 respectively in contrast the main difference in root nitrate uptake is observed during the mature growth phase mg with 0 213 mg cm 2 21 3 kg n ha 1 removed under agricultural practice 1 and 0 476 mg cm 2 47 6 kg n ha 1 removed under agricultural practice 2 in the latter case the third treatment applied on august 1st third black asterisk on doy 213 in fig 5 boosts root nitrate uptake blue line in fig 5b during the mature growth phase the impact of harvest timing usually from middle september to middle october on root nitrate uptake is negligible under both agricultural practices fig 6 shows the frequency distribution of annual cumulative root solute uptake and nitrate leaching based on one hundred forward simulations two normality tests lilliefors and kolmogorov smirnov executed in matlab reject the null hypothesis that both annual cumulative root solute uptake and nitrate leaching under both agricultural practices come from a normal distribution at the 5 significance level therefore the median is presented instead of the mean as a representative value of each frequency distribution the zero is the most frequent value mode in annual cumulative nitrate leaching fig 6b and d because the nitrate flux across the soil profile bottom remains zero during the first two years of the numerical simulations the one treatment fertilization see red histograms in fig 6a and b results in a median value of annual cumulative root nitrate uptake of 0 803 mg cm 2 corresponding to 80 3 kg n ha 1 and annual cumulative nitrate leaching of 0 749 mg cm 2 corresponding to 74 9 kg n ha 1 in other words roots absorb 41 of applied nitrate while median annual cumulative nitrate leaching represents about 38 of applied nitrate the three treatment fertilization see yellow histograms in fig 6c and d results in a median value of annual cumulative root nitrate uptake of 1 12 mg cm 2 corresponding to 112 kg n ha 1 and annual cumulative nitrate leaching of 0 524 mg cm 2 corresponding to 52 4 kg n ha 1 almost 60 of applied nitrate is removed by root nitrate uptake while median annual cumulative nitrate leaching represents about 27 of applied nitrate considering the total amount of fertilizer applied during 20 years is 3900 kg n ha 1 the final amount of residual nitrate in the entire 10 m thick soil profile after 20 years is on average 796 kg n ha 1 20 4 of applied nitrate and 612 kg n ha 1 15 7 of applied nitrate for agricultural practice 1 and 2 respectively similarly cumulative nitrate leaching after 20 years is on average 1498 kg n ha 1 and 1048 kg n ha 1 for agricultural practices 1 and 2 respectively in the po river plain lombardy northern italy under annual rainfall conditions fairly similar to those recorded in our study area perego et al 2012 reported for maize fields at six experimental sites an annual irrigation supply ranging between 1800 m3 ha 1 and 3150 m3 ha 1 annual fertilization amounts were between 309 kg n ha 1 and 642 kg n ha 1 plant nitrogen removal between 194 kg n ha 1 57 of the fertilization amount and 305 kg n ha 1 47 and nitrate leaching below the root zone z 1 5 m measured by suction cups ranging between 14 kg n ha 1 4 and 321 kg n ha 1 50 demurtas et al 2016 reported annual mean precipitation of 56 8 cm irrigation of 4600 m3 ha 1 mean annual fertilization of 599 kg n ha 1 root nitrate uptake of 264 kg n ha 1 47 of applied nitrate nitrate leaching of 84 kg n ha 1 15 of applied nitrate and 250 kg n ha 1 residual nitrate 39 of applied nitrate under mediterranean climate conditions 3 2 results for scenario 2 assessment of nitrate transit time a monte carlo analysis was performed by generating upper boundary fluxes to determine a probabilistic distribution of nitrate transit time values ttd scenario 2 involves an ensemble of one hundred numerical simulations with hydrus 1d subjected to daily rainfall data generated by the poisson distribution parameters pertaining to the dry and wet seasons and e p and t p data with normally distributed parameters mean and standard deviation in each month once again recall that the fertilizer is applied only in the third year either with a single treatment agricultural practice 1 or with a three step treatment agricultural practice 2 fig 7 refers to agricultural practice 1 i e a single treatment of urea and depicts the ensemble of one hundred nitrate concentrations at soil depths of 300 cm 600 cm and 1000 cm fig 7a and corresponding normal distributions of transit time values fig 7b these graphs show that nitrate concentration gradually propagates downward through the vadose zone with btcs characterized by decreasing magnitude and increasing duration with depth fig 7a it is hypothesized that below the root zone z 300 cm blue lines the nitrate btc peaks depend on the combination of daily rnet and et p following the nitrate spill the btcs are affected by water infiltration induced by rainfall mainly occurring in the wet season to test this hypothesis the pearson s correlation coefficients between the cumulated rainfall and transit time values at the soil depths of 300 cm 600 cm and 1000 cm were 0 80 0 85 0 85 respectively this indicates that the ttd values depend highly on r net accelerating or slowing down nitrate transport through the unsaturated zone the standard deviation of ttds increases with soil depth 65 4 days 145 3 days and 181 4 days at the soil depths of 300 cm 600 cm and 1000 cm respectively when considering agricultural practice 2 i e three applications of urea fig 8 shows the normal probability distributions of the ensemble of one hundred nitrate concentrations at soil depths of 300 cm 600 cm and 1000 cm in general transit times decrease when treatment is individually applied on april 1st june 1st and august 1st the transit times relevant to the treatment applied in april are very similar to those presented previously and associated with a single treatment of 195 kg n ha 1 for the treatments applied on june 1st and august 1st the mean transit times are 2707 days with a standard deviation of 186 days and 2650 days with a standard deviation of 185 days respectively it is important to point out that in the present study ttds are affected only by the upper boundary forcing while other factors were kept fixed namely i the soil hydraulic parameters in the two functional soil layers influencing flow velocity across the unsaturated zone and ii the reaction and transport parameters especially the nitrate longitudinal dispersivity affecting the solute transport process 4 discussion in the present study the nitrate fate was evaluated in a representative 10 m thick soil profile by using a process oriented hydrological model supported by a relatively large number of soil data nasta et al 2020b as well as parameter values describing the nitrogen transport and transformation taken from the literature veizaga et al 2016 however because of a lack of direct local measurements on nitrate data our one dimensional numerical results should not be strictly considered for actual agronomic applications indeed our model simulations provide useful indications of nitrate transport in the area and more importantly can be integrated with map overlay procedures for delineating nitrate vulnerable zones matzeu et al 2017 catani et al 2020 vigliotti et al 2020 tufano et al 2020 the method presented in this study identifies process oriented indicators accounting for the local climatic and environmental conditions this is therefore more effective and understandable to landowners and stakeholders to our knowledge this study provides a novel protocol to assess ttds characterizing nitrate transport within the soil profile to support the mapping of nvzs fusco et al 2020 if model simulations are assumed valid the nitrate transit time can be viewed as a dynamic indicator of groundwater vulnerability and an efficient way to evaluate the protective function exerted by the vadose zone matteau et al 2019 turkeltaub et al 2020 quantification of nitrate fate and transport in the vadose zone depends on several factors that may significantly affect the accuracy of the estimated nitrate transit time mattern and vanclooster 2010 water flow depends on the depth to the groundwater table soil hydraulic properties of the vadose zone and maize characteristics influencing evapotranspiration fluxes nitrogen species fate and transport depend on their transport and reaction parameters initial concentrations throughout the soil profile and the amount and frequency of fertilizer applications it is very difficult to characterize soil layering and its soil hydraulic properties throughout large scale domains in this study only information on soil physical properties within the topmost meter of the vadose zone was used to artificially build two functional soil layers over a 10 m thick soil profile hypres ptf was employed in each soil layer to retrieve five unknown soil hydraulic parameters α n θ r θ s and k s describing the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions other existing ptfs developed on european datasets could be tested as well weynants et al 2009 szabó et al 2021 nasta et al 2021 the eleven lithological core drilling soil profiles evidence relatively uniform soil physical properties in the vadose zone nevertheless the impact of soil vertical variability on the decay of saturated hydraulic conductivity induced by soil compaction in the deepest soil layers is expected turkeltaub et al 2021 the scenario based simulations are not supported by monitoring key state variables water contents pressure head data or water fluxes throughout the soil profile the cost of the instrumentation might be high and unfeasible farmers do not recommend the installation of sensors beneath the maize fields because of tillage operations some studies interestingly calibrate physical models using soft data approaches such as isotope based techniques stumpp et al 2012 sacchi et al 2013 sprenger et al 2016a boumaiza et al 2021 future improvements will integrate key measurements of nitrate absorbed by roots nitrate leaching into the shallow aquifer and nitrate concentrations measured throughout the soil profile based on stable isotope data in a subsequent study farmers collaboration will be requested to record the exact amount and frequency of fertilization fertilizer type and irrigation depths during the growing season our results produce annual root nitrate uptake comparable to previous studies in cornfields tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 in a subsequent step the available gridded soil hydraulic properties will be used in the hydrus 1d package by assuming the spatial domain represented by independent columns hydrus 1d will be coupled to modflow beegum et al 2018 2019 to describe the nitrate transport influenced by topography and depth to the water table in the 3d domain prudic et al 2004 zeng et al 2019 another future study will investigate the impact of point source pollution caused by livestock farming piccini et al 2016 the contribution of localized applications of high amounts of buffalo manure on nitrate mineralization will be assessed in this regard a refinement of available models is needed to consider the process of nitrate immobilization into the microbial biomass that commonly occurs for organic amendments with a c n ratio above 30 hodge et al 2000 bonanomi et al 2014 5 concluding remarks numerical simulations of hydrological processes and nitrate transport provide useful process oriented indicators that can be integrated with the information retrieved from gis based approaches to map nvzs and quantify potential hazards of detrimental anthropogenic environmental impacts the use of process oriented models is often prevented by the lack of key measurements and farmers information e g about irrigation and fertilization nevertheless the use of numerical models can be enhanced in the future by investing in monitoring network infrastructures effective soil hydraulic and nitrate transport parameters can be estimated using ad hoc inverse modeling procedures supported by available vadose zone data the 20 years long model simulations show that agricultural practices strongly influence root nitrate uptake and nitrate leaching in all cases nitrate transit times are about two years to bypass the root zone and about 7 8 years to reach the shallow aquifer groundwater nitrate contamination is a consequence of nitrate leaching and will be subject to future investigations the proposed approach can produce

9883,the eu nitrates directive calls for urgent integration of process oriented indicators of nitrate fate with map overlay approaches for assessing nitrate vulnerable zones nvzs in the region of campania southern italy groundwater contamination represents a serious concern because of the presence of intensive agricultural practices and livestock farming a protocol was proposed to assess the probability distribution of the following three indicators of nitrate transport across the vadose zone i annual cumulative nitrate flux entering the shallow aquifer ii annual cumulative root nitrate uptake and iii nitrate transit time across the vadose zone this method involves numerical simulations of soil water flow and solute transport using hydrus 1d for a representative 10 m thick soil profile beneath an irrigated maize plot located in a study area within the sele plain campania two scenarios are built by running a set of one hundred 20 yr long simulations at a daily time resolution i 195 kg n ha 1 of nitrate fertilizer urea is applied annually to estimate the probability distributions of annual cumulative nitrate leaching and root nitrate uptake scenario 1 ii 195 kg n ha 1 of nitrate fertilizer urea is applied once to estimate the nitrate transit time distribution across the soil profile scenario 2 in each scenario the simulations consider two agricultural practices with either one or three annual nitrate fertilizer applications subject to randomly generated climate forcing using a monte carlo approach variations in soil and rainfall properties are described by the miller miller geometric similitude and the poisson parameterization respectively in scenario 1 roots absorb on average 80 3 kg n ha 1 every year corresponding to 40 of applied nitrate and the median annual cumulative nitrate flux across the soil profile bottom is 74 9 kg n ha 1 representing about 38 of applied nitrate when urea is applied in a single treatment in contrast when fertilizer is applied in three treatments 112 4 kg n ha 1 corresponding to almost 60 of applied nitrate of nitrate is removed by root water uptake and the median annual cumulative nitrate leaching is 52 4 kg n ha 1 corresponding to about 27 of applied nitrate in scenario 2 mean transit time values are 2741 days 2707 days and 2650 days when urea is applied on april 1st june 1st and august 1st respectively our model simulations provide useful indicators of nitrate transport and can be integrated with map overlay procedures for delineating nitrate vulnerable zones keywords groundwater nitrate leaching root uptake transit time distribution ttd hydrus 1d hypres database campania 1 introduction the agri food system is one of the main socio economic sectors in campania a region of southern italy where the most productive areas extend over the internal and coastal alluvial plains with rather intensive agricultural practices campania is also a renowned region worldwide for the breeding of buffaloes to produce mozzarella cheese and other excellent dairy products extensive fertilizers and animal manure applications boost crop production at the cost of polluting the environment infascelli et al 2009 the rapid deterioration of groundwater quality observed throughout the world over the last decades represents a serious concern particularly in campania where great attention is devoted to the transport toward shallow aquifers of potentially toxic elements ptes that are detrimental to human health for this reason european union eu policies aim at protecting shallow aquifers by promoting sustainable land management whose efficiency is entrusted to a reliable mapping of groundwater vulnerability mylevaganam and ray 2016 wall et al 2020 vulnerability can be conceptualized in different ways but in this study we follow the definitions given by national research council 1993 that groundwater vulnerability is viewed as the ease with which a pte applied on or near the land surface can migrate to the aquifer under a given set of agricultural agronomic practices contaminant characteristics and hydrogeological sensitivity conditions in most cases and especially with the help of geographic information system gis tools widespread approaches are based on mapping topographic hydrogeological pedological land use features controlling the propagation of ptes through the unsaturated and saturated zones scores and weights are assigned to the various environmental factors to obtain classes of groundwater vulnerability to contamination from a certain source following a map overlay procedure doerﬂiger et al 1999 rupert 2001 mclay et al 2001 antonakos and lambrakis 2007 the parameter weighting and rating approaches also known as point count system models e g drastic sintacs can be easily employed in large scale applications but express groundwater vulnerability in a rather empirical way and show the effect of a certain degree of subjectivity van stempvoort et al 1993 mclay et al 2001 panagopoulos et al 2006 huan et al 2012 in contrast the use of a process oriented model simulating water flow and solute transport in the porous media enables effective indicators sometimes also referred to as functional performance indicators of pte transport to be identified this represents a step forward and a more objective and efficient method to assess groundwater vulnerability especially for shallow aquifers however the prediction performance of these types of models is highly dependent on the quantity and quality of information on input data and system properties it seems still rather unfeasible to assess the groundwater vulnerability over relatively large spatial scales by using three dimensional 3d process oriented hydrological models however a viable way to provide details about solute transport is to implement one dimensional 1d models in spatially representative soil profiles of the area of interest the nitrates directive 91 676 eec reiterated by the new 2006 118 ec promoted by the european council aims at preventing and reversing groundwater degradation induced by nitrates due to agricultural practices this directive requires the member states to identify nitrate vulnerable zones nvzs allowing among other things for a threshold nitrate concentration value of 50 mg l 1 in the water bodies there is a vigorous debate in campania because of the update of the nvzs delimitation resulting from the regional council resolution n 762 2017 and the new regional action plan for nitrates vulnerable areas from agricultural sources busico et al 2019 a one off action plan of 100 million euros is about to start reducing the livestock load to vulnerable areas that since march 2020 have to be subjected to a spreading limit of 170 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year recent studies have reported that over the four year period of 2012 2015 nitrate concentrations in groundwater reached values higher than the drinking water threshold 50 mg l 1 in italy with an increasing trend in comparison to the previous four year period 2008 2011 ducci et al 2019 as also pointed out by gómez hernández and wen 1994 the main indicators controlling the vulnerability of shallow groundwater are obtained in the present study by simulating the nitrate fate across a 10 m thick layered soil profile using hydrus 1d mattern and vanclooster 2010 šimůnek et al 2016 sprenger et al 2016b mokari et al 2019 the goal is to build plausible scenario based model simulations to investigate the fate of nitrate within a stochastic framework under random generated mediterranean climate forcing conditions our investigations refer to the sele river alluvial plain in campania a renowned agri food district for agricultural produce and buffalo dairy products the probability distributions of three fundamental indicators are assessed to characterize the nitrate transport i annual nitrate leaching ii annual root nitrate uptake iii vadose zone nitrate transit time one hundred 20 yr long simulations were run for each scenario using hydrus 1d 1 scenario 1 assumes 195 kg n ha 1 of nitrate fertilizer urea applied annually to estimate the probability distributions of annual cumulative nitrate leaching and root nitrate uptake 2 scenario 2 instead assumes 195 kg n ha 1 of nitrate fertilizer urea applied only once to estimate the nitrate transit time distribution across the soil profile 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description and available data set the sele alluvial plain covers an area of about 500 km2 that spans around the sele river near the city of salerno located in the region of campania southern italy the climate is typically mediterranean with cold rainy winters and hot dry summers 68 23 and 8 of the agricultural land of the sele river plain is used for crops fruit orchards and grazing pastures respectively http www agricoltura regione campania it pubblicazioni territorio rurale html the predominant crops are vegetables 8065 ha including fennel lettuce sweet pepper tomatoes rocket salad broccoli cauliflower green beans eggplants cabbage and several others forages cover about 7481 ha and maize is the predominant forage subject to irrigation and fertilization practices considering the excessive fragmentation of vegetables we assumed the maize as the predominant land cover in the study s area and for this reason we consider maize in model simulations the hydrogeology of the sele plain belongs to the pliocene quaternary hydrogeological complex with porous aquifers formed by epiclastic deposits of alluvial and coastal plains de vita et al 2018 tufano et al 2020 groundwater fluxes are triggered by a hydraulic gradient of 0 6 in the east west direction from the mountainous region situated on the eastern border of the

of 86 topsoil representing the uppermost 15 cm of soil profile and 50 subsoil in the range from 90 cm to 120 cm soil depths undisturbed samples were collected fig 1c table 1 these soil samples were used to map the values of sand silt and clay content oven dry soil bulk density and soil organic carbon fig s1 in supplemental material the oc values were not measured for the subsoil cores a weather

calculated using the temperature based method proposed by hargreaves hargreaves and allen 2003 this relation only requires the minimum and maximum temperatures while the extraterrestrial radiation

statistics of annual mean sums of the aforementioned weather components are reported in table 2 farmers in the sele river plain mostly apply urea as fertilizer urea is incorporated into the soil by rototilling to reduce volatilization we explored two agricultural practices when urea is applied with a single treatment 195 kg n ha 1 on april 1st or a sequence of three treatments 65 kg n ha 1 on april 1st june 1st and august 1st bonfante et al 2019 heterotrophic bacteria hydrolyze urea nh2 2co to form ammonium nh4 which is sequentially nitrified by autotrophic bacteria to nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 that in turn is subsequently denitrified to form dinitrogen n2 and n2o since anaerobic conditions rarely occur in the deep vadose zone profile we neglect the denitrification process transformation of no3 into n2 and n2o hanson et al 2006 ramos et al 2012 bradshaw et al 2013 deb et al 2016 busico et al 2020 therefore the following three solute species are considered in this study nh2 2co nh4 no3 2 2 soil water balance and nitrate transport simulation with hydrus 1d the water balance in the soil plant atmosphere system was evaluated using hydrus 1d šimůnek et al 2016 which

from 0 θ θ r to 1 θ θ s the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity function k s e is given by the following equation van genuchten 1980 5 k s e k s s e τ 1 1 s e 1 m m 2 where k s cm d 1 is the saturated hydraulic conductivity and τ is a tortuosity parameter that is assumed to be τ 0 5 mualem 1976 given that the mode of the statistical distribution of depths to the water table is about 10 m within the study area in the sele alluvial plain not shown we set the thickness of the soil profile to be 10 m the lower boundary condition is set to a constant pressure head ψ 0 cm expressing a constant level of the water table of the shallow aquifer the upper boundary condition depends on fluxes occurring at the soil surface rnet and e p plant potential transpiration t p determines potential root water uptake a sink term in the richards equation in the soil profile the root distribution is assumed to be linear in the soil profile by varying from a maximum at the soil surface to a minimum at the maximum rooting depth which is considered time variant see fig 3c both e p and t p are reduced by water limitation and stresses to actual evaporation e a and actual transpiration t a the actual root water extraction rate ξ is modeled using the method proposed by feddes et al 1978 maize t p is reduced between ψ 500 cm and the wilting point that corresponds to ψ wp 8000 cm to mitigate excessive root water uptake stress of maize during the dry growing season hydrus 1d has an option to trigger irrigation when a user specified pressure head is reached in a selected observation node irrigation starts after a user specified lag period at a user specified irrigation rate the duration of irrigation is also specified when surficial matric pressure head ψ surf is less than a threshold value ψ min the prescribed flux boundary condition a neumann condition specified at the upper boundary of the soil profile automatically switches to a constant pressure head boundary condition a dirichlet condition resulting in a reduction of potential evaporation e p into actual evaporation e a a proportion of net rainfall r net is turned into runoff when ψ surf exceeds the maximum soil surface matric potential value ψ max that represents the nominal depth of surface water ponding allowable before runoff generation hydrus 1d simultaneously considers the fate and transport of multiple solutes subjected to first order degradation reactions hanson et al 2006 considered a urea ammonium nitrate fertigation system subject to nitrogen n transformation processes urea nh2 2co degrades to ammonium nh4 that is subsequently transformed into nitrate no3 by the process of nitrification no3 is then subject to denitrification the partial differential equations governing the one dimensional transport

series considering an alternation of two 6 month lasting seasons see fig s4 in supplementary material a wet season includes the months of october november december january february and march when the sum of monthly average r is higher than the sum of monthly average et p while the remaining months define the dry season i e from april to september in each of these two seasons rainfall is modeled by a stochastic poisson point process with daily rainfall depth μ cm and occurrence λ d 1 a total of one hundred synthetic rainfall time series of 7304 daily values corresponding to 20 years were generated keeping constant parameters of the poisson process and daily rainfall parent distribution in each season in each modeling scenario the synthetic time series was then used as input for the hydrus 1d to evaluate the effects of rainfall seasonality on the water balance components the poisson parameters calculated from the daily rainfall values 1999 2018 measured at the battipaglia weather station are μ 0 88 cm and λ 0 39 d 1 for the wet season and μ 0 67 cm and λ 0 21 d 1 for the dry season table 3 reports basic statistics of et p components available from 1999 to 2018 at the battipaglia weather station a total of one hundred synthetic e p and t p time series of 7304 daily values corresponding to 20 years were then generated using random numbers drawn from a normal distribution with a mean and standard deviation in each month of the year reported in table 3 a similar media scaling method was used in this study to characterize the soil hydraulic behavior of the study area this scaling approach is conceptualized by replacing the heterogeneous porous domain with a homogeneous soil domain when assuming the validity of the miller miller geometric similarity hypothesis miller and miller 1956 clausnitzer et al 1992 in other words the sparse point scale soil hydraulic functions over the heterogeneous spatial domain coalesce into a single reference soil hydraulic function a reference water retention function wrfref and a reference hydraulic conductivity function hcfref referring to a homogeneous spatially representative soil domain through a set of scaling factors nasta et al 2013 a representative soil profile was set with two functional soil layers a topsoil layer from the soil surface to the depth of 100 cm overlying a subsoil layer between soil depths of 100 cm and 1000 cm according to measurement depths described beforehand the five unknown soil hydraulic parameters α n θ r θ s and k s describing the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions for each of the two soil layers have been estimated in the study area by combining the hypres pedotransfer function ptf wösten et al 1999 with the miller miller geometric similarity theory clausnitzer et al 1992 gridded values 2 km grid size of sand silt and clay oven dry soil bulk density and soil organic carbon have been used as input of the hypres ptf to retrieve the soil hydraulic properties of both topsoil and subsoil layers whereas parameter θ r was set at zero more details are presented in supplemental materials fig s5 and table 4 reports the soil hydraulic parameters attributed to topsoil and subsoil in the representative soil profile initial conditions in the soil profile were set as the soil water content values at field capacity which is a reasonable condition on january 1st in the wet season some farmers were interviewed to investigate their irrigation management and the factors influencing the irrigation schedule the irrigation water volume and the duration of each irrigation event the irrigation schedule is based on farmers experience in detecting soil dryness it is impossible to quantify the exact amount of irrigation water and many farmers stop irrigation when infiltration decreases or water ponds are noticed the irrigation events start at the soil pressure head corresponding to field capacity and end at the soil pressure head at the maize initial root water stress romano and santini 2002 therefore to mimic farmers behavior as close as possible irrigation was triggered with zero lag time when the pressure head at the soil depth of 0 60 m the depth of a tensiometer and a corresponding control node in hydrus 1d reaches ψ at field capacity ψ fc bonfante et al 2019 given by the following physically based analytical equation proposed by assouline and or 2014 10 ψ fc 1 α n 1 n 1 2 n n to calculate the effective soil hydraulic parameters in the representative soil profile the parametric aggregation approach presented in nasta and romano 2016 was employed by obtaining ψ fc 207 cm the irrigation rate was set to 1 0 cm d 1 and the irrigation duration to 1 day urea and nitrate are assumed to be present only in the dissolved phase the distribution coefficient k d 0 cm3 g 1 ammonium was assumed to adsorb to the solid phase by setting k d 3 5 cm3 g 1 hanson et al 2006 the first order decay coefficients μ w for urea hydrolysis and ammonium nitrification were set to 0 38 d 1 and 0 2 d 1 respectively li et al 2015 recommended that the molecular diffusion coefficients in free water d w for nh4 and no3 were 1 52 and 1 64 cm2 d 1 respectively we assumed d w 1 52 cm2 d 1 also for urea the longitudinal dispersivity was assumed to be 10 cm 1 10th of the surface layer the tortuosity factor in the liquid phase τ w is calculated using the relationship proposed by millington and quirk 1961 unlimited passive uptake of both nh4 and no3 was allowed in the root solute uptake model šimůnek and hopmans 2009 by specifying the maximum allowed uptake concentration exceeding no3 concentrations recorded in the root zone fertilization is given in the form of urea solute 1 and a total annual amount of 195 kg n ha 1 y 1 is applied on the soil surface bonfante et al 2019 in two different agricultural practices 1 in a single treatment on april 1st agricultural practice 1 2 in a sequence of three treatments 65 kg n ha 1 on april 1st june 1st and august 1st agricultural practice 2 fertilization in hydrus 1d depends on the time dependent water flux precipitation and concentration called ctop at the soil surface boundary we imposed r net 1 0 cm e p to ensure solute entering the soil profile for example the amount of 195 kg n ha 1 corresponds to a solute mass per unit area of s 0 00195 g cm 2 therefore by specifying the water depth l r net 1 0 cm the nitrate concentration in water is ctop s l 0 00195 g cm 3 1950 mg l 1 2 4 scenario 1 assessment of root nitrate uptake and nitrate leaching in scenario 1 realistic agricultural management is mimicked when the total annual amount 195 kg n ha 1 of urea nh2 2co is applied every year for 20 years starting from the first year one set of one hundred model simulations was considered when the total amount of urea is applied with a single annual treatment agricultural practice 1 on april 1st and another set of one hundred model simulations was considered when the total amount of urea is applied in three treatments agricultural practice 2 on april 1st june 1st and august 1st fig 2 daily r e p and t p data were stochastically generated over 20 years to ensure the impact of the mediterranean seasonal climate regime on the water balance this exercise obtains probability distributions of annual cumulative nitrate flux at the soil profile bottom and root nitrate uptake a matlab script was used to automatically change daily r e p and t p values in the input text file atmosph in and extract results on nitrate from the output text files solute3 out and obs node out 2 5 scenario 2 assessment of nitrate transit time in scenario 2 the transit time is defined as the time required for a solute in this case urea solute 1 applied on a single day of a single specific year at the soil surface to transform into nitrate solute 3 and migrate to the soil profile bottom by entering the shallow aquifer fig 3 the transit time corresponds to the difference between the peak of the nitrate breakthrough curve btc at the soil profile bottom and fertilizer application date in the case of a single treatment agricultural practice 1 one fertilizer application is set with 1 95 mg cm 3 of urea nh2 2co corresponding to 195 kg n ha 1 applied at the soil surface on april 1st only in the third year in the case of three treatment applications agricultural practice 2 instead three individual sets of model simulations in the third year were organized the third year instead of the first year was selected to minimize the impact of unknown initial conditions the first two years of simulation thus represent a warm up period as mentioned above daily r e p and t p data were stochastically generated over 20 years this exercise was repeated one hundred times to obtain a transit time distribution ttd as above a matlab script was used to provide model inputs and extract model results automatically 3 results 3 1 results for scenario 1 assessment of root nitrate uptake and nitrate leaching a monte carlo analysis is performed with randomly generated boundary fluxes to determine the probability distributions of annual cumulative root nitrate uptake and nitrate leaching when fertilizer is applied every year recall that new synthetic time series of daily precipitation and crop specific potential evapotranspiration data were stochastically generated by considering the typical climate seasonality under mediterranean conditions one hundred simulated time series of daily root nitrate uptake and nitrate leaching under agricultural practice 1 and agricultural practice 2 are illustrated in fig 4 in general root nitrate uptake depends on the timing and amount of fertilization time variant maize characteristics and water balance which is influenced by precipitation crop specific potential evapotranspiration and irrigation crop specific potential evapotranspiration depends on the time variant crop coefficient that is maximum k c 1 05 for a short period from july 16th doy 197 to august 2nd doy 214 during tassel silking and blister kernel phases fig s2 july s highest crop coefficient value induces maximum crop specific potential evapotranspiration equal to 0 532 cm d 1 table 3 during the dry season soil water deficit causes a reduction of potential transpiration into actual transpiration irrigation mitigates soil water deficit during the dry season and helps reduce root water stress by increasing actual transpiration fluxes and consequently root nitrate uptake indeed while annual mean potential transpiration is 40 4 cm table 2 annual mean actual transpiration simulated in hydrus 1d is 32 5 cm about a 20 reduction of tp into ta annual cumulative irrigation simulated in hydrus 1d is between 36 9 cm corresponding to 3685 m3 per hectare and 40 7 cm corresponding to 4065 m3 per hectare with an average amount of 38 2 cm corresponding to 3819 m3 per hectare while this amount seems plausible some farmers might irrigate using even 50 more water http www agricoltura regione campania it irrigazione prci risultati html bonfante et al 2019 estimated total irrigation amounts on average between 2819 m3 ha 1 and 4699 m3 ha 1 under mediterranean semiarid climate conditions in northeast spain farmers apply on average 81 8 86 2 cm of irrigation water for maize considering annual mean precipitation of 34 7 44 3 cm and grass reference evapotranspiration of 123 0 133 1 cm malik et al 2019 nonetheless in this study the difference in root nitrate uptake between the two agricultural practices is caused solely by the timing and amount of fertilization since the water balance is the same under both agricultural practices in agricultural practice 1 195 kg n ha 1 applied on april 1st the applied nitrate easily bypasses the root zone because roots start growing on may 9th doy 129 fig s2 in contrast in agricultural practice 2 namely the 3 steps application nitrate derived from fertilizer applications on june 1st and august 1st is mostly taken up by roots root nitrate uptake increases linearly as a function of time eq s3 with a concurrent increase in potential evapotranspiration fig s3 moreover the lai reaches its maximum value lai 5 5 between july 16th doy 197 and august 2nd doy 214 fig s2 maximizing potential root water uptake and minimizing potential evaporation from the soil surface fig 5a actual transpiration reaches its maximum value at the beginning of the mature growth phase with favorable climate conditions from middle august fig 5a this interpretation highlights the importance of adequately describing various stages of the maize growing season which are well documented nasta and gates 2013 bonfante et al 2019 fig 5b shows median daily root nitrate uptake values under agricultural practice 1 red line and agricultural practice 2 blue line during the year with distinct maize growth phases the total nitrate removed by roots during crop planting emergence cpe tassel silking and blister kernel phases bk is 0 589 mg cm 2 58 9 kg n ha 1 and 0 648 mg cm 2 64 8 kg n ha 1 under agricultural practice 1 and agricultural practice 2 respectively in contrast the main difference in root nitrate uptake is observed during the mature growth phase mg with 0 213 mg cm 2 21 3 kg n ha 1 removed under agricultural practice 1 and 0 476 mg cm 2 47 6 kg n ha 1 removed under agricultural practice 2 in the latter case the third treatment applied on august 1st third black asterisk on doy 213 in fig 5 boosts root nitrate uptake blue line in fig 5b during the mature growth phase the impact of harvest timing usually from middle september to middle october on root nitrate uptake is negligible under both agricultural practices fig 6 shows the frequency distribution of annual cumulative root solute uptake and nitrate leaching based on one hundred forward simulations two normality tests lilliefors and kolmogorov smirnov executed in matlab reject the null hypothesis that both annual cumulative root solute uptake and nitrate leaching under both agricultural practices come from a normal distribution at the 5 significance level therefore the median is presented instead of the mean as a representative value of each frequency distribution the zero is the most frequent value mode in annual cumulative nitrate leaching fig 6b and d because the nitrate flux across the soil profile bottom remains zero during the first two years of the numerical simulations the one treatment fertilization see red histograms in fig 6a and b results in a median value of annual cumulative root nitrate uptake of 0 803 mg cm 2 corresponding to 80 3 kg n ha 1 and annual cumulative nitrate leaching of 0 749 mg cm 2 corresponding to 74 9 kg n ha 1 in other words roots absorb 41 of applied nitrate while median annual cumulative nitrate leaching represents about 38 of applied nitrate the three treatment fertilization see yellow histograms in fig 6c and d results in a median value of annual cumulative root nitrate uptake of 1 12 mg cm 2 corresponding to 112 kg n ha 1 and annual cumulative nitrate leaching of 0 524 mg cm 2 corresponding to 52 4 kg n ha 1 almost 60 of applied nitrate is removed by root nitrate uptake while median annual cumulative nitrate leaching represents about 27 of applied nitrate considering the total amount of fertilizer applied during 20 years is 3900 kg n ha 1 the final amount of residual nitrate in the entire 10 m thick soil profile after 20 years is on average 796 kg n ha 1 20 4 of applied nitrate and 612 kg n ha 1 15 7 of applied nitrate for agricultural practice 1 and 2 respectively similarly cumulative nitrate leaching after 20 years is on average 1498 kg n ha 1 and 1048 kg n ha 1 for agricultural practices 1 and 2 respectively in the po river plain lombardy northern italy under annual rainfall conditions fairly similar to those recorded in our study area perego et al 2012 reported for maize fields at six experimental sites an annual irrigation supply ranging between 1800 m3 ha 1 and 3150 m3 ha 1 annual fertilization amounts were between 309 kg n ha 1 and 642 kg n ha 1 plant nitrogen removal between 194 kg n ha 1 57 of the fertilization amount and 305 kg n ha 1 47 and nitrate leaching below the root zone z 1 5 m measured by suction cups ranging between 14 kg n ha 1 4 and 321 kg n ha 1 50 demurtas et al 2016 reported annual mean precipitation of 56 8 cm irrigation of 4600 m3 ha 1 mean annual fertilization of 599 kg n ha 1 root nitrate uptake of 264 kg n ha 1 47 of applied nitrate nitrate leaching of 84 kg n ha 1 15 of applied nitrate and 250 kg n ha 1 residual nitrate 39 of applied nitrate under mediterranean climate conditions 3 2 results for scenario 2 assessment of nitrate transit time a monte carlo analysis was performed by generating upper boundary fluxes to determine a probabilistic distribution of nitrate transit time values ttd scenario 2 involves an ensemble of one hundred numerical simulations with hydrus 1d subjected to daily rainfall data generated by the poisson distribution parameters pertaining to the dry and wet seasons and e p and t p data with normally distributed parameters mean and standard deviation in each month once again recall that the fertilizer is applied only in the third year either with a single treatment agricultural practice 1 or with a three step treatment agricultural practice 2 fig 7 refers to agricultural practice 1 i e a single treatment of urea and depicts the ensemble of one hundred nitrate concentrations at soil depths of 300 cm 600 cm and 1000 cm fig 7a and corresponding normal distributions of transit time values fig 7b these graphs show that nitrate concentration gradually propagates downward through the vadose zone with btcs characterized by decreasing magnitude and increasing duration with depth fig 7a it is hypothesized that below the root zone z 300 cm blue lines the nitrate btc peaks depend on the combination of daily rnet and et p following the nitrate spill the btcs are affected by water infiltration induced by rainfall mainly occurring in the wet season to test this hypothesis the pearson s correlation coefficients between the cumulated rainfall and transit time values at the soil depths of 300 cm 600 cm and 1000 cm were 0 80 0 85 0 85 respectively this indicates that the ttd values depend highly on r net accelerating or slowing down nitrate transport through the unsaturated zone the standard deviation of ttds increases with soil depth 65 4 days 145 3 days and 181 4 days at the soil depths of 300 cm 600 cm and 1000 cm respectively when considering agricultural practice 2 i e three applications of urea fig 8 shows the normal probability distributions of the ensemble of one hundred nitrate concentrations at soil depths of 300 cm 600 cm and 1000 cm in general transit times decrease when treatment is individually applied on april 1st june 1st and august 1st the transit times relevant to the treatment applied in april are very similar to those presented previously and associated with a single treatment of 195 kg n ha 1 for the treatments applied on june 1st and august 1st the mean transit times are 2707 days with a standard deviation of 186 days and 2650 days with a standard deviation of 185 days respectively it is important to point out that in the present study ttds are affected only by the upper boundary forcing while other factors were kept fixed namely i the soil hydraulic parameters in the two functional soil layers influencing flow velocity across the unsaturated zone and ii the reaction and transport parameters especially the nitrate longitudinal dispersivity affecting the solute transport process 4 discussion in the present study the nitrate fate was evaluated in a representative 10 m thick soil profile by using a process oriented hydrological model supported by a relatively large number of soil data nasta et al 2020b as well as parameter values describing the nitrogen transport and transformation taken from the literature veizaga et al 2016 however because of a lack of direct local measurements on nitrate data our one dimensional numerical results should not be strictly considered for actual agronomic applications indeed our model simulations provide useful indications of nitrate transport in the area and more importantly can be integrated with map overlay procedures for delineating nitrate vulnerable zones matzeu et al 2017 catani et al 2020 vigliotti et al 2020 tufano et al 2020 the method presented in this study identifies process oriented indicators accounting for the local climatic and environmental conditions this is therefore more effective and understandable to landowners and stakeholders to our knowledge this study provides a novel protocol to assess ttds characterizing nitrate transport within the soil profile to support the mapping of nvzs fusco et al 2020 if model simulations are assumed valid the nitrate transit time can be viewed as a dynamic indicator of groundwater vulnerability and an efficient way to evaluate the protective function exerted by the vadose zone matteau et al 2019 turkeltaub et al 2020 quantification of nitrate fate and transport in the vadose zone depends on several factors that may significantly affect the accuracy of the estimated nitrate transit time mattern and vanclooster 2010 water flow depends on the depth to the groundwater table soil hydraulic properties of the vadose zone and maize characteristics influencing evapotranspiration fluxes nitrogen species fate and transport depend on their transport and reaction parameters initial concentrations throughout the soil profile and the amount and frequency of fertilizer applications it is very difficult to characterize soil layering and its soil hydraulic properties throughout large scale domains in this study only information on soil physical properties within the topmost meter of the vadose zone was used to artificially build two functional soil layers over a 10 m thick soil profile hypres ptf was employed in each soil layer to retrieve five unknown soil hydraulic parameters α n θ r θ s and k s describing the soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity functions other existing ptfs developed on european datasets could be tested as well weynants et al 2009 szabó et al 2021 nasta et al 2021 the eleven lithological core drilling soil profiles evidence relatively uniform soil physical properties in the vadose zone nevertheless the impact of soil vertical variability on the decay of saturated hydraulic conductivity induced by soil compaction in the deepest soil layers is expected turkeltaub et al 2021 the scenario based simulations are not supported by monitoring key state variables water contents pressure head data or water fluxes throughout the soil profile the cost of the instrumentation might be high and unfeasible farmers do not recommend the installation of sensors beneath the maize fields because of tillage operations some studies interestingly calibrate physical models using soft data approaches such as isotope based techniques stumpp et al 2012 sacchi et al 2013 sprenger et al 2016a boumaiza et al 2021 future improvements will integrate key measurements of nitrate absorbed by roots nitrate leaching into the shallow aquifer and nitrate concentrations measured throughout the soil profile based on stable isotope data in a subsequent study farmers collaboration will be requested to record the exact amount and frequency of fertilization fertilizer type and irrigation depths during the growing season our results produce annual root nitrate uptake comparable to previous studies in cornfields tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 in a subsequent step the available gridded soil hydraulic properties will be used in the hydrus 1d package by assuming the spatial domain represented by independent columns hydrus 1d will be coupled to modflow beegum et al 2018 2019 to describe the nitrate transport influenced by topography and depth to the water table in the 3d domain prudic et al 2004 zeng et al 2019 another future study will investigate the impact of point source pollution caused by livestock farming piccini et al 2016 the contribution of localized applications of high amounts of buffalo manure on nitrate mineralization will be assessed in this regard a refinement of available models is needed to consider the process of nitrate immobilization into the microbial biomass that commonly occurs for organic amendments with a c n ratio above 30 hodge et al 2000 bonanomi et al 2014 5 concluding remarks numerical simulations of hydrological processes and nitrate transport provide useful process oriented indicators that can be integrated with the information retrieved from gis based approaches to map nvzs and quantify potential hazards of detrimental anthropogenic environmental impacts the use of process oriented models is often prevented by the lack of key measurements and farmers information e g about irrigation and fertilization nevertheless the use of numerical models can be enhanced in the future by investing in monitoring network infrastructures effective soil hydraulic and nitrate transport parameters can be estimated using ad hoc inverse modeling procedures supported by available vadose zone data the 20 years long model simulations show that agricultural practices strongly influence root nitrate uptake and nitrate leaching in all cases nitrate transit times are about two years to bypass the root zone and about 7 8 years to reach the shallow aquifer groundwater nitrate contamination is a consequence of nitrate leaching and will be subject to future investigations the proposed approach can produce

9884,precipitation is a very important weather variable for growth and yield of rainfed crops in many agricultural regions of the world high quality precipitation records are not available and thus gridded precipitation products gpps have to be applied as an alternative the main objective of this study was to identify the most accurate gpp for simulating crop yield over a major rainfed wheat production zone in iran for this purpose fifteen global gpps were evaluated versus the observed precipitation records for the simulation of rainfed wheat growth and development and yield estimation using the cropping system model csm ceres wheat model embedded in the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat the findings showed that multi source gpps had generally higher skill for the yield estimation considering all statistical and simulation results obtained from three sites during 2000 2010 mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation was found as the best alternative gpp to the observed precipitation data for rainfed wheat grain yield simulation with normalized root mean square error nrmse of 4 6 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 79 while cmorph the climate prediction center morphing method was the weakest with nrmse of 13 3 and nse as 0 81 the results point to differences among gpp but there is a need to evaluate in other regions if multi purpose gpps are in general more reliable than gpps based on specific sources keywords crop model dssat ceres wheat gridded precipitation rainfed wheat 1 introduction cropping system models csms are widely used tools for estimating crop development growth and yield hoogenboom 2000 as climate change and variability have significant impacts on crop production fraisse et al 2006 hoogenboom 2000 olesen and bindi 2002 estimating crop yield using csms requires daily weather data as inputs including solar radiation s rad maximum and minimum temperature t max and t min and total precipitation p hoogenboom 2000 however for many agricultural regions observed weather data owd are not available or do not have sufficient high quality this is therefore a problematic issue for accurate crop yield estimation in these regions van wart et al 2013 white et al 2011 recent studies revealed that gridded weather products gwps are often dependable alternatives for use in crop production system studies using csms in regions that lack of high quality owd some of the conducted studies were summarized in table 1 studies indicate that daily s rad t max and t min obtained from gwp may be reliably used for crop simulations while daily p is often biased monteiro et al 2018 toreti et al 2019 van wart et al 2013 2015 white et al 2008 2011 daily p is the most important weather data for simulating rainfed crops and variability of the csm outputs is directly correlated to the accuracy of model inputs particularly daily p values heinemann et al 2002 and this enhances the importance of exploring the quality of daily p data lashkari et al 2018 van wart et al 2015 there are several available daily gridded precipitation products gpps such as chirps gpm the global precipitation measurement mission and mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation that are generated using various sources including satellites climate models and weather stations by applying spatial interpolation techniques and data assimilation method however these gpps have not yet been assessed and inter compared for rainfed crop yield simulation across relevant regions of the globe the primary objective of this paper is to identify the most proper gpp for crop simulation of rainfed crops in the northwest iran and also regions with similar environmental attributes the weather station network over the study region is not sufficiently dense for regional assessments and there is a particular lack of observed precipitation data it is a common problematic issue in many agricultural zones and thus detecting accurate gpps can be very useful for crop production systems especially for yield prediction wheat is selected for this research as it is the most important crop in food production globally and is cultivated in the study areas as a rainfed crop thus depending on rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area iran is located in southwest asia and has a dominant arid to semi arid climate with a long term annual average rainfall of 250 mm araghi et al 2019 according to the records from 1978 to 2020 more than 63 of wheat area in iran are rainfed iranian ministry of agriculture 2020 with the northwestern and western provinces as the major regions for rainfed wheat production three sites i e khorramabad in lorestan sanandaj in kordestan and tabriz in east azerbaijan provinces table 2 were selected for this study fig 1 more than 75 of total wheat production area in these provinces is rainfed accounting for 30 of rainfed wheat production in iran the climate of all the selected sites is semi arid which is the general climate for rainfed wheat cultivation the nearest weather station was selected for each site and their locations were presented in table 2 the daily observed weather

gpp in this study 15 global gpps were evaluated including 13 satellite related and two gauge based gpps table 2 the two gauge based gpps were solely based on gauge records while for the thirteen satellite related gpps remotely sensed data of precipitation from different satellites were applied as the main source for generating gpp or as an auxiliary source for improving the quality of gpp and thus satellite related phrase was used in this paper instead of satellite derived and satellite based these 15 gpps table 3 were all generated using spatial statistical interpolation techniques and

including plant population at seeding depth and date of planting row spacing soil texture the genetic coefficients for the azar 2 cultivar and fertilizer material and application were all taken from previously conducted modeling studies in the study area nouri et al 2017 2 4 workflow 2 4 1 statistical analysis of gpps and observed rainfall firstly precipitation values were extracted from each gpp from the nearest grid point to the selected sites considering all sites the extracted precipitation values from each of the gpps were compared against the observed precipitation data at daily 15 day and monthly time steps as well as the total precipitation during the growing season i e october to may from 2000 to 2010 the statistical analysis was not performed site by site and all sites were pooled together before the accuracy analysis this method was conducted to avoid site based findings and obtain comprehensive site free results from the gpps accuracy analysis following previous studies van wart et al 2015 percentage of false wet days a precipitation event estimated in gpp but not reported by observations and false dry days a precipitation event not estimated in gpp but reported by observations of each of the gpps were also computed versus the observed precipitation records to compare daily 15 day monthly and total precipitation obtained from gpps versus observed data during the growing season the wilcoxon test was applied the wilcoxon test is a non parametric distribution free test commonly used to check the mean equality of two series wilks 2011 null hypothesis of the wilcoxon test indicates equality of the means of two series 2 4 2 accuracy of gpps for crop modeling applications as depicted in fig 2 to investigate skill of the gpps for applying in crop modeling the ceres wheat model was firstly run based on the observed weather data owd in each of the selected sites during 2000 2010 then the observed rainfall values within the dssat weather files replaced by the extracted rainfall values from each of the gpps and the crop model was run again the model outputs including grain yield and precipitation use efficiency estimated based on the observed rainfall data and the rainfall values extracted from gpps were then compared to find the most accurate gpp there is uncertainty in crop models outputs because of the assumptions and simplifications considered in model s structure however in this context the reference is considered to be the crop model outputs based on observed weather data owd and the results based on gpps are then used for comparisons note that quality control of owd including rainfall measured in weather stations as the stations used in the current study is typically conducted before data is made publically available by iran meteorological organization irimo 2 4 3 evaluation indices to evaluate the rainfall values extracted from each gpps and also the ceres wheat model outputs some evaluation

statistical analysis of gpps vs observed precipitation the best performance of the gpps when compared to the observed daily precipitation during the growing season was obtained for agmerra and mswep that both had r 0 79 and nse 0 46 table 4 on the other hand cmorph had the lowest accuracy among all gpps descriptive statistics of agmerra and mswep were very similar to those of the observed daily precipitation given the p values of the wilcoxon test among all gpps only agmerra and mswep had non significant differences with the observed daily precipitation at α 0 05 results obtained for 15 day precipitation during the growing season showed that agmerra and mswep had the strongest skills and cmorph had the weakest skill table 5 agmerra and mswep had values close to the observed 15 day precipitation for almost all descriptive statistics according to the p values of the wilcoxon test there were no significant differences between the observed 15 day precipitation and the gpp products for agcfsr agmerra gldas mswep and pgf at α 0 05 for monthly precipitation during growing season from 2000 to 2010 agmerra and mswep had the highest skill and cmorph had the lowest skill table 6 agmerra and mswep also had descriptive statistics that most closely matched the observed data analysis of p values of the wilcoxon test revealed that agcfsr agmerra gldas mswep pgf s14fd and trmm have non significant differences with the observed monthly precipitation at α 0 05 findings gained from statistical analysis of the total precipitation during the growing season from 2000 to 2010 table 7 disclosed that agmerra and mswep had the strongest skills and cmorph had the weakest skill the closest descriptive statistics to the observed total precipitation were also found in agmerra and mswep according to the result of the wilcoxon test there was no significant difference between the observed total precipitation and agmerra mswep and some other gpps table 7 3 2 false wet and dry days considering all sites during growing seasons from 2000 to 2010 table 8 mswep had the highest accuracy in terms of accurately representing wet and dry days and cmorph had the lowest accuracy cpc and agmerra had the highest accuracy after mswep and gldas and persiann had the lowest accuracy after cmorph 3 3 grain yield comparing simulated grain yield with gpp products to the model outputs for grain yield kg ha 1 estimated from the observed precipitation in all sites during 2000 2010 fig 3 the strongest skills were found for agmerra and mswep the weakest skill was detected in cmorph after cmorph the next weakest skills were found in agera5 with and persiann 4 discussion simulation of crop yield in water limited regions is highly dependent on accurate rainfall data and the available precipitation station network is often insufficient for regional analyses of crop performance using simulation modeling this calls for the use of gridded estimates of daily precipitation but there are great differences in the quality of precipitation data from these different gpps and the quality of the precipitation data is directly reflected in the quality of the simulated crop yields as illustrated by the similar performance of the gpps with respects to precipitation and to crop yield considering evaluation indices computed for the model outputs it was found that agmerra and mswep were the gpps with the highest reliability and the best alternatives for the observed precipitation data for rainfed wheat yield estimation in the study area whereas cmorph has the lowest skill the high skill of agmerra for crop modeling was also revealed in previous studies battisti et al 2019 lashkari et al 2018 parkes et al 2019 toreti et al 2019 yaghoubi et al 2020 moreover previous research has shown higher accuracy of mswep daily precipitation against cmorph persiann and trmm across iran alijanian et al 2017 our findings highlight that multi source precipitation products such as mswep has a higher accuracy compared to purely satellite derived precipitation products such as cmorph however power s rad t max and t min data were found to be promising source for crop modeling van wart et al 2015 white et al 2008 but the findings of the current study showed a medium to low accuracy of power daily precipitation data considering the findings mswep can be recommended as the best gpp for crop modeling purposes over the study area and similar regions the main reason is the multi source structure of mswep based on weather stations observations remote sensing data and climate models output mswep is also available for recent years and is updated frequently it has a proper spatial resolution and temporal coverage alongside the results gained in the current study some general benefits and drawbacks of the investigated gpps concerning their applicability and retrieval process concern accessibility and spatial and temporal coverage 4 1 accessibility ease of downloading is a significant factor that increases the usage of a gwp the most convenient downloading process in this study was found in persiann and power which had this ability to simply download data for a specific geo point mswep was in the next rank which had pre cutted data for different regions of the globe for example the pre cutted mswep file size for each year over the middle east was 25mb some products such as agcfsr agera5 agmerra chirps cpc gpcc and pgf had one file for each year with global coverage resulting in considerably larger file sizes compared to mswep although the online system of gldas gpm and trmm had a perfect option to easily cut the product for a specific region but unfortunately the final files were prepared day by day for instance for the period selected for the current study from 2000 to 2010 a total of 4018 single files must be downloaded it would be convenient if these cutted products were packaged in a single compressed file and then presented to the user the worst downloading process was for s14fd where data files of all years with a global spatial coverage had been packaged in a single compressed file with size of 7 gb 4 2 spatial coverage most of the assessed gpps had a global coverage but some gpps such as chirps and trmm had a limited spatial coverage from 50 s 50 n such limited gpps are not useful for the environmental and agricultural studies outside of their bounds agmerra and mswep the two gpps with the greatest skill in the current study had a global spatial coverage this is a distinguished benefit of these gpps as they can be applied in any zone of the globe 4 3 temporal coverage availability over the past recent years can be a significant superiority of a gpp while mswep v2 6 is available until end of 2019 agmerra was ended in 2010 and this is its major drawback as it cannot be useful for environmental and agricultural studies after 2010 it is also expected that next versions of mswep will include precipitation values for the years after 2019 5 conclusions this study aimed to evaluate multiple gridded precipitation products gpps for rainfed wheat yield estimation in a semi arid environment using the ceres wheat model to this end fifteen global gpps were investigated findings showed that multi source gpps had higher accuracy accordingly agmerra and mswep outperformed the other gpps while cmorph was the weakest product although agmerra was identified as a top gpp in the current research it cannot be a proper choice for the further studies due to its limited temporal coverage up to 2010 and therefore mswep is recommended for environmental and agricultural research particularly crop modeling over the study area similar studies for other crops and environments are required to expand the findings of this research declaration

9884,precipitation is a very important weather variable for growth and yield of rainfed crops in many agricultural regions of the world high quality precipitation records are not available and thus gridded precipitation products gpps have to be applied as an alternative the main objective of this study was to identify the most accurate gpp for simulating crop yield over a major rainfed wheat production zone in iran for this purpose fifteen global gpps were evaluated versus the observed precipitation records for the simulation of rainfed wheat growth and development and yield estimation using the cropping system model csm ceres wheat model embedded in the decision support system for agrotechnology transfer dssat the findings showed that multi source gpps had generally higher skill for the yield estimation considering all statistical and simulation results obtained from three sites during 2000 2010 mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation was found as the best alternative gpp to the observed precipitation data for rainfed wheat grain yield simulation with normalized root mean square error nrmse of 4 6 and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse of 0 79 while cmorph the climate prediction center morphing method was the weakest with nrmse of 13 3 and nse as 0 81 the results point to differences among gpp but there is a need to evaluate in other regions if multi purpose gpps are in general more reliable than gpps based on specific sources keywords crop model dssat ceres wheat gridded precipitation rainfed wheat 1 introduction cropping system models csms are widely used tools for estimating crop development growth and yield hoogenboom 2000 as climate change and variability have significant impacts on crop production fraisse et al 2006 hoogenboom 2000 olesen and bindi 2002 estimating crop yield using csms requires daily weather data as inputs including solar radiation s rad maximum and minimum temperature t max and t min and total precipitation p hoogenboom 2000 however for many agricultural regions observed weather data owd are not available or do not have sufficient high quality this is therefore a problematic issue for accurate crop yield estimation in these regions van wart et al 2013 white et al 2011 recent studies revealed that gridded weather products gwps are often dependable alternatives for use in crop production system studies using csms in regions that lack of high quality owd some of the conducted studies were summarized in table 1 studies indicate that daily s rad t max and t min obtained from gwp may be reliably used for crop simulations while daily p is often biased monteiro et al 2018 toreti et al 2019 van wart et al 2013 2015 white et al 2008 2011 daily p is the most important weather data for simulating rainfed crops and variability of the csm outputs is directly correlated to the accuracy of model inputs particularly daily p values heinemann et al 2002 and this enhances the importance of exploring the quality of daily p data lashkari et al 2018 van wart et al 2015 there are several available daily gridded precipitation products gpps such as chirps gpm the global precipitation measurement mission and mswep multi source weighted ensemble precipitation that are generated using various sources including satellites climate models and weather stations by applying spatial interpolation techniques and data assimilation method however these gpps have not yet been assessed and inter compared for rainfed crop yield simulation across relevant regions of the globe the primary objective of this paper is to identify the most proper gpp for crop simulation of rainfed crops in the northwest iran and also regions with similar environmental attributes the weather station network over the study region is not sufficiently dense for regional assessments and there is a particular lack of observed precipitation data it is a common problematic issue in many agricultural zones and thus detecting accurate gpps can be very useful for crop production systems especially for yield prediction wheat is selected for this research as it is the most important crop in food production globally and is cultivated in the study areas as a rainfed crop thus depending on rainfall 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area iran is located in southwest asia and has a dominant arid to semi arid climate with a long term annual average rainfall of 250 mm araghi et al 2019 according to the records from 1978 to 2020 more than 63 of wheat area in iran are rainfed iranian ministry of agriculture 2020 with the northwestern and western provinces as the major regions for rainfed wheat production three sites i e khorramabad in lorestan sanandaj in kordestan and tabriz in east azerbaijan provinces table 2 were selected for this study fig 1 more than 75 of total wheat production area in these provinces is rainfed accounting for 30 of rainfed wheat production in iran the climate of all the selected sites is semi arid which is the general climate for rainfed wheat cultivation the nearest weather station was selected for each site and their locations were presented in table 2 the daily observed weather data owd for crop simulation i e s rad t max t min and p were obtained from iran meteorological organization irimo from 2000 to 2010 for each of the selected sites 2 2 gridded precipitation product gpp in this study 15 global gpps were evaluated including 13 satellite related and two gauge based gpps table 2 the two gauge based gpps were solely based on gauge records while for the thirteen satellite related gpps remotely sensed data of precipitation from different satellites were applied as the main source for generating gpp or as an auxiliary source for improving the quality of gpp and thus satellite related phrase was used in this paper instead of satellite derived and satellite based these 15 gpps table 3 were all generated using spatial statistical interpolation techniques and data assimilation methods a brief explanation for each gpp is given below 2 2 1 agcfsr agcfsr agrometeorological cfsr climate forecast system reanalysis was originally produced using the ncep national

al 2019a the ceres wheat model was found to be a reliable tool for simulating various rainfed wheat cultivars across iran including the study area andarzian et al 2015 bannayan et al 2013 nouri et al 2017 paymard et al 2019 the azar 2 cultivar was chosen in this study as it is the most commonly planted rainfed wheat cultivar in the study area nouri et al 2017 crop management and soil data including plant population at seeding depth and date of planting row spacing soil texture the genetic coefficients for the azar 2 cultivar and fertilizer material and application were all taken from previously conducted modeling studies in the study area nouri et al 2017 2 4 workflow 2 4 1 statistical analysis of gpps and observed rainfall firstly precipitation values were extracted from each gpp from the nearest grid point to the selected sites considering all sites the extracted precipitation values from each of the gpps were compared against the observed precipitation data at daily 15 day and monthly time steps as well as the total precipitation during the growing season i e october to may from 2000 to 2010 the statistical analysis was not performed site by site and all sites were pooled together before the accuracy analysis this method was conducted to avoid site based findings and obtain comprehensive site free results from the gpps accuracy analysis following previous studies van wart et al 2015 percentage of false wet days a precipitation event estimated in gpp but not reported by observations and false dry days a precipitation event not estimated in gpp but reported by observations of each of the gpps were also computed versus the observed precipitation records to compare daily 15 day monthly and total precipitation obtained from gpps versus observed data during the growing season the wilcoxon test was applied the wilcoxon test is a non parametric distribution free test commonly used to check the mean equality of two series wilks 2011 null hypothesis of the wilcoxon test indicates equality of the means of two series 2 4 2 accuracy of gpps for crop modeling applications as depicted in fig 2 to investigate skill of the gpps for applying in crop modeling the ceres wheat model was firstly run based on the observed weather data owd in each of the selected sites during 2000 2010 then the observed rainfall values within the dssat weather files replaced by the extracted rainfall values from each of the gpps and the crop model was run again the model outputs including grain yield and precipitation use efficiency estimated based on the observed rainfall data and the rainfall values extracted from gpps were then compared to find the most accurate gpp there is uncertainty in crop models outputs because of the assumptions and simplifications considered in model s structure however in this context the reference is considered to be the crop model outputs based on observed weather data owd and the results based on gpps are then used for comparisons note that quality control of owd including rainfall measured in weather stations as the stations used in the current study is typically conducted before data is made publically available by iran meteorological organization irimo 2 4 3 evaluation indices to evaluate the rainfall values extracted from each gpps and also the ceres wheat model outputs some evaluation indices including correlation coefficient r index of agreement d normalized root mean square error nrmse nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and percent bias pbias were calculated wilks 2011 1 e i m i o i 2

statistical analysis of gpps vs observed precipitation the best performance of the gpps when compared to the observed daily precipitation during the growing season was obtained for agmerra and mswep that both had r 0 79 and nse 0 46 table 4 on the other hand cmorph had the lowest accuracy among all gpps descriptive statistics of agmerra and mswep were very similar to those of the observed daily precipitation given the p values of the wilcoxon test among all gpps only agmerra and mswep had non significant differences with the observed daily precipitation at α 0 05 results obtained for 15 day precipitation during the growing season showed that agmerra and mswep had the strongest skills and cmorph had the weakest skill table 5 agmerra and mswep had values close to the observed 15 day precipitation for almost all descriptive statistics according to the p values of the wilcoxon test there were no significant differences between the observed 15 day precipitation and the gpp products for agcfsr agmerra gldas mswep and pgf at α 0 05 for monthly precipitation during growing season from 2000 to 2010 agmerra and mswep had the highest skill and cmorph had the lowest skill table 6 agmerra and mswep also had descriptive statistics that most closely matched the observed data analysis of p values of the wilcoxon test revealed that agcfsr agmerra gldas mswep pgf s14fd and trmm have non significant differences with the observed monthly precipitation at α 0 05 findings gained from statistical analysis of the total precipitation during the growing season from 2000 to 2010 table 7 disclosed that agmerra and mswep had the strongest skills and cmorph had the weakest skill the closest descriptive statistics to the observed total precipitation were also found in agmerra and mswep according to the result of the wilcoxon test there was no significant difference between the observed total precipitation and agmerra mswep and some other gpps table 7 3 2 false wet and dry days considering all sites during growing seasons from 2000 to 2010 table 8 mswep had the highest accuracy in terms of accurately representing wet and dry days and cmorph had the lowest accuracy cpc and agmerra had the highest accuracy after mswep and gldas and persiann had the lowest accuracy after cmorph 3 3 grain yield comparing simulated grain yield with gpp products to the model outputs for grain yield kg ha 1 estimated from the observed precipitation in all sites during 2000 2010 fig 3 the strongest skills were found for agmerra and mswep the weakest skill was detected in cmorph after cmorph the next weakest skills were found in agera5 with and persiann 4 discussion simulation of crop yield in water limited regions is highly dependent on accurate rainfall data and the available precipitation station network is often insufficient for regional analyses of crop performance using simulation modeling this calls for the use of gridded estimates of daily precipitation but there are great differences in the quality of precipitation data from these different gpps and the quality of the precipitation data is directly reflected in the quality of the simulated crop yields as illustrated by the similar performance of the gpps with respects to precipitation and to crop yield considering evaluation indices computed for the model outputs it was found that agmerra and mswep were the gpps with the highest reliability and the best alternatives for the observed precipitation data for rainfed wheat yield estimation in the study area whereas cmorph has the lowest skill the high skill of agmerra for crop modeling was also revealed in previous studies battisti et al 2019 lashkari et al 2018 parkes et al 2019 toreti et al 2019 yaghoubi et al 2020 moreover previous research has shown higher accuracy of mswep daily precipitation against cmorph persiann and trmm across iran alijanian et al 2017 our findings highlight that multi source precipitation products such as mswep has a higher accuracy compared to purely satellite derived precipitation products such as cmorph however power s rad t max and t min data were found to be promising source for crop modeling van wart et al 2015 white et al 2008 but the findings of the current study showed a medium to low accuracy of power daily precipitation data considering the findings mswep can be recommended as the best gpp for crop modeling purposes over the study area and similar regions the main reason is the multi source structure of mswep based on weather stations observations remote sensing data and climate models output mswep is also available for recent years and is updated frequently it has a proper spatial resolution and temporal coverage alongside the results gained in the current study some general benefits and drawbacks of the investigated gpps concerning their applicability and retrieval process concern accessibility and spatial and temporal coverage 4 1 accessibility ease of downloading is a significant factor that increases the usage of a gwp the most convenient downloading process in this study was found in persiann and power which had this ability to simply download data for a specific geo point mswep was in the next rank which had pre cutted data for different regions of the globe for example the pre cutted mswep file size for each year over the middle east was 25mb some products such as agcfsr agera5 agmerra chirps cpc gpcc and pgf had one file for each year with global coverage resulting in considerably larger file sizes compared to mswep although the online system of gldas gpm and trmm had a perfect option to easily cut the product for a specific region but unfortunately the final files were prepared day by day for instance for the period selected for the current study from 2000 to 2010 a total of 4018 single files must be downloaded it would be convenient if these cutted products were packaged in a single compressed file and then presented to the user the worst downloading process was for s14fd where data files of all years with a global spatial coverage had been packaged in a single compressed file with size of 7 gb 4 2 spatial coverage most of the assessed gpps had a global coverage but some gpps such as chirps and trmm had a limited spatial coverage from 50 s 50 n such limited gpps are not useful for the environmental and agricultural studies outside of their bounds agmerra and mswep the two gpps with the greatest skill in the current study had a global spatial coverage this is a distinguished benefit of these gpps as they can be applied in any zone of the globe 4 3 temporal coverage availability over the past recent years can be a significant superiority of a gpp while mswep v2 6 is available until end of 2019 agmerra was ended in 2010 and this is its major drawback as it cannot be useful for environmental and agricultural studies after 2010 it is also expected that next versions of mswep will include precipitation values for the years after 2019 5 conclusions this study aimed to evaluate multiple gridded precipitation products gpps for rainfed wheat yield estimation in a semi arid environment using the ceres wheat model to this end fifteen global gpps were investigated findings showed that multi source gpps had higher accuracy accordingly agmerra and mswep outperformed the other gpps while cmorph was the weakest product although agmerra was identified as a top gpp in the current research it cannot be a proper choice for the further studies due to its limited temporal coverage up to 2010 and therefore mswep is recommended for environmental and agricultural research particularly crop modeling over the study area similar studies for other crops and environments are required to expand the findings of this research declaration
