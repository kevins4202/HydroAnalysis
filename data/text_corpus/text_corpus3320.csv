16600,cryptosporidium parvum is waterborne parasite that can cause potentially life threatening gastrointestinal disease and is resistant to conventional water treatment processes including chlorine disinfection the current environmental protection agency approved method for oocyst detection and quantification is expensive limiting the ability of water utilities to monitor complex watersheds thoroughly to understand the fate and transport of c parvum oocysts in this work whole cell imprinting was used to create selective and sensitive surfaces for the capture of c parvum oocysts in water cell imprinted polydimethylsiloxane pdms was manufactured using a modified stamping approach and sensitivity and selectivity were analyzed using different water chemistries and different surrogate biological and non biological particles the overall binding affinity was determined to be less than that of highly specific antibodies but on par with standard antibodies and immune enabled technologies these initial results demonstrate the potential for developing devices using cell imprinting for use in waterborne pathogen analysis graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords cryptosporidium parvum cell imprinted polymer biosensor molecular imprinting 1 introduction cryptosporidium parvum is a protozoan parasite responsible for the gastrointestinal disease known as cryptosporidiosis riggs and perryman 1987 in the environment the parasite exists as a microscopic 4 6 μm oocyst possessing both an inner and outer wall that protect the infective sporozoites from environmental conditions harris and petry 1999 the oocysts are ingested via the fecal oral route as few as 10 oocysts have been reported to cause disease symptoms dupont et al 1995 gerace et al 2019 cryptosporidiosis is generally self limiting in healthy individuals but can prove fatal for immunocompromised persons dupont et al 1995 checkley et al 2015 advanced water treatment technologies for drinking water are generally insufficient for removal of c parvum oocysts riggs and perryman 1987 fayer et al 1998 fayer et al 2000 carey et al 2004 angles et al 2007 the oocysts are small enough to pass through sand filters under suboptimal coagulation flocculation regimes and are resistant to chlorine considine et al 2002 angles et al 2007 jones et al 2018 in addition the long incubation time average 7 days of the parasite prior to symptoms allows transmission to continue for days before an outbreak is recognized dupont et al 1995 fayer et al 2000 carey et al 2004 thus source water monitoring and protection is necessary to avoid future infection outbreaks to this goal the epa has developed the long term 2 enhanced surface water treatment rule lt2 rule which mandates source water monitoring and based on the monitoring results treatment requirements for vulnerable surface water supplies to protect residents from ingesting waterborne cryptosporidium ongerth 2013 ongerth 2017 however due to budget constraints many water utilities are only able to perform the minimum required surface water monitoring for their jurisdiction given the environmental persistence of cryptosporidium carey et al 2004 enhancing the ability of water utilities to monitor more frequently and across more waterways would help reduce the public health burden of cryptosporidiosis currently surface waters are monitored using the environmental protection agency epa method 1623 1 mccuin and clancy 2003 zuckerman and tzipori 2006 shaw et al 2008 obolensky and hotaling 2013 this method includes filtering a 10 l sample of water from a sampling site isolating oocysts using immunomagnetic separation ims and detecting the presence of oocysts using an immunofluorescence assay ifa the technique is prohibitively costly and the efficiency of capture is widely variable xiao et al 2006 kimble et al 2012 furthermore the method requires a laboratory and cannot be performed on site hence there is a need to develop reliable fast and accurate detection tools to monitor for cryptosporidium in surface waters development of new biosensing technologies for cryptosporidium and related environmental pathogens would possibly allow for enhanced monitoring capabilities at lower costs to the water utility lab on a chip technologies label free detection and a myriad of other technologies are under development for diagnosis and detection of multiple disease causing organisms xu and mutharasan 2010 thiruppathiraja et al 2011 angus et al 2012 gavriilidou and bridle 2018 luka et al 2019 currently many of these technologies rely on biological molecules bound to a surface while these methods are often quite selective and sensitive the biological molecules can be degraded easily thiruppathiraja et al 2011 gavriilidou and bridle 2012 thus limiting the useful shelf life of such devices thus for many devices more stable methods of pathogen cell capture are needed molecular imprinting is a technique that creates a negative imprint of a molecule in a polymer matrix wulff 1995 chen et al 2011 chen et al 2016 ang and low 2019 and can be incorporated into lab on a chip technologies using this technique will allow for the target molecule to interact with the imprinted polymer matrix in much the same way as the template molecule used for imprinting the method has been used to develop novel purification technologies andac et al 2016 drug delivery solutions zaidi 2016 tuwahatu et al 2018 and molecular sensing devices chen et al 2016 ang and low 2019 cao et al 2019 ding et al 2020 imprinting of whole cells uses the same principles cells can be imprinted as bulk objects leaving behind homogeneously distributed cavities representing a negative imprint of the microorganism ren et al 2013 ren et al 2014 shan et al 2018 cell imprinted polymers cips have been created for a variety of cell types including bacteria shan et al 2018 viruses altintas et al 2015 and yeast hayden and dickert 2001 among others two methods of cell imprinting are commonly used self assembly and molding ren et al 2014 chen et al 2016 komiyama et al 2018 in the self assembly technique a template microorganism and a polymerization mixture composed of monomers initiators and cross linkers are combined allowing for an imprinted surface to be formed via interactions of the template and monomers during polymerization the template is later removed this technique has been previously used with viruses and bacteria wang et al 2010 shan et al 2018 in the molding technique the polymer is deposited onto the template covered substrate the polymer is then cross linked and peeled off to create complementary surface cavities this method is commonly used with mammalian cells hayden et al 2006 deporter et al 2012 the advantages of using cell imprinting for target recognition are numerous and include a high selectivity and affinity for the target cells mechanical and chemical stability of the final templated polymer and a long shelf life for the final devices surfaces of this type could replace any number of alternative capture purification and analysis devices as cip surfaces generally show comparable sensitivity and selectivity to more traditional approaches while representing a longer shelf life and less time consuming and costly manufacturing in addition as the surfaces are fully artificial their stability is significantly greater than traditional biosensor surfaces that use active biomolecules this opens up the possibility for building full sensing systems using cip surfaces if cip surfaces are sufficiently sensitive and selective towards the cells of interest in this work we describe the development and characterization of a cell imprinted surface for the selective capture of c parvum oocysts the surfaces developed demonstrate robust selectivity and sensitivity in laboratory based assays and could be used in future development of devices for assaying cryptosporidium in laboratory settings possibly replacing some of the costly alternate steps such as filtration and immune magnetic separation in current testing methodologies we envision devices such as this being used as the first step in water testing the surface serves to both select for and capture oocysts potentially eliminating the need for upstream steps in analysis 2

solution 3 1 concentrated h2so4 30 h2o2 v v followed by rinsing several times with distilled water a 40 μl aliquot of oocysts 104 oocysts total has been used for making one template this solution was centrifuged at 1100xg for 15 min the 20 μl supernatant was removed to reduce probability of wasting oocysts during spin coating remaining 20 μl of the oocyst suspension was spread with a sterile pipet tip onto the clean glass slides and held at 4 c for 1 h the remaining liquid on the glass surface was removed via spin coating 2000 rpm 30 s oocyst immobilization on the glass surfaces was confirmed by nuclear dye staining hoechst 33 258 and fluorescence microscopy fig 1 2 4 stamp fabrication polydimethylsiloxane pdms surfaces were prepared by mixing two liquid components of a pre polymer base and a cross linking curing agent dow corning sylgard 184 kit according to the manufacturer s recommendations the pdms monomers were mixed with curing agents in a 10 1 ratio this pre polymer mixture was diluted 4 1 vol vol in cyclohexane to enhance surface flowability the polymer mixture was then spin coated onto a glass slide 1500 rpm 15 s the spun layer of pre polymer was partially cured at 80 c for 4 min prior to pressing the template surface with immobilized oocysts onto the pdms surface oocyst counts on the template ranged from 2500 to 10 000 per glass slide surfaces were remained at room temperature 37 c for 8 h followed by additional curing at 65 c for 1 h the template was then removed and the newly formed imprinted surface was cleaned via sonication with distilled water for 5 min fig 1 cip surfaces were microscopically examined to ensure template oocyst removal 2 5 surface characterization scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy specimens were chemically fixed in 2 5 glutaraldehyde specimens were then dehydrated using an ethanol series 10 20 30 50 70 80 90 and 100 and dried with hexamethyldisilazane to avoid specimen shrinkage specimens were sputtered with a 1 nanometer coating of iridium and examined using a zeiss vp1550 sem oberkochen germany atomic force microscopy afm was performed in tapping mode with dry surfaces using a bruker veeco di 3000 afm tips from bruker mlct bio dc were used for analysis 2 6 adhesion assay attachment efficiency of c parvum oocysts and selectivity of the cip surfaces was analyzed in artificial or natural stream water using an orbital shaking assay surfaces were affixed to the bottom of a petri dish in an orbital shaker set at 130 rpm adjusting for water depth the shear stress was equivalent to 10 49 dyne cm2 turbulent flow see supplementary information particles oocysts or other biological synthetic particles were introduced in known quantities ranging from 100 particles oocysts to 100 000 particles oocysts depending on the parameter being tested selectivity sensitivity and attachment kinetics to the surfaces using rotational agitation at various time points up to 1 week surfaces were removed from the petri dish and the number of particles attached was enumerated by in situ staining and or direct counting using fluorescence microscopy for c parvum and g lamblia staining fluorescence antibody kits crypt a glo and giardi a glo were used according to manufacturer recommendations with one deviation the specimens were treated with antibody solution in a microdroplet i e a droplet of antibody suspension stabilized from evaporation by coverslip overlay for b subtillus a membrane permeant calcium green 5 n invitrogen was used to label the spores yeast cells were labelled with dapi polystyrene particles were used as received from the manufacturer in each assay at least 18 unique and randomly selected fields of view 220 200 μm2 were analyzed at 400x per sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and analysis of cip surfaces polymers for cip surface imprinting should possess mechanical robustness with no lateral shrinking and no cracking during the curing process in addition ideal polymers should be optically transparent to allow for in situ microscopic confirmation of oocyst attachment for these reasons pdms sylgard 184 which is optically transparent relatively inexpensive and mechanically stable was selected for this work to verify cip surface integrity and imprinting surface morphology produced as shown in fig 1 was analyzed using sem and afm sem images figs 2 a and 2b show smooth surfaces with some minor wrinkling likely due to the peeling process used to remove the polymer from the oocyst template small spherical pits average diameter 3 µm on the surfaces are evidence of successfully imprinted oocysts given the templating method we anticipated that the negative imprint would be slightly smaller than the average diameter of the oocysts as described below in fig 2c oocysts on the template stained with crypt a glo are shown to be randomly distributed with minor clustering with a rough diameter of 4 5 µm the distribution and size of the resulting cavities in the templated pdms is similar and thus within expected parameters defects in the circular cross section of the cavities observed by afm fig 3 are likely due to the force used during the stamping fabrication technique and the nature of pdms curing overall the physical appearance of the cip surfaces is consistent with prior works with other similarly sized biological specimens hayden and dickert 2001 dickert and hayden 2002 shan et al 2018 the morphology of the imprinted surfaces and the artifacts associated with manufacturing likely arise due to the mechanical properties of the oocysts when live cells are used as a template the forces associated with templating may deform the oocysts this deformation is less than ideal as it is hypothesized that capture of target oocysts comes from the shapes that result from the templated oocysts ren et al 2013 shan et al 2018 however prior research has shown that the state of the polymer may also play a role in recognition of target organisms this polymer state may be altered in the course of interacting with the template oocyst as the polymer adjusts to minimize the interaction energy intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds dipole dipole attraction and electrostatic forces could be present between the template oocyst surface and polymer monomers all of which can influence the interaction energy chen et al 2016 after polymerization the template oocysts are removed leaving specific recognition sites complementary in shape size and chemical functionalities that can bind selectively to the oocysts in addition some of the dangling moieties on the surface of oocysts or other cells may be removed via the physical forces associated with removal of the template thus some incidence of slight polymer deformations are likely acceptable to overcome the physical deformation prior work has shown that chemical fixation of whole cells stabilizes the shapes to eliminate the deformation challenge ren et al 2013 however the current study used live unfixed oocysts 3 2 attachment efficiency the attachment efficiency of c parvum to the cip surfaces was analyzed using the orbital shaking assay clean glass slides and freshly cured pdms were used as control surfaces each experiment was performed at least three times using oocysts of the same age from different waterborne inc mouse shed samples in each assay 2500 c parvum oocysts per 30 ml of fluid are spiked into the assay dish with the surface of interest cip clean glass or pdms while shaking attachment of the oocysts was monitored over the course of a week at 5 min 1 hour 6 h 24 h 3 days and 1 week on the different surfaces times were chosen to reflect potential use cases for such surfaces including laboratory assays 5 min 1 hour and field deployment 3 days 1 week oocyst attachment was enumerated in situ by staining with crypt a glo and dapi followed by visual quantification using fluorescence microscopy c parvum oocyst attachment efficiencies were significantly higher on the cip surfaces than the glass and pdms null surfaces p 0 001 fig 4 a with the cip surfaces exhibiting attachment efficiencies of 68 after six hours and 73 after three days non specific oocyst attachment efficiencies to the glass and pdms null surfaces were 21 at a maximum some oocyst binding to glass and pdms null surfaces is expected as both types of surfaces are known to allow for non specific adhesion of proteins and cells oocyst attachment to the cip surface was confirmed by sem fig 4b in all samples observed using sem only limited 10 of all bound non specific i e outside of the cavities attachment was observed 3 3 sensitivity analysis the initial attachment assay fig 4a was performed using surfaces imprinted with 2500 oocysts to examine the sensitivity of the cip surfaces to both small and large numbers of oocysts surfaces imprinted with 10 000 oocysts were prepared and the orbital shaking assay was performed with oocyst quantities of 100 to 100 000 fig 5 a this range allowed for analysis of binding sensitivity as well as surface saturation the assay was performed for six hours which coincides with the time when the binding efficiency curve was observed to flatten fig 4a the saturation point of the surfaces after 6 h is 74 see in the curve flattening in fig 4a which means that 74 of the cavities are sensitive enough to capture oocysts when oocyst quantities are in 10 fold excess this saturation point is very similar to the overall oocyst attachment efficiency after 3 days in contact with the cip surfaces fig 4a in addition after 6 h 50 of oocysts are able to attach to the surfaces when 10 000 oocysts are introduced into the system n n0 fig 5a note that 100 000 oocysts exceeds the total number of available sites by 10x this yield could be due to the increased eddy forces at the surface due to the orbital shaker settings this assay which evaluates saturation under turbulent flow conditions 10 49 dyne cm2 provides a basis for which to calculate the affinity binding constant kd this value which provides a numerical indicator of binding affinity can be roughly calculated by assuming the following equilibrium state where o free oocysts t unoccupied cavities and o t occupied cavities o t o t k d o t o t by plotting o t o against the number of oocysts introduced to the surfaces o fig 5b and assuming a steady state system the binding constant can be determined from the slope of the plot the binding follows a first order binding profile with a kd of 4 82 10 5 in units of occupied sites free oocysts free sites which is consistent with that of a small molecule or protein kd usually expressed in m 1 it also indicates that there is a high complementarity and good binding affinity in the micromolar concentration between the oocysts and the templated cavities this binding affinity is similar to that of standard antibodies which have kd in the 10 5 to 10 7 range however it is less than reported binding affinities of some anti cryptosporidium antibodies priest et al 1999 weir et al 2000 it is expected that flow conditions may influence this binding constant to a minor extent with lower flow possibly resulting with a higher capture affinity but with a slower overall capture rate in addition affinity constants are reliant upon surface preparation batch to batch consistency would be key to commercial applications similar to other devices that require biological templating this is apparent when comparing the n no values between figs 4 and 5 different batches of oocysts were used in preparing these surfaces resulting in a varied n no although within the experimental margin of error 3 4 selectivity analysis the selectivity of the cip surface was evaluated by comparing the attachment of c parvum oocysts with the attachment of both biological and non biological particles particles organisms were selected based on size as well as surface chemistry and included polystyrene ps micro beads carboxylated ps beads saccharomyces cerevisiae bacillus subtilis gram positive bacterium presented as spores and giardia lamblia ps microbeads were spherical 5 µm diameter and smooth carboxylated ps beads 5 µm diameter were also used as the surface of c parvum oocysts is known to possess surface biomolecules with carboxylic acid moieties ranucci et al 1993 sarkhosh et al 2019 s cerevisiae was selected as a biological particle with a size and shape similar to c parvum oocysts b subtilis has a similar surface chemistry and surface charge as c parvum and has been suggested as a possible surrogate organism for c parvum in water utility treatment decisions bradford et al 2016 scoullos et al 2020 g lamblia is another waterborne pathogen that may be present in surface waters dai et al 2004 dumetre et al 2012 thompson and ash 2019 scoullos et al 2020 twenty five hundred 2500 particles or oocysts were used in each experiment pdms allows for non specific adhesion of proteins and cells while coatings and modifiers can reduce these non specific interactions in our study the pdms was used without modification thus the adhesion of non c parvum particles was expected to be at the level of background non specific binding i e a 15 20 efficiency based on fig 4a attachment efficiencies of c parvum g lamblia b subtilis s cerevisiae ps beads and carboxylated ps beads were measured at time points spanning 5 min to 24 h fig 6 at every time point the attachment efficiency of c parvum oocysts to the cip surfaces was significantly higher p 0 001 than that of the alternative biological and non biological particles indicating a high selectivity of the cip surfaces for c parvum non specific attachment efficiency was the highest for b subtilis although still minimal which is expected due to the chemical and physical nature of this bacterium the current epa method exhibits variable yield largely due to potential microbiological contaminants and the state of oocysts after collection and processing in prior work biofilms have been shown to provide a useful sampling tool as biofilms allow oocysts to persist dicesare et al 2012 wolyniak et al 2009 for long periods of time for biofilms prepared in the laboratory the percentage of oocysts introduced into a closed system that attach to a biofilm has been shown to be between 50 and 80 which is consistent with the sensitivities observed in the cell imprinting method outlined herein enyzme linked immunosorbent assays elisa for cryptosporidium have sensitivity rates similar to biofilms and the cips kabir et al 2018 of all of the detection methods that have been evaluated in prior works qpcr has the overall highest sensitivity but also requires a great deal of sample preparation that may not allow for rapid screening kabir et al 2018 cell imprinted polymers provide the highly selective and sensitive surface observed herein by providing a lock and key mechanism of attachment which has been described in prior studies wulff 1995 chen et al 2011 chen et al 2016 ang and low 2019 in fact in many studies molecular or cellular imprinting is likened to an artificial antibody where the attraction of the target molecule or cell is facilitated through van der waals interactions hydrogen bonding and similar non covalent bond structures gao et al 2020 these interactions enhanced further by the physical shape of the cip cavities provide enhanced sensitivity and selectivity furthermore cips because of their chemical nature are not as sensitive to environmental factors like heat thus making them an attractive alternative over more traditional uses of antibody based capture such as elisa 3 5 attachment efficiency in different water chemistries the attachment efficiency of c parvum oocysts to the cip surfaces in different water chemistries will be of importance for the application of cip technology in point of use water treatment devices or in laboratory analysis of collected water samples to validate the performance of the cip surfaces in different water chemistries pre filtered 0 22 µm water from three local streams hchokendauqua creek ic indian creek mc monocacy creek was used in the orbital shaking assay fig 7 cip surfaces were created with 2500 oocysts similar to the experiment shown in fig 4 oocysts 2500 in 30 ml of stream water were introduced to the cip surfaces surfaces were collected over the course of 1440 min 24 h and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy each of the three stream chemistries allowed for attachment of the oocysts to the cip surfaces fig 7 with some variability in efficiency across the different timepoints in different water chemistry the attachment efficiencies after 1440 min 24 h in all streams were 55 61 which is slightly less than the attachment efficiency of c parvum oocysts in artificial stream water fig 4a in comparing the stream water chemistries mc has a higher conductivity 417 5 us cm compared to 164 3 us cm and higher potassium and calcium concentrations 8 4 ppb and 27 6 ppb vs 2 3 ppb and 14 6 ppb respectively these data indicate that the physical and chemical nature of the oocyst surface and cip surface are sensitive to water chemistry as the cip surface is created with oocysts that have been stored in a different water chemistry than the oocysts that are being assayed the outer surface of the target oocysts may not be fully complementary to the template sites an observation that will require further study 4 conclusion this study demonstrates that cellular imprinting is a viable technology for cryptosporidium oocyst capture oocyst binding affinity to cip surfaces is similar to that of standard antibodies and immuno enabled technologies while offering the added benefit of a longer shelf life and room temperature storage the potential to use chemically fixed oocysts as template organisms in the manufacture of cip surfaces warrants further investigation as fixed oocysts would reduce the biological risk of using live oocysts and could potentially allow for reuse of the template as the oocysts could also be chemically fixed to the template surface during manufacturing as opposed to physically adsorbed as in the current study these surfaces could be used as the first and only step required in oocyst separation and capture in water quality testing with the only necessary follow up step being immunofluorescence for oocyst confirmation furthermore future incorporation of signal processing technologies into a flow through chip to build a lab on a chip could remove this immunofluorescence step thus allowing for a single step protocol to be used in critical testing situations declaration of competing interest the authors

cip surfaces generally show comparable sensitivity and selectivity to more traditional approaches while representing a longer shelf life and less time consuming and costly manufacturing in addition as the surfaces are fully artificial their stability is significantly greater than traditional biosensor surfaces that use active biomolecules this opens up the possibility for building full sensing systems using cip surfaces if cip surfaces are sufficiently sensitive and selective towards the cells of interest in this work we describe the development and characterization of a cell imprinted surface for the selective capture of c parvum oocysts the surfaces developed demonstrate robust selectivity and sensitivity in laboratory based assays and could be used in future development of devices for assaying cryptosporidium in laboratory settings possibly replacing some of the costly alternate steps such as filtration and immune magnetic separation in current testing methodologies we envision devices such as this being used as the first step in water testing the surface serves to both select for and capture oocysts potentially eliminating the need for upstream steps in analysis 2

solution 3 1 concentrated h2so4 30 h2o2 v v followed by rinsing several times with distilled water a 40 μl aliquot of oocysts 104 oocysts total has been used for making one template this solution was centrifuged at 1100xg for 15 min the 20 μl supernatant was removed to reduce probability of wasting oocysts during spin coating remaining 20 μl of the oocyst suspension was spread with a sterile pipet tip onto the clean glass slides and held at 4 c for 1 h the remaining liquid on the glass surface was removed via spin coating 2000 rpm 30 s oocyst immobilization on the glass surfaces was confirmed by nuclear dye staining hoechst 33 258 and fluorescence microscopy fig 1 2 4 stamp fabrication polydimethylsiloxane pdms surfaces were prepared by mixing two liquid components of a pre polymer base and a cross linking curing agent dow corning sylgard 184 kit according to the manufacturer s recommendations the pdms monomers were mixed with curing agents in a 10 1 ratio this pre polymer mixture was diluted 4 1 vol vol in cyclohexane to enhance surface flowability the polymer mixture was then spin coated onto a glass slide 1500 rpm 15 s the spun layer of pre polymer was partially cured at 80 c for 4 min prior to pressing the template surface with immobilized oocysts onto the pdms surface oocyst counts on the template ranged from 2500 to 10 000 per glass slide surfaces were remained at room temperature 37 c for 8 h followed by additional curing at 65 c for 1 h the template was then removed and the newly formed imprinted surface was cleaned via sonication with distilled water for 5 min fig 1 cip surfaces were microscopically examined to ensure template oocyst removal 2 5 surface characterization scanning electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy specimens were chemically

with a 1 nanometer coating of iridium and examined using a zeiss vp1550 sem oberkochen germany atomic force microscopy afm was performed in tapping mode with dry surfaces using a bruker veeco di 3000 afm tips from bruker mlct bio dc were used for analysis 2 6 adhesion assay attachment efficiency of c parvum oocysts and selectivity of the cip surfaces was analyzed in artificial or natural stream water using an orbital shaking assay surfaces were affixed to the bottom of a petri dish in an orbital shaker set at 130 rpm adjusting for water depth the shear stress was equivalent to 10 49 dyne cm2 turbulent flow see supplementary information particles oocysts or other biological synthetic particles were introduced in known quantities ranging from 100 particles oocysts to 100 000 particles oocysts depending on the parameter being tested selectivity sensitivity and attachment kinetics to the surfaces using rotational agitation at various time points up to 1 week surfaces were removed from the petri dish and the number of particles attached was enumerated by in situ staining and or direct counting using fluorescence microscopy for c parvum and g lamblia staining fluorescence

polystyrene particles were used as received from the manufacturer in each assay at least 18 unique and randomly selected fields of view 220 200 μm2 were analyzed at 400x per sample 3 results and discussion 3 1 preparation and analysis of cip surfaces polymers for cip surface imprinting should possess mechanical robustness with no lateral shrinking and no cracking during the curing process in addition ideal polymers should be optically transparent to allow for in situ microscopic confirmation of oocyst attachment for these reasons pdms sylgard 184 which is optically transparent relatively inexpensive and mechanically stable was selected for this work to verify cip surface integrity and imprinting surface morphology produced as shown in fig 1 was analyzed using sem and afm sem images figs 2 a and 2b show smooth surfaces with some minor wrinkling likely due to the peeling process used to remove the polymer from the oocyst template small spherical pits average diameter 3 µm on the surfaces are evidence of successfully imprinted oocysts given the templating method we anticipated that the negative imprint would be slightly smaller than the average diameter of the oocysts as described below in fig 2c oocysts on the template stained with crypt a glo are shown to be randomly distributed with minor clustering with a rough diameter of 4 5 µm the distribution and size of the resulting cavities in the templated pdms is similar and thus within expected parameters defects in the circular cross section of the cavities observed by afm fig 3 are likely due to the force used during the stamping fabrication technique and the nature of pdms curing overall the physical appearance of the cip surfaces is consistent with prior works with other similarly sized biological specimens hayden and dickert 2001 dickert and hayden 2002 shan et al 2018 the morphology of the imprinted surfaces and the artifacts associated with manufacturing likely arise due to the mechanical properties of the oocysts when live cells are used as a template the forces associated with templating may deform the oocysts this deformation is less than ideal as it is hypothesized that capture of target oocysts comes from the shapes that result from the templated oocysts ren et al 2013 shan et al 2018 however prior research has shown that the state of the polymer may also play a role in recognition of target organisms this polymer state may be altered in the course of interacting with the template oocyst as the polymer adjusts to minimize the interaction energy intermolecular interactions such as hydrogen bonds dipole dipole attraction and electrostatic forces could be present between the template oocyst surface and polymer monomers all of which can influence the interaction energy chen et al 2016 after polymerization the template oocysts are removed leaving specific recognition sites complementary in shape size and chemical functionalities that can bind selectively to the oocysts in addition some of the dangling moieties on the surface of oocysts or other cells may be removed via the physical forces associated with removal of the template thus some incidence of slight polymer deformations are likely acceptable to overcome the physical deformation prior work has shown that chemical fixation of whole cells stabilizes the shapes to eliminate the deformation challenge ren et al 2013 however the current study used live unfixed oocysts 3 2 attachment efficiency the attachment efficiency of c parvum to the cip surfaces was analyzed using the orbital shaking assay clean glass slides and freshly cured pdms were used as control surfaces each experiment was performed at least three times using oocysts of the same age from different waterborne inc mouse shed samples in each assay 2500 c parvum oocysts per 30 ml of fluid are spiked into the assay dish with the surface of interest cip clean glass or pdms while shaking attachment of the oocysts was monitored over the course of a week at 5 min 1 hour 6 h 24 h 3 days and 1 week on the different surfaces times were chosen to reflect potential use cases for such surfaces including laboratory assays 5 min 1 hour and field deployment 3 days 1 week oocyst attachment was enumerated in situ by staining with crypt a glo and dapi followed by visual quantification using fluorescence microscopy c parvum oocyst attachment efficiencies were significantly higher on the cip surfaces than the glass and pdms null surfaces p 0 001 fig 4 a with the cip surfaces exhibiting attachment efficiencies of 68 after six hours and 73 after three days non specific oocyst attachment efficiencies to the glass and pdms null surfaces were 21 at a maximum some oocyst binding to glass and pdms null surfaces is expected as both types of surfaces are known to allow for non specific adhesion of proteins and cells oocyst attachment to the cip surface was confirmed by sem fig 4b in all samples observed using sem only limited 10 of all bound non specific i e outside of the cavities attachment was observed 3 3 sensitivity analysis the initial attachment assay fig 4a was performed using surfaces imprinted with 2500 oocysts to examine the sensitivity of the cip surfaces to both small and large numbers of oocysts surfaces imprinted with 10 000 oocysts were prepared and the orbital shaking assay was performed with oocyst quantities of 100 to 100 000 fig 5 a this range allowed for analysis of binding sensitivity as well as surface saturation the assay was performed for six hours which coincides with the time when the binding efficiency curve was observed to flatten fig 4a the saturation point of the surfaces after 6 h is 74 see in the curve flattening in fig 4a which means that 74 of the cavities are sensitive enough to capture oocysts when oocyst quantities are in 10 fold excess this saturation point is very similar to the overall oocyst attachment efficiency after 3 days in contact with the cip surfaces fig 4a in addition after 6 h 50 of oocysts are able to attach to the surfaces when 10 000 oocysts are introduced into the system n n0 fig 5a note that 100 000 oocysts exceeds the total number of available sites by 10x this yield could be due to the increased eddy forces at the surface due to the orbital shaker settings this assay which evaluates saturation under turbulent flow conditions 10 49 dyne cm2 provides a basis for which to calculate the affinity binding constant kd this value which provides a numerical indicator of binding affinity can be roughly calculated by assuming the following equilibrium state where o free oocysts t unoccupied cavities and o t occupied cavities o t o t k d o t o t by plotting o t o against the number of oocysts introduced to the surfaces o fig 5b and assuming a steady state system the binding constant can be determined from the slope of the plot the binding follows a first order binding profile with a kd of 4 82 10 5 in units of occupied sites free oocysts free sites which is consistent with that of a small molecule or protein kd usually expressed in m 1 it also indicates that there is a high complementarity and good binding affinity in the micromolar concentration between the oocysts and the templated cavities this binding affinity is similar to that of standard antibodies which have kd in the 10 5 to 10 7 range however it is less than reported binding affinities of some anti cryptosporidium antibodies priest et al 1999 weir et al 2000 it is expected that flow conditions may influence this binding constant to a minor extent with lower flow possibly resulting with a higher capture affinity but with a slower overall capture rate in addition affinity constants are reliant upon surface preparation batch to batch consistency would be key to commercial applications similar to other devices that require biological templating this is apparent when comparing the n no values between figs 4 and 5 different batches of oocysts were used in preparing these surfaces resulting in a varied n no although within the experimental margin of error 3 4 selectivity analysis the selectivity of the cip surface was evaluated by comparing the attachment of c parvum oocysts with the attachment of both biological and non biological particles particles organisms were selected based on size as well as surface chemistry and included polystyrene ps micro beads carboxylated ps beads saccharomyces cerevisiae bacillus subtilis gram positive bacterium presented as spores and giardia lamblia ps microbeads were spherical 5 µm diameter and smooth carboxylated ps beads 5 µm diameter were also used as the surface of c parvum oocysts is known to possess surface biomolecules with carboxylic acid moieties ranucci et al 1993 sarkhosh et al 2019 s cerevisiae was selected as a biological particle with a size and shape similar to c parvum oocysts b subtilis has a similar surface chemistry and surface charge as c parvum and has been suggested as a possible surrogate organism for c parvum in water utility treatment decisions bradford et al 2016 scoullos et al 2020 g lamblia is another waterborne pathogen that may be present in surface waters dai et al 2004 dumetre et al 2012 thompson and ash 2019 scoullos et al 2020 twenty five hundred 2500 particles or oocysts were used in each experiment pdms allows for non specific adhesion of proteins and cells while coatings and modifiers can reduce these non specific interactions in our study the pdms was used without modification thus the adhesion of non c parvum particles was expected to be at the level of background non specific binding i e a 15 20 efficiency based on fig 4a attachment efficiencies of c parvum g lamblia b subtilis s cerevisiae ps beads and carboxylated ps beads were measured at time points spanning 5 min to 24 h fig 6 at every time point the attachment efficiency of c parvum oocysts to the cip surfaces was significantly higher p 0 001 than that of the alternative biological and non biological particles indicating a high selectivity of the cip surfaces for c parvum non specific attachment efficiency was the highest for b subtilis although still minimal which is expected due to the chemical and physical nature of this bacterium the current epa method exhibits variable yield largely due to potential microbiological contaminants and the state of oocysts after collection and processing in prior work biofilms have been shown to provide a useful sampling tool as biofilms allow oocysts to persist dicesare et al 2012 wolyniak et al 2009 for long periods of time for biofilms prepared in the laboratory the percentage of oocysts introduced into a closed system that attach to a biofilm has been shown to be between 50 and 80 which is consistent with the sensitivities observed in the cell imprinting method outlined herein enyzme linked immunosorbent assays elisa for cryptosporidium have sensitivity rates similar to biofilms and the cips kabir et al 2018 of all of the detection methods that have been evaluated in prior works qpcr has the overall highest sensitivity but also requires a great deal of sample preparation that may not allow for rapid screening kabir et al 2018 cell imprinted polymers provide the highly selective and sensitive surface observed herein by providing a lock and key mechanism of attachment which has been described in prior studies wulff 1995 chen et al 2011 chen et al 2016 ang and low 2019 in fact in many studies molecular or cellular imprinting is likened to an artificial antibody where the attraction of the target molecule or cell is facilitated through van der waals interactions hydrogen bonding and similar non covalent bond structures gao et al 2020 these interactions enhanced further by the physical shape of the cip cavities provide enhanced sensitivity and selectivity furthermore cips because of their chemical nature are not as sensitive to environmental factors like heat thus making them an attractive alternative over more traditional uses of antibody based capture such as elisa 3 5 attachment efficiency in different water chemistries the attachment efficiency of c parvum oocysts to the cip surfaces in different water chemistries will be of importance for the application of cip technology in point of use water treatment devices or in laboratory analysis of collected water samples to validate the performance of the cip surfaces in different water chemistries pre filtered 0 22 µm water from three local streams hchokendauqua creek ic indian creek mc monocacy creek was used in the orbital shaking assay fig 7 cip surfaces were created with 2500 oocysts similar to the experiment shown in fig 4 oocysts 2500 in 30 ml of stream water were introduced to the cip surfaces surfaces were collected over the course of 1440 min 24 h and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy each of the three stream chemistries allowed for attachment of the oocysts to the cip surfaces fig 7 with some variability in efficiency across the different timepoints in different water chemistry the attachment efficiencies after 1440 min 24 h in all streams were 55 61 which is slightly less than the attachment efficiency of c parvum oocysts in artificial stream water fig 4a in comparing the stream water chemistries mc has a higher conductivity 417 5 us cm compared to 164 3 us cm and higher potassium and calcium concentrations 8 4 ppb and 27 6 ppb vs 2 3 ppb and 14 6 ppb respectively these data indicate that the physical and chemical nature of the oocyst surface and cip surface are sensitive to water chemistry as the cip surface is created with oocysts that have been stored in a different water chemistry than the oocysts that are being assayed the outer surface of the target oocysts may not be fully complementary to the template sites an observation that will require further study 4 conclusion this study demonstrates that cellular imprinting is a viable technology for cryptosporidium oocyst capture oocyst binding affinity to cip surfaces is similar to that of standard antibodies and immuno enabled technologies while offering the added benefit of a longer shelf life and room temperature storage the potential to use chemically fixed oocysts as template organisms in the manufacture of cip surfaces warrants further investigation as fixed oocysts would reduce the biological risk of using live oocysts and could potentially allow for reuse of the template as the oocysts could also be chemically fixed to the template surface during manufacturing as opposed to physically adsorbed as in the current study these surfaces could be used as the first and only step required in oocyst separation and capture in water quality testing with the only necessary follow up step being immunofluorescence for oocyst confirmation furthermore future incorporation of signal processing technologies into a flow through chip to build a lab on a chip could remove this immunofluorescence step thus allowing for a single step protocol to be used in critical testing situations declaration of competing interest the authors

16601,population growth and urbanization worldwide entail the need for continuous renewal plans for urban water distribution networks hence understanding the long term performance and predicting the service life of water pipelines are essential for facilitating early replacement avoiding economic losses and ensuring safe transportation of drinking water from treatment plants to consumers however developing a suitable model that can be used for cases where data are insufficient or incomplete remains challenging herein a new advanced meta learning paradigm based on deep neural networks is introduced the developed model is used to predict the risk index of pipe failure the effects of different factors that are considered essential for the deterioration modeling of water pipelines are first examined the factors include seasonal climatic variation chlorine content traffic conditions pipe material and the spatial characteristics of water pipes the results suggest that these factors contribute to estimating the likelihood of failure in water distribution pipelines the presence of chlorine residual and the number of traffic lanes are the most critical factors followed by road type spatial characteristics month index traffic type precipitation temperature number of breaks and pipe depth the proposed approach can accommodate limited high dimensional and partially observed data and can be applied to any water distribution system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water pipelines essential factors failure meta learning 1 introduction and motivation urban water distribution networks are critical infrastructures as they provide essential services that supply water to different areas such critical infrastructures can also lead to harmful and social impacts including floods and the loss of clean drinking water almheiri et al 2020a husband and boxall 2011 shortridge and guikema 2014 the global investment in water distribution networks is noticeably high furthermore tools based on machine learning are promising as they mitigate the risk of failure by predicting the expected failure time of pipes within a water distribution network prior to their occurrence however it is challenging to accurately predict the time to failure of water pipes this task is also known as survival analysis in medical research survival analysis is challenging because some observation outcomes are censored and do not involve any failure events during the condition monitoring period borenstein et al 2009 the failure time can be unmonitored due to missing traces caused by other events klein and moeschberger 2006 the prediction of service life or failure time can be conducted using standard statistical approaches and machine learning methods standard statistical methods focus on approximating failure curves to characterize the distributions of failure times and the statistical properties of parameter estimation meanwhile machine learning approaches combine the power of conventional statistical methods and various algorithms for predicting the failure time of an event furthermore machine learning algorithms can handle high dimensional data and learn complex relationships better as compared to standard statistical approaches statistical methods can be applied using fully parametric semiparametric and nonparametric approaches however the semiparametric cox proportional hazards cox ph method remains the most prevalent and extensively employed approach for failure analyses huber carol et al 2019 in contrast to other methods cox ph applies a partial likelihood for parameter estimation although this approach is regression based the distribution of outcomes remains unknown cox 1972 machine learning algorithms such as neural networks survival trees and support vector machines svms have gained a marked prominence in survival analyses because of their ability to capture nonlinear relationships and handle high dimensional data adeli 2001 adeli and panakkat 2009 dharia and adeli 2003 panakkat and adeli 2009 however modeling censored data using machine learning remains a challenging task wang et al 2019 furthermore artificial neural networks anns have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in survival analyses in several application domains wang et al 2019 anns comprise artificial neurons that form a network structure by connecting neurons via a weighted link adeli 2001 researchers can employ survival trees for failure analyses as they are programmatically structured to handle censored data wang et al 2019 in survival trees data are recursively partitioned into small regions nodes that contain observations with homogenous survival outcomes based on a splitting criterion safavian and landgrebe 1991 in contrast to standard decision trees survival trees consider the interactions between features and censored information using a tree structure however the performance of ensemble methods such as random forests can surpass that of a single tree breiman 2001 svms are robust supervised learning algorithms for labeled regression and classification tasks however the model output consists of labeled and unlabeled observations in the failure analysis of water pipelines to cope with these challenges a survival svm ssvm has been proposed as a regression and rank based model regression based models predict the log service life by contrast rank based models assign a low rank for a short service life considering all possible pairwise training data to optimize the hinge loss function pölsterl et al 2015 conventional statistical methods have been extensively applied in the failure analysis of water pipelines for example stochastic modeling such as weibull proportional hazards wph has been used for the reliability analysis of water pipes to estimate the failure curve with input explanatory variables the failure curve indicates that the probability of a failure event exceeding a limit state within a defined reference period alvisi and franchini 2010 kimutai et al 2015 le gat and eisenbeis 2000 malm et al 2012 scheidegger et al 2013 vanrenterghem raven et al 2003 previous studies christodoulou 2011 clark et al 2010 debón et al 2010 kimutai et al 2015 park et al 2011 vanrenterghem raven et al 2003 also applied cox ph for the failure analysis of water distribution pipelines however limited studies have applied survival machine learning algorithms for the failure analysis of water distribution pipelines for example harvey et al 2014 utilized an ann to predict the time to pipe failure neglecting the impact of censoring information nevertheless anns have been extensively used to estimate the number of failures ahn et al 2005 ho et al 2010 jafar et al 2010 nishiyama and filion 2014 tabesh et al 2009 almheiri et al 2020b predicted the first time to pipe failure using ensemble decision trees and an ann using the physical characteristics of water pipes such as length diameter and material winkler et al 2018 classified pipes into failed or not failed using classification based models which could only identify the pipe status other studies predicted the failure rate or time to next failure and neglected the contribution of censored observations during the learning process aydogdu and firat 2015 harvey et al 2014 kutyłowska 2015 sattar et al 2016 li et al 2014 proposed a hierarchical process for sparse incident data of water pipelines and demonstrated its superiority over the cox regression model however the status of water pipes and censoring remains unknown generally most applied machine learning methods in the failure prediction of water pipelines dismiss the impact of censored information during the learning algorithm recently snider and mcbean 2020 applied a gradient boosting ensemble machine learning and statistical model to predict the time to next break of single pipes of cast iron the applied ensemble machine learning algorithms are not programmatically structured to leverage knowledge given the censoring data table 1 summarizes the limitations of developed machine learning methods for the failure time prediction of water distribution pipelines in previous studies maintaining the sustainability of water distribution pipelines is imperative for transporting clean water to consumers and thereby ensuring public health developing a robust machine learning tool is of prime importance for predicting the failure time of water pipelines before their occurrence this method can help water utilities and decision makers mitigate the risk of failure by making rigorous plans for the early replacement of water distribution pipelines however developing a robust model remains challenging because data on water pipe failures are limited in addition most real world data are highly censored so data contain more censored than uncensored observations in this study these limitations are addressed by proposing a new approach named an advanced meta learning paradigm based on deep neural networks for predicting the likelihood of failure at time t of water distribution pipelines previous studies almheiri et al 2020b aydogdu and firat 2015 harvey et al 2014 kutyłowska 2015 snider and mcbean 2020 utilized limited features to predict the failure time of water pipelines table 1 accordingly the proposed model can handle a high dimensional feature space and limited and highly censored data where the failure data of water pipes can be inadequate it can also learn efficiently and rapidly with little exposure to new tasks finn et al 2017 vilalta and drissi 2002 meta learning ml is a field in deep learning that is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent finn et al 2017 for an adequate generalization the proposed approach explicitly learns model parameters with a small number of gradient steps and little exposure to unseen tasks and hence is called a few shot learning approach huisman et al 2021 in addition the contribution of critical factors to the failure of water distribution pipelines was investigated factors such as climatic temperature evaporation precipitation and frost depth road characteristics road type traffic type and the number of lanes and spatial characteristics of water pipes easting northing and rotation were investigated the effects of other factors including chlorine residual and physical pipe characteristics were also examined in addition a new feature named month index is introduced particularly the main objectives of this study are as follows i to investigate the effect of different factors on the service life analysis of water distribution pipelines ii to propose a new ml paradigm based on neural networks in order to predict the risk of failure of water distribution pipelines and aid in the decision making of handling high dimensional limited and censored data and iii to demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust with respect to other statistical methods such as cox ph and machine learning approaches such as random survival forest srf and ssvm the framework of the proposed paradigm for the failure prediction of water distribution pipelines is depicted in fig 1 2 the proposed paradigm in this section the proposed paradigm and the notations used in this study are discussed 2 1 preliminary and problem statement this study predicts the hazard ratio of pipe i that is yet to experience a failure event during the condition monitoring period of water distribution pipelines at time t this concept is known as censoring klein and moeschberger 2006 the inclusion of censored data is essential to avoid biases in the failure analysis of water pipelines censored data are categorized into three groups right censoring left censoring and interval censoring cox and oakes 1984 lee and wang 2003 right censoring occurs when the observed service life is less than or equal to the actual service life by contrast left censoring occurs when the observed service life of a pipe is greater than or equal to its expected service life finally interval censoring occurs within a given interval time note that an actual failure event is unknown in all the three categories this study deals with right censored data where the recorded failure time of a water pipe is less than or equal to its expected service life right censored data were collected from the city of london ontario based on domain experts the expected service life of cast iron pipes is 116 years in comparison the recorded service life from the collected data is less than or equal to 116 years in real life applications right censored data are the most prevalent category marubini and valsecchi 2004 for a given pipe i represented by a triplet x i y i δ i x i r 1 d is the feature vector δ i is the binary failure indicator where 0 and 1 refer to censored and uncensored observations respectively and y i is the service life of pipe i in years which is equal to the observed time for uncensored t i and censored c i pipes as shown in eq 1 t i is a latent observation for censored pipes as they are yet to experience failure during the study period 1 y i t i if δ i 1 c i if δ i 0 this study proposes advanced meta learning advaml an ann based paradigm to predict the risk of failure at time t of a new latent observation t i given the feature predictors denoted by x i the proposed paradigm is an extension of the cox regression katzman et al 2018 in other words the output layer of the ann performs the cox ph model in addition cox ph is linked with hidden layers via activation functions to extract valuable information from the input feature data in addition the independent factors features that describe the likelihood of failure are expected to exponentially influence the service life of the analyzed pipeline system 2 2 mathematical formulations and components of advaml the service life of water distribution pipelines is predicted by sequentially conveying feature input data into two main components feature extraction and cox output feature extraction consists of input and hidden layers hidden neurons in hidden layers leverage knowledge and extract features from feature input data this knowledge is then fed into the cox output which consists of the output neuron that performs cox ph for service life prediction as a hazard function of the features cox 1972 the model parameter β of the cox ph regression is learned by minimizing the cost function which is the negative of the partial log likelihood eq 2 2 l β δ i 1 h i β log y j y i e h j β where l is a loss function that measures the error between the actual and predicted by the function from the hidden layer y i is the observed failure time for each pipe i h i is a function that contains the information extracted from features for pipe i and β is the estimated coefficient weight vector between the features and model output the output of the hidden layer feature extraction can be represented by eq 3 3 h i f φ x i f φ w x i b t where x i is the feature input of pipe i and f φ is a nonlinear function activation function that maps the input data into a lower dimension extracts features and leverages information from the model predictors in this study a rectified linear unit relu was applied as shown in eq 4 goodfellow et al 2016 4 f φ x i m a x i 0 b i w i x w represents the coefficient weight matrix between the input features and hidden layers and b is the bias term for each hidden node φ denotes the parameters of feature extraction including the weights and biases of each hidden neural network layer feature extraction and cox output parameters were jointly modeled during the training learning process and presented as θ the learned parameters θ of the ml method require two optimization phases a meta learner initial learning phase and a final learning phase in the former the model learns a suitable parameter initialization for the final learning phase the model can then be fine tuned and trained quickly and efficiently on a few training tasks during the final learning phase nichol et al 2018 furthermore a first order gradient descent ml algorithm was implemented to train a deep neural network during the meta learner initial learning phase finn et al 2017 nichol et al 2018 during the meta learner initial learning phase the model was randomly initialized with θ to do so n tasks t τ τ 1 2 3 4 n were randomly sampled from the data each task t τ consists of a few shots of training samples a from the training data these samples were derived from a distribution over tasks such as a classification regression or reinforcement problem furthermore the inner optimizer loop utilizes samples of t τ to iteratively update the model parameters corresponding to loss l τ using minibatch stochastic gradient descent sgd θ τ k during the meta learner initial learning phase in other words this study refers to minibatch sgd as the inner loop optimizer of the meta learner initial learning phase furthermore θ τ k is indicated as the parameter operator that updates the parameters θ the k steps of sgd for learning each task t τ are θ τ 0 θ θ τ 1 θ τ 0 η d d θ l τ 0 θ τ 0 5 θ τ 2 θ τ 1 η d d θ l τ 1 θ τ 1 θ τ k θ τ k 1 η d d θ l τ k 1 θ τ k 1 where l τ k 1 is the loss calculated on the previous kth minibatch for learning the task τ for example l τ 3 is the loss calculated on the fourth minibatch sampled from task τ and so on the parameters are updated by the amount η which is called the learning rate it is a configurable hyperparameter tuned during the training learning process of neural networks often in the range 0 1 the iterative learning process in eq 5 is independent of each task using the sgd algorithms for k steps one update is applied across all z τ 1 2 3 4 z tasks with the outer loop optimizer to obtain θ τ k one prevalent optimizer used for the outer loop optimizer of the meta learner initial learning phase is the adam optimizer which can be applied to self adjust the learning rates for each parameter during the learning process kingma and ba 2014 during the outer loop optimization of the meta learner initial learning phase a better initialization of parameter θ eq 6 is obtained 6 θ θ α 1 z τ 1 z θ τ k θ where α is the learning rate of the outer loop optimizer adam optimizer in other words the term α 1 z τ 1 z θ τ k θ refers to the adam gradient algorithm for the meta learner adam s algorithm has been shown to improve model generalization on unseen tasks nichol et al 2018 the inner optimizer sgd and outer optimizer adam loops were updated iteratively until the chosen maximum number of epochs of the meta learner initial learning process is achieved in the final learning phase the initialized model was fine tuned with new unseen training tasks to θ τ m the model was then evaluated using testing data that were selected randomly from new training tasks in addition the learning process during the final learning phase requires an inner optimizer loop without an outer optimizer similar to the initial learning process minibatch sgd algorithms were performed to learn the model parameters following the same iterative procedures for a single task in eq 5 during the final learning phase algorithm 1 and fig 2 summarize the complete procedures of the meta learner initial and final learning phases 3 data collection and cleaning methods pipeline data were collected from the city of london ontario canada 2000 samples the data are censored because some observations are partially observed incomplete meaning that the exact failure time for these observations is unknown these incomplete observations belong to pipes that are yet to experience failure the data comprise eight pipe materials copper asbestos cement polyvinyl chloride pvc concrete ductile iron di steel and cast iron cast iron pvc and di materials represent the highest proportion of the total pipe population 85 therefore these materials were included in the failure analysis we excluded other materials to avoid any bias that may result from imbalanced data the pipe data also consisted of the date of installation date of break diameter mm length m pipe id pipe depth ft number of breaks per pipe frost depth ft chlorine residual mg l spatial characteristics x and y coordinates of each pipe road type traffic type failure type and number of lanes the data contained several mechanical failure types longitudinal split piece blowout pinhole split sleeve longitudinal blowout burn hole circumferential and joint in addition the data consisted of small to large pipe sizes the pipe size mm was in the range 100 600 for the selected materials the proposed approach incorporates climate and seasonal variations for the service life analysis of water pipes accordingly climate data which included three climatic variables i e temperature precipitation and evaporation were collected from the environment and climate change canada these factors are critical for the failure of water distribution pipelines almheiri et al 2020a climate data were estimated using the canadian regional climate model canrcm modeling was performed at 25 and 50 km horizontal spacings over the north american region a sufficient density of climate data could be more accurate in capturing climate signals rauscher et al 2010 therefore climate data were extracted at a 50 km horizontal grid resolution in addition a daily average of three continuous climate variables were collected from canrcm for the study period of 1974 2019 in the city of london ontario moreover missing climate variables were imputed with their mean values afterward the climate and pipe data were combined through the break date of single water pipes in addition data cleaning and preprocessing were applied to validate the quality of the collected data and maximize data accuracy rather than deleting valuable information for the failure analysis data cleaning also involves deep domain expertise to address observations that might be incorrect there are essential steps to ensure that the algorithms can extract and leverage knowledge from the data to achieve this first uninformative data were excluded which is beyond the scope of this study duplicate observations and pipes with missing installation dates were also eliminated to avoid any possible bias in the failure analysis in addition outliers were identified using boxplots missing values were marked and imputed using statistics e g average and median once the data were cleaned the input data were normalized within the range 0 1 using eq 7 where x represents the input data 7 x normalized x x m i n x m a x x m i n furthermore one hot encoding was applied for categorical data to represent data in a numerical and readable format for the learning algorithm process the feature dimension was 34 after preprocessing the data contain spatial and physical characteristics of pipes and environmental and climatic features these features are frost depth ft temperature c evaporation kg m 2 s 1 precipitation kg m 2s 1 chlorine residual mg l 1 pipe length m pipe depth ft pipe diameter mm material road type traffic type number of lanes failure type and spatial characteristics northing easting and rotation in addition the pipe diameter was excluded from our analysis because it contains approximately 50 missing data points table 2 lists the independent factors potentially associated with the model output finally the outcome is the service life length of water pipes in years the service life of water pipes is equal to the difference between the installation date and the most recent break date the data contain 70 of censored data which means that these pipes are yet to experience failure events 4 experimental setup 4 1 architecture of advaml the neural network architecture for advaml consists of fully connected layers the neural network includes four hidden layers one input layer and one output layer the input layer consists of 33 neurons which represent the number of feature dimensions the output layer consists of a single neuron the first second third and fourth hidden layers contain 23 13 9 and 3 hidden neurons respectively initially multiple neural network architectures were proposed and then the optimal architecture was selected see fig 3 in accordance with their predictive performances 4 2 implementations of the baseline models other statistical and machine learning paradigms for failure time prediction were implemented to assess the performance of advaml these methods are ssvm cox ph and srf an svm is considered one of the most common supervised learning models for classification and regression tasks it has also been adapted for survival and failure analysis tasks more details can be found in pölsterl et al 2015 wang et al 2019 an ensemble srf is another survival machine learning method which is a tree based and nonlinear approach goeman 2010 wang et al 2019 it is also a nonparametric method that can be applied to regression and classification tasks wang et al 2019 an ensemble srf can improve the model performance owing to its randomization of feature selection based on the splitting criterion and more details can be found in ishwaran et al 2008 wang et al 2019 in addition the cumulative hazard function chf was calculated for leaf nodes then the chf for pipe i was computed as an average of all the trees in the ensemble cox ph is a semiparametric regularized cox regression based model cox 1972 efron 1977 simon et al 2011 it is a popular approach for predicting failure events and employs the partial log likelihood for parameter estimation katzman et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in this study advaml was developed using python with the extensively used pytorch for deep learning then baseline models were implemented using python with sksurv for the survival and failure analyses 4 3 feature engineering and selection feature selection is of prime importance in identifying the most relevant features of a model target hence improving model performance accordingly critical factors for the failure of water pipes were determined based on literature reviews almheiri et al 2020a b kleiner and rajani 2001 the most relevant features of the model output of advaml were then selected to achieve this goal advaml was designed with no hidden layers a standard cox ph model and the model efficacy was individually tested in accordance with each feature first random samples were drawn from the target data 80 for training and 20 for testing the model efficacy the factors that achieve acceptable to high performances were then selected based on the concordance index c index to develop the final model the minimum threshold value of the mean c index assigned for feature evaluation was 0 35 4 4 data splitting for the initial and final learning process two datasets were randomly selected from the pipe data in our experiment initial training data and target data first the initial training data were used for the initial learning process phase parameter initialization of advaml during this phase the algorithm leverages general knowledge with a few shots of the initial training data until it reaches the initialization stage in addition this stage aims to prepare the model to easily and quickly adapt to unseen tasks to achieve this the model was trained using a few shot samples n 900 of the data where 70 of the data points were censored in addition the target data were divided into training and testing data for the final learning process see fig 1 in this phase the proposed model adapts and learns from task specific knowledge by utilizing a few shots of the target data the model can also be fine tuned using sgd algorithms on a new task during the final learning process by contrast baseline models were directly trained on the target data without explicitly focusing on learning to reach the initialization stage in other words baseline models are based on a direct learning process the efficacy of the methods was tested using a few shots from the target data three learning scenarios were conducted with different sample sizes small n 70 medium n 100 and large n 300 three datasets were randomly selected without replacement from the target data for the training process furthermore the efficacy of each model was tested using 20 of the target testing data these learning scenarios were implemented during the final phase of advaml and the learning process of the baseline models the model generalization was then tested on unseen testing tasks from the target task data see fig 1 finally 25 experimental trials were conducted for each method where each was trained and tested on randomly drawn samples from the target training data and target testing data respectively 4 5 hyperparameter selection the hyperparameter tuning process is a critical step for successful learning algorithms choosing the optimal hyperparameters via the tuning process can improve model generalization and avoid overfitting it also helps maintain the stability of learning algorithms the optimal hyperparameters were selected for the parameter initialization phase and final learning process of the advaml process accordingly a 5 fold cross validation was applied for the hyperparameter selection first five validation sets were randomly extracted from the training data where each group represented 20 of the training data the model was then trained with a given set of hyperparameters the optimal hyperparameters were then selected based on their average performance on the five validation datasets for advaml the hyperparameters of the inner and outer loop optimizers were tuned during the initial learning process minibatch sgd and adam in addition in the final learning phase the hyperparameters of the minibatch sgd were investigated a grid search method was implemented where a set of values was chosen for each hyperparameter the average model performance was tested based on these sets of values to select the optimal hyperparameter the hyperparameters for the sgd optimizer are the learning rate gradient steps batch shot size and regularization scale l2 the hyperparameters for the adam optimizer are the learning rate and shot size in the initial phase the learning rate was selected to be within the ranges 0 0001 0 001 0 01 0 1 0 3 0 003 and 0 00001 0 0001 0 001 0 01 0 005 0 0003 for minibatch sgd and adam respectively different batch sizes of 25 50 100 150 200 250 500 and 700 were assigned to the minibatch sgd and adam optimizers the optimal regularization scale was also investigated using a grid search of 0 0001 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 for the sgd optimizer in addition the sgd optimizer performance was tested on a grid search of 3 5 10 13 15 20 for gradient steps likewise the optimal hyperparameters for the minibatch sgd optimizer were explored during the final learning process the same hyperparameter values were selected for the sgd optimizer as that used during the initial learning phase the hyperparameters chosen for the initial and final ml processes are listed in table 3 in addition the optimal parameters for the baseline models were examined using a grid search method for the ssvm linear and rank based ssvms were implemented to map the relationships between features and the service life in the latter phase the algorithms assign a low rank with a short service life by considering all possible combinations of training data in other words pipes with a shorter service life will be ranked before those with a longer service life pölsterl et al 2015 the hyperparameters of the ssvm and cox ph baseline models are the regularization scale ridge regression penalty alpha and the maximum number of iterations max iter to search for the optimal solution of ssvm and cox ph a 5 fold cross validation was performed to tune the regularization scale alpha and choose the maximum number of iterations max iter on a grid search of 0 001 0 01 0 25 0 5 0 1 and 100 150 200 300 respectively for srf the model was designed based on the bootstrap technique breiman 1996 the hyperparameters were tuned for srf namely maximum depth max depth minimum sample leaf min samples leaf minimum sample split min samples split and number of estimators n estimators on a grid search of 100 110 120 3 4 5 8 10 12 and 200 300 1000 respectively the hyperparameters selected for the baseline models are listed in table 3 4 6 model evaluation the efficacy of the prediction models was evaluated using the common evaluation metric c index wang et al 2019 the c index measures the model accuracy in the service life and failure analysis the service lives of the two data points can be ordered in two scenarios first the observed service lives are uncensored second the observed service life of the uncensored observation is shorter than that of the censored observation steck et al 2008 essentially a censored observation can only be compared with a previous uncensored observation the c index is calculated using the following wang et al 2019 8 c index 1 v i δ i 1 j y i y j i s y j x j s y i x i where i j 1 n v refers to the number of all comparable pairs i is the indicator function y 1 y 1 and y 2 y 2 where y i and y i represent the true and predicted values respectively and s refers to the estimated value a c index value greater than 0 8 indicates a strong prediction and a value of 0 5 indicates a random prediction 5 results the results of feature engineering reveal that all features contribute to the failure analysis of water pipelines in other words the model achieved its best performance when all pipe features were included during the learning process the features that contribute from the highest to lowest based on the mean c index 95 confidence interval ci are as follows number of lanes 0 654 0 13 chlorine residual 0 632 0 07 spatial characteristics of water pipes 0 624 0 07 road type 0 615 0 08 traffic type 0 614 0 07 failure type 0 592 0 10 month index 0 576 0 12 evaporation 0 571 0 12 precipitation 0 478 0 12 temperature 0 467 0 13 number of breaks 0 454 0 16 depth 0 453 0 05 frost depth 0 40 0 12 and length 0 40 0 13 as depicted in fig 4 the results prove that all selected features provide insightful information for the service life analysis of water pipes therefore all features are included in the prediction and learning processes for the advaml and baseline models i e cox ph ssvm and srf furthermore the failure type and road type contribute similarly to the failure analysis fig 4 evaporation and precipitation also achieved a comparable c index when predicting the service life of water pipes fig 4 fig 5 depicts the contribution percentage of each feature to the model output based on the mean c index indicating that the highest contribution is accomplished by the number of lanes and chlorine residual in addition the lowest contribution is achieved by the frost depth and pipe length however the results demonstrate that all features contribute to the prediction of service life four methods advaml cox ph ssvm and srf were compared using 20 samples drawn from the target testing data for each learning scenario in other words these methods are trained on the target training data used for the cross validation process and evaluated using 20 of the unseen target testing data fig 6 depicts the c index performance of the target training and target testing for the proposed model advaml and baseline models cox ph srf and ssvm across 25 iterations the mean c index for advaml is 0 80 0 8 0 06 95 ci for the small learning scenario n 70 the mean c index for cox ph and srf is 0 69 0 69 0 07 95 ci and 0 70 0 70 0 16 95 ci respectively cox ph and srf achieved a similar performance during the small learning scenario whereas the mean c index for ssvm is 0 62 0 62 0 16 95 ci the results prove that advaml outperformed cox ph ssvm and srf for the small learning scenario figs 6 and 7 in addition ssvm achieved the lowest performance during the small learning scenario n 70 therefore advaml achieved a competitive performance on small tasks compared to the baseline models particularly the variance result across the 25 random experimental trials tended to be the smallest for advaml figs 6 and 7 during the medium learning scenario n 100 advaml outperformed cox ph ssvm and srf the mean c index is 0 85 0 85 0 08 95 ci for advaml and 0 71 0 71 0 03 95 ci for cox ph furthermore the mean c index for ssvm and srf is 0 77 0 77 0 13 95 ci and 0 72 0 72 0 16 95 ci respectively fig 7 thus the ssvm outperformed cox ph and srf on the medium tasks in addition the variance results across the 25 random experimental trials tended to be the highest for srf figs 6 and 7 advaml and ssvm achieved a c index of 0 87 0 87 0 02 95 ci and 0 87 0 87 0 03 95 ci during the large learning scenario n 300 respectively the mean c index was the same for both methods however the variance across the 25 random experimental trials tended to be smaller for advaml than for ssvm furthermore cox ph achieved a mean c index of 0 85 0 85 0 05 95 ci which is comparable to the efficacy of advaml and ssvm conversely srf achieved a mean c index of 0 78 0 78 0 01 95 ci the results revealed that advaml and srf achieved the lowest variance across the 25 random experimental trials figs 6 and 7 advaml exhibited a competitive performance as compared to cox ph ssvm and srf during the small and medium learning scenarios whereas advaml and ssvm achieved a comparable performance when large shots of target data were used however the variance results across the 25 random experimental trials tended to be smaller for advaml the ssvm was superior to cox ph and srf during the medium and large learning processes fig 7 furthermore although the outputs of advaml and cox ph were the log hazard ratios for each pipe advaml was superior to cox ph in all learning scenarios in summary the results investigated essential factors for the failure time prediction of water distribution pipelines researchers and decision makers can rely on these factors when modeling the failure of water pipes compared to previous studies almheiri et al 2020b harvey et al 2014 sattar et al 2016 snider and mcbean 2020 the proposed methodological approach could leverage information with limited exposure to the training tasks and high censored data therefore the proposed method can be applied to any water distribution network to predict the failure risk of water pipes before failure occurrence and avoid catastrophic consequences including floods and the loss of clean drinking water the proposed model can also help decision makers to develop an optimal management strategy for pipe replacement 6 discussion this study proposes an advaml ann based model for the service life analysis of water distribution pipelines deep learning can achieve superior performance as compared to other machine learning methods e g cox ph ssvm and srf particularly for high dimensional it should be high dimentional data however one challenge in applying deep learning in this area is that pipe failure data are limited to overcome these challenges advaml is proposed which is an ann based method combined with an ml process to predict the hazard ratio of water pipes the proposed paradigm was also compared to other approaches namely cox ph ssvm and srf when small to large shots of samples are picked from the target data during the learning process the performance of cox ph ssvm and srf decreased as the size of the training shots decreased however the efficacy of advaml remained stable when small and medium shots of the target data were used in other words advaml performs well when a small amount of training data is used because knowledge transfers from the initial parameterization phase to the final learning process furthermore srf and ssvm achieved the highest variance across the 25 random experimental trials during the small and medium learning scenarios figs 6 and 7 the variance then remarkably decreased by utilizing a large number of training samples in scenario 3 the results show that advaml outperforms the baseline methods when small and medium shots of the target training data are used figs 6 and 7 in addition advaml and ssvm achieved a comparable performance when large sample shots of the target data were used however the variance across the 25 random experimental trials tended to be slightly smaller for advaml the variance of srf remarkably decreased when large sample shots of the training data were used fig 7 the proposed approach comprises two learning phases as compared to the baseline methods this feature allows the algorithms to efficiently adapt to a few new tasks and generalize better than the baseline methods because of the optimization setting environment the ml setting also enables the automatic discovery of the climatic environmental spatial and physical features of water pipes in addition the hidden nodes in advaml capture distinctive patterns and map features onto lower dimensions via activation functions e g relu therefore our approach provides more information than the baseline models in particular advaml depends on the initial training data used for parameter initialization during the meta learner initial learning phase therefore the knowledge transferred from the initial training data phase to the final learning phase of the target data supports the performance of advaml in this study the challenges in the failure prediction of water pipes within water pipelines were evaluated the first challenge is designing a robust and effective machine learning tool for insufficient training data another challenge is creating a tool for data with a large number of censored data points these challenges were addressed through an ml approach that effectively and quickly learns a few shots of the target training tasks in the context of limited training data the proposed paradigm is superior to other methods cox ph ssvm and srf in terms of efficacy finally advaml achieved comparable results to the ssvm during the large learning scenario the results also prove that ml can uncover the features associated with the service life and implicitly prioritizes pipes in accordance with their contribution to the prediction task nonetheless the small and partially observed data could be a limiting factor and challenge in the reliability analysis of water pipes especially when data collection is expensive the proposed approach shows a promising advaml approach for civil engineering decision making as regards the service life analysis of water distribution pipelines when data are limited finally table 4 depicts the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach and the baseline methods it is worth mentioning that the performance of these machine learning approaches relies on the quality of training tasks and the selection of appropriate algorithms 7 conclusions this study discovered that chlorine residual and the number of lanes are the most critical factors followed by road type spatial characteristics month index evaporation traffic and failure type precipitation temperature number of breaks and pipe depth by contrast frost depth and pipe length are the least critical factors in the failure analysis based on the model efficacy c index the proposed ml paradigm based on deep anns can leverage and uncover information pertinent to the failure process of water distribution pipelines with unseen few shot tasks in addition it can predict the likelihood of failure of water distribution pipelines in terms of the hazard ratio it is also flexible to incomplete limited and heavily censored data the proposed paradigm can help water utilities and decision makers mitigate the risk of failure by labeling pipes that require immediate repair within a water distribution network further investigation into how different neural network architectures impact the performance of advaml is needed in addition the capability of advaml to handle missing data will be examined because the data received from water utilities usually contain high missing data points finally a reliable technique for data imputation can also be helpful for the failure data of water distribution pipelines because excluding missing data can lead to the loss of insightful information about the failure

16601,population growth and urbanization worldwide entail the need for continuous renewal plans for urban water distribution networks hence understanding the long term performance and predicting the service life of water pipelines are essential for facilitating early replacement avoiding economic losses and ensuring safe transportation of drinking water from treatment plants to consumers however developing a suitable model that can be used for cases where data are insufficient or incomplete remains challenging herein a new advanced meta learning paradigm based on deep neural networks is introduced the developed model is used to predict the risk index of pipe failure the effects of different factors that are considered essential for the deterioration modeling of water pipelines are first examined the factors include seasonal climatic variation chlorine content traffic conditions pipe material and the spatial characteristics of water pipes the results suggest that these factors contribute to estimating the likelihood of failure in water distribution pipelines the presence of chlorine residual and the number of traffic lanes are the most critical factors followed by road type spatial characteristics month index traffic type precipitation temperature number of breaks and pipe depth the proposed approach can accommodate limited high dimensional and partially observed data and can be applied to any water distribution system graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords water pipelines essential factors failure meta learning 1 introduction and motivation urban water distribution networks are critical infrastructures as they provide essential services that supply water to different areas such critical infrastructures can also lead to harmful and social impacts including floods and the loss of clean drinking water almheiri et al 2020a husband and boxall 2011 shortridge and guikema 2014 the global investment in water distribution networks is noticeably high furthermore tools based on machine learning are promising as they mitigate the risk of failure by predicting the expected failure time of pipes within a water distribution network prior to their occurrence however it is challenging to accurately predict the time to failure of water pipes this task is also known as survival analysis in medical research survival analysis is challenging because some observation outcomes are censored and do not involve any failure events during the condition monitoring period borenstein et al 2009 the failure time can be unmonitored due to missing traces caused by other events klein and moeschberger 2006 the prediction of service life or failure time can be conducted using standard statistical approaches and machine learning methods standard statistical methods focus on approximating failure curves to characterize the distributions of failure times and the statistical properties of parameter estimation meanwhile machine learning approaches combine the power of conventional statistical methods and various algorithms for predicting the failure time of an event furthermore machine learning algorithms can handle high dimensional data and learn complex relationships better as compared to standard statistical approaches statistical methods can be applied using fully parametric semiparametric and nonparametric approaches however the semiparametric cox proportional hazards cox ph method remains the most prevalent and extensively employed approach for failure analyses huber carol et al 2019 in contrast to other methods cox ph applies a partial likelihood for parameter estimation although this approach is regression based the distribution of outcomes remains unknown cox 1972 machine learning algorithms such as neural networks survival trees and support vector machines svms have gained a marked prominence in survival analyses because of their ability to capture nonlinear relationships and handle high dimensional data adeli 2001 adeli and panakkat 2009 dharia and adeli 2003 panakkat and adeli 2009 however modeling censored data using machine learning remains a challenging task wang et al 2019 furthermore artificial neural networks anns have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in survival analyses in several application domains wang et al 2019 anns comprise artificial neurons that form a network structure by connecting neurons via a weighted link adeli 2001 researchers can employ survival trees for failure analyses as they are programmatically structured to handle censored data wang et al 2019 in survival trees data are recursively partitioned into small regions nodes that contain observations with homogenous survival outcomes based on a splitting criterion safavian and landgrebe 1991 in contrast to standard decision trees survival trees consider the interactions between features and censored information using a tree structure however the performance of ensemble methods such as random forests can surpass that of a single tree breiman 2001 svms are robust supervised learning algorithms for labeled regression and classification tasks however the model output consists of labeled and unlabeled observations in the failure analysis of water pipelines to cope with these challenges a survival svm ssvm has been proposed as a regression and rank based model regression based models predict the log service life by contrast rank based models assign a low rank for a short service life considering all possible pairwise training data to optimize the hinge loss function pölsterl et al 2015 conventional statistical methods have been extensively applied in the failure analysis of water pipelines for example stochastic modeling such as weibull proportional hazards wph has been used for the reliability analysis of water pipes to estimate the failure curve with input explanatory variables the failure curve indicates that the probability of a failure event exceeding a limit state within a defined reference period alvisi and franchini 2010 kimutai et al 2015 le gat and eisenbeis 2000 malm et al 2012 scheidegger et al 2013 vanrenterghem raven et al 2003 previous studies christodoulou 2011 clark et al 2010 debón et al 2010 kimutai et al 2015 park et al 2011 vanrenterghem raven et al 2003 also applied cox ph for the failure analysis of water distribution pipelines however limited studies have applied survival machine learning algorithms for the failure analysis of water distribution pipelines for example harvey et al 2014 utilized an ann to predict the time to pipe failure neglecting the impact of censoring information nevertheless anns have been extensively used to estimate the number of failures ahn et al 2005 ho et al 2010 jafar et al 2010 nishiyama and filion 2014 tabesh et al 2009 almheiri et al 2020b predicted the first time to pipe failure using ensemble decision trees and an ann using the physical characteristics of water pipes such as length diameter and material winkler et al 2018 classified pipes into failed or not failed using classification based models which could only identify the pipe status other studies predicted the failure rate or time to next failure and neglected the contribution of censored observations during the learning process aydogdu and firat 2015 harvey et al 2014 kutyłowska 2015 sattar et al 2016 li et al 2014 proposed a hierarchical process for sparse incident data of water pipelines and demonstrated its superiority over the cox regression model however the status of water pipes and censoring remains unknown generally most applied machine learning methods in the failure prediction of water pipelines dismiss the impact of censored information during the learning algorithm recently snider and mcbean 2020 applied a gradient boosting ensemble machine learning and statistical model to predict the time to next break of single pipes of cast iron the applied ensemble machine learning algorithms are not programmatically structured to leverage knowledge given the censoring data table 1 summarizes the limitations of developed machine learning methods for the failure time prediction of water distribution pipelines in previous studies maintaining the sustainability of water distribution pipelines is imperative for transporting clean water to consumers and thereby ensuring public health developing a robust machine learning tool is of prime importance for predicting the failure time of water pipelines before their occurrence this method can help water utilities and decision makers mitigate the risk of failure by making rigorous plans for the early replacement of water distribution pipelines however developing a robust model remains challenging because data on water pipe failures are limited in addition most real world data are highly censored so data contain more censored than uncensored observations in this study these limitations are addressed by proposing a new approach named an advanced meta learning paradigm based on deep neural networks for predicting the likelihood of failure at time t of water distribution pipelines previous studies almheiri et al 2020b aydogdu and firat 2015 harvey et al 2014 kutyłowska 2015 snider and mcbean 2020 utilized limited features to predict the failure time of water pipelines table 1 accordingly the proposed model can handle a high dimensional feature space and limited and highly censored data where the failure data of water pipes can be inadequate it can also learn efficiently and rapidly with little exposure to new tasks finn et al 2017 vilalta and drissi 2002 meta learning ml is a field in deep learning that is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent finn et al 2017 for an adequate generalization the proposed approach explicitly learns model parameters with a small number of gradient steps and little exposure to unseen tasks and hence is called a few shot learning approach huisman et al 2021 in addition the contribution of critical factors to the failure of water distribution pipelines was investigated factors such as climatic temperature evaporation precipitation and frost depth road characteristics road type traffic type and the number of lanes and spatial characteristics of water pipes easting northing and rotation were investigated the effects of other factors including chlorine residual and physical pipe characteristics were also examined in addition a new feature named month index is introduced particularly the main objectives of this study are as follows i to investigate the effect of different factors on the service life analysis of water distribution pipelines ii to propose a new ml paradigm based on neural networks in order to predict the risk of failure of water distribution pipelines and aid in the decision making of handling high dimensional limited and censored data and iii to demonstrate that the proposed approach is robust with respect to other statistical methods such as cox ph and machine learning approaches such as random survival forest srf and ssvm the framework of the proposed paradigm for the failure prediction of water distribution pipelines is depicted in fig 1 2 the proposed paradigm in this section the proposed paradigm and the notations used in this study are discussed 2 1 preliminary and problem statement this study predicts the hazard ratio of pipe i that is yet to experience a failure event during the condition monitoring period of water distribution pipelines at time t this concept is known as censoring klein and moeschberger 2006 the inclusion of censored data is essential to avoid biases in the failure analysis of water pipelines censored data are categorized into three groups right censoring left censoring and interval censoring cox and oakes 1984 lee and wang 2003 right censoring occurs when the observed service life is less than or equal to the actual service life by contrast left censoring occurs when the observed service life of a pipe is greater than or equal to its expected service life finally interval censoring occurs within a given interval time note that an actual failure event is unknown in all the three categories this study deals with right censored data where the recorded failure time of a water pipe is less than or equal to its expected service life right censored data were collected from the city of london ontario based on domain experts the expected service life of cast iron pipes is 116 years in comparison the recorded service life from the collected data is less than or equal to 116 years in real life applications right censored data are the most prevalent category marubini and valsecchi 2004 for a given pipe i represented by a triplet x i y i δ i x i r 1 d is the feature vector δ i is the binary failure indicator where 0 and 1 refer to censored and uncensored observations respectively and y i is the service life of pipe i in years which is equal to the observed time for uncensored t i and censored c i pipes as shown in eq 1 t i is a latent observation for censored pipes as they are yet to experience failure during the study period 1 y i t i if δ i 1 c i if δ i 0 this study proposes advanced meta learning advaml an ann based paradigm to predict the risk of failure at time t of a new latent observation t i given the feature predictors denoted by x i the proposed paradigm is an extension of the cox regression katzman et al 2018 in other words the output layer of the ann performs the cox ph model in addition cox ph is linked with hidden layers via activation functions to extract valuable information from the input feature data in addition the independent factors features that describe the likelihood of failure are expected to exponentially influence the service life of the analyzed pipeline system 2 2 mathematical formulations and components of advaml the service life of water distribution pipelines is predicted by sequentially conveying feature input data into two main components feature extraction and cox output feature extraction consists of input and hidden layers hidden neurons in hidden layers leverage knowledge and extract features from feature input data this knowledge is then fed into the cox output which consists of the output neuron that performs cox ph for service life prediction as a hazard function of the features cox 1972 the model parameter β of the cox ph regression is learned by minimizing the cost function which is the negative of the partial log likelihood eq 2 2 l β δ i 1 h i β log y j y i e h j β where l is a loss function that measures the error between the actual and predicted by the function from the hidden layer y i is the observed failure time for each pipe i h i is a function that contains the information extracted from features for pipe i and β is the estimated coefficient weight vector between the features and model output the output of the hidden layer feature extraction can be represented by eq 3 3 h i f φ x i f φ w x i b t where x i is the feature input of pipe i and f φ is a nonlinear function activation function that maps the input data into a lower dimension extracts features and leverages information from the model predictors in this study a rectified linear unit relu was applied as shown in eq 4 goodfellow et al 2016 4 f φ x i m a x i 0 b i w i x w represents the coefficient weight matrix between the input features and hidden layers and b is the bias term for each hidden node φ denotes the parameters of feature extraction including the weights and biases of each hidden neural network layer feature extraction and cox output parameters were jointly modeled during the training learning process and presented as θ the learned parameters θ of the ml method require two optimization phases a meta learner initial learning phase and a final learning phase in the former the model learns a suitable parameter initialization for the final learning phase the model can then be fine tuned and trained quickly and efficiently on a few training tasks during the final learning phase nichol et al 2018 furthermore a first order gradient descent ml algorithm was implemented to train a deep neural network during the meta learner initial learning phase finn et al 2017 nichol et al 2018 during the meta learner initial learning phase the model was randomly initialized with θ to do so n tasks t τ τ 1 2 3 4 n were randomly sampled from the data each task t τ consists of a few shots of training samples a from the training data these samples were derived from a distribution over tasks such as a classification regression or reinforcement problem furthermore the inner optimizer loop utilizes samples of t τ to iteratively update the model parameters corresponding to loss l τ using minibatch stochastic gradient descent sgd θ τ k during the meta learner initial learning phase in other words this study refers to minibatch sgd as the inner loop optimizer of the meta learner initial learning phase furthermore θ τ k is indicated as the parameter operator that updates the parameters θ the k steps of sgd for learning each task t τ are θ τ 0 θ θ τ 1 θ τ 0 η d d θ l τ 0 θ τ 0 5 θ τ 2 θ τ 1 η d d θ l τ 1 θ τ 1 θ τ k θ τ k 1 η d d θ l τ k 1 θ τ k 1 where l τ k 1 is the loss calculated on the previous kth minibatch for learning the task τ for example l τ 3 is the loss calculated on the fourth minibatch sampled from task τ and so on the parameters are updated by the amount η which is called the learning rate it is a configurable hyperparameter tuned during the training learning process of neural networks often in the range 0 1 the iterative learning process in eq 5 is independent of each task using the sgd algorithms for k steps one update is applied across all z τ 1 2 3 4 z tasks with the outer loop optimizer to obtain θ τ k one prevalent optimizer used for the outer loop optimizer of the meta learner initial learning phase is the adam optimizer which can be applied to self adjust the learning rates for each parameter during the learning process kingma and ba 2014 during the outer loop optimization of the meta learner initial learning phase a better initialization of parameter θ eq 6 is obtained 6 θ θ α 1 z τ 1 z θ τ k θ where α is the learning rate of the outer loop optimizer adam optimizer in other words the term α 1 z τ 1 z θ τ k θ refers to the adam gradient algorithm for the meta learner adam s algorithm has been shown to improve model generalization on unseen tasks nichol et al 2018 the inner optimizer sgd and outer optimizer adam loops were updated iteratively until the chosen maximum number of epochs of the meta learner initial learning process is achieved in the final learning phase the initialized model was fine tuned with new unseen training tasks to θ τ m the model was then evaluated using testing data that were selected randomly from new training tasks in addition the learning process during the final learning phase requires an inner optimizer loop without an outer optimizer similar to the initial learning process minibatch sgd algorithms were performed to learn the model parameters following the same iterative procedures for a single task in eq 5 during the final learning phase algorithm 1 and fig 2 summarize the complete procedures of the meta learner initial and final learning phases 3 data collection and cleaning methods pipeline data were collected from the city of london ontario canada 2000 samples the data are censored because some observations are partially observed incomplete meaning that the exact failure time for these observations is unknown these incomplete observations belong to pipes that are yet to experience failure the data comprise eight pipe materials copper asbestos cement polyvinyl chloride pvc concrete ductile iron di steel and cast iron cast iron pvc and di materials represent the highest proportion of the total pipe population 85 therefore these materials were included in the failure analysis we excluded other materials to avoid any bias that may result from imbalanced data the pipe data also consisted of the date of installation date of break diameter mm length m pipe id pipe depth ft number of breaks per pipe frost depth ft chlorine residual mg l spatial characteristics x and y coordinates of each pipe road type traffic type failure type and number of lanes the data contained several mechanical failure types longitudinal split piece blowout pinhole split sleeve longitudinal blowout burn hole circumferential and joint in addition the data consisted of small to large pipe sizes the pipe size mm was in the range 100 600 for the selected materials the proposed approach incorporates climate and seasonal variations for the service life analysis of water pipes accordingly climate data which included three climatic variables i e temperature precipitation and evaporation were collected from the environment and climate change canada these factors are critical for the failure of water distribution pipelines almheiri et al 2020a climate data were estimated using the canadian regional climate model canrcm modeling was performed at 25 and 50 km horizontal spacings over the north american region a sufficient density of climate data could be more accurate in capturing climate signals rauscher et al 2010 therefore climate data were extracted at a 50 km horizontal grid resolution in addition a daily average of three continuous climate variables were collected from canrcm for the study period of 1974 2019 in the city of london ontario moreover missing climate variables were imputed with their mean values afterward the climate and pipe data were combined through the break date of single water pipes in addition data cleaning and preprocessing were applied to validate the quality of the collected data and maximize data accuracy rather than deleting valuable information for the failure analysis data cleaning also involves deep domain expertise to address observations that might be incorrect there are essential steps to ensure that the algorithms can extract and leverage knowledge from the data to achieve this first uninformative data were excluded which is beyond the scope of this study duplicate observations and pipes with missing installation dates were also eliminated to avoid any possible bias in the failure analysis in addition outliers were identified using boxplots missing values were marked and imputed using statistics e g average and median once the data were cleaned the input data were normalized within the range 0 1 using eq 7 where x represents the input data 7 x normalized x x m i n x m a x x m i n furthermore one hot encoding was applied for categorical data to represent data in a numerical and readable format for the learning algorithm process the feature dimension was 34 after preprocessing the data contain spatial and physical characteristics of pipes and environmental and climatic features these features are frost depth ft temperature c evaporation kg m 2 s 1 precipitation kg m 2s 1 chlorine residual mg l 1 pipe length m pipe depth ft pipe diameter mm material road type traffic type number of lanes failure type and spatial characteristics northing easting and rotation in addition the pipe diameter was excluded from our analysis because it contains approximately 50 missing data points table 2 lists the independent factors potentially associated with the model output finally the outcome is the service life length of water pipes in years the service life of water pipes is equal to the difference between the installation date and the most recent break date the data contain 70 of censored data which means that these pipes are yet to experience failure events 4 experimental setup 4 1 architecture of advaml the neural network architecture for advaml consists of fully connected layers the neural network includes four hidden layers one input layer and one output layer the input layer consists of 33 neurons which represent the number of feature dimensions the output layer consists of a single neuron the first second third and fourth hidden layers contain 23 13 9 and 3 hidden neurons respectively initially multiple neural network architectures were proposed and then the optimal architecture was selected see fig 3 in accordance with their predictive performances 4 2 implementations of the baseline models other statistical and machine learning paradigms for failure time prediction were implemented to assess the performance of advaml these methods are ssvm cox ph and srf an svm is considered one of the most common supervised learning models for classification and regression tasks it has also been adapted for survival and failure analysis tasks more details can be found in pölsterl et al 2015 wang et al 2019 an ensemble srf is another survival machine learning method which is a tree based and nonlinear approach goeman 2010 wang et al 2019 it is also a nonparametric method that can be applied to regression and classification tasks wang et al 2019 an ensemble srf can improve the model performance owing to its randomization of feature selection based on the splitting criterion and more details can be found in ishwaran et al 2008 wang et al 2019 in addition the cumulative hazard function chf was calculated for leaf nodes then the chf for pipe i was computed as an average of all the trees in the ensemble cox ph is a semiparametric regularized cox regression based model cox 1972 efron 1977 simon et al 2011 it is a popular approach for predicting failure events and employs the partial log likelihood for parameter estimation katzman et al 2018 wang et al 2019 in this study advaml was developed using python with the extensively used pytorch for deep learning then baseline models were implemented using python with sksurv for the survival and failure analyses 4 3 feature engineering and selection feature selection is of prime importance in identifying the most relevant features of a model target hence improving model performance accordingly critical factors for the failure of water pipes were determined based on literature reviews almheiri et al 2020a b kleiner and rajani 2001 the most relevant features of the model output of advaml were then selected to achieve this goal advaml was designed with no hidden layers a standard cox ph model and the model efficacy was individually tested in accordance with each feature first random samples were drawn from the target data 80 for training and 20 for testing the model efficacy the factors that achieve acceptable to high performances were then selected based on the concordance index c index to develop the final model the minimum threshold value of the mean c index assigned for feature evaluation was 0 35 4 4 data splitting for the initial and final learning process two datasets were randomly selected from the pipe data in our experiment initial training data and target data first the initial training data were used for the initial learning process phase parameter initialization of advaml during this phase the algorithm leverages general knowledge with a few shots of the initial training data until it reaches the initialization stage in addition this stage aims to prepare the model to easily and quickly adapt to unseen tasks to achieve this the model was trained using a few shot samples n 900 of the data where 70 of the data points were censored in addition the target data were divided into training and testing data for the final learning process see fig 1 in this phase the proposed model adapts and learns from task specific knowledge by utilizing a few shots of the target data the model can also be fine tuned using sgd algorithms on a new task during the final learning process by contrast baseline models were directly trained on the target data without explicitly focusing on learning to reach the initialization stage in other words baseline models are based on a direct learning process the efficacy of the methods was tested using a few shots from the target data three learning scenarios were conducted with different sample sizes small n 70 medium n 100 and large n 300 three datasets were randomly selected without replacement from the target data for the training process furthermore the efficacy of each model was tested using 20 of the target testing data these learning scenarios were implemented during the final phase of advaml and the learning process of the baseline models the model generalization was then tested on unseen testing tasks from the target task data see fig 1 finally 25 experimental trials were conducted for each method where each was trained and tested on randomly drawn samples from the target training data and target testing data respectively 4 5 hyperparameter selection the hyperparameter tuning process is a critical step for successful learning algorithms choosing the optimal hyperparameters via the tuning process can improve model generalization and avoid overfitting it also helps maintain the stability of learning algorithms the optimal hyperparameters were selected for the parameter initialization phase and final learning process of the advaml process accordingly a 5 fold cross validation was applied for the hyperparameter selection first five validation sets were randomly extracted from the training data where each group represented 20 of the training data the model was then trained with a given set of hyperparameters the optimal hyperparameters were then selected based on their average performance on the five validation datasets for advaml the hyperparameters of the inner and outer loop optimizers were tuned during the initial learning process minibatch sgd and adam in addition in the final learning phase the hyperparameters of the minibatch sgd were investigated a grid search method was implemented where a set of values was chosen for each hyperparameter the average model performance was tested based on these sets of values to select the optimal hyperparameter the hyperparameters for the sgd optimizer are the learning rate gradient steps batch shot size and regularization scale l2 the hyperparameters for the adam optimizer are the learning rate and shot size in the initial phase the learning rate was selected to be within the ranges 0 0001 0 001 0 01 0 1 0 3 0 003 and 0 00001 0 0001 0 001 0 01 0 005 0 0003 for minibatch sgd and adam respectively different batch sizes of 25 50 100 150 200 250 500 and 700 were assigned to the minibatch sgd and adam optimizers the optimal regularization scale was also investigated using a grid search of 0 0001 0 001 0 01 and 0 1 for the sgd optimizer in addition the sgd optimizer performance was tested on a grid search of 3 5 10 13 15 20 for gradient steps likewise the optimal hyperparameters for the minibatch sgd optimizer were explored during the final learning process the same hyperparameter values were selected for the sgd optimizer as that used during the initial learning phase the hyperparameters chosen for the initial and final ml processes are listed in table 3 in addition the optimal parameters for the baseline models were examined using a grid search method for the ssvm linear and rank based ssvms were implemented to map the relationships between features and the service life in the latter phase the algorithms assign a low rank with a short service life by considering all possible combinations of training data in other words pipes with a shorter service life will be ranked before those with a longer service life pölsterl et al 2015 the hyperparameters of the ssvm and cox ph baseline models are the regularization scale ridge regression penalty alpha and the maximum number of iterations max iter to search for the optimal solution of ssvm and cox ph a 5 fold cross validation was performed to tune the regularization scale alpha and choose the maximum number of iterations max iter on a grid search of 0 001 0 01 0 25 0 5 0 1 and 100 150 200 300 respectively for srf the model was designed based on the bootstrap technique breiman 1996 the hyperparameters were tuned for srf namely maximum depth max depth minimum sample leaf min samples leaf minimum sample split min samples split and number of estimators n estimators on a grid search of 100 110 120 3 4 5 8 10 12 and 200 300 1000 respectively the hyperparameters selected for the baseline models are listed in table 3 4 6 model evaluation the efficacy of the prediction models was evaluated using the common evaluation metric c index wang et al 2019 the c index measures the model accuracy in the service life and failure analysis the service lives of the two data points can be ordered in two scenarios first the observed service lives are uncensored second the observed service life of the uncensored observation is shorter than that of the censored observation steck et al 2008 essentially a censored observation can only be compared with a previous uncensored observation the c index is calculated using the following wang et al 2019 8 c index 1 v i δ i 1 j y i y j i s y j x j s y i x i where i j 1 n v refers to the number of all comparable pairs i is the indicator function y 1 y 1 and y 2 y 2 where y i and y i represent the true and predicted values respectively and s refers to the estimated value a c index value greater than 0 8 indicates a strong prediction and a value of 0 5 indicates a random prediction 5 results the results of feature engineering reveal that all features contribute to the failure analysis of water pipelines in other words the model achieved its best performance when all pipe features were included during the learning process the features that contribute from the highest to lowest based on the mean c index 95 confidence interval ci are as follows number of lanes 0 654 0 13 chlorine residual 0 632 0 07 spatial characteristics of water pipes 0 624 0 07 road type 0 615 0 08 traffic type 0 614 0 07 failure type 0 592 0 10 month index 0 576 0 12 evaporation 0 571 0 12 precipitation 0 478 0 12 temperature 0 467 0 13 number of breaks 0 454 0 16 depth 0 453 0 05 frost depth 0 40 0 12 and length 0 40 0 13 as depicted in fig 4 the results prove that all selected features provide insightful information for the service life analysis of water pipes therefore all features are included in the prediction and learning processes for the advaml and baseline models i e cox ph ssvm and srf furthermore the failure type and road type contribute similarly to the failure analysis fig 4 evaporation and precipitation also achieved a comparable c index when predicting the service life of water pipes fig 4 fig 5 depicts the contribution percentage of each feature to the model output based on the mean c index indicating that the highest contribution is accomplished by the number of lanes and chlorine residual in addition the lowest contribution is achieved by the frost depth and pipe length however the results demonstrate that all features contribute to the prediction of service life four methods advaml cox ph ssvm and srf were compared using 20 samples drawn from the target testing data for each learning scenario in other words these methods are trained on the target training data used for the cross validation process and evaluated using 20 of the unseen target testing data fig 6 depicts the c index performance of the target training and target testing for the proposed model advaml and baseline models cox ph srf and ssvm across 25 iterations the mean c index for advaml is 0 80 0 8 0 06 95 ci for the small learning scenario n 70 the mean c index for cox ph and srf is 0 69 0 69 0 07 95 ci and 0 70 0 70 0 16 95 ci respectively cox ph and srf achieved a similar performance during the small learning scenario whereas the mean c index for ssvm is 0 62 0 62 0 16 95 ci the results prove that advaml outperformed cox ph ssvm and srf for the small learning scenario figs 6 and 7 in addition ssvm achieved the lowest performance during the small learning scenario n 70 therefore advaml achieved a competitive performance on small tasks compared to the baseline models particularly the variance result across the 25 random experimental trials tended to be the smallest for advaml figs 6 and 7 during the medium learning scenario n 100 advaml outperformed cox ph ssvm and srf the mean c index is 0 85 0 85 0 08 95 ci for advaml and 0 71 0 71 0 03 95 ci for cox ph furthermore the mean c index for ssvm and srf is 0 77 0 77 0 13 95 ci and 0 72 0 72 0 16 95 ci respectively fig 7 thus the ssvm outperformed cox ph and srf on the medium tasks in addition the variance results across the 25 random experimental trials tended to be the highest for srf figs 6 and 7 advaml and ssvm achieved a c index of 0 87 0 87 0 02 95 ci and 0 87 0 87 0 03 95 ci during the large learning scenario n 300 respectively the mean c index was the same for both methods however the variance across the 25 random experimental trials tended to be smaller for advaml than for ssvm furthermore cox ph achieved a mean c index of 0 85 0 85 0 05 95 ci which is comparable to the efficacy of advaml and ssvm conversely srf achieved a mean c index of 0 78 0 78 0 01 95 ci the results revealed that advaml and srf achieved the lowest variance across the 25 random experimental trials figs 6 and 7 advaml exhibited a competitive performance as compared to cox ph ssvm and srf during the small and medium learning scenarios whereas advaml and ssvm achieved a comparable performance when large shots of target data were used however the variance results across the 25 random experimental trials tended to be smaller for advaml the ssvm was superior to cox ph and srf during the medium and large learning processes fig 7 furthermore although the outputs of advaml and cox ph were the log hazard ratios for each pipe advaml was superior to cox ph in all learning scenarios in summary the results investigated essential factors for the failure time prediction of water distribution pipelines researchers and decision makers can rely on these factors when modeling the failure of water pipes compared to previous studies almheiri et al 2020b harvey et al 2014 sattar et al 2016 snider and mcbean 2020 the proposed methodological approach could leverage information with limited exposure to the training tasks and high censored data therefore the proposed method can be applied to any water distribution network to predict the failure risk of water pipes before failure occurrence and avoid catastrophic consequences including floods and the loss of clean drinking water the proposed model can also help decision makers to develop an optimal management strategy for pipe replacement 6 discussion this study proposes an advaml ann based model for the service life analysis of water distribution pipelines deep learning can achieve superior performance as compared to other machine learning methods e g cox ph ssvm and srf particularly for high dimensional it should be high dimentional data however one challenge in applying deep learning in this area is that pipe failure data are limited to overcome these challenges advaml is proposed which is an ann based method combined with an ml process to predict the hazard ratio of water pipes the proposed paradigm was also compared to other approaches namely cox ph ssvm and srf when small to large shots of samples are picked from the target data during the learning process the performance of cox ph ssvm and srf decreased as the size of the training shots decreased however the efficacy of advaml remained stable when small and medium shots of the target data were used in other words advaml performs well when a small amount of training data is used because knowledge transfers from the initial parameterization phase to the final learning process furthermore srf and ssvm achieved the highest variance across the 25 random experimental trials during the small and medium learning scenarios figs 6 and 7 the variance then remarkably decreased by utilizing a large number of training samples in scenario 3 the results show that advaml outperforms the baseline methods when small and medium shots of the target training data are used figs 6 and 7 in addition advaml and ssvm achieved a comparable performance when large sample shots of the target data were used however the variance across the 25 random experimental trials tended to be slightly smaller for advaml the variance of srf remarkably decreased when large sample shots of the training data were used fig 7 the proposed approach comprises two learning phases as compared to the baseline methods this feature allows the algorithms to efficiently adapt to a few new tasks and generalize better than the baseline methods because of the optimization setting environment the ml setting also enables the automatic discovery of the climatic environmental spatial and physical features of water pipes in addition the hidden nodes in advaml capture distinctive patterns and map features onto lower dimensions via activation functions e g relu therefore our approach provides more information than the baseline models in particular advaml depends on the initial training data used for parameter initialization during the meta learner initial learning phase therefore the knowledge transferred from the initial training data phase to the final learning phase of the target data supports the performance of advaml in this study the challenges in the failure prediction of water pipes within water pipelines were evaluated the first challenge is designing a robust and effective machine learning tool for insufficient training data another challenge is creating a tool for data with a large number of censored data points these challenges were addressed through an ml approach that effectively and quickly learns a few shots of the target training tasks in the context of limited training data the proposed paradigm is superior to other methods cox ph ssvm and srf in terms of efficacy finally advaml achieved comparable results to the ssvm during the large learning scenario the results also prove that ml can uncover the features associated with the service life and implicitly prioritizes pipes in accordance with their contribution to the prediction task nonetheless the small and partially observed data could be a limiting factor and challenge in the reliability analysis of water pipes especially when data collection is expensive the proposed approach shows a promising advaml approach for civil engineering decision making as regards the service life analysis of water distribution pipelines when data are limited finally table 4 depicts the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed approach and the baseline methods it is worth mentioning that the performance of these machine learning approaches relies on the quality of training tasks and the selection of appropriate algorithms 7 conclusions this study discovered that chlorine residual and the number of lanes are the most critical factors followed by road type spatial characteristics month index evaporation traffic and failure type precipitation temperature number of breaks and pipe depth by contrast frost depth and pipe length are the least critical factors in the failure analysis based on the model efficacy c index the proposed ml paradigm based on deep anns can leverage and uncover information pertinent to the failure process of water distribution pipelines with unseen few shot tasks in addition it can predict the likelihood of failure of water distribution pipelines in terms of the hazard ratio it is also flexible to incomplete limited and heavily censored data the proposed paradigm can help water utilities and decision makers mitigate the risk of failure by labeling pipes that require immediate repair within a water distribution network further investigation into how different neural network architectures impact the performance of advaml is needed in addition the capability of advaml to handle missing data will be examined because the data received from water utilities usually contain high missing data points finally a reliable technique for data imputation can also be helpful for the failure data of water distribution pipelines because excluding missing data can lead to the loss of insightful information about the failure

enhance the removal of spiramycin which is a typical precursor of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma spiramycin 10 mg l could be completely removed within 20 min under the conditions of an initial ph of 4 0 a nzvi dose of 0 02 g l and a paa dose of 3 0 mg l additionally 95 8 and 78 8 of paa and h2o2 were consumed during the process electron paramagnetic resonance analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that 52 4 and 44 8 of spiramycin removal was contributed by hydroxyl radical oh and carbon centered radicals r c respectively and fe2 released from nzvi played a critical role in radicals

effective method is to enhance the removal of its precursors roccaro et al 2020 such as spiramycin generally advanced oxidation processes aops are effective for the elimination of refractory organic contaminants shao et al 2020 yan et al 2021 and ultraviolet uv based aops have been reported as a category of this promising technology among all aops yan et al 2021 wang et al 2018 in uv based aops uv combined with chemical oxidants such as h2o2 persulfate and chlorine are widely adopted to synergistically remove contaminants because the radical quantum yields in these combination systems 0 57 2 8 are much higher than those systems that only use of uv 0 01 0 05 wang et al 2018 in addition to these conventional combination methods a novel combination of uv with peracetic acid paa has received much more attention in recent years chen et al 2019 rizzo et al 2019 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 refractory antibiotics such as naproxen carbamazepine diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and oxytetracycline had been reported to achieve good removal efficiencies in the uv paa system under the multiple attacks of hydroxyl radical oh and carbon centered radicals r c yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the commercial paa solution is an equilibrium mixture of paa h2o2 acetic acid and h2o in which the paa and h2o2 are the reactive oxidation species for radical generation ao et al 2021 to achieve good performance in aops a high concentration of paa 35 40 w w is usually preferred in which the main reactive oxidation species is paa however due to the explosive risk of the transportation and storage a lower concentration of paa 15 20 w w is easily to be obtained and in which h2o2 concentration is equivalent to that of paa 13 5 16 w w and this results in a reduction of its oxidation performance wagner et al 2002 to date much more attention has been given to adopting the oxidation capability of the paa the equivalent concentration of h2o2 has usually been neglected the oo bond dissociation energy of paa 38 kcal mol is much lower than that of h2o2 51 kcal mol bianchini et al 2002 thus under the coexistence of paa and h2o2 paa would be utilized prior to h2o2 under uv irradiation ghanbari et al 2021 and negative reactions between oh and h2o2 to form less reactive radicals such as ho2 o 2 and o2 would occur wang et al 2016 thus uv irradiation alone cannot adequately motivate the oxidation abilities of paa and h2o2 if they coexist and additional measures should be considered in addition to uv irradiation transition metals such as fe cu co mn and ag or metal ions also exhibit excellent activation performance of oxidants and fe2 was demonstrated to have the highest efficiency ao et al 2021 ghanbari et al 2021 unfortunately paa reacts much faster with fe2 than h2o2 kim et al 2019 thus h2o2 can also not be adequately motivated if paa and h2o2 coexist the deficiency of rapid fe2 consumption is similar to that found in conventional fenton systems using solid iron based catalysts instead of fe2 can overcome this problem because fe2 can be released continuously in a heterogeneous fenton like system wang et al 2016 the method should also be suitable for alleviating the competition of paa and h2o2 with fe2 among solid iron based catalysts nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been widely used due to its large specific surface area and high reactivity kim et al 2019 li et al 2015 wang et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge no literature has reported the use of the ternary nzvi uv paa process to remove emerging organic contaminants especially spiramycin this study aims to elucidate the removal mechanism of spiramycin in the ternary nzvi uv paa system and to evaluate the reduction potential of ndma formation firstly influencing factors were investigated for optimizing the reaction conditions secondly the degradation pathway of spiramycin was proposed and verified by the density of functional theory dft analysis thirdly the ndma reduction potential of this process was assessed by analyzing the compositions of ndma fp before and after reaction finally the reuse performance of nzvi was evaluated through continuous degradation experiments and multiple characterizations this is the first study to elucidate the removal mechanism of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system from the perspective of ndma formation control 2 materials and methods

and all columns were discarded after use 2 2 3 ndma fp analysis ndma chloramination formation experiments were conducted before and after the reactions to evaluate whether the nzvi uv paa process was effective for the reduction of ndma fp dou et al 2021a 2021b the concentration of ndma formed during the chloramination serves as a surrogate for all compounds that can be converted into ndma furthermore the fractions of ndma fp after the reaction were purposely analyzed according to procedures described in text s2 2 3 calculations 2 3 1 synergic effect calculation to quantitatively evaluate the synergic degradation of spiramycin in the ternary nzvi uv paa system the synergic effect indicator sfi was calculated eq 1 the calculation of sfi was modified according to other paa based

the variations of nzvi before and after the reaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of spiramycin in different systems the degradation of spiramycin in the single system paa uv irradiation h2o2 and nzvi the binary system uv paa uv h2o2 nzvi uv nzvi paa and nzvi h2o2 and the ternary system nzvi uv paa and nzvi uv h2o2 was investigated and the results are shown in fig 1 the molar concentrations of paa and h2o2 were held the same to quantitatively assess of the abilities of each reactive oxidation species the results indicated that spiramycin was stable in the control set and either paa and h2o2 alone could hardly degrade spiramycin because its concentration barely changed in these systems previous studies yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 indicated that peroxides could not effectively remove emerging organic contaminants if they were not well activated when paa or h2o2 was activated by uv irradiation the removal efficiencies of spiramycin increased to 36 5 and 26 7 respectively although the removal of spiramycin was improved in the uv paa and uv h2o2 systems the removal efficiencies were relatively low a previous study indicated that if the octanol water partitioning coefficient log kow of one compound is less than 2 5 the compound has a low adsorption potential savic et al 2013 the log kow of spiramycin is 1 87 thus its removal by adsorption onto nzvi should be low 7 6 moreover the removal efficiency of spiramycin in the nzvi uv system 11 2 was slightly lower than that of the uv irradiation system alone 14 5 however in the other nzvi based binary systems such as nzvi h2o2 and nzvi paa the removal rates of spiramycin were significantly improved and its removal efficiency values were increased to 63 5 and 80 2 respectively a large amount of oh was formed in the nzvi h2o2 system wang et al 2016 and in addition to oh r c could also be formed in paa based aops cai et al 2017 yan et al 2021 this might be the main reason the removal of spiramycin in the nzvi paa system was better than that of the nzvi h2o2 system and this was confirmed by erp analysis and quenching experiments compared to the results of the binary systems the removal efficiency and degradation rate constant of spiramycin in the nzvi uv h2o2 ternary system increased to 88 6 and 0 106 min 1 respectively moreover spiramycin was completely removed within 20 min in the nzvi uv paa ternary system and its degradation rate constant increased to 0 319 min 1 for a ternary system ghanbari et al 2021 indicated that if the calculated sfi value was greater than 1 the synergic effect of every composition appeared the sfi value of spiramycin obtained in the nzvi uv paa ternary system was 3 22 therefore the ternary combination of nzvi uv and paa in this study can significantly accelerate the degradation of spiramycin compared to those of the single and binary systems 3 2 factors influencing the degradation of spiramycin 3 2 1 effect of paa dose the effect of the paa dose on the degradation of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system was investigated and the results are shown in fig 2 a with increasing paa dose from 0 5 mg l to 5 mg l the removal efficiency and the degradation rate of spiramycin also increased when the paa dose was below 1 mg l spiramycin could not be completely removed in 60 min however when the paa dose was above 2 mg l spiramycin could be completely removed in 30 min with the paa dose increasing from 2 mg l to 4 mg l its degradation rate constant increased significantly from 0 217 min 1 to 0 362 min 1 however when the paa dose was further increased to 5 mg l its degradation rate constant increased only slightly to 0 367 min 1 considering of the removal of spiramycin the cost of reagent and the reaction time a 3 mg l of paa dose was recommended if the initial spiramycin concentration was lower than 10 mg l to further investigate the utilization of reactive oxidation species during the degradation of spiramycin the variations of paa and h2o2 were traced fig s1 in total 95 8 and 78 8 of the paa and h2o2 were consumed during the whole process respectively specifically the paa concentration decreased rapidly approximately 90 7 in the first 3 min while only 14 7 of h2o2 was consumed during this period afterward the paa barely changed while the h2o2 was rapidly diminished under the coexistence of paa and h2o2 paa will be utilized prior to h2o2 because the oo bond dissociation energy in paa is much lower than that in h2o2 bianchini et al 2002 after spiramycin was completely degraded within 20 min 18 3 of the h2o2 was still utilized this was mostly due to the mineralization of tps of spiramycin and it was consistent with the results of toc analysis 3 2 2 effect of nzvi dose the effect of the nzvi dose on the degradation of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system is shown in fig 2 b when the nzvi dose was at a low concentration such as 0 005 g l and 0 01 g l spiramycin could not be completely removed and its degradation rate was relatively low however when the nzvi dose increased from 0 02 g l to 0 06 g l spiramycin could be completely removed within 20 min and its degradation rate constant significantly increased from 0 319 min 1 to 0 891 min 1 with increasing nzvi dose the number of active sites on its surface also increased which favored the release of fe2 eqs 2 and 3 and more oh and r c was produced by the decomposition of paa and h2o2 eqs 4 6 however when the nzvi dose further increased to 0 1 g l the shielding effect of nzvi appeared and the degradation rate constant of spiramycin decreased to 0 771 min 1 the shielding effect was also found in the heterogeneous nzvi based fenton like system when nzvi was at high dose conditions wang et al 2016 and in addition an undesired radical scavenging reaction might also occurred eq 7 considering both spiramycin removal and nzvi cost a nzvi dose of 0 02 g l was recommended to remove 10 mg l spiramycin under the conditions of a paa dose of 3 mg l and an initial ph of 4 0 2 f e 0 h 2 o 2 2 h fe ii 2 h 2 o 3 f e 0 o 2 2 h fe ii h 2 o 2 4 c h 3 c o o o h fe ii fe iii c h 3 c o o o h 5 c h 3 c o o o h fe ii fe iii c h 3 c o o o h 6 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii o h o h 7 fe ii o h fe iii o h under the recommended conditions the leaching of nzvi was quantified fig s2 the fe2 concentration was very low in the first 30 min while it increased afterward however the total dissolved iron increased during the whole process this might be because when fe2 was leached from nzvi it was quickly utilized to activate paa or h2o2 to generate oh and r c to degrade spiramycin after spiramycin was degraded the fe2 released exceeded what was needed causing the accumulation of fe2 the accumulation of fe2 might also occur from the reduction of fe3 to fe2 on or near the surface of nzvi eq 8 wang et al 2016 previous study indicated that in addition to oh and r c feiv also likely participates in the removal of emerging organic contaminants in the fe2 paa system chen et al 2021 kim et al 2019 to check whether feiv was involved in the nzvi uv paa system pmso was added to quench the oxygen atom transfer reaction derived from feiv fig s3 the results indicated that the degradation of spiramycin was negligibly inhibited by the addition of pmso implying that feiv played a negligible role in the removal of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system thus fe2 and fe3 should be the main constituents in the total dissolved iron and the leached iron accounted for 4 9 of the total nzvi 8 f e 0 2 fe iii 3 fe ii 3 2 3 effect of the initial ph the effect of the initial ph on the degradation of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system is shown in fig 2 c when the initial ph values were controlled at 3 0 4 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 10 0 the removal efficiency of spiramycin was 100 100 83 1 57 3 50 4 and 17 5 respectively and correspondingly its degradation rate constants were 0 844 min 1 0 319 min 1 0 0292 min 1 0 0138 min 1 0 0117 min 1 and 0 0038 min 1 respectively the acidic conditions facilitated the removal of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system on the one hand under alkaline conditions the progress of the leaching of fe2 from nzvi is inhibited eqs 2 and 3 wang et al 2016 which significantly influenced the activation of paa or h2o2 on the other hand the passivation of nzvi occurred under alkaline conditions resulting a decrease of active sites on the surface of nzvi zhang et al 2017 meanwhile the excess o h in the system will consume the h2o2 eq 9 dong et al 2016 in addition ph was also a decisive factor influencing the states of paa and spiramycin the hydrolytic equilibrium of paa was significantly influenced by ph fig s4 and the dissociation constant pka of paa was approximately 8 2 this suggests that when the ph value was less than 8 2 the molecular state pa a 0 was the major species of paa while the negatively charged form pa a was its dominant species once the ph value was above 8 2 previous studies have indicated that cai et al 2017 yan et al 2021 pa a has a scavenging effect on radicals leading to a significant decrease in the removal efficiencies of emerging organic contaminants mitchell et al 2015 also reported that spiramycin hydrolysis occurred under superacidic or alkalic conditions therefore the stability of spiramycin under our investigated ph range of 3 0 10 0 was also assessed fig s5 the results indicated that spiramycin was stable in the ph range of 4 0 10 0 while 43 8 of spiramycin was hydrolyzed at ph of 3 0 in 60 min thus the quick degradation of spiramycin at ph of 3 0 was mainly influenced by acidic hydrolysis fig 2 c not actual degradation our study aims to achieve the actual degradation of spiramycin not through the hydrolytic pathway thus a ph of 4 0 was recommended in the following experiments 9 h 2 o 2 o h o 2 h 2 o 3 2 4 effect of the initial spiramycin concentration the effect of the initial spiramycin concentration on its degradation in the nzvi uv paa system is shown in fig 2 d with the initial spiramycin increasing from 1 mg l to 15 mg l its degradation rate constant decreased from 1 867 min 1 to 0 156 min 1 the sharply reduced degradation rate of spiramycin might be caused by the lack of enough oxidation radicals once paa was fixed yan et al 2021 in addition a higher initial concentration of spiramycin would produce higher concentrations of tps and generated tps would compete with spiramycin for oxidation radicals therefore a paa dose of 3 mg l was recommended when the initial spiramycin concentration was below 15 mg l and a higher paa dose was needed if a higher concentration of spiramycin needed to be removed 3 2 5 effect of the water matrices ha and hco 3 were selected as typical organic compounds and inorganic ions after analysis of natural water and their influences on the degradation of spiramycin are shown in fig 2 e and fig 2 f the degradation of spiramycin was not influenced under low ha concentrations 3 mg l when the ha concentration was increased to 5 mg l the degradation rate of spiramycin decreased significantly although it could still be completely degraded within 60 min however when the ha concentration was further increased to 10 mg l and 20 mg l the degradation of spiramycin was significantly inhibited and only 65 4 and 55 6 of spiramycin was degraded within 60 min respectively at higher ha concentrations 5 mg l competition between spiramycin and ha with oxidation radicals occurred resulting in the reduced degradation of spiramycin chen et al 2019 reported that 1 mg l ha could almost inhibit naproxen degradation due to the scavenging effect of ha for oh and r c in the uv paa system the threshold inhibition concentration of ha here 5 mg l was higher than that of the chen et al 2019 which might be because the concentration of oxidation radicals generated in the nzvi uv paa system were much greater than those of the uv paa system confirmed by epr analysis as shown in fig 3 a in natural water the ha concentration was usually equal to or less than 5 mg l yan et al 2021 thus its influence on the removal of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system was acceptable the effect of hco 3 on the degradation of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system is shown in fig 2 f the results showed that when the hco 3 concentration was in the range of 0 10 0 mm the removal of spiramycin was barely inhibited traditionally hco 3 was considered to be able to convert oh to a form of less reactive radicals such as co 3 finally resulting in the reduced removal efficiency of contaminants luo et al 2015 however in this study hco 3 concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 0 mm had no significant effect on the removal of spiramycin the highly reactive r c radicals generated in the system such as ch3cooo could compensate for the disadvantage of the quenching of oh eqs 10 and 11 in natural water the hco 3 concentration was usually lower than 5 mm dou et al 2021a and spiramycin degradation is not influenced under this concentration threshold 10 h c o 3 o h c o 3 h 2 o 11 c o 3 c h 3 c o o o h c h 3 c o o o h c o 3 3 3 removal mechanism of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system 3 3 1 reactive radicals responsible for the removal of spiramycin fig 3 a shows the epr spectra with dmpo adducts for recognizing reactive radicals in different systems in the solo uv and paa systems only characteristic peaks of oh were observed and the signals were relatively weak however after paa was activated by uv in addition to oh the characteristic peaks of ch3 also appeared and the peak intensity of oh was much higher than those of solo uv and paa system moreover the peak intensities of oh and ch3 in the nzvi uv paa system were much higher than those of the uv paa system yan et al 2021 the reasons were as follows 1 after nzvi was added to the uv paa system in addition to uv activated paa fe2 released from nzvi could also activate paa to form oh and r c eqs 2 5 2 low concentration paa 15 20 w w was used in this study which contained an equivalent concentration of h2o2 and the heterogeneous fenton reaction also occurred to generate oh eq 6 after tba was added radical formation was inhibited resulting in a decrease of peak intensities dmpo is a relatively weak spin trap whose use will result in unstable spin adducts rokhina et al 2013 to provide more convincing evidence for radical generation in the nzvi uv paa system the advanced spin trap dippmpo was utilized and the results are shown in fig 3 b compared to the epr spectra with dmpo adducts the epr spectra with dippmpo adducts in the system are much more complex because of the presence of 31p i 1 2 inducing extra line splitting the simulation based fitting of spectra confirmed the presence of oh and r c such as ch3 ch3co ch3coo and ch3oo in the nzvi uv paa system table s2 through analysis of the hyperfine splittings from phosphors αp nitrogen αn and protons αh chalier and tordo 2002 kim et al 2019 rokhina et al 2013 quenching experiments were carried out to quantitatively evaluate the functions of each reactive radical for the removal of spiramycin fig 3 c and detailed calculations were conducted text s1 the results indicated that oh and r c were the main radicals that accounted for 52 4 and 44 8 of the spiramycin removal respectively however direct uv photolysis contribution was low 2 8 further analysis showed that the oh generated from the combination processes of h2o2 activation by uv k2 h2o2 activation by fe2 k3 and paa activation by fe2 k4 accounted for 76 0 of the total oh and the processes of paa activation by uv k1 and uv irradiation only accounted for 16 2 and 7 8 respectively for r c the processes of paa activation by uv k6 and paa activation by fe2 k7 accounted for 26 6 and 73 4 of the total r c respectively moreover catalase quenching experiments showed that 39 8 of spiramycin removal could be attributed to h2o2 based processes therefore after the addition of nzvi not only paa activation enhanced but h2o2 could also be effectively adopted to synergistically remove spiramycin in the system based on the analysis of the utilization of paa and h2o2 a schematic diagram of spiramycin degradation was proposed fig 3 d the whole degradation period of spiramycin could be divided into three steps step i and step ii were responsible for spiramycin removal while step iii was mainly charged for the mineralization of its tps the main reaction that occurred in the three steps could be clarified as follows in step i 0 3 min paa was activated by uv irradiation the oo bond of paa was cleaved and the radicals of ch3coo and oh were formed eq 12 and then continuous reactions occurred to form other r c such as ch3 ch3oo and ch3co eqs 13 15 in addition to the abovementioned reactions paa could also be activated by the released fe2 from nzvi to form oh and r c radicals such as ch3coo eqs 4 and 5 in step ii 3 20 min the paa concentration barely changed while h2o2 was rapidly utilized spiramycin removal in this step should be due to the fenton like process eq 6 under the multiple attacks of oh r c radicals and direct uv photolysis in step i and step ii spiramycin was completely removed within 20 min eq 16 in step iii 20 60 min the fenton like process also proceeded as 18 3 of h2o2 was utilized in this step and the oh generated was responsible for the mineralization of the tps of spiramycin eq 17 12 c h 3 c o o o h h v c h 3 c o o o h 13 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 14 c h 3 o 2 c h 3 o o 15 c h 3 c o o o h o h c h 3 c o h 2 o o 2 16

higher than that of the uv paa binary system 15 0 our previous study yan et al 2021 indicated that the uv paa process was effective for the mineralization of oxytetracycline as 50 9 toc removal was achieved the very low removal of toc in the uv paa system here might due to the molecular structure of spiramycin being more complex than that of oxytetracycline after nzvi was added to the uv paa system the intensities of the reactive radicals were enhanced fig 3 a which facilitated the mineralization of spiramycin therefore the nzvi uv paa process could not only thoroughly degrade spiramycin but also further mineralize the majority of its tps the tps of spiramycin were traced using uplc ms ms to elucidate its removal mechanism fig 4 a additionally dma as an important tp was also quantified due to the molecular structure of spiramycin containing two dma functional groups dou et al 2021a fig 4 b a total of 15 types of tps were detected during the degradation of spiramycin and their characteristics and mass spectra were provided in table 1 and fig s7 among the tps tp663 tp699 tp830 tp845 and tp861 were first detected in this study due to the lack of standards except dma the peak intensities of tps were given instead the peak intensities of tp859 and tp891 were relatively higher and they increased to a maximum at 10 min and 30 min respectively and then decreased they were the mono and tertiary hydroxylation intermediates of spiramycin however the peak intensity of its secondary hydroxylation intermediate tp875 was found at a low level although tp859 tp875 and tp891 were also detected in the peroxydisulfate g c3n4 visible light irradiation system their variations were different dou et al 2021a this might be due to the different removal mechanisms o 2 and h were the main oxidizers in the previous study dou et al 2021a while oh and r c were the main reactive oxidizers in this study in contrast to other tps tp159 and tp335 continued to increase during the whole process in addition the majority of dma 86 0 was degraded after it was produced under the attack of oh and r c fig 4 b and text s4 based on the analysis of the structures of the detected tps the degradation pathway was proposed fig 4 c and then verified by dft analysis fig s8 and fig 4 d the results implied that spiramycin was degraded through four pathways in the nzvi uv paa system pathway 1 was initiated by electrophilic attack at the n atom position in the dma functional group which was located at the forosamine group and mycaminose group of spiramycin c1 and c12 positions in fig 4 c the 2fed2homo values of n68 and n94 in the dma group were much higher than those of other atoms 1 1532 and 0 7021 respectively suggesting that these sites were susceptible attack and underwent electrophilic reactions fig s8 under the electrophilic attack f fig 4 d at the positions of n68 and n94 one methyl group was lost ch3 tp289 1 and its isomer tp289 2 were formed and then tp814 was produced by a further electrophilic reaction ch3 these three tps were also detected in the peroxydisulfate g c3n4 visible light irradiation system dou et al 2021a therefore it was considered that electrophilic demethylation reactions frequently occurred during the degradation of spiramycin using aops tp845 tp829 1 o and tp830 tp814 o were the monohydroxylation intermediates of tp829 1 and tp814 the secondary hydroxylation intermediates of tp861 tp845 o could be formed by attacking the aldehyde group at the c11 position illustrated in fig 4 c el shaheny 2019 also reported that aldehyde groups in organic contaminants were easily attacked in aops to form carboxylic acid groups pathway 2 proceeded by continuous hydroxylation the fed2homo fed2lumo values of n68 and n94 in the dma group were also much higher 0 1056 and 0 1006 respectively fig s8 which suggested that in addition to electrophilic reaction these sites were also susceptible to proceed hydroxylation reactions f 0 fig 4 d when these two sites were attacked monohydroxylation intermediates of spiramycin such as tp859 1 and tp859 2 were formed previous studies el shaheny 2019 dou et al 2021a also indicated that amine groups in the structures of organic contaminants were easily oxidized to amine oxides tp875 was formed by further hydroxylation of tp859 in addition tp891 was formed due to the oxidation of the aldehyde group in tp875 to form carboxylic acid group in this study the hydroxylation was an important pathway as quenching experiments showed that 52 4 of spiramycin removal was contributed by oh pathway 3 and pathway 4 occurred due to the cleavage of the co bond three deoxysugars mycarose forosamine and mycaminose existed in the branch chain of spiramycin illustrated as i ii and iii in fig 4 c respectively these branches were all connected by the co bond positions of a b and c illustrated in fig 4 c as the co bond energy is small under the attack of oxidation radicals the bond is easily cleaved wang et al 2021 for pathway 3 the co bond at the position a was broken and tp699 was generated by the loss of mycarose tp699 was also detected in peroxydisulfate based aops and a monodehydration intermediate of tp681 was further generated wang et al 2021 however instead of a monodehydration intermediate a secondary dehydration intermediate of tp663 was detected in this study for pathway 4 the co bond at the position b was cleaved under the attack of oxidation radicals and tp685 was produced by the loss of forosamine furthermore the co bond at the position of was broken to produce tp352 and tp335 in addition as tp159 tp663 and tp335 contained dma functional groups dma could be generated from these three tps due to the cleavage of the nc bond 3 3 3 ndma fp assessment chloramination of spiramycin before and after reaction was conducted to assess the variations of ndma fp in the nzvi uv paa system fig 5 the ndma fp of spiramycin sharply decreased from 89 63 2 9 μg l to 31 15 2 3 μg l after the reaction suggesting that 65 2 of ndma fp had been reduced further calculations showed that the residual ndma fp was contributed by undegraded spiramycin dma and other unidentified precursors and they accounted for 8 8 58 7 and 32 5 respectively as the residuals of spiramycin and dma could be further degraded if the doses of nzvi and paa were increased data not shown a ndma fp reduction rate of 88 7 was expected once these residual fractions were well degraded 3 4 reuse performance of nzvi continuous degradation experiments were conducted to assess the reuse performance of nzvi fig s9 the results indicated that nzvi had significant reuse potential as after three cycles of reuse run 4 the removal efficiency of spiramycin only slightly decreased from 100 to 93 1 the stability of nzvi in the system was further confirmed by the results of multiple characterizations fig 6 fig s10 and fig s11 the core shell structure of nzvi can be observed clearly from hr tem images and the majority of particles were in the range of 40 100 nm before the reaction the nzvi particles appeared as chain like aggregates and the outside of the nzvi particles was very smooth fig 6 a however after the reaction slight corrosion outside the core shell of nzvi occurred fig 6 b to understand the elemental compositions of nzvi before and after the reaction edx analyses were conducted fig s10 iron fe 99 66 wt was the dominant element on the surface of nzvi before the reaction and very small amount of oxygen o was detected 0 34 wt as the purchased nzvi was stored in an anaerobic chamber the small quantity of o in the sample before the reaction was mostly due to the sample preparation for edx analysis after the reaction the o significantly increased to 7 19 wt and fe element decreased to 85 25 wt due to the leaching of fe2 the fe and o contents in nzvi were similar to those of nzvi based heterogeneous fenton systems mao et al 2019 wang et al 2016 in addition carbon c 7 53 wt and nitrogen n 0 03 wt also appeared and these two elements could be derived from spiramycin and its tps in addition to the micromorphology structure of nzvi xrd xps and raman analysis were also conducted the xrd patterns showed that strong characteristic peaks of 44 7 65 0 and 82 3 appeared before the reaction which were consistent with jcpds no 65 4899 results of zero valent iron fig 6 c however after the reaction in addition to the characteristic peaks of zero valent iron the characteristic peaks of iron oxides also appeared the characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 30 3 and 62 7 refer to the existence of fe2o3 and 2θ values of 35 4 and 57 2 refer to the existence of fe3o4 fe2o3 and fe3o4 are commonly detected iron oxides in fe0 based advanced oxidation systems li et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the results were consistent with the xps analysis fig s11 three characteristic peaks at 710 1 ev 712 1 ev and 723 8 ev corresponding to iron oxides were detected in the nzvi sample after the reaction the peak at 712 1 ev is assigned to fe 2p3 2 spin orbit peaks of fe2o3 while the peaks at 724 3 and 710 8 ev correspond to fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 spin orbit peaks of fe3o4 mao et al 2019 xiang et al 2021 the raman spectra of nzvi before and after the reaction further verified fe2o3 was the main iron oxides as the peak intensity was much higher than that of fe3o4 fig 6 d the bands for nzvi were at 217 280 388 and 595 cm 1 however these bands shifted to 210 276 and 382 cm 1 which were the characteristic peaks of fe2o3 liu et al 2017 compared to fe2o3 the peak intensities for fe3o4 were relatively lower with values of 310 540 and 670 cm 1 the above multiple characterizations indicated that although the passivation of nzvi might occur due to the oxidation reaction its structure was not affected therefore nzvi still had good performance for spiramycin removal when recycled three times 4 conclusions spiramycin 10 mg l could be completely removed in the nzvi uv paa system under the conditions of an initial ph of 4 0 a nzvi dose of 0 02 g l and a paa dose of 3 0 mg l 95 8 and 78 8 of paa and h2o2 were consumed during the process respectively epr analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that oh and r c were the main oxidizers for the spiramycin removal accounting for 52 4 and 44 8 respectively based on the tps tracing and dft analysis four degradation pathways of spiramycin were proposed and hydroxylation was found to be its main degradation pathway multiple characterization results showed that nzvi was stable in the system and even after being reused three times the removal efficiency of spiramycin was still above 93 in addition 65 2 of the ndma fp of spiramycin was reduced after the nzvi uv paa reaction therefore the nzvi uv paa process is a promising advanced oxidation technology not only for the removal of refractory ndma precursors such as spiramycin but also for significantly lowering the ndma fp

16602,in this study nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi was added to motivate the functions of all the reactive oxidation species in peracetic acid paa mixture under ultraviolet uv irradiation and to enhance the removal of spiramycin which is a typical precursor of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma spiramycin 10 mg l could be completely removed within 20 min under the conditions of an initial ph of 4 0 a nzvi dose of 0 02 g l and a paa dose of 3 0 mg l additionally 95 8 and 78 8 of paa and h2o2 were consumed during the process electron paramagnetic resonance analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that 52 4 and 44 8 of spiramycin removal was contributed by hydroxyl radical oh and carbon centered radicals r c respectively and fe2 released from nzvi played a critical role in radicals generation four degradation pathways of spiramycin were proposed and verified by the density of functional theory analysis 65 2 of the ndma formation potential fp was reduced after the reaction and its residual was mainly contributed by the undegraded intermediate of dimethylamine the results of multiple characterizations and continuous degradation experiments indicated that nzvi was stable in the system as the removal of spiramycin was hardly influenced even if reused three times the nzvi uv paa process is a promising advanced oxidation technology not only for the removal of refractory ndma precursors such as spiramycin but also for significantly lowering the ndma fp graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords spiramycin nanoscale zero valent iron peracetic acid ultraviolet irradiation n nitrosodimethylamine 1 introduction spiramycin is a typical macrolide antibiotic in addition to being widely used to cure animal diseases it is also added as a feed supplement at low concentrations to promote the growth of livestock due to containing dimethylamine dma groups in the forosamine and mycaminose structures of spiramycin it was also reported to be an important precursor of n nitrosodimethylamine ndma dou et al 2021a which is a carcinogenic disinfection by product that has recently received more attentions previous studies tang et al 2017 tian et al 2020 reported that spiramycin in the influent of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps was between 603 ng l and 2588 ng l while its concentration could reach several to tens of mg l in antibiotic manufacturing wastewaters as the secondary treatment in wwtps was not effective in the removal of spiramycin it was frequently detected in the effluent of wwtps dou et al 2021a when chlorination based disinfection processes are adopted for wastewater regeneration ndma can be formed from its residuals and ultimately cause great safety risks compared to intentionally removing ndma after its formation the more effective method is to enhance the removal of its precursors roccaro et al 2020 such as spiramycin generally advanced oxidation processes aops are effective for the elimination of refractory organic contaminants shao et al 2020 yan et al 2021 and ultraviolet uv based aops have been reported as a category of this promising technology among all aops yan et al 2021 wang et al 2018 in uv based aops uv combined with chemical oxidants such as h2o2 persulfate and chlorine are widely adopted to synergistically remove contaminants because the radical quantum yields in these combination systems 0 57 2 8 are much higher than those systems that only use of uv 0 01 0 05 wang et al 2018 in addition to these conventional combination methods a novel combination of uv with peracetic acid paa has received much more attention in recent years chen et al 2019 rizzo et al 2019 yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 refractory antibiotics such as naproxen carbamazepine diclofenac sulfamethoxazole and oxytetracycline had been reported to achieve good removal efficiencies in the uv paa system under the multiple attacks of hydroxyl radical oh and carbon centered radicals r c yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 the commercial paa solution is an equilibrium mixture of paa h2o2 acetic acid and h2o in which the paa and h2o2 are the reactive oxidation species for radical generation ao et al 2021 to achieve good performance in aops a high concentration of paa 35 40 w w is usually preferred in which the main reactive oxidation species is paa however due to the explosive risk of the transportation and storage a lower concentration of paa 15 20 w w is easily to be obtained and in which h2o2 concentration is equivalent to that of paa 13 5 16 w w and this results in a reduction of its oxidation performance wagner et al 2002 to date much more attention has been given to adopting the oxidation capability of the paa the equivalent concentration of h2o2 has usually been neglected the oo bond dissociation energy of paa 38 kcal mol is much lower than that of h2o2 51 kcal mol bianchini et al 2002 thus under the coexistence of paa and h2o2 paa would be utilized prior to h2o2 under uv irradiation ghanbari et al 2021 and negative reactions between oh and h2o2 to form less reactive radicals such as ho2 o 2 and o2 would occur wang et al 2016 thus uv irradiation alone cannot adequately motivate the oxidation abilities of paa and h2o2 if they coexist and additional measures should be considered in addition to uv irradiation transition metals such as fe cu co mn and ag or metal ions also exhibit excellent activation performance of oxidants and fe2 was demonstrated to have the highest efficiency ao et al 2021 ghanbari et al 2021 unfortunately paa reacts much faster with fe2 than h2o2 kim et al 2019 thus h2o2 can also not be adequately motivated if paa and h2o2 coexist the deficiency of rapid fe2 consumption is similar to that found in conventional fenton systems using solid iron based catalysts instead of fe2 can overcome this problem because fe2 can be released continuously in a heterogeneous fenton like system wang et al 2016 the method should also be suitable for alleviating the competition of paa and h2o2 with fe2 among solid iron based catalysts nanoscale zero valent iron nzvi has been widely used due to its large specific surface area and high reactivity kim et al 2019 li et al 2015 wang et al 2016 to the best of our knowledge no literature has reported the use of the ternary nzvi uv paa process to remove emerging organic contaminants especially spiramycin this study aims to elucidate the removal mechanism of spiramycin in the ternary nzvi uv paa system and to evaluate the reduction potential of ndma formation firstly influencing factors were investigated for optimizing the reaction conditions secondly the degradation pathway of spiramycin was proposed and verified by the density of functional theory dft analysis thirdly the ndma reduction potential of this process was assessed by analyzing the compositions of ndma fp before and after reaction finally the reuse performance of nzvi was evaluated through continuous degradation experiments and multiple characterizations this is the first study to elucidate the removal mechanism of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system from the perspective of ndma formation control 2 materials and methods

of water matrices on the degradation of spiramycin table s1 the degradation experiments were performed in triplicate and the pseudo first order kinetics were used to describe the degradation of spiramycin in the system the procedures of the quenching experiments were the same as those of the degradation experiments and tba and catalase were added to the quantitative analysis of the functions of direct uv photolysis oh and r c in the removal of spiramycin text s1 2 2 2 identification of transformation products tps to facilitate the capture of tps and investigate the spiramycin removal

and all columns were discarded after use 2 2 3 ndma fp analysis ndma chloramination formation experiments were conducted before and after the reactions to evaluate whether the nzvi uv paa process was effective for the reduction of ndma fp dou et al 2021a 2021b the concentration of ndma formed during the chloramination serves as a surrogate for all compounds that can be converted into ndma furthermore the fractions of ndma fp after the reaction were purposely analyzed according to procedures described in text s2 2 3 calculations 2 3 1 synergic effect calculation to quantitatively evaluate the synergic degradation of spiramycin in the ternary nzvi uv paa system the synergic effect indicator sfi was calculated eq 1 the calculation of sfi was modified according to other paa based

the variations of nzvi before and after the reaction 3 results and discussion 3 1 degradation of spiramycin in different systems the degradation of spiramycin in the single system paa uv irradiation h2o2 and nzvi the binary system uv paa uv h2o2 nzvi uv nzvi paa and nzvi h2o2 and the ternary system nzvi uv paa and nzvi uv h2o2 was investigated and the results are shown in fig 1 the molar concentrations of paa and h2o2 were held the same to quantitatively assess of the abilities of each reactive oxidation species the results indicated that spiramycin was stable in the control set and either paa and h2o2 alone could hardly degrade spiramycin because its concentration barely changed in these systems previous studies yan et al 2021 zhang et al 2021 indicated that peroxides could not effectively remove emerging organic contaminants if they were not well activated when paa or h2o2 was activated by uv irradiation the removal efficiencies of spiramycin increased to 36 5 and 26 7 respectively although the removal of spiramycin was improved in the uv paa and uv h2o2 systems the removal efficiencies were relatively low a previous study indicated that if the octanol water partitioning coefficient log kow of one compound is less than 2 5 the compound has a low adsorption potential savic et al 2013 the log kow of spiramycin is 1 87 thus its removal by adsorption onto nzvi should be low 7 6 moreover the removal efficiency of spiramycin in the nzvi uv system 11 2 was slightly lower than that of the uv irradiation system alone 14 5 however in the other nzvi based binary systems such as nzvi h2o2 and nzvi paa the removal rates of spiramycin were significantly improved and its removal efficiency values were increased to 63 5 and 80 2 respectively a large amount of oh was formed in the nzvi h2o2 system wang et al 2016 and in addition to oh r c could also be formed in paa based aops cai et al 2017 yan et al 2021 this might be the main reason the removal of spiramycin in the nzvi paa system was better than that of the nzvi h2o2 system and this was confirmed by erp analysis and quenching experiments compared to the results of the binary systems the removal efficiency and degradation rate constant of spiramycin in the nzvi uv h2o2 ternary system increased to 88 6 and 0 106 min 1 respectively moreover spiramycin was completely removed within 20 min in the nzvi uv paa ternary system and its degradation rate constant increased to 0 319 min 1 for a ternary system ghanbari et al 2021 indicated that if the calculated sfi value was greater than 1 the synergic effect of every composition appeared the sfi value of spiramycin obtained in the nzvi uv paa ternary system was 3 22 therefore the ternary combination of nzvi uv and paa in this study can significantly accelerate the degradation of spiramycin compared to those of the single and binary systems 3 2 factors influencing the degradation of spiramycin 3 2 1 effect of paa dose the effect of the paa dose on the degradation of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system was investigated and the results are shown in fig 2 a with increasing paa dose from 0 5 mg l to 5 mg l the removal efficiency and the degradation rate of spiramycin also increased when the paa dose was below 1 mg l spiramycin could not be completely removed in 60 min however when the paa dose was above 2 mg l spiramycin could be completely removed in 30 min with the paa dose increasing from 2 mg l to 4 mg l its degradation rate constant increased significantly from 0 217 min 1 to 0 362 min 1 however when the paa dose was further increased to 5 mg l its degradation rate constant increased only slightly to 0 367 min 1 considering of the removal of spiramycin the cost of reagent and the reaction time a 3 mg l of paa dose was recommended if the initial spiramycin concentration was lower than 10 mg l to further investigate the utilization of reactive oxidation species during the degradation of spiramycin the variations of paa and h2o2 were traced fig s1 in total 95 8 and 78 8 of the paa and h2o2 were consumed during the whole process respectively specifically the paa concentration decreased rapidly approximately 90 7 in the first 3 min while only 14 7 of h2o2 was consumed during this period afterward the paa barely changed while the h2o2 was rapidly diminished under the coexistence of paa and h2o2 paa will be utilized prior to h2o2 because the oo bond dissociation energy in paa is much lower than that in h2o2 bianchini et al 2002 after spiramycin was completely degraded within 20 min 18 3 of the h2o2 was still utilized this was mostly due to the mineralization of tps of spiramycin and it was consistent with the results of toc analysis 3 2 2 effect of nzvi dose the effect of the nzvi dose on the degradation of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system is shown in fig 2 b when the nzvi dose was at a low concentration such as 0 005 g l and 0 01 g l spiramycin could not be completely removed and its degradation rate was relatively low however when the nzvi dose increased from 0 02 g l to 0 06 g l spiramycin could be completely removed within 20 min and its degradation rate constant significantly increased from 0 319 min 1 to 0 891 min 1 with increasing nzvi dose the number of active sites on its surface also increased which favored the release of fe2 eqs 2 and 3 and more oh and r c was produced by the decomposition of paa and h2o2 eqs 4 6 however when the nzvi dose further increased to 0 1 g l the shielding effect of nzvi appeared and the degradation rate constant of spiramycin decreased to 0 771 min 1 the shielding effect was also found in the heterogeneous nzvi based fenton like system when nzvi was at high dose conditions wang et al 2016 and in addition an undesired radical scavenging reaction might also occurred eq 7 considering both spiramycin removal and nzvi cost a nzvi dose of 0 02 g l was recommended to remove 10 mg l spiramycin under the conditions of a paa dose of 3 mg l and an initial ph of 4 0 2 f e 0 h 2 o 2 2 h fe ii 2 h 2 o 3 f e 0 o 2 2 h fe ii h 2 o 2 4 c h 3 c o o o h fe ii fe iii c h 3 c o o o h 5 c h 3 c o o o h fe ii fe iii c h 3 c o o o h 6 fe ii h 2 o 2 fe iii o h o h 7 fe ii o h fe iii o h under the recommended conditions the leaching of nzvi was quantified fig s2 the fe2 concentration was very low in the first 30 min while it increased afterward however the total dissolved iron increased during the whole process this might be because when fe2 was leached from nzvi it was quickly utilized to activate paa or h2o2 to generate oh and r c to degrade spiramycin after spiramycin was degraded the fe2 released exceeded what was needed causing the accumulation of fe2 the accumulation of fe2 might also occur from the reduction of fe3 to fe2 on or near the surface of nzvi eq 8 wang et al 2016 previous study indicated that in addition to oh and r c feiv also likely participates in the removal of emerging organic contaminants in the fe2 paa system chen et al 2021 kim et al 2019 to check whether feiv was involved in the nzvi uv paa system pmso was added to quench the oxygen atom transfer reaction derived from feiv fig s3 the results indicated that the degradation of spiramycin was negligibly inhibited by the addition of pmso implying that feiv played a negligible role in the removal of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system thus fe2 and fe3 should be the main constituents in the total dissolved iron and the leached iron accounted for 4 9 of the total nzvi 8 f e 0 2 fe iii 3 fe ii 3 2 3 effect of the initial ph the effect of the initial ph on the degradation of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system is shown in fig 2 c when the initial ph values were controlled at 3 0 4 0 5 0 7 0 9 0 and 10 0 the removal efficiency of spiramycin was 100 100 83 1 57 3 50 4 and 17 5 respectively and correspondingly its degradation rate constants were 0 844 min 1 0 319 min 1 0 0292 min 1 0 0138 min 1 0 0117 min 1 and 0 0038 min 1 respectively the acidic conditions facilitated the removal of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system on the one hand under alkaline conditions the progress of the leaching of fe2 from nzvi is inhibited eqs 2 and 3 wang et al 2016 which significantly influenced the activation of paa or h2o2 on the other hand the passivation of nzvi occurred under alkaline conditions resulting a decrease of active sites on the surface of nzvi zhang et al 2017 meanwhile the excess o h in the system will consume the h2o2 eq 9 dong et al 2016 in addition ph was also a decisive factor influencing the states of paa and spiramycin the hydrolytic equilibrium of paa was significantly influenced by ph fig s4 and the dissociation constant pka of paa was approximately 8 2 this suggests that when the ph value was less than 8 2 the molecular state pa a 0 was the major species of paa while the negatively charged form pa a was its dominant species once the ph value was above 8 2 previous studies have indicated that cai et al 2017 yan et al 2021 pa a has a scavenging effect on radicals leading to a significant decrease in the removal efficiencies of emerging organic contaminants mitchell et al 2015 also reported that spiramycin hydrolysis occurred under superacidic or alkalic conditions therefore the stability of spiramycin under our investigated ph range of 3 0 10 0 was also assessed fig s5 the results indicated that spiramycin was stable in the ph range of 4 0 10 0 while 43 8 of spiramycin was hydrolyzed at ph of 3 0 in 60 min thus the quick degradation of spiramycin at ph of 3 0 was mainly influenced by acidic hydrolysis fig 2 c not actual degradation our study aims to achieve the actual degradation of spiramycin not through the hydrolytic pathway thus a ph of 4 0 was recommended in the following experiments 9 h 2 o 2 o h o 2 h 2 o 3 2 4 effect of the initial spiramycin concentration the effect of the initial spiramycin concentration on its degradation in the nzvi uv paa system is shown in fig 2 d with the initial spiramycin increasing from 1 mg l to 15 mg l its degradation rate constant decreased from 1 867 min 1 to 0 156 min 1 the sharply reduced degradation rate of spiramycin might be caused by the lack of enough oxidation radicals once paa was fixed yan et al 2021 in addition a higher initial concentration of spiramycin would produce higher concentrations of tps and generated tps would compete with spiramycin for oxidation radicals therefore a paa dose of 3 mg l was recommended when the initial spiramycin concentration was below 15 mg l and a higher paa dose was needed if a higher concentration of spiramycin needed to be removed 3 2 5 effect of the water matrices ha and hco 3 were selected as typical organic compounds and inorganic ions after analysis of natural water and their influences on the degradation of spiramycin are shown in fig 2 e and fig 2 f the degradation of spiramycin was not influenced under low ha concentrations 3 mg l when the ha concentration was increased to 5 mg l the degradation rate of spiramycin decreased significantly although it could still be completely degraded within 60 min however when the ha concentration was further increased to 10 mg l and 20 mg l the degradation of spiramycin was significantly inhibited and only 65 4 and 55 6 of spiramycin was degraded within 60 min respectively at higher ha concentrations 5 mg l competition between spiramycin and ha with oxidation radicals occurred resulting in the reduced degradation of spiramycin chen et al 2019 reported that 1 mg l ha could almost inhibit naproxen degradation due to the scavenging effect of ha for oh and r c in the uv paa system the threshold inhibition concentration of ha here 5 mg l was higher than that of the chen et al 2019 which might be because the concentration of oxidation radicals generated in the nzvi uv paa system were much greater than those of the uv paa system confirmed by epr analysis as shown in fig 3 a in natural water the ha concentration was usually equal to or less than 5 mg l yan et al 2021 thus its influence on the removal of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system was acceptable the effect of hco 3 on the degradation of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system is shown in fig 2 f the results showed that when the hco 3 concentration was in the range of 0 10 0 mm the removal of spiramycin was barely inhibited traditionally hco 3 was considered to be able to convert oh to a form of less reactive radicals such as co 3 finally resulting in the reduced removal efficiency of contaminants luo et al 2015 however in this study hco 3 concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 0 mm had no significant effect on the removal of spiramycin the highly reactive r c radicals generated in the system such as ch3cooo could compensate for the disadvantage of the quenching of oh eqs 10 and 11 in natural water the hco 3 concentration was usually lower than 5 mm dou et al 2021a and spiramycin degradation is not influenced under this concentration threshold 10 h c o 3 o h c o 3 h 2 o 11 c o 3 c h 3 c o o o h c h 3 c o o o h c o 3 3 3 removal mechanism of spiramycin in the nzvi uv paa system 3 3 1 reactive radicals responsible for the removal of spiramycin fig 3 a shows the epr spectra with dmpo adducts for recognizing reactive radicals in different systems in the solo uv and paa systems only characteristic peaks of oh were observed and the signals were relatively weak however after paa was activated by uv in addition to oh the characteristic peaks of ch3 also appeared and the peak intensity of oh was much higher than those of solo uv and paa system moreover the peak intensities of oh and ch3 in the nzvi uv paa system were much higher than those of the uv paa system yan et al 2021 the reasons were as follows 1 after nzvi was added to the uv paa system in addition to uv activated paa fe2 released from nzvi could also activate paa to form oh and r c eqs 2 5 2 low concentration paa 15 20 w w was used in this study which contained an equivalent concentration of h2o2 and the heterogeneous fenton reaction also occurred to generate oh eq 6 after tba was added radical formation was inhibited resulting in a decrease of peak intensities dmpo is a relatively weak spin trap whose use will result in unstable spin adducts rokhina et al 2013 to provide more convincing evidence for radical generation in the nzvi uv paa system the advanced spin trap dippmpo was utilized and the results are shown in fig 3 b compared to the epr spectra with dmpo adducts the epr spectra with dippmpo adducts in the system are much more complex because of the presence of 31p i 1 2 inducing extra line splitting the simulation based fitting of spectra confirmed the presence of oh and r c such as ch3 ch3co ch3coo and ch3oo in the nzvi uv paa system table s2 through analysis of the hyperfine splittings from phosphors αp nitrogen αn and protons αh chalier and tordo 2002 kim et al 2019 rokhina et al 2013 quenching experiments were carried out to quantitatively evaluate the functions of each reactive radical for the removal of spiramycin fig 3 c and detailed calculations were conducted text s1 the results indicated that oh and r c were the main radicals that accounted for 52 4 and 44 8 of the spiramycin removal respectively however direct uv photolysis contribution was low 2 8 further analysis showed that the oh generated from the combination processes of h2o2 activation by uv k2 h2o2 activation by fe2 k3 and paa activation by fe2 k4 accounted for 76 0 of the total oh and the processes of paa activation by uv k1 and uv irradiation only accounted for 16 2 and 7 8 respectively for r c the processes of paa activation by uv k6 and paa activation by fe2 k7 accounted for 26 6 and 73 4 of the total r c respectively moreover catalase quenching experiments showed that 39 8 of spiramycin removal could be attributed to h2o2 based processes therefore after the addition of nzvi not only paa activation enhanced but h2o2 could also be effectively adopted to synergistically remove spiramycin in the system based on the analysis of the utilization of paa and h2o2 a schematic diagram of spiramycin degradation was proposed fig 3 d the whole degradation period of spiramycin could be divided into three steps step i and step ii were responsible for spiramycin removal while step iii was mainly charged for the mineralization of its tps the main reaction that occurred in the three steps could be clarified as follows in step i 0 3 min paa was activated by uv irradiation the oo bond of paa was cleaved and the radicals of ch3coo and oh were formed eq 12 and then continuous reactions occurred to form other r c such as ch3 ch3oo and ch3co eqs 13 15 in addition to the abovementioned reactions paa could also be activated by the released fe2 from nzvi to form oh and r c radicals such as ch3coo eqs 4 and 5 in step ii 3 20 min the paa concentration barely changed while h2o2 was rapidly utilized spiramycin removal in this step should be due to the fenton like process eq 6 under the multiple attacks of oh r c radicals and direct uv photolysis in step i and step ii spiramycin was completely removed within 20 min eq 16 in step iii 20 60 min the fenton like process also proceeded as 18 3 of h2o2 was utilized in this step and the oh generated was responsible for the mineralization of the tps of spiramycin eq 17 12 c h 3 c o o o h h v c h 3 c o o o h 13 c h 3 c o o c h 3 c o 2 14 c h 3 o 2 c h 3 o o 15 c h 3 c o o o h o h c h 3 c o h 2 o o 2 16

higher than that of the uv paa binary system 15 0 our previous study yan et al 2021 indicated that the uv paa process was effective for the mineralization of oxytetracycline as 50 9 toc removal was achieved the very low removal of toc in the uv paa system here might due to the molecular structure of spiramycin being more complex than that of oxytetracycline after nzvi was added to the uv paa system the intensities of the reactive radicals were enhanced fig 3 a which facilitated the mineralization of spiramycin therefore the nzvi uv paa process could not only thoroughly degrade spiramycin but also further mineralize the majority of its tps the tps of spiramycin were traced using uplc ms ms to elucidate its removal mechanism fig 4 a additionally dma as an important tp was also quantified due to the molecular structure of spiramycin containing two dma functional groups dou et al 2021a fig 4 b a total of 15 types of tps were detected during the degradation of spiramycin and their characteristics and mass spectra were provided in table 1 and fig s7 among the tps tp663 tp699 tp830 tp845 and tp861 were first detected in this study due to the lack of standards except dma the peak intensities of tps were given instead the peak intensities of tp859 and tp891 were relatively higher and they increased to a maximum at 10 min and 30 min respectively and then decreased they were the mono and tertiary hydroxylation intermediates of spiramycin however the peak intensity of its secondary hydroxylation intermediate tp875 was found at a low level although tp859 tp875 and tp891 were also detected in the peroxydisulfate g c3n4 visible light irradiation system their variations were different dou et al 2021a this might be due to the different removal mechanisms o 2 and h were the main oxidizers in the previous study dou et al 2021a while oh and r c were the main reactive oxidizers in this study in contrast to other tps tp159 and tp335 continued to increase during the whole process in addition the majority of dma 86 0 was degraded after it was produced under the attack of oh and r c fig 4 b and text s4 based on the analysis of the structures of the detected tps the degradation pathway was proposed fig 4 c and then verified by dft analysis fig s8 and fig 4 d the results implied that spiramycin was degraded through four pathways in the nzvi uv paa system pathway 1 was initiated by electrophilic attack at the n atom position in the dma functional group which was located at the forosamine group and mycaminose group of spiramycin c1 and c12 positions in fig 4 c the 2fed2homo values of n68 and n94 in the dma group were much higher than those of other atoms 1 1532 and 0 7021 respectively suggesting that these sites were susceptible attack and underwent electrophilic reactions fig s8 under the electrophilic attack f fig 4 d at the positions of n68 and n94 one methyl group was lost ch3 tp289 1 and its isomer tp289 2 were formed and then tp814 was produced by a further electrophilic reaction ch3 these three tps were also detected in the peroxydisulfate g c3n4 visible light irradiation system dou et al 2021a therefore it was considered that electrophilic demethylation reactions frequently occurred during the degradation of spiramycin using aops tp845 tp829 1 o and tp830 tp814 o were the monohydroxylation intermediates of tp829 1 and tp814 the secondary hydroxylation intermediates of tp861 tp845 o could be formed by attacking the aldehyde group at the c11 position illustrated in fig 4 c el shaheny 2019 also reported that aldehyde groups in organic contaminants were easily attacked in aops to form carboxylic acid groups pathway 2 proceeded by continuous hydroxylation the fed2homo fed2lumo values of n68 and n94 in the dma group were also much higher 0 1056 and 0 1006 respectively fig s8 which suggested that in addition to electrophilic reaction these sites were also susceptible to proceed hydroxylation reactions f 0 fig 4 d when these two sites were attacked monohydroxylation intermediates of spiramycin such as tp859 1 and tp859 2 were formed previous studies el shaheny 2019 dou et al 2021a also indicated that amine groups in the structures of organic contaminants were easily oxidized to amine oxides tp875 was formed by further hydroxylation of tp859 in addition tp891 was formed due to the oxidation of the aldehyde group in tp875 to form carboxylic acid group in this study the hydroxylation was an important pathway as quenching experiments showed that 52 4 of spiramycin removal was contributed by oh pathway 3 and pathway 4 occurred due to the cleavage of the co bond three deoxysugars mycarose forosamine and mycaminose existed in the branch chain of spiramycin illustrated as i ii and iii in fig 4 c respectively these branches were all connected by the co bond positions of a b and c illustrated in fig 4 c as the co bond energy is small under the attack of oxidation radicals the bond is easily cleaved wang et al 2021 for pathway 3 the co bond at the position a was broken and tp699 was generated by the loss of mycarose tp699 was also detected in peroxydisulfate based aops and a monodehydration intermediate of tp681 was further generated wang et al 2021 however instead of a monodehydration intermediate a secondary dehydration intermediate of tp663 was detected in this study for pathway 4 the co bond at the position b was cleaved under the attack of oxidation radicals and tp685 was produced by the loss of forosamine furthermore the co bond at the position of was broken to produce tp352 and tp335 in addition as tp159 tp663 and tp335 contained dma functional groups dma could be generated from these three tps due to the cleavage of the nc bond 3 3 3 ndma fp assessment chloramination of spiramycin before and after reaction was conducted to assess the variations of ndma fp in the nzvi uv paa system fig 5 the ndma fp of spiramycin sharply decreased from 89 63 2 9 μg l to 31 15 2 3 μg l after the reaction suggesting that 65 2 of ndma fp had been reduced further calculations showed that the residual ndma fp was contributed by undegraded spiramycin dma and other unidentified precursors and they accounted for 8 8 58 7 and 32 5 respectively as the residuals of spiramycin and dma could be further degraded if the doses of nzvi and paa were increased data not shown a ndma fp reduction rate of 88 7 was expected once these residual fractions were well degraded 3 4 reuse performance of nzvi continuous degradation experiments were conducted to assess the reuse performance of nzvi fig s9 the results indicated that nzvi had significant reuse potential as after three cycles of reuse run 4 the removal efficiency of spiramycin only slightly decreased from 100 to 93 1 the stability of nzvi in the system was further confirmed by the results of multiple characterizations fig 6 fig s10 and fig s11 the core shell structure of nzvi can be observed clearly from hr tem images and the majority of particles were in the range of 40 100 nm before the reaction the nzvi particles appeared as chain like aggregates and the outside of the nzvi particles was very smooth fig 6 a however after the reaction slight corrosion outside the core shell of nzvi occurred fig 6 b to understand the elemental compositions of nzvi before and after the reaction edx analyses were conducted fig s10 iron fe 99 66 wt was the dominant element on the surface of nzvi before the reaction and very small amount of oxygen o was detected 0 34 wt as the purchased nzvi was stored in an anaerobic chamber the small quantity of o in the sample before the reaction was mostly due to the sample preparation for edx analysis after the reaction the o significantly increased to 7 19 wt and fe element decreased to 85 25 wt due to the leaching of fe2 the fe and o contents in nzvi were similar to those of nzvi based heterogeneous fenton systems mao et al 2019 wang et al 2016 in addition carbon c 7 53 wt and nitrogen n 0 03 wt also appeared and these two elements could be derived from spiramycin and its tps in addition to the micromorphology structure of nzvi xrd xps and raman analysis were also conducted the xrd patterns showed that strong characteristic peaks of 44 7 65 0 and 82 3 appeared before the reaction which were consistent with jcpds no 65 4899 results of zero valent iron fig 6 c however after the reaction in addition to the characteristic peaks of zero valent iron the characteristic peaks of iron oxides also appeared the characteristic peaks at 2θ values of 30 3 and 62 7 refer to the existence of fe2o3 and 2θ values of 35 4 and 57 2 refer to the existence of fe3o4 fe2o3 and fe3o4 are commonly detected iron oxides in fe0 based advanced oxidation systems li et al 2015 wang et al 2016 the results were consistent with the xps analysis fig s11 three characteristic peaks at 710 1 ev 712 1 ev and 723 8 ev corresponding to iron oxides were detected in the nzvi sample after the reaction the peak at 712 1 ev is assigned to fe 2p3 2 spin orbit peaks of fe2o3 while the peaks at 724 3 and 710 8 ev correspond to fe 2p1 2 and fe 2p3 2 spin orbit peaks of fe3o4 mao et al 2019 xiang et al 2021 the raman spectra of nzvi before and after the reaction further verified fe2o3 was the main iron oxides as the peak intensity was much higher than that of fe3o4 fig 6 d the bands for nzvi were at 217 280 388 and 595 cm 1 however these bands shifted to 210 276 and 382 cm 1 which were the characteristic peaks of fe2o3 liu et al 2017 compared to fe2o3 the peak intensities for fe3o4 were relatively lower with values of 310 540 and 670 cm 1 the above multiple characterizations indicated that although the passivation of nzvi might occur due to the oxidation reaction its structure was not affected therefore nzvi still had good performance for spiramycin removal when recycled three times 4 conclusions spiramycin 10 mg l could be completely removed in the nzvi uv paa system under the conditions of an initial ph of 4 0 a nzvi dose of 0 02 g l and a paa dose of 3 0 mg l 95 8 and 78 8 of paa and h2o2 were consumed during the process respectively epr analysis and quenching experiments confirmed that oh and r c were the main oxidizers for the spiramycin removal accounting for 52 4 and 44 8 respectively based on the tps tracing and dft analysis four degradation pathways of spiramycin were proposed and hydroxylation was found to be its main degradation pathway multiple characterization results showed that nzvi was stable in the system and even after being reused three times the removal efficiency of spiramycin was still above 93 in addition 65 2 of the ndma fp of spiramycin was reduced after the nzvi uv paa reaction therefore the nzvi uv paa process is a promising advanced oxidation technology not only for the removal of refractory ndma precursors such as spiramycin but also for significantly lowering the ndma fp

16603,simultaneous microorganism inactivation and organic microcontaminant removal in municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary effluents by the solar photo fenton process mediated by fe3 nta is studied in depth to achieve this objective different key aspects were addressed i the effect of initial fe3 nta concentration at 1 1 molar ratio 0 10 0 30 mm and h2o2 concentration 1 47 5 88 mm ii the effect of initial microorganism load 103 and 106 cfu ml and iii the impact of the disinfection target on treatment cost the first stage of this work was carried out in simulated wwtp effluent spiked with 100 µg l of imidacloprid imd as model microcontaminant and inoculated with escherichia coli e coli k 12 as reference strain in a pilot scale raceway pond reactor with 5 cm of liquid depth secondly the most cost effective conditions were validated in actual wwtp effluent the kinetic analysis revealed that increasing fe3 nta concentration over 0 20 mm does not significantly reduce treatment time due to the limited effect caused on the volumetric rate photon absorption treatment cost is determined by the disinfection process since imd removal was always faster than e coli inactivation the most cost effective strategy to achieve 10 cfu 100 ml of e coli regulation eu 2020 741 was 0 20 4 41 mm fe3 nta h2o2 with a cost of 0 32 m3 a less restrictive disinfection target 100 cfu 100 ml allowed reducing reactant concentration and cost 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 and 0 15 m3 respectively in both cases no regrowth at 24 h and more than 90 of imd removal were observed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords neutral ph escherichia coli tertiary treatment imidacloprid treatment cost 1 introduction both increasing urban development and climate change have generated growing concern among the scientific community to explore new efficient solutions to the lack of water in this context reusing water has been put forward as a good solution to solve the pressure on freshwater resources and the reuse of wastewater for crop irrigation is a very common practice michael kordatou et al 2018 however this type of water coming from the municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps presents problems associated with pathogens and pollutants in very low concentrations which can lead potential direct and indirect effects for the human health and environment such as transmission of infectious diseases kümmerer et al 2016 under these circumstances member states of the european union have proposed a minimum quality requirement mqr for reclaimed water reuse in agriculture irrigation approved by regulation 2020 741 of the european parliament and of the council of may 2020 this normative includes among others a bacterial indicator to monitor the quality of reclaimed water regulation eu 2020 741 in this regard escherichia coli e coli as well as total coliforms are presented as one of the most used indicators rizzo et al 2019 spain has developed a regulation of water reuse following the royal decree 1620 2007 royal decree 1620 2007 where the different uses for reclaimed water urban agricultural industrial recreational and environmental are established it is important to remark that the regulations previously mentioned will be hardened in a near future however in recent time there is special interest in a group of micropollutant called contaminants of emerging concern cecs found at very low concentrations rizzo et al 2019 the european community has elaborated a watch list updated periodically where 18 compounds are presented as potentially dangerous they must be specially controlled and monitored in this type of wastewater normative 2020 1161 eu commission implementing decision 2020 1161 eu of 4 august 2020 considering this problem the development of new low cost and environmentally sustainable treatments becomes especially necessary to improve or replace the conventional tertiary treatments chlorination and ozonation are the most applied tertiary treatments however they present several disadvantages on one hand the former generates disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids which are well known toxic compounds in addition cec removal during chlorination is almost negligible on the other hand the main disadvantage of ozonisation is the high electrical cost to produce ozone in situ brillas and garcia segura 2020 in this sense the advanced oxidation processes aops where the generation of non selective hydroxyl radicals ho presents significant advantages in depuration and disinfection processes has emerged as environmentally friendly alternative against conventional tertiary treatments such as chlorination or ozonation brillas and garcia segura 2020 in this sense solar photo fenton process has been presented as one of the most effective and simple aops with promising results in terms of microcontaminant degradation and bacterial inactivation villegas guzman et al 2017 a great part of this success is owed to the generation of ho generated as a result of the combination of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv vis radiation and the iron ions catalytic cycle fe2 fe3 in this sense ph is the main variable to carry out the photo fenton process accordingly acidic ph has been considered the optimum ph of the photo fenton reaction since iron remains dissolved in the water matrix pignatello et al 2006 however a growing number of researches has shown the possibility of working at neutral ph this fact allows reducing the acidification and neutralisation costs associated with the pre and post treatment stages respectively as well as to avoid the possible increase in terms of salinity of treated effluents ahile et al 2020a de luca et al 2015 lópez vinent et al 2020 miralles cuevas et al 2014 soriano molina et al 2018 2021b under these circumstances different operating options at neutral ph have been recently proposed with promising results in terms of microcontaminant removal as well as bacterial inactivation on the one hand the use of iron sulfate de la obra jiménez et al 2019 natural iron oxides abeledo lameiro et al 2019 and other iron sources such as monolithic catalysts martinez et al 2020 to drive heterogeneous photo fenton at natural ph has gained importance this strategy has shown good results in terms of bacterial inactivation but the microcontaminant removal results are not yet competitive with those obtained working under homogeneous photo fenton process maniakova et al 2020 on the other hand the use of complexes based on iron chelates to facilitate a homogeneous photo fenton at neutral ph has also grown in importance in this regard several types of mono poly carboxylic acid and aminopolycarboxylic acid have been studied in recent years prominent amongst them are ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta citric acid ca oxalic acid oa as well as nitrilotriacetic acid nta as the most commonly used giannakis et al 2016b the use of edta is not recommended due to it confers high toxicity levels whilst both edds and nta are presented as highly biodegradable chelating agents commonly used in industrial applications ahile et al 2020a continuing with this approach both chelating agents of iron showed excellent results for microcontaminant removal mejri et al 2020 however although both have reported similar removal efficiencies nta has shown some advantages with respect to the use of edds such as a greater stability against hydroxyl radicals as well as being significantly less expensive dong et al 2019 however few studies are found in bibliography addressing in depth the disinfection process mediated by chelating agents lópez vinent et al 2020 in this line ahile et al 2020a showed that one of the disadvantages of using these complexing agents for bacterial inactivation by solar photo fenton process is the high chelator concentration required to carry out the process ahile et al 2020a consequently this is a fact that must be considered in future studies where these types of chelating agents are used on the other hand although the study of general reaction mechanism of the photo fenton process at neutral ph with fe3 ligand for microcontaminant removal has been studied by several authors de luca et al 2015 miralles cuevas et al 2018 soriano molina et al 2018 there is a lack of information with regard to the dominant inactivation mechanisms in the specific case of microcontaminant removal using fe3 nta complex the reaction mechanism has been recently reported by soriano molina et al 2021c consequently more studies concerning bacterial inactivation are required as for the experimental scale most of the studies on solar photo fenton with nta were conducted at laboratory scale de luca et al 2015 soriano molina et al 2021c being necessary more studies at pilot plant scale in this regard the study carried out by mejri et al 2020 compared for the first time the use of both edds and nta for solar photo fenton in raceway pond reactors rpr this study established 0 1 mm fe3 nta and 0 88 mm h2o2 as the most cost effective concentrations for both chelating agents in terms of microcontaminant degradation mejri et al 2020 it is important to remark that it was observed a strong effect of fenton like reaction on the kinetics of microcontaminant removal encouraging to increase the reactant concentrations in futures studies considering all the aspects mentioned above this work presents for the first time a study on the effect of reactant concentration on the simultaneous bacterial inactivation and microcontaminant removal by the solar photo fenton process at neutral ph mediated by the fe3 nta complex in an rpr at two initial bacterial loads different fe3 nta concentrations 1 1 molar ratio in the range from 0 10 to 0 30 mm and different h2o2 concentrations in the range from 1 47 to 5 88 mm were used in simulated wwtp effluent to inactivate two initial loads of e coli k 12 106 cfu ml and 103 cfu ml and simultaneously remove 100 µg l of imidacloprid imd selected as a model microcontaminant these concentrations of bacteria and microcontaminant were chosen as representative of those usually found in actual wwtp secondary effluents de la obra et al 2019 soriano molina et al 2021c afterwards the most cost effective strategy was validated in actual wwtp effluent bacterial regrowth at 24 h of post treatment was also evaluated to gain know how about the effect of the process on bacteria inactivation and the possibility of

competitive and ii not add more than 22 mg l of toc with the nta addition toc values lower than 30 mg l does not significantly affect the microcontaminant removal efficiency lópez vinent et al 2020 miralles cuevas et al 2014 nahim granados et al 2019 on the other hand the cost of 0 45 m3 is established based on an average irrigation water price which vary substantially within and between countries but these are ranged from 0 10 to 0 80 m3 depending mainly on the tertiary treatment applied as well as geographic location giannakis et al 2016a the following approaches were addressed a effect of the fe3 nta h2o2 concentration on e coli inactivation and imd removal the first experimental set was carried out in simulated wwtp secondary effluent doped with 100 µg l of imd which roughly represents the total load of microcontaminants usually found in wwtp effluents soriano molina et al 2021c this compound was selected as model microcontaminant because it is included in the eu watch list in decision 2018 840 eu of 5 june 2018 commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 of 5 june 2018 the treatment goal was to reach 90 degradation of imd which can be confidently monitored by uplc uv dad without need to use advanced analytical techniques mejri et al 2020 soriano molina et al 2021c e coli concentrations can be found in wwtp secondary effluents in the range of 103 106 cfu ml for this reason inactivation kinetics were evaluated for these two initial e coli concentrations the initial fe3 nta concentrations tested were 0 10 0 20 0 25 and 0 30 mm at 1 1 molar ratio h2o2 concentration was varied from 1 47 mm to 5 88 mm these values correspond to the range of h2o2 concentrations reported in literature ahile et al 2021 2020b mejri et al 2020 villegas guzman et al 2017 a validation in actual wwtp secondary effluent in this stage the most cost effective strategy for microcontaminant removal according to soriano molina et al 2021a and the most cost effective strategy for simultaneous bacteria inactivation and microcontaminant removal found in this work were evaluated in terms of e coli inactivation at 103 cfu ml and imd removal at 100 µg l in actual wwtp secondary effluent 2 4 outdoor experiments in rpr all the experiments were carried out in a 5 cm deep rpr pilot plant fig 1 located at the solar energy research center ciesol university of almería spain the total volume of the system is 19 l with 0 38 m2 of illuminated area all experiments in simulated wwtp secondary effluent were carried out in summer july 2020 with an average temperature of 34 1 c and 35 2 w m2 of average solar uva radiation while the validation experiments in actual wwtp secondary effluent were carried out in september 2020 at 27 2 c

monitored with probes connected to a labjack usb ethernet data logging device concerning the radiation field in the reactor the concept of average volumetric rate of photon absorption vrpa which combines the effect of light absorption and reactor geometry was used to evaluate the effect of light absorption on the kinetics of the process in section 3 1 it was calculated as the sum of vrpa

prepared according to the recipe shown in section 2 2 in addition imd solution in deionized water was prepared 50 mg l to be used for one week rpr was filled with simulated or actual wwtp effluent spiked with 100 µg l of imd and inoculated with 106 or 103 cfu ml and homogenized for 5 min then h2o2 1 47 2 94 4 41 or 5 88 mm was added and mixed for 5 min fe3 nta complex previously prepared by dissolving fe2 so4 3 h2o 0 10 0 20 0 25 or 0 30 mm in deionized water at ph 3 and adding nta at molar ratio 1 1 from a 300 mm stock solution in basic medium afterwards the reactor was uncovered and the solar photo fenton process started samples were collected for 120 min in addition bacterial regrowth was assessed 24 h after treatment catalase 50 µl ml was added in all samples to remove residual h2o2 all assays were replicated figures show the average values and error is shown as standard deviation 2 6 analytical measurement imd and fe3 nta were quantified and monitored by ultra pressure liquid chromatography equipped with a uv diode array detector uhplc dad agilent technologies 1200 series instrument the injection vial for imd was prepared by filtering 1 ml of sample and adding 30 µl of catalase in order to decompose residual h2o2 in addition to determine the concentration of fe3 nta 10 μl of acetic acid were added to the vials in this way the sample was acidified to ph 3 avoiding fe3 nta decomposition after sampling soriano molina et al 2021c imd and fe3 nta method are described in mejri et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the detection wavelengths for imd and fe3 nta were 270 nm and 254 nm with a limit of quantification loq of 0 54 µg l for imd and 2 10 4 mm for fe3 nta respectively the concentration of total dissolved iron fe and h2o2 were quantified according to 1 10

23631 was selected as model microorganism the different steps for its preparation are described as follows firstly the strain was inoculated the day immediately preceding the experiments from a chromocult stock selective medium merck kgaa germany and incubated at 37 c with constant agitation in a rotary shaker under aerobic conditions once this time has lapsed bacteria were collected after 20h of incubation which corresponds to a concentration of 109 cfu ml to reach the desired initial bacterial concentration for the experiments 103 and 106 cfu ml different dilutions were carried out finally the e coli k 12 concentration was determined using the plate counting technique with saline solution 0 8 nacl in chromocult selective medium merck kgaa germany two detection limits were used dla 10 cfu 100 ml in concordance with the required concentration in the new regulation eu 2020 741 of the european parliament and of the council of 25 may 2020 for water reuse for this purpose filters of 0 45 μm pore size cellulose nitrate membrane sartorius were used these filters where plated in chromocult medium and incubated at 37 c for 24h and dlb 100 cfu 100 ml in concordance with the required concentration in the spanish regulation currently in force for water reuse to this end different volumes of sample were plated achieving in the last sample the desired detection limit then colonies were counted after 24 h of incubation 2 8 cost assessment total treatment cost was assessed as the sum of the rpr investment capital and the operating costs costs were estimated based on a

simultaneous e coli inactivation and imd removal in simulated wwtp secondary effluents firstly control assays of e coli inactivation in wwtp secondary effluents were conducted no inactivation was observed for the isolated effects of iron complex and h2o2 and only sunlight h2o2 provoked e coli inactivation at long treatment times as previously reported ortega gómez et al 2014 villegas guzman et al 2017 imd was also monitored without any removal for the isolated effect of iron complex h2o2 and sunlight h2o2 as for solar photolysis it was almost negligible 20 in 60 min in comparison with solar photo fenton 80 in 30 min soriano molina et al 2021c afterwards the solar photo fenton process mediated by fe3 nta for simultaneous e coli inactivation and imd removal was assessed to put it briefly the main steps of the reaction mechanism with fe3 nta described in soriano molina et al 2021c are the following under solar uva radiation fe3 nta is photo reduced to fe2 yielding ho r1 the generated fe2 is oxidized by h2o2 through the fenton reaction r2 giving rise to ho and ferric iron which instantaneously precipitates at neutral ph in addition fe3 nta reacts with h2o2 r3 fenton like generating superoxide radical anion and fe2 nta which is oxidized by h2o2 yielding ho through the fenton reaction r4 soriano molina et al 2021c these radicals are responsible for microcontaminant oxidation and microorganism inactivation moreover it is known that internal photo fenton due to the h2o2 diffusion inside the cells can damage the internal dna causing bacterial inactivation giannakis et al 2018 lópez vinent et al 2020 r1 o h f e 3 n t a h v f e 2 n t a h o r2 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o r3 f e 3 n t a h 2 o 2 f e 2 n t a o 2 r4 f e 2 n t a h 2 o 2 f e 3 n t a h o h o fig 2 shows the profiles of reagent consumption e coli inactivation at 106 cfu ml and imd removal as a function of the initial concentrations of reagents the main feature is the longer time needed for disinfection 1 1 5 hours compared with microcontaminant removal a few minutes bacterial inactivation profiles fig 2a show a lag phase in which the concentration remained constant the lag phase lasted up to 40 min depending on the reagent concentrations then a log linear drop is observed this drop is mainly attributed to the accumulation of damages on the external cell membrane of bacteria caused by ho generated in the photo fenton process r1 4 nahim granados et al 2019 and the direct photonic damages casado et al 2021 with the reagent concentrations commonly used for microcontaminant removal in rprs 0 10 mm fe3 nta and 1 47 mm h2o2 a reduction of 4 logs was achieved in 120 min although the dlb was not reached it must be considered that after 60 min of reaction when e coli concentration began to decrease fe3 nta had almost been completely decomposed and more than 80 of h2o2 had been consumed which points out the need for stronger oxidation conditions for e coli inactivation nonetheless these concentrations of fe3 nta and h2o2 were enough to remove imd below the loq in 30 min in concordance with a previous work soriano molina et al 2021c increasing the initial concentration of fe3 nta to 0 20 mm with 1 47 mm of h2o2 made only possible to reduce 1 log of e coli concentration this was due to the increase in complex concentration which gave rise to a fast h2o2 consumption being totally consumed after 40 min of reaction that is the process was limited by h2o2 this phenomenon did not affect imd removal as the loq was reached at 30 min although the increase in the initial concentration of h2o2 to 2 94 mm led to faster e coli inactivation and imd removal rates in comparison with the use of 0 10 mm fe3 nta and 1 47 mm h2o2 disinfection below the dlb was neither achieved under these conditions the concentration of reagents remaining in the reaction bulk after 120 min were 0 004 mm of fe3 nta 0 2 mg l of fe3 and 0 11 mm of h2o2 3 7 mg l with 0 20 mm of fe3 nta and 4 41 mm of h2o2 although the complex was totally photodegraded in 70 min both imd removal and e coli inactivation below the dlb 100 cfu 100 ml were achieved in 10 min and 105 min of reaction respectively and the residual concentration of h2o2 was 0 55 mm these results point out the impact of the h2o2 concentration in combination with solar uva radiation on bacterial inactivation in concordance with previous works fiorentino et al 2015 maniakova et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that there was no regrowth above the dla after 24 hours with higher reagent concentrations 0 25 mm fe3 nta 2 94 mm h2o2 and 0 30 mm fe3 nta 5 88 mm h2o2 inactivation times were reduced to 80 and 60 min respectively these results reveal that when simultaneous disinfection and microcontaminant removal is the treatment goal disinfection is by far the limiting step fig 3 shows the pseudo first order rate constants corresponding to reagent consumption imd removal and e coli inactivation with r2 ranging from 0 978 to 0 992 as for bacterial inactivation according to nahim granados et al 2019 the chick watson law can be used to fit experimental data showing a log linear decay eq 3 model 1 whereas eq 4 model 2 is proposed to fit the inactivation of e coli population with a shoulder phase or lag stage followed by a log linear decrease 3 ln n n 0 k t 4 ln n n 0 k t 0 t t l a g k t t l a g t t l a g where n n 0 represents the bacterial concentration drop k is the pseudo first order kinetic constant min 1 t is the treatment time min and t l a g is the duration of the shoulder phase or lag stage min model 1 was used to calculate the pseudo first order kinetic constants for 0 25 4 41 and 0 30 5 88 fe3 nta h2o2 concentrations while model 2 was only used for the cases where a lag stage was observed with 0 10 1 47 and 0 20 1 47 fe3 nta h2o2 concentrations tlag was 40 min whereas with 0 20 2 94 and 0 20 4 41 tlag was reduced to 20 min photodecomposition of fe3 nta is the principal reaction in the mechanism although the roles of h2o2 and light availability must be discussed it must be considered that the liquid depth in the reactor geometrical variable was 5 cm and the solar uva irradiance was around 35 w m2 in all the tests consequently the vrpa only varied as a function of fe3 nta concentration at 1 47 mm h2o2 the increase in fe3 nta from 0 10 mm vrpa 389 µe m3 s to 0 20 mm vrpa 638 µe m3 s gave rise to increasing the kinetic constant of fe3 nta decomposition along with an increase in the rate constant for h2o2 consumption and imd removal but not for e coli inactivation due to the prompt drop in h2o2 concentration which stopped the process of bacterial damage and avoided inactivation this limitation was prevented at 2 94 mm h2o2 however the use of fe3 nta concentrations higher than 0 20 mm 0 25 mm of fe3 nta 4 41 mm of h2o2 and 0 30 mm of fe3 nta 5 88 mm of h2o2 in mild excess of h2o2 did not substantially improved the rate constants of fe3 nta photodecomposition and h2o2 consumption with values in the range of experimental error this is due to the lower increase in vrpa 27 when increasing the initial concentration of iron from 0 20 mm to 0 30 mm than from 0 10 to 0 20 mm 64 as in this case h2o2 does not limit the kinetics and fe3 nta decomposition only depends on radiation absorption in contrast this increase in vrpa was enough to lead to the generation of a higher amount of hydroxyl radicals that caused a 1 4 increase in the rate constant of imidacloprid as for e coli inactivation there was a clear effect of h2o2 concentration as shown at 0 20 mm fe3 nta 1 47 and 2 94 mm h2o2 limited the inactivation rate meanwhile at 4 41 mm h2o2 the inactivation rate constant became independent of fe3 nta this points out the difference in the mechanisms of microcontaminant removal and bacterial inactivation as discussed elsewhere casado et al 2021 3 2 effect of initial bacterial load on simultaneous e coli inactivation and imd removal in simulated wwtp effluent considering the above discussed limitation due to h2o2 four fe3 nta h2o2 concentrations 0 10 1 47 0 20 4 41 0 25 4 41 and 0 30 5 88 mm were assayed for the treatment of the simulated wwtp secondary effluent with 103 cfu ml of e coli and 100 µg l of imd as expected the bacterial concentration had negligible effect on the kinetics of fe3 nta photodegradation h2o2 consumption and imd removal with rate constants similar to those obtained at the higher e coli concentration fig 4 pointing out the replicability of the treatment as for e coli inactivation the main change at 0 10 and 0 20 mm fe3 nta concentration is the lack of shoulder in addition the rate constants of e coli inactivation decreased between 32 and 42 regarding those obtained at 106 cfu ml of initial load which points out that bacterial concentration has a significant effect on the inactivation kinetics in general the h2o2 residual concentration was approximately 20 of the initial one only when 0 10 1 47 fe3 nta h2o2 concentration was used the h2o2 residual concentration was 0 24 mm 8 1 mg l in the other cases the h2o2 residual concentration was higher than 0 88 mm 30 mg l without exceeding 1 18 mm 40 mg l which ensures the bactericidal effect below dla after 24 h the treatment cost will vary depending on the initial bacterial concentration and the required quality of reclaimed water in terms of disinfection limits in this regard the treatment cost was calculated according to soriano molina et al 2021a the main drawback for solar photo fenton process with complexing agents for disinfection purpose is the large amount of chelator that is added increasing the operating costs as well as organic content in solution ahile et al 2020a which is also usually translated into higher treatment times initially the operating conditions used in this study were selected in order to not to exceed 0 45 m3 since this can be considered a good reference cost for a tertiary treatment e coli inactivation determined the total treatment cost because it required a higher treatment time than imd removal as shown in fig 5 the most cost effective strategy was 0 20 4 41 fe3 nta h2o2 concentration which resulted in 0 32 m3 23 due to cost of fe3 nta to reach dla however the most adequate treatment depends on the reclaimed water quality requirements the results showed that the total treatment costs can be reduced almost 50 depending on the water quality requirements in this regard 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 with an estimated cost of 0 15 m3 could be the most cost effective strategy if attaining dlb is the disinfection target soriano molina et al 2021b reported that the total cost for 0 10 0 88 mm fe3 edds h2o2 concentration carried out in an rpr and considering 50 m3 h of water flow rate was close to 0 49 m3 in this case the operating cost represented 98 of total cost since edds is very expensive nahim granados et al 2020 reported a total cost of 2 1 m3 when the treatment was carried out using ethylenediamine n n bis 2 hydroxyphenylacetic acid eddha as chelating agent with 0 045 0 58 mm fe3 eddha h2o2 of initial concentrations this significant difference between treatment costs is mainly related to the low flow rate considered 2 8 m3 h and the selected photo reactor since the experiments were carried out in a compound parabolic collector cpc pilot plant which represented 94 of the total cost whereas eddha only represented 3 of the total cost 3 3 validation in actual wwtp secondary effluents once the effect of the different initial conditions of fe3 nta h2o2 was studied in simulated wwtp secondary effluent the next step was to assess the kinetics of the process when applied to actual wwtp secondary effluents to this end two different operating conditions were studied i the most cost effective strategy for microcontaminant removal according to soriano molina et al 2021c 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 and ii the most cost effective strategy for simultaneous bacterial inactivation and microcontaminant removal obtained in this work 0 20 4 41 mm fe3 nta h2o2 concentrations e coli was completely removed bellow dla in 60 min when 0 20 4 41 mm fe3 nta h2o2 was used and the residual concentrations of h2o2 and dissolved iron were 1 8 mm 61 mg l and 0 015 mm 0 8 mg l respectively while 120 min were needed for 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 with 0 66 mm 22 mg l and 0 004 mm 0 2 mg l of residual concentrations fig 6 a it is important to remark that there was bacterial regrowth above dla 10 cfu 100 ml 24 h after the treatment when working with 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 but there was no regrowth above dlb 100 cfu 100 ml which agrees with the results obtained in simulated wwtp effluents it is interesting to highlight the different behavior between microcontaminant removal and bacterial inactivation on the one hand fetotal precipitation fe3 nta photo degradation h2o2 consumption and imd removal were slowed down when compared to the experiments in simulated wwtp effluent fig 6 this effect can be attributed to the lower uva irradiance 35 vs 21 w m2 section 2 4 and the different effluent characteristics turbidity ph sulfates chloride organic matter content among others actual wwtp secondary effluent of this study contained high concentrations of sulfates 330 mg l and chlorine 654 mg l compared with simulated wwtp effluents these constituents are scavengers of ho and probably the formation of secondary radicals generate other oxidizing species so4 cl2 o2 that have lower oxidation potential than ho thus limiting reaction rate on the other hand despite the lower kinetic constants when applying the solar photo fenton process at neutral ph in actual wwtp secondary effluent fig 7 b the rate constants of e coli inactivation were similar to those shown in fig 4 for both sets of fe3 nta h2o2 concentrations this fact remarks the difference in the mechanisms of microcontaminant removal and bacterial inactivation and the need for integrated kinetics models 4 conclusions these results reveal for the first time the most cost effective conditions at pilot plant scale for simultaneous bacterial inactivation and microcontaminant removal by solar photo fenton process with fe3 nta validated in actual wwtp effluent it was observed that increasing the fe3 nta h2o2 concentration from 0 10 1 47 to 0 20 4 41 mm allows achieving e coli inactivation below 10 cfu 100 ml without regrowth at 24 h and more than 90 of imd removal with residual concentrations of h2o2 and dissolved iron lower than 1 5 mm and 0 003 mm respectively the vrpa increased till 64 when initial fe3 nta concentration was increased from 0 10 to 0 20 mm however increasing the fe3 nta concentration from 0 20 to 0 30 mm the increase in vrpa was lower 27 causing a lower improvement of imd and e coli kinetic constants the treatment cost mainly depends on the disinfection target the most cost effective strategy being 0 20 4 41 mm fe3 nta h2o2 to achieve 10 cfu 100 ml with an estimated cost of 0 32 m3 however since 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 is enough to achieve 100 cfu 100 ml without regrowth after 24 h this option would allow decreasing treatment cost by almost 50 in both cases microcontaminant removal is attained as this process is much faster than bacterial inactivation declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors wish to thank the spanish ministry

16603,simultaneous microorganism inactivation and organic microcontaminant removal in municipal wastewater treatment plant wwtp secondary effluents by the solar photo fenton process mediated by fe3 nta is studied in depth to achieve this objective different key aspects were addressed i the effect of initial fe3 nta concentration at 1 1 molar ratio 0 10 0 30 mm and h2o2 concentration 1 47 5 88 mm ii the effect of initial microorganism load 103 and 106 cfu ml and iii the impact of the disinfection target on treatment cost the first stage of this work was carried out in simulated wwtp effluent spiked with 100 µg l of imidacloprid imd as model microcontaminant and inoculated with escherichia coli e coli k 12 as reference strain in a pilot scale raceway pond reactor with 5 cm of liquid depth secondly the most cost effective conditions were validated in actual wwtp effluent the kinetic analysis revealed that increasing fe3 nta concentration over 0 20 mm does not significantly reduce treatment time due to the limited effect caused on the volumetric rate photon absorption treatment cost is determined by the disinfection process since imd removal was always faster than e coli inactivation the most cost effective strategy to achieve 10 cfu 100 ml of e coli regulation eu 2020 741 was 0 20 4 41 mm fe3 nta h2o2 with a cost of 0 32 m3 a less restrictive disinfection target 100 cfu 100 ml allowed reducing reactant concentration and cost 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 and 0 15 m3 respectively in both cases no regrowth at 24 h and more than 90 of imd removal were observed graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords neutral ph escherichia coli tertiary treatment imidacloprid treatment cost 1 introduction both increasing urban development and climate change have generated growing concern among the scientific community to explore new efficient solutions to the lack of water in this context reusing water has been put forward as a good solution to solve the pressure on freshwater resources and the reuse of wastewater for crop irrigation is a very common practice michael kordatou et al 2018 however this type of water coming from the municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps presents problems associated with pathogens and pollutants in very low concentrations which can lead potential direct and indirect effects for the human health and environment such as transmission of infectious diseases kümmerer et al 2016 under these circumstances member states of the european union have proposed a minimum quality requirement mqr for reclaimed water reuse in agriculture irrigation approved by regulation 2020 741 of the european parliament and of the council of may 2020 this normative includes among others a bacterial indicator to monitor the quality of reclaimed water regulation eu 2020 741 in this regard escherichia coli e coli as well as total coliforms are presented as one of the most used indicators rizzo et al 2019 spain has developed a regulation of water reuse following the royal decree 1620 2007 royal decree 1620 2007 where the different uses for reclaimed water urban agricultural industrial recreational and environmental are established it is important to remark that the regulations previously mentioned will be hardened in a near future however in recent time there is special interest in a group of micropollutant called contaminants of emerging concern cecs found at very low concentrations rizzo et al 2019 the european community has elaborated a watch list updated periodically where 18 compounds are presented as potentially dangerous they must be specially controlled and monitored in this type of wastewater normative 2020 1161 eu commission implementing decision 2020 1161 eu of 4 august 2020 considering this problem the development of new low cost and environmentally sustainable treatments becomes especially necessary to improve or replace the conventional tertiary treatments chlorination and ozonation are the most applied tertiary treatments however they present several disadvantages on one hand the former generates disinfection by products dbps such as trihalomethanes and haloacetic acids which are well known toxic compounds in addition cec removal during chlorination is almost negligible on the other hand the main disadvantage of ozonisation is the high electrical cost to produce ozone in situ brillas and garcia segura 2020 in this sense the advanced oxidation processes aops where the generation of non selective hydroxyl radicals ho presents significant advantages in depuration and disinfection processes has emerged as environmentally friendly alternative against conventional tertiary treatments such as chlorination or ozonation brillas and garcia segura 2020 in this sense solar photo fenton process has been presented as one of the most effective and simple aops with promising results in terms of microcontaminant degradation and bacterial inactivation villegas guzman et al 2017 a great part of this success is owed to the generation of ho generated as a result of the combination of hydrogen peroxide h2o2 uv vis radiation and the iron ions catalytic cycle fe2 fe3 in this sense ph is the main variable to carry out the photo fenton process accordingly acidic ph has been considered the optimum ph of the photo fenton reaction since iron remains dissolved in the water matrix pignatello et al 2006 however a growing number of researches has shown the possibility of working at neutral ph this fact allows reducing the acidification and neutralisation costs associated with the pre and post treatment stages respectively as well as to avoid the possible increase in terms of salinity of treated effluents ahile et al 2020a de luca et al 2015 lópez vinent et al 2020 miralles cuevas et al 2014 soriano molina et al 2018 2021b under these circumstances different operating options at neutral ph have been recently proposed with promising results in terms of microcontaminant removal as well as bacterial inactivation on the one hand the use of iron sulfate de la obra jiménez et al 2019 natural iron oxides abeledo lameiro et al 2019 and other iron sources such as monolithic catalysts martinez et al 2020 to drive heterogeneous photo fenton at natural ph has gained importance this strategy has shown good results in terms of bacterial inactivation but the microcontaminant removal results are not yet competitive with those obtained working under homogeneous photo fenton process maniakova et al 2020 on the other hand the use of complexes based on iron chelates to facilitate a homogeneous photo fenton at neutral ph has also grown in importance in this regard several types of mono poly carboxylic acid and aminopolycarboxylic acid have been studied in recent years prominent amongst them are ethylenediamine n n disuccinic acid edds ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta citric acid ca oxalic acid oa as well as nitrilotriacetic acid nta as the most commonly used giannakis et al 2016b the use of edta is not recommended due to it confers high toxicity levels whilst both edds and nta are presented as highly biodegradable chelating agents commonly used in industrial applications ahile et al 2020a continuing with this approach both chelating agents of iron showed excellent results for microcontaminant removal mejri et al 2020 however although both have reported similar removal efficiencies nta has shown some advantages with respect to the use of edds such as a greater stability against hydroxyl radicals as well as being significantly less expensive dong et al 2019 however few studies are found in bibliography addressing in depth the disinfection process mediated by chelating agents lópez vinent et al 2020 in this line ahile et al 2020a showed that one of the disadvantages of using these complexing agents for bacterial inactivation by solar photo fenton process is the high chelator concentration required to carry out the process ahile et al 2020a consequently this is a fact that must be considered in future studies where these types of chelating agents are used on the other hand although the study of general reaction mechanism of the photo fenton process at neutral ph with fe3 ligand for microcontaminant removal has been studied by several authors de luca et al 2015 miralles cuevas et al 2018 soriano molina et al 2018 there is a lack of information with regard to the dominant inactivation mechanisms in the specific case of microcontaminant removal using fe3 nta complex the reaction mechanism has been recently reported by soriano molina et al 2021c consequently more studies concerning bacterial inactivation are required as for the experimental scale most of the studies on solar photo fenton with nta were conducted at laboratory scale de luca et al 2015 soriano molina et al 2021c being necessary more studies at pilot plant scale in this regard the study carried out by mejri et al 2020 compared for the first time the use of both edds and nta for solar photo fenton in raceway pond reactors rpr this study established 0 1 mm fe3 nta and 0 88 mm h2o2 as the most cost effective concentrations for both chelating agents in terms of microcontaminant degradation mejri et al 2020 it is important to remark that it was observed a strong effect of fenton like reaction on the kinetics of microcontaminant removal encouraging to increase the reactant concentrations in futures studies considering all the aspects mentioned above this work presents for the first time a study on the effect of reactant concentration on the simultaneous bacterial inactivation and microcontaminant removal by the solar photo fenton process at neutral ph mediated by the fe3 nta complex in an rpr at two initial bacterial loads different fe3 nta concentrations 1 1 molar ratio in the range from 0 10 to 0 30 mm and different h2o2 concentrations in the range from 1 47 to 5 88 mm were used in simulated wwtp effluent to inactivate two initial loads of e coli k 12 106 cfu ml and 103 cfu ml and simultaneously remove 100 µg l of imidacloprid imd selected as a model microcontaminant these concentrations of bacteria and microcontaminant were chosen as representative of those usually found in actual wwtp secondary effluents de la obra et al 2019 soriano molina et al 2021c afterwards the most cost effective strategy was validated in actual wwtp effluent bacterial regrowth at 24 h of post treatment was also evaluated to gain know how about the effect of the process on bacteria inactivation and the possibility of reusing reclaimed water in agricultural irrigation di cesare et al 2020a 2 materials and methods 2 1 reagents and chemicals imidacloprid imd 97 9 w w nitrilotriacetic acid nta 99 w w acacia gum powder

effluents to assess different operating conditions is not advised due to the variability in its characteristics so that simulated wwtp secondary effluent was selected for the first investigation stage afterwards actual secondary effluents from a wwtp located in almería south of spain was used in the last stages to validate the best operating conditions proposed the recipe of simulated wwtp secondary effluent is described as follows rivas et al 2015 caso4 2h2o 60 mg l mgso4 60 mg l kcl 4 mg l nh4 2so4 23 6 mg l k2hpo4 7 0 mg l nahco3 96 mg l beef extract 1 8 mg l peptone 2 7 mg l humic

7 0 to 7 5 2 3 experimental work plan to select the concentrations of fe3 nta and h2o2 two key aspects were considered i not exceed 0 45 m3 of operating costs since a higher treatment cost is not competitive and ii not add more than 22 mg l of toc with the nta addition toc values lower than 30 mg l does not significantly affect the microcontaminant removal efficiency lópez vinent et al 2020 miralles cuevas et al 2014 nahim granados et al 2019 on the other hand the cost of 0 45 m3 is established based on an average irrigation water price which vary substantially within and between countries but these are ranged from 0 10 to 0 80 m3 depending mainly on the tertiary treatment applied as well as geographic location giannakis et al 2016a the following approaches were addressed a effect of the fe3 nta h2o2 concentration on e coli inactivation and imd removal the first experimental set was carried out in simulated wwtp secondary effluent doped with 100 µg l of imd which roughly represents the total load of microcontaminants usually found in wwtp effluents soriano molina et al 2021c this compound was selected as model microcontaminant because it is included in the eu watch list in decision 2018 840 eu of 5 june 2018 commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 commission implementing decision eu 2018 840 of 5 june 2018 the treatment goal was to reach 90 degradation of imd which can be confidently monitored by uplc uv dad without need to use advanced analytical techniques mejri et al 2020 soriano molina et al 2021c e coli concentrations can be found in wwtp secondary effluents in the range of 103 106 cfu ml for this reason inactivation kinetics were evaluated for these two initial e coli concentrations the initial fe3 nta concentrations tested were 0 10 0 20 0 25 and 0 30 mm at 1 1 molar ratio h2o2 concentration was varied from 1 47 mm to 5 88 mm these values correspond to the range of h2o2 concentrations reported in literature ahile et al 2021 2020b mejri et al 2020 villegas guzman et al 2017 a validation in actual wwtp secondary effluent in this stage the most cost effective strategy for microcontaminant removal according to soriano molina et al 2021a and the most cost effective strategy for simultaneous bacteria inactivation and microcontaminant removal found in this work were evaluated in terms of e coli inactivation at 103 cfu ml and imd removal at 100 µg l in actual wwtp secondary effluent 2 4 outdoor experiments in rpr all the experiments were carried out in a 5 cm deep rpr pilot plant fig 1 located at the solar energy research center ciesol university of almería spain the total volume of the system is 19 l with 0 38 m2 of illuminated area all experiments in simulated wwtp secondary effluent were carried out in summer july 2020 with an average temperature of 34 1 c and 35 2 w m2 of average solar uva radiation while the validation experiments in actual wwtp secondary effluent were carried out in september 2020 at 27 2 c

monitored with probes connected to a labjack usb ethernet data logging device concerning the radiation field in the reactor the concept of average volumetric rate of photon absorption vrpa which combines the effect of light absorption and reactor geometry was used to evaluate the effect of light absorption on the kinetics of the process in section 3 1 it was calculated as the sum of vrpa

used to convert data in w m2 into einstein m2 s 2 5 experimental procedure one day before experimentation the inoculum of e coli was grown 109 cfu ml and the simulated wwtp secondary effluent was prepared according to the recipe shown in section 2 2 in addition imd solution in deionized water was prepared 50 mg l to be used for one week rpr was filled with simulated or actual wwtp effluent spiked with 100 µg l of imd and inoculated with 106 or 103 cfu ml and homogenized for 5 min then h2o2 1 47 2 94 4 41 or 5 88 mm was added and mixed for 5 min fe3 nta complex previously prepared by dissolving fe2 so4 3 h2o 0 10 0 20 0 25 or 0 30 mm in deionized water at ph 3 and adding nta at molar ratio 1 1 from a 300 mm stock solution in basic medium afterwards the reactor was uncovered and the solar photo fenton process started samples were collected for 120 min in addition bacterial regrowth was assessed 24 h after treatment catalase 50 µl ml was added in all samples to remove residual h2o2 all assays were replicated figures show the average values and error is shown as standard deviation 2 6 analytical measurement imd and fe3 nta were quantified and monitored by ultra pressure liquid chromatography equipped with a uv diode array detector uhplc dad agilent technologies 1200 series instrument the injection vial for imd was prepared by filtering 1 ml of sample and adding 30 µl of catalase in order to decompose residual h2o2 in addition to determine the concentration of fe3 nta 10 μl of acetic acid were added to the vials in this way the sample was acidified to ph 3 avoiding fe3 nta decomposition after sampling soriano molina et al 2021c imd and fe3 nta method are described in mejri et al 2020 zhang et al 2017 the detection wavelengths for imd and fe3 nta were 270 nm and 254 nm with a limit of quantification loq of 0 54 µg l for imd and 2 10 4 mm for fe3 nta respectively the concentration of total dissolved iron fe and h2o2 were quantified according to 1 10

compact ic pro more details about the methods and limits of quantifications loqs are described elsewhere soriano molina et al 2019 2 7 enumeration and quantification of microorganisms e coli k 12 atcc 23631 was selected as model microorganism the different steps for its preparation are described as follows firstly the strain was inoculated the day immediately preceding the experiments from a chromocult stock selective medium merck kgaa germany and incubated at 37 c with constant agitation in a rotary shaker under aerobic conditions once this time has lapsed bacteria were collected after 20h of incubation which corresponds to a concentration of 109 cfu ml to reach the desired initial bacterial concentration for the experiments 103 and 106 cfu ml different dilutions were carried out finally the e coli k 12 concentration was determined using the plate counting technique with saline solution 0 8 nacl in chromocult selective medium merck kgaa germany two detection limits were used dla 10 cfu 100 ml in concordance with the required concentration in the new regulation eu 2020 741 of the european parliament and of the council of 25 may 2020 for water reuse for this purpose filters of 0 45 μm pore size cellulose nitrate membrane sartorius were used these filters where plated in chromocult medium and incubated at 37 c for 24h and dlb 100 cfu 100 ml in concordance with the required concentration in the spanish regulation currently in force for water reuse to this end different volumes of sample were plated achieving in the last sample the desired detection limit then colonies were counted after 24 h of incubation 2 8 cost assessment total treatment cost was assessed as the sum of the rpr investment capital and the operating costs costs were estimated based on a 400 m3 day 50 m3 h flow rate 8 operating hours per day and 360 days per year which correspond to 1 44 105 m3 per year reagent consumption electricity cost personnel and maintenance are the operating

simultaneous e coli inactivation and imd removal in simulated wwtp secondary effluents firstly control assays of e coli inactivation in wwtp secondary effluents were conducted no inactivation was observed for the isolated effects of iron complex and h2o2 and only sunlight h2o2 provoked e coli inactivation at long treatment times as previously reported ortega gómez et al 2014 villegas guzman et al 2017 imd was also monitored without any removal for the isolated effect of iron complex h2o2 and sunlight h2o2 as for solar photolysis it was almost negligible 20 in 60 min in comparison with solar photo fenton 80 in 30 min soriano molina et al 2021c afterwards the solar photo fenton process mediated by fe3 nta for simultaneous e coli inactivation and imd removal was assessed to put it briefly the main steps of the reaction mechanism with fe3 nta described in soriano molina et al 2021c are the following under solar uva radiation fe3 nta is photo reduced to fe2 yielding ho r1 the generated fe2 is oxidized by h2o2 through the fenton reaction r2 giving rise to ho and ferric iron which instantaneously precipitates at neutral ph in addition fe3 nta reacts with h2o2 r3 fenton like generating superoxide radical anion and fe2 nta which is oxidized by h2o2 yielding ho through the fenton reaction r4 soriano molina et al 2021c these radicals are responsible for microcontaminant oxidation and microorganism inactivation moreover it is known that internal photo fenton due to the h2o2 diffusion inside the cells can damage the internal dna causing bacterial inactivation giannakis et al 2018 lópez vinent et al 2020 r1 o h f e 3 n t a h v f e 2 n t a h o r2 f e 2 h 2 o 2 f e 3 h o h o r3 f e 3 n t a h 2 o 2 f e 2 n t a o 2 r4 f e 2 n t a h 2 o 2 f e 3 n t a h o h o fig 2 shows the profiles of reagent consumption e coli inactivation at 106 cfu ml and imd removal as a function of the initial concentrations of reagents the main feature is the longer time needed for disinfection 1 1 5 hours compared with microcontaminant removal a few minutes bacterial inactivation profiles fig 2a show a lag phase in which the concentration remained constant the lag phase lasted up to 40 min depending on the reagent concentrations then a log linear drop is observed this drop is mainly attributed to the accumulation of damages on the external cell membrane of bacteria caused by ho generated in the photo fenton process r1 4 nahim granados et al 2019 and the direct photonic damages casado et al 2021 with the reagent concentrations commonly used for microcontaminant removal in rprs 0 10 mm fe3 nta and 1 47 mm h2o2 a reduction of 4 logs was achieved in 120 min although the dlb was not reached it must be considered that after 60 min of reaction when e coli concentration began to decrease fe3 nta had almost been completely decomposed and more than 80 of h2o2 had been consumed which points out the need for stronger oxidation conditions for e coli inactivation nonetheless these concentrations of fe3 nta and h2o2 were enough to remove imd below the loq in 30 min in concordance with a previous work soriano molina et al 2021c increasing the initial concentration of fe3 nta to 0 20 mm with 1 47 mm of h2o2 made only possible to reduce 1 log of e coli concentration this was due to the increase in complex concentration which gave rise to a fast h2o2 consumption being totally consumed after 40 min of reaction that is the process was limited by h2o2 this phenomenon did not affect imd removal as the loq was reached at 30 min although the increase in the initial concentration of h2o2 to 2 94 mm led to faster e coli inactivation and imd removal rates in comparison with the use of 0 10 mm fe3 nta and 1 47 mm h2o2 disinfection below the dlb was neither achieved under these conditions the concentration of reagents remaining in the reaction bulk after 120 min were 0 004 mm of fe3 nta 0 2 mg l of fe3 and 0 11 mm of h2o2 3 7 mg l with 0 20 mm of fe3 nta and 4 41 mm of h2o2 although the complex was totally photodegraded in 70 min both imd removal and e coli inactivation below the dlb 100 cfu 100 ml were achieved in 10 min and 105 min of reaction respectively and the residual concentration of h2o2 was 0 55 mm these results point out the impact of the h2o2 concentration in combination with solar uva radiation on bacterial inactivation in concordance with previous works fiorentino et al 2015 maniakova et al 2021 it is worth mentioning that there was no regrowth above the dla after 24 hours with higher reagent concentrations 0 25 mm fe3 nta 2 94 mm h2o2 and 0 30 mm fe3 nta 5 88 mm h2o2 inactivation times were reduced to 80 and 60 min respectively these results reveal that when simultaneous disinfection and microcontaminant removal is the treatment goal disinfection is by far the limiting step fig 3 shows the pseudo first order rate constants corresponding to reagent consumption imd removal and e coli inactivation with r2 ranging from 0 978 to 0 992 as for bacterial inactivation according to nahim granados et al 2019 the chick watson law can be used to fit experimental data showing a log linear decay eq 3 model 1 whereas eq 4 model 2 is proposed to fit the inactivation of e coli population with a shoulder phase or lag stage followed by a log linear decrease 3 ln n n 0 k t 4 ln n n 0 k t 0 t t l a g k t t l a g t t l a g where n n 0 represents the bacterial concentration drop k is the pseudo first order kinetic constant min 1 t is the treatment time min and t l a g is the duration of the shoulder phase or lag stage min model 1 was used to calculate the pseudo first order kinetic constants for 0 25 4 41 and 0 30 5 88 fe3 nta h2o2 concentrations while model 2 was only used for the cases where a lag stage was observed with 0 10 1 47 and 0 20 1 47 fe3 nta h2o2 concentrations tlag was 40 min whereas with 0 20 2 94 and 0 20 4 41 tlag was reduced to 20 min photodecomposition of fe3 nta is the principal reaction in the mechanism although the roles of h2o2 and light availability must be discussed it must be considered that the liquid depth in the reactor geometrical variable was 5 cm and the solar uva irradiance was around 35 w m2 in all the tests consequently the vrpa only varied as a function of fe3 nta concentration at 1 47 mm h2o2 the increase in fe3 nta from 0 10 mm vrpa 389 µe m3 s to 0 20 mm vrpa 638 µe m3 s gave rise to increasing the kinetic constant of fe3 nta decomposition along with an increase in the rate constant for h2o2 consumption and imd removal but not for e coli inactivation due to the prompt drop in h2o2 concentration which stopped the process of bacterial damage and avoided inactivation this limitation was prevented at 2 94 mm h2o2 however the use of fe3 nta concentrations higher than 0 20 mm 0 25 mm of fe3 nta 4 41 mm of h2o2 and 0 30 mm of fe3 nta 5 88 mm of h2o2 in mild excess of h2o2 did not substantially improved the rate constants of fe3 nta photodecomposition and h2o2 consumption with values in the range of experimental error this is due to the lower increase in vrpa 27 when increasing the initial concentration of iron from 0 20 mm to 0 30 mm than from 0 10 to 0 20 mm 64 as in this case h2o2 does not limit the kinetics and fe3 nta decomposition only depends on radiation absorption in contrast this increase in vrpa was enough to lead to the generation of a higher amount of hydroxyl radicals that caused a 1 4 increase in the rate constant of imidacloprid as for e coli inactivation there was a clear effect of h2o2 concentration as shown at 0 20 mm fe3 nta 1 47 and 2 94 mm h2o2 limited the inactivation rate meanwhile at 4 41 mm h2o2 the inactivation rate constant became independent of fe3 nta this points out the difference in the mechanisms of microcontaminant removal and bacterial inactivation as discussed elsewhere casado et al 2021 3 2 effect of initial bacterial load on simultaneous e coli inactivation and imd removal in simulated wwtp effluent considering the above discussed limitation due to h2o2 four fe3 nta h2o2 concentrations 0 10 1 47 0 20 4 41 0 25 4 41 and 0 30 5 88 mm were assayed for the treatment of the simulated wwtp secondary effluent with 103 cfu ml of e coli and 100 µg l of imd as expected the bacterial concentration had negligible effect on the kinetics of fe3 nta photodegradation h2o2 consumption and imd removal with rate constants similar to those obtained at the higher e coli concentration fig 4 pointing out the replicability of the treatment as for e coli inactivation the main change at 0 10 and 0 20 mm fe3 nta concentration is the lack of shoulder in addition the rate constants of e coli inactivation decreased between 32 and 42 regarding those obtained at 106 cfu ml of initial load which points out that bacterial concentration has a significant effect on the inactivation kinetics in general the h2o2 residual concentration was approximately 20 of the initial one only when 0 10 1 47 fe3 nta h2o2 concentration was used the h2o2 residual concentration was 0 24 mm 8 1 mg l in the other cases the h2o2 residual concentration was higher than 0 88 mm 30 mg l without exceeding 1 18 mm 40 mg l which ensures the bactericidal effect below dla after 24 h the treatment cost will vary depending on the initial bacterial concentration and the required quality of reclaimed water in terms of disinfection limits in this regard the treatment cost was calculated according to soriano molina et al 2021a the main drawback for solar photo fenton process with complexing agents for disinfection purpose is the large amount of chelator that is added increasing the operating costs as well as organic content in solution ahile et al 2020a which is also usually translated into higher treatment times initially the operating conditions used in this study were selected in order to not to exceed 0 45 m3 since this can be considered a good reference cost for a tertiary treatment e coli inactivation determined the total treatment cost because it required a higher treatment time than imd removal as shown in fig 5 the most cost effective strategy was 0 20 4 41 fe3 nta h2o2 concentration which resulted in 0 32 m3 23 due to cost of fe3 nta to reach dla however the most adequate treatment depends on the reclaimed water quality requirements the results showed that the total treatment costs can be reduced almost 50 depending on the water quality requirements in this regard 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 with an estimated cost of 0 15 m3 could be the most cost effective strategy if attaining dlb is the disinfection target soriano molina et al 2021b reported that the total cost for 0 10 0 88 mm fe3 edds h2o2 concentration carried out in an rpr and considering 50 m3 h of water flow rate was close to 0 49 m3 in this case the operating cost represented 98 of total cost since edds is very expensive nahim granados et al 2020 reported a total cost of 2 1 m3 when the treatment was carried out using ethylenediamine n n bis 2 hydroxyphenylacetic acid eddha as chelating agent with 0 045 0 58 mm fe3 eddha h2o2 of initial concentrations this significant difference between treatment costs is mainly related to the low flow rate considered 2 8 m3 h and the selected photo reactor since the experiments were carried out in a compound parabolic collector cpc pilot plant which represented 94 of the total cost whereas eddha only represented 3 of the total cost 3 3 validation in actual wwtp secondary effluents once the effect of the different initial conditions of fe3 nta h2o2 was studied in simulated wwtp secondary effluent the next step was to assess the kinetics of the process when applied to actual wwtp secondary effluents to this end two different operating conditions were studied i the most cost effective strategy for microcontaminant removal according to soriano molina et al 2021c 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 and ii the most cost effective strategy for simultaneous bacterial inactivation and microcontaminant removal obtained in this work 0 20 4 41 mm fe3 nta h2o2 concentrations e coli was completely removed bellow dla in 60 min when 0 20 4 41 mm fe3 nta h2o2 was used and the residual concentrations of h2o2 and dissolved iron were 1 8 mm 61 mg l and 0 015 mm 0 8 mg l respectively while 120 min were needed for 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 with 0 66 mm 22 mg l and 0 004 mm 0 2 mg l of residual concentrations fig 6 a it is important to remark that there was bacterial regrowth above dla 10 cfu 100 ml 24 h after the treatment when working with 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 but there was no regrowth above dlb 100 cfu 100 ml which agrees with the results obtained in simulated wwtp effluents it is interesting to highlight the different behavior between microcontaminant removal and bacterial inactivation on the one hand fetotal precipitation fe3 nta photo degradation h2o2 consumption and imd removal were slowed down when compared to the experiments in simulated wwtp effluent fig 6 this effect can be attributed to the lower uva irradiance 35 vs 21 w m2 section 2 4 and the different effluent characteristics turbidity ph sulfates chloride organic matter content among others actual wwtp secondary effluent of this study contained high concentrations of sulfates 330 mg l and chlorine 654 mg l compared with simulated wwtp effluents these constituents are scavengers of ho and probably the formation of secondary radicals generate other oxidizing species so4 cl2 o2 that have lower oxidation potential than ho thus limiting reaction rate on the other hand despite the lower kinetic constants when applying the solar photo fenton process at neutral ph in actual wwtp secondary effluent fig 7 b the rate constants of e coli inactivation were similar to those shown in fig 4 for both sets of fe3 nta h2o2 concentrations this fact remarks the difference in the mechanisms of microcontaminant removal and bacterial inactivation and the need for integrated kinetics models 4 conclusions these results reveal for the first time the most cost effective conditions at pilot plant scale for simultaneous bacterial inactivation and microcontaminant removal by solar photo fenton process with fe3 nta validated in actual wwtp effluent it was observed that increasing the fe3 nta h2o2 concentration from 0 10 1 47 to 0 20 4 41 mm allows achieving e coli inactivation below 10 cfu 100 ml without regrowth at 24 h and more than 90 of imd removal with residual concentrations of h2o2 and dissolved iron lower than 1 5 mm and 0 003 mm respectively the vrpa increased till 64 when initial fe3 nta concentration was increased from 0 10 to 0 20 mm however increasing the fe3 nta concentration from 0 20 to 0 30 mm the increase in vrpa was lower 27 causing a lower improvement of imd and e coli kinetic constants the treatment cost mainly depends on the disinfection target the most cost effective strategy being 0 20 4 41 mm fe3 nta h2o2 to achieve 10 cfu 100 ml with an estimated cost of 0 32 m3 however since 0 10 1 47 mm fe3 nta h2o2 is enough to achieve 100 cfu 100 ml without regrowth after 24 h this option would allow decreasing treatment cost by almost 50 in both cases microcontaminant removal is attained as this process is much faster than bacterial inactivation declaration of competing interest none acknowledgements the authors wish to thank the spanish ministry

coagulation performance of txc 3 1 1 coagulation removal of antibiotics tc belongs to a typical type of antibiotic drugs when measured with hplc the removal rate of tc increased to more than 98 as the dose of coagulants increased and ticl4 performed a little better than ptc and txc fig 1 a however by measuring the toc of the effluent the actual removal rates were far lower than the hplc data except for txc as the dosage was greater than 20 mg l the removal rates of tc by ticl4 and ptc were reduced from 86 6 and 93 9 to 33 7 and 41 7 respectively after coagulation the ticl4 and ptc treated tc solutions became yellowish fig 1b a further analysis of the uv visible spectra of the coagulation effluents demonstrates that the formation of soluble tc ti complexes might account for the yellowish color and the fake removal of tc when measured with hplc as shown in fig 1b the coagulation effluents showed strong absorption between 200 and 500 nm and there was a new absorption band centered at 400 405 nm while for txc the absorbance at 200 400 nm was significantly weakened and there was no absorption peak at 400 405 nm which corresponds to the high removal rates of tc and the low residual ti concentrations in the txc system as shown in fig 1b rather than shifted to the longer wavelength end the characteristic absorption peaks of tc had a blue shift as the ph was reduced from 7 0 to 3 0 suggesting that the new peak around 400 nm was not from the protonation of tc caused by ph dropping in coagulation but due to the formation of tc ti complexes this conclusion is further supported by the spectra of individual and mixed solutions of ticl4 and ptc with tc fig 1b the strong resistance of txc to the coordination interactions with tc might be attributable to the protection effects of the capping acac moieties in the txc the surface charge of the txc coagulation flocs remained negative in the tested dose range fig 1c the pk a values of tc were 3 32 qiang and adams 2004 under the given coagulation conditions tc was mainly negatively charged the above results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions were the dominant forces in the coagulation removal of tc by ticl4 and ptc but was not the case in txc coagulation solution ph is a fundamental parameter that influences the coagulation performance as the dosage was greater than 20 mg l the effluent ph of the ticl4 and ptc treated solutions dropped drastically fig 1d as a result only small flocs were formed in the ptc and ticl4 solutions whereas large flocs were formed in the txc solution at doses of 20 50 mg l fig 1e under all the tested doses the effluents of txc coagulation had the lowest turbidity 1 0 ntu and the lowest residual ti concentration 0 05 mg l among the three ti salts fig s2 similar coagulation results were observed for otc fig s3 otc has one more hydroxyl group than tc both tc and otc have several deprotonation functional groups fig s4 the ph effects in their solutions were rather complicated especially when there were also coordination interactions between the ti salts and the antibiotics to better understand the ph effects we further conducted the coagulation experiments with three oxysalts whose charge states and speciation are clear enough moreover the removal of these oxysalts is also an important task in water treatment 3 1 2 removal of toxic oxysalts the effect of solution ph on the removal performance of the three oxysalts was closely related with their speciation figs 2 and s5 as shown in fig 2a in the common ph range of water 5 9 as iii exists mainly in the neutral form of h3aso3 and the anionic form of h2aso3 appears as the ph is over 7 sb iii exists exclusively as the neutral form of sb oh 3 while se iv exists exclusively in the anionic form of hseo3 and seo3 2 compared with ticl4 and ptc txc showed better coagulation performance for as iii sb iii and se iv removal in wider ph and dose ranges in terms of removal efficiency residual turbidity ph variation and residual ti concentration figs 2b and s5 ticl4 and ptc only generated flocs in a narrower dose range 20 40 mg l and the residual turbidity was mostly higher than 3 0 ntu especially for ticl4 fig 2c the removal of sb iii was slightly affected by the solution ph while the removal of se iv was better under acidic conditions as shown in fig s5a at an initial solution ph of 5 0 and an initial concentration of oxysalts of 5 0 mg l the hydrolysis of ticl4 and ptc required a large amount of alkali so there were no visible flocs formed at all dosages for as iii and se iv removal resulting in lower removal rates of as iii and se iv as compared with sb iii fig 2b with the increase of the dosage the removal rates of as iii sb iii and se iv by txc were gradually increased to 56 7 99 2 and 96 3 while those by ticl4 decreased to 7 2 16 3 and 8 9 respectively for ptc system in addition to a certain strengthening effect during the removal of sb iii high doses would significantly inhibit the removal of as iii and se iv when the initial solution ph was increased to 7 0 and 9 0 the workable dose ranges of ticl4 and ptc were broadened and the removal of se iv was significantly better than txc fig s5b and c although the initial alkalinity of the solution was increased the effluent ph of ticl4 and ptc still dropped significantly when the dosages were greater than 20 mg l the three ti coagulants could remove more than 90 of the oxysalts under the optimized dosage but the coagulation behaviors were quite different the workable dose ranges of ticl4 and ptc were much narrower than that of txc depending on the zeta potential to some extent the zeta potential of ti hydrolysates in the ticl4 and ptc coagulation solutions were mostly higher than 15 mv indicating that electrostatic interactions played important roles in the coagulation removal of these oxysalts by ticl4 and ptc at all ph conditions the residual turbidity and the residual ti concentration of the effluent after txc coagulation were lower than those of ticl4 and ptc the residual turbidity is mainly composed of ti colloids as the dose increases a charge reversal occurred in the coagulation processes of ticl4 and ptc and the turbidity increased when the dose continued to increase the ph of the solution dropped sharply to even below 2 5 in such a case the hydrolysis of the oligomeric ti species was severely restricted and the ti species might exist in the form of simple ti ions instead of ti colloids fig s6 therefore the turbidity decreased accordingly and the residual ti concentration increased sharply the above results demonstrate the advantages of txc over ticl4 and ptc in terms of wider applicable dose range milder ph change and less sensitivity to ph effects the removal of as iii sb iii and se iv in the txc system did not rely on electrostatic adsorption but were attributable to sweep flocculation and coordination binding zhang et al 2020 therefore the floc properties are the most important parameters that should be considered for the application of txc in order to fully understand the floc properties a sequential ultrafiltration process was conducted following the coagulation process the changes in membrane parameters are good indices for the performance of coagulation especially the properties of flocs 3 2 ultrafiltration of coagulation effluents it has been reported that the combined process of fecl3 coagulation and ultrafiltration could remove 90 of sb iii but the residual iron concentration in the coagulation effluent was as high as 0 2 2 5 mg l du et al 2014 no residual ti was detected in the txc coagulation and ultrafiltration effluents while there were 0 16 and 0 13 mg l of dissolved ti remained in the coagulation effluents of ticl4 and ptc fig 3 a furthermore the ultrafiltration process with ptc trapped more residual ti than that of ticl4 after filtering 900 ml of coagulation effluent the remaining membrane flux was 89 5 in the txc system which was much higher than those of the ticl4 and ptc systems 56 1 and 57 4 fig 3b the cake layer of txc colloids on the fouled ultrafiltration membrane was thin and loose while the cake layers formed in the systems of ptc and ticl4 were relatively thick and dense fig 3c the alleviated membrane fouling was well reflected by the membrane resistance as shown in fig 3d the cake layer resistance r c of the membrane in the txc system was far lower than those of ptc and ticl4 compared with the conventional csuf process in line coagulation without sedimentation also known as cuf was expected to reduce membrane fouling by controlling the density of the cake layer and to shorten the sewage treatment process yu et al 2015 peleato et al 2017 yu et al 2016 the residual ti concentrations in the coagulation effluents of ticl4 0 51 mg l and ptc 0 44 mg l were much higher than that of txc 0 05 mg l fig 4 a after 118 h of ultrafiltration process the tmp with the three ti coagulants showed different trends after continuously running the cuf systems for 118 h the tmp of the ticl4 system was basically stabilized at 18 5 kpa while those of the ptc and txc systems were increased to 12 2 and 4 9 kpa fig 4b as reflected by the heights of the coagulation sediments the floc structure of txc was much looser than those of ticl4 and ptc fig 4c the consequence of the difference in floc structure was well reflected by the membrane resistance both the reversible and irreversible resistances r r and r ir of txc in the cuf systems was far lower than those of ticl4 and ptc fig 4d 3 3 mechanisms of alleviated membrane fouling by txc taking the case in the removal of sb iii as an example the floc size of txc was much larger than those of ticl4 and ptc prior to and after breakage figs 5 a and s6 by contrast the fractal dimension of the generated flocs of txc was lower those of ticl4 and ptc fig 5b the larger floc size together with the lower fractal dimension led to a shorter settling time of the txc flocs fig 5c moreover the hydrolysis of txc was more thorough than those of ticl4 and ptc there was almost no difference in the determined ti concentrations by acidification prior to and after filtration fig s7 demonstrating that there was negligible colloidal ti in txc treated solutions as a result the membranes used in the txc systems were less fouled figs 3 and 4 on the contrary due to the existence of a large number of ti colloids fig 6 a the membranes in the ticl4 and ptc systems were heavily fouled even with a 2 min interval backwashing the tmp of the filtration systems with ticl4 and ptc rapidly went up whereas the filtration system with txc could run about 80 h without any significant increase of tmp fig 6b increasing the polymerization degree of the coagulants is a key approach to improve coagulation performance and floc properties li and li 2001 zhang et al 2019 in this work the basicity of txc 93 were significantly larger than those of ticl4 0 and ptc 21 in other words txc had a much higher polymerization degree which is attributable to the larger floc size faster floc growth and settling and consequently looser sludge that are favorable to alleviate membrane fouling the correlation between the polymerization degree and the floc properties are summarized in fig 7 3 4 usability analysis except for coagulation performance cost is a key factor in determining whether the coagulant is a promising alternative or not pac and pfs are two widely used commercial coagulants as shown in fig 8 txc performed better than pac and pfs in the removal of sb iii in a large sb iii concentration range 0 1 5 0 mg l and a wide coagulant dose range 2 20 mg l besides the lower residual sb iii turbidity metal than pac and pfs the use of txc led to a milder ph change which avoids the need of alkali for ph adjustment the production cost of txc has been reported as 4560 ton ti whereas pac and pfs were priced at 2089 3451 ton al and 926 1390 ton fe respectively gan et al 2020 if the ti containing sludge can be recycled to produce tio2 the application cost of txc might be significantly reduced to be comparable to that of pac gan et al 2020 alkali neutralization is generally needed in pfs coagulation more importantly high residual iron ions in the pfs coagulation effluent could lead to serious membrane fouling and raise additional cost inputs wu et al 2021 that can account for up to 24 of total operating costs jafari et al 2021 therefore txc is expected to be a promising coagulant in integrated coagulation membrane filtration system 4 conclusions txc with a high polymerization degree showed excellent coagulation performance for the removal of toxic oxysalts and antibiotics and performed better in alleviating ultrafiltration membrane fouling as compared with the simple ti salt ticl4 and the lowly polymerized ti salt ptc the merits of txc coagulation include lower residual turbidity and ti concentration milder ph dropping larger floc size faster settling rate of flocs and stronger resistance to coordination with organics the above merits make the txc coagulation a good pretreatment approach for membrane filtration in either the csuf or cuf modes membrane filtration is a necessary step in deep treatment of water from the practical application point of view it is of great significance to minimize the membrane fouling in the water wastewater treatment this work demonstrates that txc is a good candidate coagulant for the hybrid processes of coagulation ultrafiltration the finding here

coagulation performance of txc 3 1 1 coagulation removal of antibiotics tc belongs to a typical type of antibiotic drugs when measured with hplc the removal rate of tc increased to more than 98 as the dose of coagulants increased and ticl4 performed a little better than ptc and txc fig 1 a however by measuring the toc of the effluent the actual removal rates were far lower than the hplc data except for txc as the dosage was greater than 20 mg l the removal rates of tc by ticl4 and ptc were reduced from 86 6 and 93 9 to 33 7 and 41 7 respectively after coagulation the ticl4 and ptc treated tc solutions became yellowish fig 1b a further analysis of the uv visible spectra of the coagulation effluents demonstrates that the formation of soluble tc ti complexes might account for the yellowish color and the fake removal of tc when measured with hplc as shown in fig 1b the coagulation effluents showed strong absorption between 200 and 500 nm and there was a new absorption band centered at 400 405 nm while for txc the absorbance at 200 400 nm was significantly weakened and there was no absorption peak at 400 405 nm which corresponds to the high removal rates of tc and the low residual ti concentrations in the txc system as shown in fig 1b rather than shifted to the longer wavelength end the characteristic absorption peaks of tc had a blue shift as the ph was reduced from 7 0 to 3 0 suggesting that the new peak around 400 nm was not from the protonation of tc caused by ph dropping in coagulation but due to the formation of tc ti complexes this conclusion is further supported by the spectra of individual and mixed solutions of ticl4 and ptc with tc fig 1b the strong resistance of txc to the coordination interactions with tc might be attributable to the protection effects of the capping acac moieties in the txc the surface charge of the txc coagulation flocs remained negative in the tested dose range fig 1c the pk a values of tc were 3 32 qiang and adams 2004 under the given coagulation conditions tc was mainly negatively charged the above results demonstrate that electrostatic interactions were the dominant forces in the coagulation removal of tc by ticl4 and ptc but was not the case in txc coagulation solution ph is a fundamental parameter that influences the coagulation performance as the dosage was greater than 20 mg l the effluent ph of the ticl4 and ptc treated solutions dropped drastically fig 1d as a result only small flocs were formed in the ptc and ticl4 solutions whereas large flocs were formed in the txc solution at doses of 20 50 mg l fig 1e under all the tested doses the effluents of txc coagulation had the lowest turbidity 1 0 ntu and the lowest residual ti concentration 0 05 mg l among the three ti salts fig s2 similar coagulation results were observed for otc fig s3 otc has one more hydroxyl group than tc both tc and otc have several deprotonation functional groups fig s4 the ph effects in their solutions were rather complicated especially when there were also coordination interactions between the ti salts and the antibiotics to better understand the ph effects we further conducted the coagulation experiments with three oxysalts whose charge states and speciation are clear enough moreover the removal of these oxysalts is also an important task in water treatment 3 1 2 removal of toxic oxysalts the effect of solution ph on the removal performance of the three oxysalts was closely related with their speciation figs 2 and s5 as shown in fig 2a in the common ph range of water 5 9 as iii exists mainly in the neutral form of h3aso3 and the anionic form of h2aso3 appears as the ph is over 7 sb iii exists exclusively as the neutral form of sb oh 3 while se iv exists exclusively in the anionic form of hseo3 and seo3 2 compared with ticl4 and ptc txc showed better coagulation performance for as iii sb iii and se iv removal in wider ph and dose ranges in terms of removal efficiency residual turbidity ph variation and residual ti concentration figs 2b and s5 ticl4 and ptc only generated flocs in a narrower dose range 20 40 mg l and the residual turbidity was mostly higher than 3 0 ntu especially for ticl4 fig 2c the removal of sb iii was slightly affected by the solution ph while the removal of se iv was better under acidic conditions as shown in fig s5a at an initial solution ph of 5 0 and an initial concentration of oxysalts of 5 0 mg l the hydrolysis of ticl4 and ptc required a large amount of alkali so there were no visible flocs formed at all dosages for as iii and se iv removal resulting in lower removal rates of as iii and se iv as compared with sb iii fig 2b with the increase of the dosage the removal rates of as iii sb iii and se iv by txc were gradually increased to 56 7 99 2 and 96 3 while those by ticl4 decreased to 7 2 16 3 and 8 9 respectively for ptc system in addition to a certain strengthening effect during the removal of sb iii high doses would significantly inhibit the removal of as iii and se iv when the initial solution ph was increased to 7 0 and 9 0 the workable dose ranges of ticl4 and ptc were broadened and the removal of se iv was significantly better than txc fig s5b and c although the initial alkalinity of the solution was increased the effluent ph of ticl4 and ptc still dropped significantly when the dosages were greater than 20 mg l the three ti coagulants could remove more than 90 of the oxysalts under the optimized dosage but the coagulation behaviors were quite different the workable dose ranges of ticl4 and ptc were much narrower than that of txc depending on the zeta potential to some extent the zeta potential of ti hydrolysates in the ticl4 and ptc coagulation solutions were mostly higher than 15 mv indicating that electrostatic interactions played important roles in the coagulation removal of these oxysalts by ticl4 and ptc at all ph conditions the residual turbidity and the residual ti concentration of the effluent after txc coagulation were lower than those of ticl4 and ptc the residual turbidity is mainly composed of ti colloids as the dose increases a charge reversal occurred in the coagulation processes of ticl4 and ptc and the turbidity increased when the dose continued to increase the ph of the solution dropped sharply to even below 2 5 in such a case the hydrolysis of the oligomeric ti species was severely restricted and the ti species might exist in the form of simple ti ions instead of ti colloids fig s6 therefore the turbidity decreased accordingly and the residual ti concentration increased sharply the above results demonstrate the advantages of txc over ticl4 and ptc in terms of wider applicable dose range milder ph change and less sensitivity to ph effects the removal of as iii sb iii and se iv in the txc system did not rely on electrostatic adsorption but were attributable to sweep flocculation and coordination binding zhang et al 2020 therefore the floc properties are the most important parameters that should be considered for the application of txc in order to fully understand the floc properties a sequential ultrafiltration process was conducted following the coagulation process the changes in membrane parameters are good indices for the performance of coagulation especially the properties of flocs 3 2 ultrafiltration of coagulation effluents it has been reported that the combined process of fecl3 coagulation and ultrafiltration could remove 90 of sb iii but the residual iron concentration in the coagulation effluent was as high as 0 2 2 5 mg l du et al 2014 no residual ti was detected in the txc coagulation and ultrafiltration effluents while there were 0 16 and 0 13 mg l of dissolved ti remained in the coagulation effluents of ticl4 and ptc fig 3 a furthermore the ultrafiltration process with ptc trapped more residual ti than that of ticl4 after filtering 900 ml of coagulation effluent the remaining membrane flux was 89 5 in the txc system which was much higher than those of the ticl4 and ptc systems 56 1 and 57 4 fig 3b the cake layer of txc colloids on the fouled ultrafiltration membrane was thin and loose while the cake layers formed in the systems of ptc and ticl4 were relatively thick and dense fig 3c the alleviated membrane fouling was well reflected by the membrane resistance as shown in fig 3d the cake layer resistance r c of the membrane in the txc system was far lower than those of ptc and ticl4 compared with the conventional csuf process in line coagulation without sedimentation also known as cuf was expected to reduce membrane fouling by controlling the density of the cake layer and to shorten the sewage treatment process yu et al 2015 peleato et al 2017 yu et al 2016 the residual ti concentrations in the coagulation effluents of ticl4 0 51 mg l and ptc 0 44 mg l were much higher than that of txc 0 05 mg l fig 4 a after 118 h of ultrafiltration process the tmp with the three ti coagulants showed different trends after continuously running the cuf systems for 118 h the tmp of the ticl4 system was basically stabilized at 18 5 kpa while those of the ptc and txc systems were increased to 12 2 and 4 9 kpa fig 4b as reflected by the heights of the coagulation sediments the floc structure of txc was much looser than those of ticl4 and ptc fig 4c the consequence of the difference in floc structure was well reflected by the membrane resistance both the reversible and irreversible resistances r r and r ir of txc in the cuf systems was far lower than those of ticl4 and ptc fig 4d 3 3 mechanisms of alleviated membrane fouling by txc taking the case in the removal of sb iii as an example the floc size of txc was much larger than those of ticl4 and ptc prior to and after breakage figs 5 a and s6 by contrast the fractal dimension of the generated flocs of txc was lower those of ticl4 and ptc fig 5b the larger floc size together with the lower fractal dimension led to a shorter settling time of the txc flocs fig 5c moreover the hydrolysis of txc was more thorough than those of ticl4 and ptc there was almost no difference in the determined ti concentrations by acidification prior to and after filtration fig s7 demonstrating that there was negligible colloidal ti in txc treated solutions as a result the membranes used in the txc systems were less fouled figs 3 and 4 on the contrary due to the existence of a large number of ti colloids fig 6 a the membranes in the ticl4 and ptc systems were heavily fouled even with a 2 min interval backwashing the tmp of the filtration systems with ticl4 and ptc rapidly went up whereas the filtration system with txc could run about 80 h without any significant increase of tmp fig 6b increasing the polymerization degree of the coagulants is a key approach to improve coagulation performance and floc properties li and li 2001 zhang et al 2019 in this work the basicity of txc 93 were significantly larger than those of ticl4 0 and ptc 21 in other words txc had a much higher polymerization degree which is attributable to the larger floc size faster floc growth and settling and consequently looser sludge that are favorable to alleviate membrane fouling the correlation between the polymerization degree and the floc properties are summarized in fig 7 3 4 usability analysis except for coagulation performance cost is a key factor in determining whether the coagulant is a promising alternative or not pac and pfs are two widely used commercial coagulants as shown in fig 8 txc performed better than pac and pfs in the removal of sb iii in a large sb iii concentration range 0 1 5 0 mg l and a wide coagulant dose range 2 20 mg l besides the lower residual sb iii turbidity metal than pac and pfs the use of txc led to a milder ph change which avoids the need of alkali for ph adjustment the production cost of txc has been reported as 4560 ton ti whereas pac and pfs were priced at 2089 3451 ton al and 926 1390 ton fe respectively gan et al 2020 if the ti containing sludge can be recycled to produce tio2 the application cost of txc might be significantly reduced to be comparable to that of pac gan et al 2020 alkali neutralization is generally needed in pfs coagulation more importantly high residual iron ions in the pfs coagulation effluent could lead to serious membrane fouling and raise additional cost inputs wu et al 2021 that can account for up to 24 of total operating costs jafari et al 2021 therefore txc is expected to be a promising coagulant in integrated coagulation membrane filtration system 4 conclusions txc with a high polymerization degree showed excellent coagulation performance for the removal of toxic oxysalts and antibiotics and performed better in alleviating ultrafiltration membrane fouling as compared with the simple ti salt ticl4 and the lowly polymerized ti salt ptc the merits of txc coagulation include lower residual turbidity and ti concentration milder ph dropping larger floc size faster settling rate of flocs and stronger resistance to coordination with organics the above merits make the txc coagulation a good pretreatment approach for membrane filtration in either the csuf or cuf modes membrane filtration is a necessary step in deep treatment of water from the practical application point of view it is of great significance to minimize the membrane fouling in the water wastewater treatment this work demonstrates that txc is a good candidate coagulant for the hybrid processes of coagulation ultrafiltration the finding here provides a possible strategy to solve the bottleneck in the deep treatment with membrane filtration i e the membrane fouling caused by colloids and trace organics declaration of competing interest the
