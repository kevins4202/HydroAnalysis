24225,fertilization methods significantly affects sustainability of agricultural production through controlling nutrient efficiency and related environmental emissions as well as energy and economic performance at crop cultivation and fertilizer production stage therein controlled release urea cru use has been proved to raise nitrogen use efficiency and reduce some nitrogen related environmental emissions however related studies have not been found to address whether cru can promote coordinated development of crop production based on the energy efficiency carbon emission intensity environmental performance and economic benefit from this fertilizer production to crop plantation which could affect reasonable utilization of cru due to prejudiced conclusions based on inadequate decision making information derived from one or two or three aspects abovementioned to this end this study proposed a set of evaluation system composed of energy efficiency carbon emission intensity and emergy based environmental performance through integrating environmental emissions impact as well as economic benefit to investigate the coordinated development of rice production with different fertilization schemes composed of altering ratios of cru to common urea cu in doing so we attempt to search for the relative balance between long run sustainability of crop production and short term gains of stakeholders the presented approach was applied to a study case from sichuan province china based on three fertilization schemes i e n1 single cu n2 single cru and n3 blend application of 60 cru and 40 cu with the expanded analysis boundary from n fertilizer production to its application in rice plantation the results indicate that 1 relative to n1 introduction of cru increases energy efficiency by 33 15 and 53 09 for n3 and n2 respectively in terms of kj kg rice production efficiency by 0 85 and 3 39 for n3 and n2 respectively in terms of adjusted emergy yield rate and economic benefit by 14 53 and 17 95 for n3 and n2 respectively in terms of benefit cost ratio or increased by 15 87 and 26 98 for n3 and n2 respectively in terms of adjusted benefit to cost ratio mainly derived from improving n use efficiency and saving labor 2 introduction of cru weakens resource structure by 0 98 and 3 23 for n3 and n2 respectively and raises environmental load by 0 31 and 2 51 for n3 and n2 respectively due to enlarging share of purchased non renewable resources and promoting methane emission respectively 3 introduction of cru enhances environmental sustainability by 0 27 and 0 55 for n3 and n2 respectively relative to n1 and 4 generally n2 realizes the best coordinated development followed by n3 and n1 improving resource structure and mitigating carbon emissions should be emphasized when popularizing cru use in rice production keywords rice plantation controlled release urea energy consumption emergy carbon emission data availability related raw data have been provided in supplementary materials 1 introduction although nitrogen n fertilizer contributed greatly to ensuring food security overuse of n fertilizer in crop production cui et al 2010 has brought about serious risks on environmental quality and human health in china due to significant acidification in croplands guo et al 2010 lots of nh3 and n2o emissions gu et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 and enhanced nitrogen deposition liu et al 2013 so improving nitrogen use efficiency nue in crop production is one of the important measures for ensuring food security preventing environmental degradation and mitigating climate change zhang et al 2015 therein use of controlled release urea cru has been regarded as one of effective alternative of common urea cu due to synchronizing n release rates with crop n demand akiyama et al 2010 and labor saving due to the one off application of cru guo et al 2017 to reduce fertilizer cost some scholars proposed use of blending urea bu that consists of both cru and cu jarosiewicz and tomaszewska 2003 noellsch et al 2009 while ensuring grain yield consequently amounts of studies have been implemented to investigate issues related to nue economic benefit and environmental impacts from use of cru or bu in cropping systems in recent years lots of studies have been done to investigate effectiveness of ratios of cru and cu in crop planting stage such as potential ability of greenhouse gas emissions reduction zhong et al 2016 effects on nue and crop yield ke et al 2018 guo et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 influences on nue and crop yield as well economic benefit li et al 2015 guo et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 etc generally compared to cu these studies demonstrated that introduction of cru could ensure grain yield and economic benefit due to reduce n loss as well as labor cost saving however those issues including energy efficiency the environmental contribution to crop production and related environmental emissions impacts have not been investigated simultaneously in addition their analysis boundary is limited to crop plantation stage and thus could lead to inadequate information for policy making for example rock et al 2021 shortlisted and analyzed 22 environmental building stock modelling approaches and found main limitations of those approaches on their effectiveness in supporting decarbonization efforts which are derived from small system boundaries and thus lack of comprehensive life cycle assessment likewise only concentrating on crop plantation stage could ignore environmental impacts from production of agricultural materials such as fertilizers pesticides etc and then lead to incomplete decision making information to explore environmental effects of introduction of cru in the larger scope life cycle assessment lca and other performance evaluation methods are combined zhang et al 2021 and yao et al 2021 assessed agronomic environmental and ecosystem economic benefits from introduction of cru in wheat production and maize production respectively and found that application of cru at optimal fertilization schemes 170 kg n ha 1 and 180 kg n ha 1 for wheat production and maize production respectively with ratio of cru to cu 1 and the one time application before planting could raise a high grain yield and ecosystem economic benefit as well as mitigate the negative environmental impacts however they have not considered related energy efficiency and the environmental contribution to crop systems which cannot provide related information on energy saving and the environmental values for policy making since abovementioned studies ignore the environmental contribution to plantation systems some scholars have investigated comprehensive performance of plantation systems using emergy analysis ema or combination of ema and other methods because ema quantifies the environmental contribution to crop plantation systems through distinguishing quality differences of diverse kinds of inputs based on a common measure therein ghisellini et al 2014 investigated the sustainability of italian agricultural system through an emergy decomposition analysis houshyar et al 2018 implemented an emergy evaluation of sustainability of wheat and maize production in the warm climate of southwestern iran zhang et al 2016 and su et al 2020 carried out an emergy evaluation of the sustainability of chinese crop production system and then they put forward related measures to improve sustainability level of related plantation systems however they ignore emissions impacts from crop systems on emergy based indicators which could make the environmental performance deviate from actual situation to some degree meanwhile related energy efficiency and or economic performance have not been considered and thus could not provide full policy making information in recent years combination of several methods have been applied to performance evaluation of crop production systems such as combination of energy emergy and economic approaches jafari et al 2018 wang et al 2018 combination of life cycle assessment emergy and economic analysis chen et al 2021 combination of emergy and economic analysis wang et al 2021 and then these studies put forward related measures to improve performance of those agricultural systems however their studies could not provide a holistic result due to lacking merger of results from the several methods besides ignorance of emissions effects on emergy based indicators which could be difficult to make an overall conclusion when results of several methods collide with each other lyu et al 2021 assessed impact of fertilization schemes with different ratios of cu to cru on environmental sustainability nue and economic benefit of rice plantation in southwest china therein they improved emissions impact quantification methods in terms of emergy then integrated different kinds of emissions impacts into related emergy indicators respectively and finally merged nue economic indicator and emergy sustainability index into a comprehensive index in doing so they provided separate information on nue economic benefit and environmental performance respectively as well as a united result derived from results merger of three different methods for the final decision making however their analysis boundary is still limited to crop plantation stage meanwhile they have not provided detailed information on energy performance and carbon emission yet which should be concerned under the background of carbon neutrality of china as far as impacts of cru use on the integrated systems composed of n fertilizer production and crop plantation systems related studies have not been found yet although some advantages of cru use over cu use in crop plantation have been proved other related issues have not been clarified from cru production to its use in crop plantation including 1 energy efficiency and carbon emissions 2 economic benefit 3 environmental performance integrated with environmental contribution and emissions impacts and 4 the overall result based on related energy efficiency carbon emissions intensity and environmental and economic performances compared to single cu use of cru still incur other resources consumption and environmental emissions due to extra inputs from its manufacture stage therefore following issues need further investigation when the analysis boundary is expanded from cropping stage to cru and cu production stage including 1 whether the use of cru or bu can improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions 2 whether their application can improve economic benefit 3 whether their use can promote the environmental sustainability of the expanded system when considering the environmental contribution and emissions impacts and 4 whether its use can enhance coordination degree between energy efficiency carbon emission intensity environmental performance and economic benefit as pointed out by xu and lan 2017 the product and farm carbon footprints of rice are all much larger than those of wheat and maize in china so this research chose rice plantation in sichuan province southwest china as a case study to investigate effects of different ratios of cru and cu on energy efficiency carbon emission intensity and modified emergy sustainability as well as economic benefit of the combined system composed of n fertilizer production stage and rice plantation stage here the emergy energy and economic techniques are adopted because they are different but complement each other each considering a specific aspect of one system and their joint use can show more complete information for policy making jafari et al 2018 investigating all these issues can provide more adequate information for policy making this study put forward a set of novel methods and indicators to optimize fertilization schemes which can act as one of optimization tools for plantation systems meanwhile this study also reveals 1 the promotion of cru use to carbon emissions in the integrated system which has not been pointed out in the existing literature and 2 research results based on a larger analysis boundary providing more complete policy making information than those derived from a smaller one which should be emphasized when promoting sustainable agriculture 2 introduction of the study case 2 1 n fertilizer production in this study two industrial enterprises were investigated one is for urea production the other one is for cru production the urea enterprise located in sichuan province china produces urea using carbon dioxide extraction gas carbon and ammonia as its main raw material and its annual output is 300 000 t urea with the nitrogen content of 46 the other one located in shandong province china produces cru using urea toluene diisocyanate and polyol as raw materials and its annual output is 50 000 t cru with a nitrogen content of 44 and a release period of 90 days 2 2 rice plantation in this study the three categories of n fertilizer treatments i e cu cru and bu were applied to rice plantation a field experiment was conducted in yanting county located in sichuan province southwestern china the local recommended fertilization scheme for rice plantation is 150 kg n ha 75 kg p2o5 ha and 75 kg k2o ha respectively the adopted rice variety was yixiang 725 rice was transplanted on may 14 2019 and harvested on august 31 2019 experimental treatments for the study were laid out according to a randomized completed block design and three treatments were considered according to our preliminary test in the year 2018 including single cu n1 single cru n2 and blend application of 60 cru and 40 cu n3 and each treatment included four replications there are no differences in their inputs among the three treatments except their types of n fertilizers furthermore areas of three treatments were adjusted to a unit area of 1 ha in one year to ease comparison detailed information on the site description the field experimental schemes and the sampling and monitoring analysis were shown in supporting material sm 1 for each treatment there are no statistically significant differences of rice yield among its four replications sm 14 therefore in the following calculation we adopt the mean yield of each treatment to calculate related indicator values 3 methods 3 1 analysis boundary as shown in fig 1 the analysis boundary starts with the n fertilizer production in the two enterprises and ends with the rice harvest main input categories of fertilizer production include local environmental inputs industrial raw materials energy sources and labor and service and input items of rice plantation are composed of local environmental inputs agricultural materials and energy sources as well as labor and service main output items includ rice grain and various environmental emissions generated in the two stages 3 2 energy consumption to investigate energy efficiency of rice plantation energy consumption of this crop production should be calculated in this study the direct energy consumption from the n fertilizer production to application in rice plantation mainly comes from fuel natural gas and electricity and it is obtained by using raw data multiplied by its corresponding conversion factors sac standardization administration of p r c 2020 as follow 1 e n c i n e i k i 29307 6 where enc refers to the energy consumption kj n is the number of types of energy sources consumed ei stands for the amount of i th energy source kg kw h or mj ki means the standard coal coefficient of i th energy source kg ce kg kg ce kw h kg ce mj detailed information was shown in sm 2 29307 6 is the net calorific value of 1 kg chinese standard coal kj kg ce then we calculate the energy consumption intensity i e energy consumption per unit rice yield encuy and the higher indicator value reflects lower energy efficiency and vice versa the encuy can be computed using eq 2 2 e n c u y e n c r y where encuy stands for the energy consumption per unit rice yield kj kg and ry is the rice yield per hectare kg ha 3 3 carbon emissions carbon emissions involve in the total carbon emissions and carbon emissions per unit rice yield and they are calculated as follows 1 total carbon emissions total carbon emissions linked to the n fertilizer production and n fertilizer application in crop plantation are calculated through the following formula 3 t c e c e p c e a where tce refers to the total carbon emissions and are expressed in co2 equivalent co2 eq cep stands for the carbon emissions from n fertilizer production kg co2 eq including ch4 and co2 cea is the carbon emissions in n fertilizer application kg co2 eq including the ch4 and co2 from rice growth as well as the carbon emission from diesel burning and labor force it is noted that here n2o from rice plantation isn t considered because its emission amount is too little under the experimental conditions therefore cep and cea can be obtained through the following formulas 4 c e p c e c o 2 c e c h 4 28 5 c e a c e c o 2 c e c h 4 28 c e d i e c e l a b where cep and cea stands for the carbon emission from n fertilizer production and application kg co2 eq respectively ceco2 and cech4 represent the mass of co2 and ch4 kg respectively 28 is the emission conversion factor of the global warming potential on 100 years of ch4 ipcc 2013 cedie and celab are the carbon emission from diesel burning and labors respectively their emission factors are cited from lyu et al 2020 2 carbon emission per unit rice yield we calculate the carbon emission per unit rice yield linked to the n fertilizer production and application through the formula 6 and the larger indicator value means higher carbon emission intensity 6 c e u y t c e r y where ceuy stands for carbon emission per unit rice yield kg co2 eq kg 3 4 emergy evaluation 3 4 1 introduction of ema ema founded by odum is applied to the evaluation of the environmental efficiency of ecological systems brown and herendeen 1996 odum 1996 slesser 1974 and it was defined as the available energy exergy used directly or indirectly to generate a product or service expressed in units of solar energy joule sej odum 1996 all the inputs should be converted into the same measurement by their corresponding unit emergy values uevs different from energy accounting ema distinguish quality differences of diverse energy sources and considers the environmental contribution to artifcial activities and thus it can evaluate comprehensive performance of a system based on a common measure it is noted that all uves should be based on the same geobiosphere emergy baseline geb in one study to keep consistency up to now the geb has been revised several times by various researchers brown et al 2016 brown and ulgiati 2010 campbell et al 2005 odum 1996 odum 2000 in this study all the uevs are converted to the latest one i e geb 12 0 e 24 sej yr based on the emergy rule algebra the total emergy u was computed according to eq 7 7 u e i u e v i where u refers to the total emergy sej ei stands for the amount of energy mass or money of i th input in j kg or and uevi refers to the uev of i th input in sej j sej kg or sej as for labor and service l s amounting in this study it is noted that here service refers to artificial work embodied at construction stage while labor stands for artificial work embodied in purchased raw materials and energy sources as well as maintenance at operation stage due to the different channels of data acquisition l s are both measured in unit of currency in the n fertilizer production stage while service was measured in the unit of currency and labor was measure in the unit of working hours in the rice production stage 3 4 2 emergy flow as shown in fig 2 the whole system consists of two subsystems i e the n fertilizer production system nfps and the rice production system rps hence total emergy can also be summarized using eq 8 8 u u 1 u 2 where u1 and u2 are the total emergy of nfps and rps respectively for nfps its total emergy is derived from the local renewable resources r1 such as sunlight rain imported renewable resources fr1 such l s with a renewable fraction of 2 75 lyu et al 2021 imported nonrenewable resources fn1 such as natural gas nonrenewable part of l s and its output is the n fertilizer y1 and environmental emissions therefore the total emergy of nfps can be calculated as follows 9 u 1 r 1 f r 1 f n 1 environmental emissions in nfps that exceed the environmental self purification capacity require extra ecological services to dilute them here named as ese1 because they generally exceed the related environmental quality standard these emissions could also affect the environmental function and human health before they reach related acceptable levels and then will lead to potential emergy loss el1 rps as a modern human dominated stage requires not only local renewable resources r2 including sun rain etc and local nonrenewable resources n soil organic matters but also needs nonrenewable purchased inputs fn2 such as fertilizers pesticides nonrenewable part of l s etc as well as renewable l s fr2 here the total emergy of rps can be obtained according to eq 10 10 u 2 r 2 n f r 2 f n 2 the main outputs of rps include rice yield y2 and related environmental emissions furthermore environmental effects derived from environmental emissions include positive environmental effects and negative ones here positive environmental effects are from recharge of underground water and capture of co2 since this system consumes much more water than other plantation systems it can also recharge groundwater due to the long period of flooded conditions meanwhile rice photosynthesis promotes the increase of biomass through capturing carbon dioxide here we regard these two kinds of positive effects as beneficial ecological services bes negative impacts derive from environmental emissions harm to human health and environmental functions here environmental emissions during the planting stage mainly include co2 ch4 ammonia volatilization no3 n nh4 n etc these emissions will cause extra environmental load when exceeding related environmental quality standards and then lead to potential emergy loss el2 before they attain acceptable levels 3 4 3 quantification of emissions impact in terms of emergy 1 quantifying bes due to the longtime flooded situation and lots of water consumption of rps underwater can be recharged during rice plantation here the emergy of recharged groundwater can be attained according to eq 11 based on ref shah et al 2019 11 e m w r p ρ s k u e v g w where emwr stands for the emergy of recharged groundwater sej p means annual precipitation on the rice plantation area m here referring to that in 2019 ρ is water density kg m3 s is the cultivation area m2 k stands for the infiltration coefficient i e 0 203 liu 2007 uevgw is the uev of groundwater besides water recharge the photosynthesis of rice should be also considered as one of carbon capture ways meanwhile during the plantation stage carbon emissions still include co2 and ch4 from the rice plantation and carbon emissions from energy consumption and labor force therefore the rps acts as both carbon sink and carbon source simultaneously and the difference between the two ones determines whether it s net carbon sequestration or net carbon emissions detailed calculation can be expressed using eq 12 12 c s s i s o c s i 44 12 c s o where cssi so refers to the difference between carbon sink and carbon source kg co2 eq csi stand for the carbon sequestration derived from the increase of net primary productivity npp and related calculation method is cited from refs lyu et al 2021 wang et al 2016 npp is roughly equal to 45 of the biomass of rice including aboveground and underground luo 2009 44 12 stands for conversion fraction for converting c into co2 cso is the carbon emissions during rice plantation kg co2 eq cssi so 0 stands for net carbon sequestration which will produce ecological benefits and thus mitigate greenhouse effect cssi so 0 means net carbon emission which will promote greenhouse effect and then will be further quantified in the following part eq 24 and cssi so 0 refers to carbon balance therein the ecological benefit of net carbon sequestration can be measured in terms of emergy using eq 13 according to ref shah et al 2019 13 e m s i s o c s s i s o u e v c s where emsi so is the ecological benefit of net carbon sequestration sej uevc s refers to the specific emergy value of biomass in rice plantation sej kg co2 eq lyu et al 2021 finally total emergy of bes can be calculated using eq 14 14 e m b e s e m w r e m s i s o 2 quantifying ese because of the limited self purification capacity of the environment sometimes extra ecological services are needed to reduce concentrations of discharged pollutants i e dilute air pollutants by using clean air and water pollutants by using clean water the calculation procedure includes 1 calculation of the extra amount of air or water needed and 2 quantification of the ese detailed calculation methods are shown in eqs 15 18 15 m i e x a i r w a t e r d a i r w a t e r m i a i r w a t e r e v c i a i r w a t e

where mi ex air water represents the extra mass of air or water to dilute the i th air water pollutant kg dair water is the density of air or water 1 23 kg m3 for air 1000 kg m3 for water mi air water is the mass of i th air water pollutant emitted in both nfps and rps kg evci air water is the environmental capacity of i th air water pollutant here it is still considered as zero for air emissions because local air quality often cannot meet related class i in the national ambient air quality standard of china while those water discharges do not need extra ecological service because their concentrations are smaller than local underwater environmental quality standard according to our experimental data ci air water stands for the acceptable concentration of i th pollutant esei air is the emergy to dilute the i th air pollutant sej mi ex air is the mass of extra air to dilute the i th air pollutant kg v means the wind velocity m s uevwind refers to the transformity of wind energy i

kg ρ is the thermal value coefficient of water and it is 1 39e 05 j kg zhang et al 2018 uevwater refers to the transformity of water energy i e 2 13e 04 sej j brown et al 2016 since wind energy or water energy can dilute diverse air pollutants or groundwater pollutants simultaneously the total ese value is equal to the sum of the greatest value among those values of esei air and the largest one among those values of esei water to avoid double accounting eq 18 the acceptable concentration values of air pollutants and water pollutants are shown in sm 3 ese1 and ese2 refer to the ese of nfps and rps respectively 3 quantifying el before reaching the acceptable levels air and water pollutants could also lead to emergy loss derived from their potential harm to human health for comparison we use eco indicator 99 assessment method to standardize the negative effect of various emissions on human health through disability adjusted life years dalys goedkoop 1999 furthermore emergy loss due to emissions harm to human health can be obtained through eq 19 19 e l e l 1 e l 2 m i e v c i d a l y i τ 2019 where el refers to the emergy loss sej el1 and el2 are emergy loss of nfps and rps respectively mi is the mass of i th air environmental emission or water pollutant both in nfps and rps evci stands for the environmental capacity of the i th air emission or water pollutant linked to related regions where n fertilizer production and application are implemented dalyi is the daly value caused by the i th emission which can be attained from ref goedkoop 1999 τ 2019 is the emergy use per capita in the year 2019 i e 2 71e 16 sej person yr lyu et al 2021 here environmental emissions considered and related parameters are given in table 1 4 net environmental effect as mentioned above since there exist both positive and negative environmental effects simultaneously in the integrated system the net environmental effect can be computed through formula 20 20 n e e e m b e s e s e e l where nee represents the net environmental effect nee 0 stands for environmental benefits nee 0 means negative environmental impact and nee 0 refers to no effect 3 4 4 emergy related indicators considering emissions effects on environmental performance we integrate positive and negative emissions impacts into related classic emergy based indicators to attain three improved ones lyu et al 2021 i e adjusted emergy yield ratio aeyr adjusted environmental loading ratio aelr and adjusted emergy sustainability index aesi in addition one new indicator i e environmental efficiency ene is also built meanwhile two classic indicators are also adopted including uev and r and all these indicators are described as follows 1 uev uev is the ratio of total emergy input to yield sej kg it s a response to the resources efficiency of a system i e a lower indicator value means higher resources efficiency it can be obtained through the following formula 21 u e v u r y where u is the total emergy sej ry refers to rice yield kg 1 r it is the proportion of renewable inputs including local renewable resources and purchased renewable inputs to the total emergy the larger indicator value is more beneficial for promoting sustainability of a system in study it can be obtained through eq 22 22 r r 1 r 2 f r 1 f r 2 u 100 2 ene environmental efficiency nonrenewable resources depletion and adverse emissions impacts have become the two main obstacles hindering sustainable development of social economy since the industrial revolution to measure effect of the two factors on product production systems here the indicator ene is proposed and it is defined as the ratio of environmental cost to value of product or services reflecting how much environmental cost is needed to achieve a unit product or service and the smaller indicator value reflects the higher environmental efficiency in detail the environmental cost emergy equivalent includes two categories one is the cost of non renewable resources depletion including fossil energy mineral resources soil organic matter etc and the other one is the cost of environmental quality degradation caused by carbon emission extra ecological services and emergy loss and emergy of the product or service equals to the product of economic output and ratio of emergy to money shown in sm 4 the indicator can be calculated according to eq 23 23 e n e e m r e s e m e n v e m p r o o r s e r f n 1 f n 2 n e m p r o o r s e r e m t c e e l e s e e m p r o o r s e r where emres and emenv refers to the cost of resource depletion and environmental degradation cost in sej respectively empro or ser is the emergy of one product or service fn1 and fn2 stands for the imported nonrenewable inputs in n fertilizer production and rice plantation respectively n is the local nonrenewable input soil organic matter emtce means emergy of carbon emissions effects and it can be calculated through eq 20 24 e m t c e t c e u e v c o 2 where tce kg co2 eq can be obtained through formula 3 uevco2 is uev of carbon emissions effects sej kg co2 eq which are shown in sm 4 1 aeyr this is a modified indicator on the basis of classic emergy indicator emergy yield ratio eyr which is defined as the total emergy input divided by the purchased input and it is used to measure production efficiency of the system i e the bigger indicator value means the higher production efficiency or stronger competition ability here el is thought to decrease the net emergy output while bes enhances the net emergy output therefore it is necessary to integrate the emergy of bes and emergy loss into the indicator to fully reflect environmental emissions effect on the competitive ability of the system through the following formula lyu et al 2021 25 m e y r u e m b e s e l f r 1 f r 2 f n 1 f n 2 2 aelr classic environmental load ratio elr equals to the sum of local nonrenewable resources and imported inputs divided by local renewable resources the higher indicator value reflects the larger environmental load on the local environment in this study we categorized imported inputs into renewable and nonrenewable ones meanwhile ese will place extra pressure on the local environment due to exceeding local environmental capacity and thus it should be integrated into the elr then the modified indicator aelr can be calculated using eq 26 based on ref lyu et al 2021 26 m e l r n f n 1 f n 2 e s e r f r 1 f r 2 3 aesi classic esi equals to the ratio of eyr and elr reflecting the sustainability of a system in the long run likewise esi was also corrected to aesi through considering the structure of imported inputs and environmental emissions impacts the bigger indicator value reflects the relatively higher sustainable level and this index is calculated through eq 27 cited from ref lyu et al 2021 27 m e s i m e y r m e l r 3 5 economic analysis in this study the final product is rice grain which is needed to be traded in markets and its market competitiveness should be assessed by economic analysis here we consider the benefit to cost ratio bcr the higher indicator value indicates stronger market competitiveness similarly we incorporate the environmental effects into bcr and then built the modified indicator abcr adjusted benefit cost ratio according to ref lyu et al 2021 firstly the net environmental effect should be transferred into money through ratio of emergy to money rem as follows 28 e b n e e n e e re m 2019 where ebnee is the monetized net environmental effect nee can be obtained through eq 20 and rem2019 is the ratio of emergy to money in 2019 sej sm 4 then abcr can be calculated through eq 29 29 m b c r n e b e b n e e e c b c r e b n e e e c where neb is the net economic benefit that can be obtained through the difference between economic output and economic cost ec is the economic cost and bcr is the benefit to cost ratio 3 6 coordination degree index abovementioned indicators show the performances from various aspects nevertheless generally policymakers always want to attain an overall result for final decision making in practice it is assumed that decision makers consider energy efficiency cabon emission intensity environmental sustanability and economic benefit simultaneously so as to make the final decision here we assume that the four aspects have equal importance in the decision making therefore a new comprehensive index cdi coordination degree index is established to link energy consumption intensity carbon emission intensity environmental sustainability and economic benefit therein energy consumption intensity and carbon emission intensity are negatively related to cdi environmental sustainability and economic benefit are postively related to cdi and then this index can be calculated as follows 30 c d i j e n c u y c e u y e n c u y j c e u y j m e s i j m b c r j m e s i m b c r where encuyj ceuyj mesij and mbcrj refers to energy consumption per unit rice yield carbon emission per unit rice yield modified emergy sustainability index and modified benefit cost ratio of the j th treatment e n c u y c e u y m e s i and m b c r stands for average values of energy consumption per unit rice yield carbon emission per unit rice yield modified emergy sustainability index and modified benefit cost ratio of all treatments the larger index value means more coordination relationship among the four indicators or better comprehnesive performance based on the average level to furhter quantify one indicator s impact degree on comprehensive performance of the system in study here the following indicator iid one indicator s impact degree is proposed as follows 31 i i d j n c d i j n a c d i j n b c d i j n b 100 where c d i j n b and c d i j n a is indicator value of cdi before and after considering impact of the n th indicator on index cdi of the j th treatment when iid 0 the larger indicator value reflects the bigger contribution of one indicator to the comprehnsive performance of the j th treatment iid 0 means no impact and the larger absolute value of indicator reflects the bigger adverse effect of one indicator when iid 0 3 7 data resources raw data of local renewable inputs for nfps are collected from the local statistical yearbook the data of local renewable inputs for rps come from yanting agro ecological station of purple soil of the chinese academy of sciences other inputs data for nfps are collected from the informal interviews with owners of enterprises including raw materials energy consumption environmental emissions and others the prices of industrial and agricultural materials are from dealers and market price surveys uevs of services synthetic ammonia urea and labor are calculated by this study as shown in sm 5 8 respectively and other uevs cited in this research are from published literature or databases sm 4 microsoft excel 2019 is applied for data processing and charting and emergy flow diagrams are accomplished in microsoft visio 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 energy consumption sm 9 illustrates the structure of energy consumption for n1 energy use of nfps has a share of 52 28 in the total energy consumption to which natural gas contributes 91 79 energy use of rps contributes 47 72 in which fuel and electricity have the share of 85 93 and 14 07 respectively for n2 energy use of nfps and rps contributes 16 37 and 83 63 respectively therein electricity is the biggest contributor with the share of 99 98 in nfps fuel is the largest contributor 85 93 in rps followed by electricity 14 07 for n3 nfps contributes 35 72 to total energy consumption while rps has a share of 64 28 therein natural gas has the largest contribution in nfps fuel contributes 85 93 to the energy consumption of rps followed by electricity 14 07 in summary energy consumption and its intensity follow the trend of n1 n3 n2 fig 3 a due to the clear differences in rice yield the gap of encuy is bigger than the gap of enc per area among systems i e compared with n1 encs of n2 and n3 are lower by 42 96 and 25 78 while encuys of n2 and n3 is lower by 53 09 and 33 15 respectively therefore n2 has the highest energy efficiency in three schemes based on the energy consumtion per unit area and per unit rice yield followed by n3 and n1 to further raise its energy efficiency fuel use should be paid more attention to in rps for n2 besides natural gas consumption in nfps the high share of fuel in the rps roots in the agricultural machinery application during rice plantation kazemi et al 2015 lal et al 2020 pishgar komleh et al 2011 since fuel burning leads to lots of air emissions alluvione et al 2011 fei and lin 2017 improving fuel mix and combustion efficiency should be further concerned yuan and peng 2017 4 2 carbon emission as for carbon emission sm 10 the largest emission source is n2 followed by n3 and n1 orderly furthermore the highest carbon emission roots in rice plantation stage overall the biggest contributor to total carbon emission is rps more than 99 in the three treatments derived from a large quantity of ch4 emissions in the anaerobic environment which has been proved by lan et al 2020 and maraseni et al 2018 therein ch4 contributes 63 44 65 68 and 61 68 to the carbon emission in rps for n1 n2 and n3 respectively therefore n fertilizer use should be more emphasized as it promotes much more carbon emission than its production and other fertilizer products production wu et al 2021 as illustrated in fig 3 b ceuy follows the trend of n3 n2 n1 here there is a somewhat trade off effect in n2 on the one hand n2 has the highest carbon emission mainly due to the higher fertilizer use efficiency of cru which is more conducive to tillering of rice but also provides more channels for ch4 transport through rice plants which enhances c substrate availability for methanogens in the rhizosphere ma et al 2013 singh et al 1999 on the other hand the carbon emission intensity of n2 is mitigated to some degree due to its highest yield also proved by ref banger et al 2012 in a word n1 has the lowest carbon emission intensity in the three schmes in terms of carbon emission per unit area and per unit rice yield in other words here introduction of cru in rice plantation promotes carbon emissions to different degrees compared to single cu use which deserves more attention in the future 4 3 emergy evaluation 4 3 1 emergy flows detailed emergy evaluation results for each treatment are demonstrated in sms 11 13 for n1 nfps and rps contributes 30 51 and 69 49 to the total emergy respectively therein synthetic ammonia contributes the most in the n fertilizer production stage 63 58 followed by natural gas 10 99 and electricity 2 12 for the rps the biggest contributor is labors 36 68 followed by services 36 14 for n2 the nfps and the rps have shares of 34 79 and 65 21 in the total emergy respectively therein in the nfps emergy input of urea as main raw material of cru is the largest contributor 71 86 followed by electricity 3 96 in rice plantation stage the services contributes the largest 41 05 followed by labors 29 51 for n3 contributions of nfps and rps are 34 15 and 65 85 to the total emergy input respectively therein the services is the largest contributor 39 28 in the rps followed by the labors 30 39 overall total emergy input follows the trend of n2 n1 n3 therein rps acts as the absolute contributor to the total emergy input in the three schemes more than 65 moreover this stage shows high reliance on labors and services l s which highlights one of charateristics of contemporary crop production in addition it is found that cru use reduces the l s input by 5 97 and 9 63 for n2 and n3 respectively relative to n1 as for the structure of emergy input fig 4 imported inputs contribute about 90 90 03 for n1 90 23 for n2 and 89 83 for n3 to the total emergy input 99 of which come from nonrenewable ones in summary n2 has the worst resources structure and the biggest emergy use per area in the three schemes therefore introduction of cru adversely affect the resource structure of this intengrated system 4 3 2 environmental emissions effects as shown in table 2 it is found that water recharge is the largest contributor to bes of the three schemes 90 08 91 29 followed by carbon capture therein there are little differences among bes values of water recharge for the three schemes however compared to n1 bes value of carbon capture from n3 raises by 15 26 while that from n2 has no clear changes generaly there are no clear differences among total bes of the three schemes due to absolute contribution of bes values of water recharge for emergy loss and extra ecological services they both follow the same trend of n1 n3 n2 as for emergy loss comapred to n1 n2 and n3 reduce this indicator value by 84 52 and 12 35 respectively therein nfps and rps cut this value by 77 91 and 7 87 times respectively for n2 and nfps enhances this value by 91 47 but rps cuts this value by 48 26 for n3 el mainly comes from rps for n1 and n2 while it is mainly dierved from nfps for n3 as for ese comapred to n1 n2 and n3 reduce this indicator value by 23 57 and 14 33 respectively therein nfps and rps decrease this value by 23 57 and 85 80 respectively for n2 and nfps and rps cut this value 14 33 and 53 61 for n3 most of ese comes from nfps for the three schemes followed by rps therein the extra services are mainly used to dilute the dust in the fertilizer production stage while the extra services are mainly needed to dilute nh3 in rice plantation for the three schemes finally as far as nee is concerned comapred to n1 n2 and n3 enhance this indicator value by 1 71 times and 41 58 respectively in a word n2 produces the greatest environmental benefit among the three schemes followed by n3 then n1 it should be noted the systems n1 and n3 involved in cu result in relatively higher adverse effects on human health and the environement due to higher emissions mainy rooting in the higher n loss in rps li et al 2013 zheng et al 2017 here nues of n1 n2 and n3 are 12 18 23 36 and 17 80 respectively under the same n application rate based on the corresponding rice yields 7681 kg 9359 kg and 8525 kg per hectare according to our field experiment sm 14 compared with n1 nue and yield of n2 increase by 91 79 and 21 85 while nue and yield of n3 raise by 46 14 and 10 99 this also demonstrates that cru can raise rice yield through enhancing n use efficiency consquently n2 has the best environmental benefit because it produces the lowest adverse emissions impacts due to higher nue guo et al 2017 guo et al 2021 while keeps the similar bes to the other two schemes 4 3 3 emergy indicators as illustrated in table 3 for uev it is found that n2 has the highest resource efficiency followed by n3 and then n1 orderly compared to n1 resource efficiency of n2 and n3 rises by 11 07 and 5 37 respectively according to r the three systems have a large reliance on imported resources comparatively speaking n1 has the largest share of renewable resources followed by n3 and n2 compared to n1 share of renewable resources of n2 and n3 decreases by 3 23 and 0 98 respectively and this shows that structure of resource input of the system is becoming worse with increasing share of cru results of ene values reveals that n2 has the highest environmental efficiency in the three schemes followed by n3 and then n1 which is consistent with trends from uevs compared to n1 environmental efficiency of n2 and n3 rises by 20 13 and 12 34 respectively regarding aeyr it is revealed that n2 has the highest production efficiency followed by n3 and n1 compared to n1 production efficiency of n2 and n3 rises by 3 39 and 0 85 respectively indicator values of aelr show that n2 has the largest environmental load followed by n3 and n1 compared to n1 environmental load of n2 and n3 rises by 2 51 and 0 31 respectively as far as aesi is concerned it reflects that n2 has the highest sustianbility level followed by n3 ans n1 compared to n1 environmental sustainability of n2 and n3 increases by 0 55 and 0 27 respectively in summary cru use slightly enhances the environmental sustainability because improvement of production efficiency resulting from its application is slightly larger than enlargement of environmental load from increased share of non renewable resources caused by cru production compared with the study of lyu et al 2021 which was done in the same location with the same experimental schemes using the same emergy indicators with this study but different analysis boundary systems from this study some interesting findings are revealed table 3 results from r shows cru use worses resource structure of the integrated system in this study while cru use improves resource structure of rice plantation in the study of lyu et al 2021 results from aeyr shows cru use enhances production efficiency of the integrated system in this study as well as rice plantation according to ref lyu et al 2021 however single cru use has larger contribution to production efficiency of the intengrated system than that of the rice plantation system results from aelr show that cru use enhances environmental load of the integrated system while cru use reduces environmental load of rice plantation system finally the two studies achieve some similar conclusions even based on different analysis boundaries i e introduction of cru can promote environmental sustainability of rice plantation however this study demonstrates that single cru use is more beneficial for environmental sustainability of the integrated system while lyu et al 2021 showed that bu use is more beneficial for environmental sustainability of the rice plantation system all these differences lie in distinct analysis boundaries to well address complex resource and environemntal issues generally results based on a larger analysis boundary can attain more complete information than those derived from a smaller one 4 4 economic assessment as described in table 4 n2 has the best economic cost followed by n3 and n1 compared to n1 economic cost of n2 and n3 rises by 11 13 and 3 28 respectively n2 has the highest economic output then n3 and n1 compared to n1 economic output of n2 and n3 rises by 21 84 and 11 36 respectively n2 has the highest net economic benefit then n3 and n1 compared to n1 net economic benefit of n2 and n3 rises by 30 96 and 17 54 respectively n2 has the highest benefit cost ratio followed by n3 and then n1 compared to n1 benefit cost ratio of n2 and n3 rises by 17 95 and 14 53 respectively n2 has the highest environmental benefit followed by n3 and then n1 compared to n1 environmental benefit of n2 and n3 rises by 1 71 times and 41 67 respectively n2 has the highest modified benefit cost ratio followed by n3 and then n1 compared to n1 modified benefit cost ratio of n2 and n3 rises by 26 98 and 15 87 respectively in a word results from different economic indicators all demontrate that n2 has the best economic performance followed by n3 relative to n1 when considering environmental benefit the economic benefit of each scheme all increases to different degrees however n2 is still the best one among the three schemes and this shows that the application of cru improves economic performance and environmental benefits through raising nitrogen utilization rate and saving labors which also has been proved in relevant studies geng et al 2015 li et al 2015 generally results from economic evaluation support cru use in rice plantation it is noted that compared to n1 increased environmental benefit per kilogram cru use is 0 55 for n2 application amount of cru product in n2 was 341 kg ha and 0 13 for n3 application amount of cru product in n3 was 205 kg ha respectively and they are 122 22 and 29 75 of the price of cru product the price of cru is 450 t therefore n2 produces the higher environmental benefit the environmental benefit can be used as a reference for fiscal subsidies of cru use that is at least subsidizing 30 of the price of cru to growers to encourage them to use cru in rice plantation to protect local ecological envronment in fact some local governments in china have taken related measures for example in guangdong province china the agricultural sector has encouraged farmers to use cru through financial subsidies at 25 of the market price of cru products department of agriculture and rural affairs of guangdong province 2020 4 5 cdi table 5 shows the coordination degree between encuy ceuy aesi and abcr it is found that n2 achieves the best coordination degree followed by n3 and n1 meanwhile the coordination degree rises with increasing share of cru results from iid table 5 demonstrate that for n1 carbon emission intensity has slight contribution to improvement of its comprehensive performance however energy and econmic indicators all clearly weaken its comprehensive performance and emergy sustainbaility index has no obvious effect for n2 energy indicator has the largest contribution to its comprehensive performance followed by economic performance and emergy sustainability index and carbon emission intensity have no obvious influence on its comprehensive performance for n3 energy indicator contributes the biggest to its comprehensive performance followed by economic performance however carbon emission intensity adversely influences its comprehensive performance and emergy sustainability index has no obvious effect on its comprehensive performance the study results show that those systems with part of best performance indicators could not achieve their whole best coordination degree which finally depends on total impact degree of encuy ceuy aesi and abcr on cdi for example although n1 performed the best in its carbon emission intensity its poor energy and economic performance results in the lowest coordination degree with introduction of cru in rice plantation relative to n1 encuy decreases by 53 09 for n2 and 33 15 for n3 while ceuy only rises by 2 42 for n2 and 4 85 for n3 table 2 aesi ascends by 0 55 for n2 and 0 27 for n3 table 4 and abcr climbs by 26 98 for n2 and 15 87 for n3 table 5 since positive contribution of the three indicators encuy aesi and abcr to cdi exceeds the adverse effect of ceuy on this index generally the coordination degree is improved after introduction of cru comprehensively speaking a single application of cru has the best performance based on energy consumption intensity carbon emission intensity environmental sustainability and economic benefit which highlights the significance of cru use in rice plantation however application of cru in rice plantation still incurs the following adverse impacts including 1 slightly weakening the resources structure due to increased share of purchased nonrenewable resources caused by cru manufacture 2 promoting carbon emissions mainly from ch4 emission in rice plantation and 3 enhancing economic cost of nitrogen fertilizer to some degree here cru applied are produced through the bottom side injection fluidized bed coating process and the flaw of this production process has relative low production efficiency due to the small production scale chen et al 2014 furthermore the coated process of cru has characteristics of complex process and potential environmental pollution caused by polymers azeem et al 2014 zhao et al 2021 and all these raise its economic cost and negative environmental impacts and then counteract its positive effectiveness to some degree as a result cru use is limited in improvement of the environmental sustainability level of the integrated system furthermore environmental benefit from cru use in crop production has not been widely reflected in related policies meanwhile farmers especially older farmers always hesitate even refuse to adopt cru due to its relatively higher price than urea and ammonium sulfide and ignorance of the advantages of cru on cu finally special cru varieties are also lacking which also affects nitrogen use efficiency in crop production because cru is sensitive to soil moisture soil texture and soil bioactivity azeem et al 2014 however related fertilizer enterprises have not fully considered these specific factors when manufacturing cru products all these issues affect widespread adoption of cru in crop production to different degrees therefore there is still a long way to achieve widespread adoption of cru in crop production as for relationship between among esi aesi and cdi although esi here corrected as aesi has widely used as an integrated indicator for the sustainability of systems under study generally this index concentrates on sustainability of systems under study in a long run in practice a system with higher sustainability in a long run could conflict with some short time goals such as economic benefit energy efficiency and others to address these issues some scholars have applied two or more evaluation methods to assess performance of systems from different angles including combination of emergy analysis and economic evaluation combination of emergy analysis and energy analysis etc however results from different evaluation methods could conflict with one another which can confuse final decision makers if these inconsistent results are not integrated to this end this study attempts to explore this issue through proposing an index cdi in fact this proposed index aims to search for the relative balance between long term sustainability and some short time gains economic benefit energy efficiency etc so as to provide a whole consistent conclusion for policy decision of course this index still needs further improvement in the future including specific integration ways related weight values of sub indicators 5 uncertainty and sensitivity analysis uncertainties in this study mainly arise from emergy evaluation derived from cited parameters uevs related energy convert coefficients etc those cited parameters could not well match related production systems in time and space therefore a sensitivity analysis is conducted through two scenarios to understand the impact of input parameter changes on the emergy indicators in this study the top two biggest contributors to total emergy in nfps and the top three largest contributors to total emergy in rps shown in sm 11 13 are selected as variables the scenarios are modelled based on these variables changing between 10 10 as demonstrated in sm 15 results of scenario 1 indicate that decrease of main emergy inputs will reduce the environmental load and enhance production efficiency and then raise environmental sustainability the results in scenario 2 show that increase of main inputs will result in the decreased production efficiency and increased environmental load and then weaken the environmental sustainability however changes of emergy based indicator values still fall into the scope of between 10 10 when all those variables alter from 10 to 10 therfore the results are still reliable and can also act as a reference for the following policy making 6 prospects to further promote coordinated development of the integrated sysgtem the following policy making suggestons are pproposed to deal with related adverse impacts from cru use in the future however these countermeasures still need to be deeply investigated in practice considering their diverse effects on comprehensive performance of rice production 1 improving resources structure of cru manufacture on one hand natural gas could be replaced by bioenergy sources in areas where conditions are available on the other hand adopting the renewable electricity into regional national electricity network can improve electricity mix through speeding development of electricity generation using wind solar and other renewable energy sources these measures could further improve environmental sustainability level of crop production through enhancing share of renewable resources and then further strengthening environmental friendliness of cru use 2 mitigating carbon emission intensity from rising ch4 emission in rice plantation due to cru use related measures include the reasonable choice of rice variety singh et al 1999 midseason aeration of paddy fields after short term drainage and improving organic matter management by promoting aerobic degradation through composting or incorporating crop straws into soil in autumn or winter li et al 2008 etc of course related operation conditions and parameters still need to be investigated in specific areas these measures could make crop production better adapt to china s carbon neutral strategy 3 promoting extension of agricultural machinery due to shortage of labor supply in rural areas it is necessary to further promote extension of agricultural machinery for reducing dependance of rice production on labor with rapid economic development and rising urbanization rate the shortage of full time farmers is becoming serious in rural areas which will further raise reliance of crop production on agricultural machinery in the future during the course of rice cultivation and harvest agricultural machinery such as tractors harvesters etc is mainly driven by diesel which has the enormous contribution to total energy use by the end of 2019 the number of tractors had exceeded 22 24 million in china which consumed diesel of 14 68 million tons in agriculture national bureau of statistics 2020 moreover due to the impact of terrain and the transportation distance power consumption of agricultural machinery will become bigger in hilly areas just like this study area and this also further increases diesel consumption to reduce environmental emissions from diesel use the following measures can be considered firstly diesel structure should be improved through using biodiesel asokan et al 2018 uyumaz 2018 secondly traditional tractors could be updated to electric or electrified tractors gao and xue 2020 7 conclusions the study put forward a set of methods and related indicators to evaluate coordinated development of the combined system composed of n fertilizer production and rice plantation from angles of energy consumption carbon emission environmental performance and economic benefit and then the presented approach was applied to a study case in southwest china this study results demonstrate that 1 n2 has the highest energy efficiency followed by n3 and n1 orderly 2 n3 possess the largest carbon emission intensity followed by n2 and n1 in sequence 3 n2 has the highest environmental sustainability followed by n3 and n1 4 n2 has the best economic performance followed by n3 and n1 and 5 n2 achieves the best coordinated development level followed by n3 and n1 generally n2 is the best scheme in the three ones and thus could be considered in this region meanwhile this study also reveals 1 the promotion of cru use to carbon emissions in the whole system which should be emphasized in the future 2 research results based on a larger analysis boundary could provide more complete policy making information than those derived from a smaller one which is necessary for sustainable development of crop production this study puts forward a set of novel methods and indicators to compare comprehensive performance of diverse fertilization schemes composed of n fertilizer production and rice plantation which can also act as one of decision making tools for evaluating other crop production systems credit authorship contribution statement yanfeng lyu raw data collection methodology writing original draft preparation

24225,fertilization methods significantly affects sustainability of agricultural production through controlling nutrient efficiency and related environmental emissions as well as energy and economic performance at crop cultivation and fertilizer production stage therein controlled release urea cru use has been proved to raise nitrogen use efficiency and reduce some nitrogen related environmental emissions however related studies have not been found to address whether cru can promote coordinated development of crop production based on the energy efficiency carbon emission intensity environmental performance and economic benefit from this fertilizer production to crop plantation which could affect reasonable utilization of cru due to prejudiced conclusions based on inadequate decision making information derived from one or two or three aspects abovementioned to this end this study proposed a set of evaluation system composed of energy efficiency carbon emission intensity and emergy based environmental performance through integrating environmental emissions impact as well as economic benefit to investigate the coordinated development of rice production with different fertilization schemes composed of altering ratios of cru to common urea cu in doing so we attempt to search for the relative balance between long run sustainability of crop production and short term gains of stakeholders the presented approach was applied to a study case from sichuan province china based on three fertilization schemes i e n1 single cu n2 single cru and n3 blend application of 60 cru and 40 cu with the expanded analysis boundary from n fertilizer production to its application in rice plantation the results indicate that 1 relative to n1 introduction of cru increases energy efficiency by 33 15 and 53 09 for n3 and n2 respectively in terms of kj kg rice production efficiency by 0 85 and 3 39 for n3 and n2 respectively in terms of adjusted emergy yield rate and economic benefit by 14 53 and 17 95 for n3 and n2 respectively in terms of benefit cost ratio or increased by 15 87 and 26 98 for n3 and n2 respectively in terms of adjusted benefit to cost ratio mainly derived from improving n use efficiency and saving labor 2 introduction of cru weakens resource structure by 0 98 and 3 23 for n3 and n2 respectively and raises environmental load by 0 31 and 2 51 for n3 and n2 respectively due to enlarging share of purchased non renewable resources and promoting methane emission respectively 3 introduction of cru enhances environmental sustainability by 0 27 and 0 55 for n3 and n2 respectively relative to n1 and 4 generally n2 realizes the best coordinated development followed by n3 and n1 improving resource structure and mitigating carbon emissions should be emphasized when popularizing cru use in rice production keywords rice plantation controlled release urea energy consumption emergy carbon emission data availability related raw data have been provided in supplementary materials 1 introduction although nitrogen n fertilizer contributed greatly to ensuring food security overuse of n fertilizer in crop production cui et al 2010 has brought about serious risks on environmental quality and human health in china due to significant acidification in croplands guo et al 2010 lots of nh3 and n2o emissions gu et al 2012 zhang et al 2019 and enhanced nitrogen deposition liu et al 2013 so improving nitrogen use efficiency nue in crop production is one of the important measures for ensuring food security preventing environmental degradation and mitigating climate change zhang et al 2015 therein use of controlled release urea cru has been regarded as one of effective alternative of common urea cu due to synchronizing n release rates with crop n demand akiyama et al 2010 and labor saving due to the one off application of cru guo et al 2017 to reduce fertilizer cost some scholars proposed use of blending urea bu that consists of both cru and cu jarosiewicz and tomaszewska 2003 noellsch et al 2009 while ensuring grain yield consequently amounts of studies have been implemented to investigate issues related to nue economic benefit and environmental impacts from use of cru or bu in cropping systems in recent years lots of studies have been done to investigate effectiveness of ratios of cru and cu in crop planting stage such as potential ability of greenhouse gas emissions reduction zhong et al 2016 effects on nue and crop yield ke et al 2018 guo et al 2021 zheng et al 2016 influences on nue and crop yield as well economic benefit li et al 2015 guo et al 2017 zheng et al 2017 etc generally compared to cu these studies demonstrated that introduction of cru could ensure grain yield and economic benefit due to reduce n loss as well as labor cost saving however those issues including energy efficiency the environmental contribution to crop production and related environmental emissions impacts have not been investigated simultaneously in addition their analysis boundary is limited to crop plantation stage and thus could lead to inadequate information for policy making for example rock et al 2021 shortlisted and analyzed 22 environmental building stock modelling approaches and found main limitations of those approaches on their effectiveness in supporting decarbonization efforts which are derived from small system boundaries and thus lack of comprehensive life cycle assessment likewise only concentrating on crop plantation stage could ignore environmental impacts from production of agricultural materials such as fertilizers pesticides etc and then lead to incomplete decision making information to explore environmental effects of introduction of cru in the larger scope life cycle assessment lca and other performance evaluation methods are combined zhang et al 2021 and yao et al 2021 assessed agronomic environmental and ecosystem economic benefits from introduction of cru in wheat production and maize production respectively and found that application of cru at optimal fertilization schemes 170 kg n ha 1 and 180 kg n ha 1 for wheat production and maize production respectively with ratio of cru to cu 1 and the one time application before planting could raise a high grain yield and ecosystem economic benefit as well as mitigate the negative environmental impacts however they have not considered related energy efficiency and the environmental contribution to crop systems which cannot provide related information on energy saving and the environmental values for policy making since abovementioned studies ignore the environmental contribution to plantation systems some scholars have investigated comprehensive performance of plantation systems using emergy analysis ema or combination of ema and other methods because ema quantifies the environmental contribution to crop plantation systems through distinguishing quality differences of diverse kinds of inputs based on a common measure therein ghisellini et al 2014 investigated the sustainability of italian agricultural system through an emergy decomposition analysis houshyar et al 2018 implemented an emergy evaluation of sustainability of wheat and maize production in the warm climate of southwestern iran zhang et al 2016 and su et al 2020 carried out an emergy evaluation of the sustainability of chinese crop production system and then they put forward related measures to improve sustainability level of related plantation systems however they ignore emissions impacts from crop systems on emergy based indicators which could make the environmental performance deviate from actual situation to some degree meanwhile related energy efficiency and or economic performance have not been considered and thus could not provide full policy making information in recent years combination of several methods have been applied to performance evaluation of crop production systems such as combination of energy emergy and economic approaches jafari et al 2018 wang et al 2018 combination of life cycle assessment emergy and economic analysis chen et al 2021 combination of emergy and economic analysis wang et al 2021 and then these studies put forward related measures to improve performance of those agricultural systems however their studies could not provide a holistic result due to lacking merger of results from the several methods besides ignorance of emissions effects on emergy based indicators which could be difficult to make an overall conclusion when results of several methods collide with each other lyu et al 2021 assessed impact of fertilization schemes with different ratios of cu to cru on environmental sustainability nue and economic benefit of rice plantation in southwest china therein they improved emissions impact quantification methods in terms of emergy then integrated different kinds of emissions impacts into related emergy indicators respectively and finally merged nue economic indicator and emergy sustainability index into a comprehensive index in doing so they provided separate information on nue economic benefit and environmental performance respectively as well as a united result derived from results merger of three different methods for the final decision making however their analysis boundary is still limited to crop plantation stage meanwhile they have not provided detailed information on energy performance and carbon emission yet which should be concerned under the background of carbon neutrality of china as far as impacts of cru use on the integrated systems composed of n fertilizer production and crop plantation systems related studies have not been found yet although some advantages of cru use over cu use in crop plantation have been proved other related issues have not been clarified from cru production to its use in crop plantation including 1 energy efficiency and carbon emissions 2 economic benefit 3 environmental performance integrated with environmental contribution and emissions impacts and 4 the overall result based on related energy efficiency carbon emissions intensity and environmental and economic performances compared to single cu use of cru still incur other resources consumption and environmental emissions due to extra inputs from its manufacture stage therefore following issues need further investigation when the analysis boundary is expanded from cropping stage to cru and cu production stage including 1 whether the use of cru or bu can improve energy efficiency and reduce carbon emissions 2 whether their application can improve economic benefit 3 whether their use can promote the environmental sustainability of the expanded system when considering the environmental contribution and emissions impacts and 4 whether its use can enhance coordination degree between energy efficiency carbon emission intensity environmental performance and economic benefit as pointed out by xu and lan 2017 the product and farm carbon footprints of rice are all much larger than those of wheat and maize in china so this research chose rice plantation in sichuan province southwest china as a case study to investigate effects of different ratios of cru and cu on energy efficiency carbon emission intensity and modified emergy sustainability as well as economic benefit of the combined system composed of n fertilizer production stage and rice plantation stage here the emergy energy and economic techniques are adopted because they are different but complement each other each considering a specific aspect of one system and their joint use can show more complete information for policy making jafari et al 2018 investigating all these issues can provide more adequate information for policy making this study put forward a set of novel methods and indicators to optimize fertilization schemes which can act as one of optimization tools for plantation systems meanwhile this study also reveals 1 the promotion of cru use to carbon emissions in the integrated system which has not been pointed out in the existing literature and 2 research results based on a larger analysis boundary providing more complete policy making information than those derived from a smaller one which should be emphasized when promoting sustainable agriculture 2 introduction of the study case 2 1 n fertilizer production in this study two industrial enterprises were investigated one is for urea production the other one is for cru production the urea enterprise located in sichuan province china produces urea using carbon dioxide extraction gas carbon and ammonia as its main raw material and its annual output is 300 000 t urea with the nitrogen content of 46 the other one located in shandong province china produces cru using urea toluene diisocyanate and polyol as raw materials and its annual output is 50 000 t cru with a nitrogen content of 44 and a release period of 90 days 2 2 rice plantation in this study the three categories of n fertilizer treatments i e cu cru and bu were applied to rice plantation a field experiment was conducted in yanting county located in sichuan province southwestern china the local recommended fertilization scheme for rice plantation is 150 kg n ha 75 kg p2o5 ha and 75 kg k2o ha respectively the adopted rice variety was yixiang 725 rice was transplanted on may 14 2019 and harvested on august 31 2019 experimental treatments for the study were laid out according to a randomized completed block design and three treatments were considered according to our preliminary test in the year 2018 including single cu n1 single cru n2 and blend application of 60 cru and 40 cu n3 and each treatment included four replications there are no differences in their inputs among the three treatments except their types of n fertilizers furthermore areas of three treatments were adjusted to a unit area of 1 ha in one year to ease comparison detailed information on the site description the field experimental schemes and the sampling and monitoring analysis were shown in supporting material sm 1 for each treatment there are no statistically significant differences of rice yield among its four replications sm 14 therefore in the following calculation we adopt the mean yield of each treatment to calculate related indicator values 3 methods 3 1 analysis boundary as shown in fig 1 the analysis boundary starts with the n fertilizer production in the two enterprises and ends with the rice harvest main input categories of fertilizer production include local environmental inputs industrial raw materials energy sources and labor and service and input items of rice plantation are composed of local environmental inputs agricultural materials and energy sources as well as labor and service main output items includ rice grain and various environmental emissions generated in the two stages 3 2 energy consumption to investigate energy efficiency of rice plantation energy consumption of this crop production should be calculated in this study the direct energy consumption from the n fertilizer production to application in rice plantation mainly comes from fuel natural gas and electricity and it is obtained by using raw data multiplied by its corresponding conversion factors sac standardization administration of p r c 2020 as follow 1 e n c i n e i k i 29307 6 where enc refers to the energy consumption kj n is the number of types of energy sources consumed ei stands for the amount of i th energy source kg kw h or mj ki means the standard coal coefficient of i th energy source kg ce kg kg ce kw h kg ce mj detailed information was shown in sm 2 29307 6 is the net calorific value of 1 kg chinese standard coal kj kg ce then we calculate the energy consumption intensity i e energy consumption per unit rice yield encuy and the higher indicator value reflects lower energy efficiency and vice versa the encuy can be computed using eq 2 2 e n c u y e n c r y where encuy stands for the energy consumption per unit rice yield kj kg and ry is the rice yield per hectare kg ha 3 3 carbon emissions carbon emissions involve in the total carbon emissions and carbon emissions per unit rice yield and they are calculated as follows 1 total carbon emissions total carbon emissions linked to the n fertilizer production and n fertilizer application in crop plantation are calculated through the following formula 3 t c e c e p c e a where tce refers to the total carbon emissions and are expressed in co2 equivalent co2 eq cep stands for the carbon emissions from n fertilizer production kg co2 eq including ch4 and co2 cea is the carbon emissions in n fertilizer application kg co2 eq including the ch4 and co2 from rice growth as well as the carbon emission from diesel burning and labor force it is noted that here n2o from rice plantation isn t considered because its emission amount is too little under the experimental conditions therefore cep and cea can be obtained through the following formulas 4 c e p c e c o 2 c e c h 4 28 5 c e a c e c o 2 c e c h 4 28 c e d i e c e l a b where cep and cea stands for the carbon emission from n fertilizer production and application kg co2 eq respectively ceco2 and cech4 represent the mass of co2 and ch4 kg respectively 28 is the emission conversion factor of the global warming potential on 100 years of ch4 ipcc 2013 cedie and celab are the carbon emission from diesel burning and labors respectively their emission factors are cited from lyu et al 2020 2 carbon emission per unit rice yield we calculate the carbon emission per unit rice yield linked to the n fertilizer production and application through the formula 6 and the larger indicator value means higher carbon emission intensity 6 c e u y t c e r y where ceuy stands for carbon emission per unit rice yield kg co2 eq kg 3 4 emergy evaluation 3 4 1 introduction of ema ema founded by odum is applied to the evaluation of the environmental efficiency of ecological systems brown and herendeen 1996 odum 1996 slesser 1974 and it was defined as the available energy exergy used directly or indirectly to generate a product or service expressed in units of solar energy joule sej odum 1996 all the inputs should be converted into the same measurement by their corresponding unit emergy values uevs different from energy accounting ema distinguish quality differences of diverse energy sources and considers the environmental contribution to artifcial activities and thus it can evaluate comprehensive performance of a system based on a common measure it is noted that all uves should be based on the same geobiosphere emergy baseline geb in one study to keep consistency up to now the geb has been revised several times by various researchers brown et al 2016 brown and ulgiati 2010 campbell et al 2005 odum 1996 odum 2000 in this study all the uevs are converted to the latest one i e geb 12 0 e 24 sej yr based on the emergy rule algebra the total emergy u was computed according to eq 7 7 u e i u e v i where u refers to the total emergy sej ei stands for the amount of energy mass or money of i th input in j kg or and uevi refers to the uev of i th input in sej j sej kg or sej as for labor and service l s amounting in this study it is noted that here service refers to artificial work embodied at construction stage while labor stands for artificial work embodied in purchased raw materials and energy sources as well as maintenance at operation stage due to the different channels of data acquisition l s are both measured in unit of currency in the n fertilizer production stage while service was measured in the unit of currency and labor was measure in the unit of working hours in the rice production stage 3 4 2 emergy flow as shown in fig 2 the whole system consists of two subsystems i e the n fertilizer production system nfps and the rice production system rps hence total emergy can also be summarized using eq 8 8 u u 1 u 2 where u1 and u2 are the total emergy of nfps and rps respectively for nfps its total emergy is derived from the local renewable resources r1 such as sunlight rain imported renewable resources fr1 such l s with a renewable fraction of 2 75 lyu et al 2021 imported nonrenewable resources fn1 such as natural gas nonrenewable part of l s and its output is the n fertilizer y1 and environmental emissions therefore the total emergy of nfps can be calculated as follows 9 u 1 r 1 f r 1 f n 1 environmental emissions in nfps that exceed the environmental self purification capacity require extra ecological services to dilute them here named as ese1 because they generally exceed the related environmental quality standard these emissions could also affect the environmental function and human health before they reach related acceptable levels and then will lead to potential emergy loss el1 rps as a modern human dominated stage requires not only local renewable resources r2 including sun rain etc and local nonrenewable resources n soil organic matters but also needs nonrenewable purchased inputs fn2 such as fertilizers pesticides nonrenewable part of l s etc as well as renewable l s fr2 here the total emergy of rps can be obtained according to eq 10 10 u 2 r 2 n f r 2 f n 2 the main outputs of rps include rice yield y2 and related environmental emissions furthermore environmental effects derived from environmental emissions include positive environmental effects and negative ones here positive environmental effects are from recharge of underground water and capture of co2 since this system consumes much more water than other plantation systems it can also recharge groundwater due to the long period of flooded conditions meanwhile rice photosynthesis promotes the increase of biomass through capturing carbon dioxide here we regard these two kinds of positive effects as beneficial ecological services bes negative impacts derive from environmental emissions harm to human health and environmental functions here environmental emissions during the planting stage mainly include co2 ch4 ammonia volatilization no3 n nh4 n etc these emissions will cause extra environmental load when exceeding related environmental quality standards and then lead to potential emergy loss el2 before they attain acceptable levels 3 4 3 quantification of emissions impact in terms of emergy 1 quantifying bes due to the longtime flooded situation and lots of water consumption of rps underwater can be recharged during rice plantation here the emergy of recharged groundwater can be attained according to eq 11 based on ref shah et al 2019 11 e m w r p ρ s k u e v g w where emwr stands for the emergy of recharged groundwater sej p means annual precipitation on the rice plantation area m here referring to that in 2019 ρ is water density kg m3 s is the cultivation area m2 k stands for the infiltration coefficient i e 0 203 liu 2007 uevgw is the uev of groundwater besides water recharge the photosynthesis of rice should be also considered as one of carbon capture ways meanwhile during the plantation stage carbon emissions still include co2 and ch4 from the rice plantation and carbon emissions from energy consumption and labor force therefore the rps acts as both carbon sink and carbon source simultaneously and the difference between the two ones determines whether it s net carbon sequestration or net carbon emissions detailed calculation can be expressed using eq 12 12 c s s i s o c s i 44 12 c s o where cssi so refers to the difference between carbon sink and carbon source kg co2 eq csi stand for the carbon sequestration derived from the increase of net primary productivity npp and related calculation method is cited from refs lyu et al 2021 wang et al 2016 npp is roughly equal to 45 of the biomass of rice including aboveground and underground luo 2009 44 12 stands for conversion fraction for converting c into co2 cso is the carbon emissions during rice plantation kg co2 eq cssi so 0 stands for net carbon sequestration which will produce ecological benefits and thus mitigate greenhouse effect cssi so 0 means net carbon emission which will promote greenhouse effect and then will be further quantified in the following part eq 24 and cssi so 0 refers to carbon balance therein the ecological benefit of net carbon sequestration can be measured in terms of emergy using eq 13 according to ref shah et al 2019 13 e m s i s o c s s i s o u e v c s where emsi so is the ecological benefit of net carbon sequestration sej uevc s refers to the specific emergy value of biomass in rice plantation sej kg co2 eq lyu et al 2021 finally total emergy of bes can be calculated using eq 14 14 e m b e s e m w r e m s i s o 2 quantifying ese because of the limited self purification capacity of the environment sometimes extra ecological services are needed to reduce concentrations of discharged pollutants i e dilute air pollutants by using clean air and water pollutants by using clean water the calculation procedure includes 1 calculation of the extra amount of air or water needed and 2 quantification of the ese detailed calculation methods are shown in eqs 15 18 15 m i e x a i r w a t e r d a i r w a t e r m i a i r w a t e r e v c i a i r w a t e

is the mass of i th air water pollutant emitted in both nfps and rps kg evci air water is the environmental capacity of i th air water pollutant here it is still considered as zero for air emissions because local air quality often cannot meet related class i in the national ambient air quality standard of china while those water discharges do not need extra ecological service because their concentrations are smaller than local underwater environmental quality standard according to our experimental data ci air water stands for the acceptable concentration of i th pollutant esei air is

water energy can dilute diverse air pollutants or groundwater pollutants simultaneously the total ese value is equal to the sum of the greatest value among those values of esei air and the largest one among those values of esei water to avoid double accounting eq 18 the acceptable concentration values of air pollutants and water pollutants are shown in sm 3 ese1 and ese2 refer to the ese of nfps and rps respectively 3 quantifying el before reaching the acceptable levels air and water pollutants could also lead to emergy loss derived from their potential harm to human health for comparison we use eco indicator 99 assessment method to standardize the negative effect of various emissions on human health through disability adjusted life years dalys goedkoop 1999 furthermore emergy loss due to emissions harm to human health can be obtained through eq 19 19 e l e l 1 e l 2 m i e v c i d a l y i τ 2019 where el refers to the emergy loss sej el1 and el2 are emergy loss of nfps and rps

per capita in the year 2019 i e 2 71e 16 sej person yr lyu et al 2021 here environmental emissions considered and related parameters are given in table 1 4 net environmental effect as mentioned above since there exist both positive and negative environmental effects simultaneously in the integrated system the net environmental effect can be computed through formula 20 20 n e e e m b e s e s e e l where nee represents the net environmental effect nee 0 stands for environmental benefits nee 0 means negative environmental impact and nee 0 refers to no effect 3 4 4 emergy related indicators considering emissions effects on environmental performance we integrate positive and negative emissions impacts into related classic emergy based indicators to attain three improved ones lyu et al 2021 i e adjusted emergy yield ratio aeyr adjusted environmental loading ratio aelr and adjusted emergy sustainability index aesi in addition one new indicator i e environmental efficiency ene is also built meanwhile two classic indicators are also adopted including uev and r and all these indicators are described as follows 1 uev uev is the ratio of total emergy input to yield sej kg it s a response to the resources efficiency of a system i e a lower indicator value means higher resources efficiency it can be obtained through the following formula 21 u e v u r y where u is the total emergy sej ry refers to rice yield kg 1 r it is the proportion of renewable inputs including local renewable resources and purchased renewable inputs to the total emergy the larger indicator value is more beneficial for promoting sustainability of a system in study it can be obtained through eq 22 22 r r 1 r 2 f r 1 f r 2 u 100 2 ene environmental efficiency nonrenewable resources depletion and adverse emissions impacts have become the two main obstacles hindering sustainable development of social economy since the industrial revolution to measure effect of the two factors on product production systems here the indicator ene is proposed and it is defined as the ratio of environmental cost to value of product or services reflecting how much environmental cost is needed to achieve a unit product or service and the smaller indicator value reflects the higher environmental efficiency in detail the environmental cost emergy equivalent includes two categories one is the cost of non renewable resources depletion including fossil energy mineral resources soil organic matter etc and the other one is the cost of environmental quality degradation caused by carbon emission extra ecological services and emergy loss and emergy of the product or service equals to the product of economic output and ratio of emergy to money shown in sm 4 the indicator can be calculated according to eq 23 23 e n e e m r e s e m e n v e m p r o o r s e r f n 1 f n 2 n e m p r o o r s e r e m t c e e l e s e e m p r o o r s e r where emres and emenv refers to the cost of resource depletion and environmental degradation cost in sej respectively empro or ser is the emergy of one product or service fn1 and fn2 stands for the imported nonrenewable inputs in n fertilizer production and rice plantation respectively n is the local nonrenewable input soil organic matter emtce means emergy of carbon emissions effects and it can be calculated through eq 20 24 e m t c e t c e u e v c o 2 where tce kg co2 eq can be obtained through formula 3 uevco2 is uev of carbon emissions effects sej kg co2 eq which are shown in sm 4 1 aeyr this is a modified indicator on the basis of classic emergy indicator emergy yield ratio eyr which is defined as the total emergy input divided by the purchased input and it is used to measure production efficiency of the system i e the bigger indicator value means the higher production efficiency or stronger competition ability here el is thought to decrease the net emergy output while bes enhances the net emergy output therefore it is necessary to integrate the emergy of bes and emergy loss into the indicator to fully reflect environmental emissions effect on the competitive ability of the system through the following formula lyu et al 2021 25 m e y r u e m b e s e l f r 1 f r 2 f n 1 f n 2 2 aelr classic environmental load ratio elr equals to the sum of local nonrenewable resources and imported inputs divided by local renewable resources the higher indicator value reflects the larger environmental load on the local environment in this study we categorized imported inputs into renewable and nonrenewable ones meanwhile ese will place extra pressure on the local environment due to exceeding local environmental capacity and thus it should be integrated into the elr then the modified indicator aelr can be calculated using eq 26 based on ref lyu et al 2021 26 m e l r n f n 1 f n 2 e s e r f r 1 f r 2 3 aesi classic esi equals to the ratio of eyr and elr reflecting the sustainability of a system in the long run likewise esi was also corrected to aesi through considering the structure of imported inputs and environmental emissions impacts the bigger indicator value reflects the relatively higher sustainable level and this index is calculated through eq 27 cited from ref lyu et al 2021 27 m e s i m e y r m e l r 3 5 economic analysis in this study the final product is rice grain which is needed to be traded in markets and its market competitiveness should be assessed by economic analysis here we consider the benefit to cost ratio bcr the higher indicator value indicates stronger market competitiveness similarly we incorporate the environmental effects into bcr and then built the modified indicator abcr adjusted benefit cost ratio according to ref lyu et al 2021 firstly the net environmental effect should be transferred into money through ratio of emergy to money rem as follows 28 e b n e e n e e re m 2019 where ebnee is the monetized net environmental effect nee can be obtained through eq 20 and rem2019 is the ratio of emergy to money in 2019 sej sm 4 then abcr can be calculated through eq 29 29 m b c r n e b e b n e e e c b c r e b n e e e c where neb is the net economic benefit that can be obtained through the difference between economic output and economic cost ec is the economic cost and bcr is the benefit to cost ratio 3 6 coordination degree index abovementioned indicators show the performances from various aspects nevertheless generally policymakers always want to attain an overall result for final decision making in practice it is assumed that decision makers consider energy efficiency cabon emission intensity environmental sustanability and economic benefit simultaneously so as to make the final decision here we assume that the four aspects have equal importance in the decision making therefore a new comprehensive index cdi coordination degree index is established to link energy consumption intensity carbon emission intensity environmental sustainability and economic benefit therein energy consumption intensity and carbon emission intensity are negatively related to cdi environmental sustainability and economic benefit are postively related to cdi and then this index can be calculated as follows 30 c d i j e n c u y c e u y e n c u y j c e u y j m e s i j m b c r j m e s i m b c r where encuyj ceuyj mesij and mbcrj refers to energy consumption per unit rice yield carbon emission per unit rice yield modified emergy sustainability index and modified benefit cost ratio of the j th treatment e n c u y c e u y m e s i and m b c r stands for average values of energy consumption per unit rice yield carbon emission per unit rice yield modified emergy sustainability index and modified benefit cost ratio of all treatments the larger index value means more coordination relationship among the four indicators or better comprehnesive performance based on the average level to furhter quantify one indicator s impact degree on comprehensive performance of the system in study here the following indicator iid one indicator s impact degree is proposed as follows 31 i i d j n c d i j n a c d i j n b c d i j n b 100 where c d i j n b and c d i j n a is indicator value of cdi before and after considering impact of the n th indicator on index cdi of the j th treatment when iid 0 the larger indicator value reflects the bigger contribution of one indicator to the comprehnsive performance of the j th treatment iid 0 means no impact and the larger absolute value of indicator reflects the bigger adverse effect of one indicator when iid 0 3 7 data resources raw data of local renewable inputs for nfps are collected from the local statistical yearbook the data of local renewable inputs for rps come from yanting agro ecological station of purple soil of the chinese academy of sciences other inputs data for nfps are collected from the informal interviews with owners of enterprises including raw materials energy consumption environmental emissions and others the prices of industrial and agricultural materials are from dealers and market price surveys uevs of services synthetic ammonia urea and labor are calculated by this study as shown in sm 5 8 respectively and other uevs cited in this research are from published literature or databases sm 4 microsoft excel 2019 is applied for data processing and charting and emergy flow diagrams are accomplished in microsoft visio 2019 4 results and discussion 4 1 energy consumption sm 9 illustrates the structure of energy consumption for n1 energy use of nfps has a share of 52 28 in the total energy consumption to which natural gas contributes 91 79 energy use of rps contributes 47 72 in which fuel and electricity have the share of 85 93 and 14 07 respectively for n2 energy use of nfps and rps contributes 16 37 and 83 63 respectively therein electricity is the biggest contributor with the share of 99 98 in nfps fuel is the largest contributor 85 93 in rps followed by electricity 14 07 for n3 nfps contributes 35 72 to total energy consumption while rps has a share of 64 28 therein natural gas has the largest contribution in nfps fuel contributes 85 93 to the energy consumption of rps followed by electricity 14 07 in summary energy consumption and its intensity follow the trend of n1 n3 n2 fig 3 a due to the clear differences in rice yield the gap of encuy is bigger than the gap of enc per area among systems i e compared with n1 encs of n2 and n3 are lower by 42 96 and 25 78 while encuys of n2 and n3 is lower by 53 09 and 33 15 respectively therefore n2 has the highest energy efficiency in three schemes based on the energy consumtion per unit area and per unit rice yield followed by n3 and n1 to further raise its energy efficiency fuel use should be paid more attention to in rps for n2 besides natural gas consumption in nfps the high share of fuel in the rps roots in the agricultural machinery application during rice plantation kazemi et al 2015 lal et al 2020 pishgar komleh et al 2011 since fuel burning leads to lots of air emissions alluvione et al 2011 fei and lin 2017 improving fuel mix and combustion efficiency should be further concerned yuan and peng 2017 4 2 carbon emission as for carbon emission sm 10 the largest emission source is n2 followed by n3 and n1 orderly furthermore the highest carbon emission roots in rice plantation stage overall the biggest contributor to total carbon emission is rps more than 99 in the three treatments derived from a large quantity of ch4 emissions in the anaerobic environment which has been proved by lan et al 2020 and maraseni et al 2018 therein ch4 contributes 63 44 65 68 and 61 68 to the carbon emission in rps for n1 n2 and n3 respectively therefore n fertilizer use should be more emphasized as it promotes much more carbon emission than its production and other fertilizer products production wu et al 2021 as illustrated in fig 3 b ceuy follows the trend of n3 n2 n1 here there is a somewhat trade off effect in n2 on the one hand n2 has the highest carbon emission mainly due to the higher fertilizer use efficiency of cru which is more conducive to tillering of rice but also provides more channels for ch4 transport through rice plants which enhances c substrate availability for methanogens in the rhizosphere ma et al 2013 singh et al 1999 on the other hand the carbon emission intensity of n2 is mitigated to some degree due to its highest yield also proved by ref banger et al 2012 in a word n1 has the lowest carbon emission intensity in the three schmes in terms of carbon emission per unit area and per unit rice yield in other words here introduction of cru in rice plantation promotes carbon emissions to different degrees compared to single cu use which deserves more attention in the future 4 3 emergy evaluation 4 3 1 emergy flows detailed emergy evaluation results for each treatment are demonstrated in sms 11 13 for n1 nfps and rps contributes 30 51 and 69 49 to the total emergy respectively therein synthetic ammonia contributes the most in the n fertilizer production stage 63 58 followed by natural gas 10 99 and electricity 2 12 for the rps the biggest contributor is labors 36 68 followed by services 36 14 for n2 the nfps and the rps have shares of 34 79 and 65 21 in the total emergy respectively therein in the nfps emergy input of urea as main raw material of cru is the largest contributor 71 86 followed by electricity 3 96 in rice plantation stage the services contributes the largest 41 05 followed by labors 29 51 for n3 contributions of nfps and rps are 34 15 and 65 85 to the total emergy input respectively therein the services is the largest contributor 39 28 in the rps followed by the labors 30 39 overall total emergy input follows the trend of n2 n1 n3 therein rps acts as the absolute contributor to the total emergy input in the three schemes more than 65 moreover this stage shows high reliance on labors and services l s which highlights one of charateristics of contemporary crop production in addition it is found that cru use reduces the l s input by 5 97 and 9 63 for n2 and n3 respectively relative to n1 as for the structure of emergy input fig 4 imported inputs contribute about 90 90 03 for n1 90 23 for n2 and 89 83 for n3 to the total emergy input 99 of which come from nonrenewable ones in summary n2 has the worst resources structure and the biggest emergy use per area in the three schemes therefore introduction of cru adversely affect the resource structure of this intengrated system 4 3 2 environmental emissions effects as shown in table 2 it is found that water recharge is the largest contributor to bes of the three schemes 90 08 91 29 followed by carbon capture therein there are little differences among bes values of water recharge for the three schemes however compared to n1 bes value of carbon capture from n3 raises by 15 26 while that from n2 has no clear changes generaly there are no clear differences among total bes of the three schemes due to absolute contribution of bes values of water recharge for emergy loss and extra ecological services they both follow the same trend of n1 n3 n2 as for emergy loss comapred to n1 n2 and n3 reduce this indicator value by 84 52 and 12 35 respectively therein nfps and rps cut this value by 77 91 and 7 87 times respectively for n2 and nfps enhances this value by 91 47 but rps cuts this value by 48 26 for n3 el mainly comes from rps for n1 and n2 while it is mainly dierved from nfps for n3 as for ese comapred to n1 n2 and n3 reduce this indicator value by 23 57 and 14 33 respectively therein nfps and rps decrease this value by 23 57 and 85 80 respectively for n2 and nfps and rps cut this value 14 33 and 53 61 for n3 most of ese comes from nfps for the three schemes followed by rps therein the extra services are mainly used to dilute the dust in the fertilizer production stage while the extra services are mainly needed to dilute nh3 in rice plantation for the three schemes finally as far as nee is concerned comapred to n1 n2 and n3 enhance this indicator value by 1 71 times and 41 58 respectively in a word n2 produces the greatest environmental benefit among the three schemes followed by n3 then n1 it should be noted the systems n1 and n3 involved in cu result in relatively higher adverse effects on human health and the environement due to higher emissions mainy rooting in the higher n loss in rps li et al 2013 zheng et al 2017 here nues of n1 n2 and n3 are 12 18 23 36 and 17 80 respectively under the same n application rate based on the corresponding rice yields 7681 kg 9359 kg and 8525 kg per hectare according to our field experiment sm 14 compared with n1 nue and yield of n2 increase by 91 79 and 21 85 while nue and yield of n3 raise by 46 14 and 10 99 this also demonstrates that cru can raise rice yield through enhancing n use efficiency consquently n2 has the best environmental benefit because it produces the lowest adverse emissions impacts due to higher nue guo et al 2017 guo et al 2021 while keeps the similar bes to the other two schemes 4 3 3 emergy indicators as illustrated in table 3 for uev it is found that n2 has the highest resource efficiency followed by n3 and then n1 orderly compared to n1 resource efficiency of n2 and n3 rises by 11 07 and 5 37 respectively according to r the three systems have a large reliance on imported resources comparatively speaking n1 has the largest share of renewable resources followed by n3 and n2 compared to n1 share of renewable resources of n2 and n3 decreases by 3 23 and 0 98 respectively and this shows that structure of resource input of the system is becoming worse with increasing share of cru results of ene values reveals that n2 has the highest environmental efficiency in the three schemes followed by n3 and then n1 which is consistent with trends from uevs compared to n1 environmental efficiency of n2 and n3 rises by 20 13 and 12 34 respectively regarding aeyr it is revealed that n2 has the highest production efficiency followed by n3 and n1 compared to n1 production efficiency of n2 and n3 rises by 3 39 and 0 85 respectively indicator values of aelr show that n2 has the largest environmental load followed by n3 and n1 compared to n1 environmental load of n2 and n3 rises by 2 51 and 0 31 respectively as far as aesi is concerned it reflects that n2 has the highest sustianbility level followed by n3 ans n1 compared to n1 environmental sustainability of n2 and n3 increases by 0 55 and 0 27 respectively in summary cru use slightly enhances the environmental sustainability because improvement of production efficiency resulting from its application is slightly larger than enlargement of environmental load from increased share of non renewable resources caused by cru production compared with the study of lyu et al 2021 which was done in the same location with the same experimental schemes using the same emergy indicators with this study but different analysis boundary systems from this study some interesting findings are revealed table 3 results from r shows cru use worses resource structure of the integrated system in this study while cru use improves resource structure of rice plantation in the study of lyu et al 2021 results from aeyr shows cru use enhances production efficiency of the integrated system in this study as well as rice plantation according to ref lyu et al 2021 however single cru use has larger contribution to production efficiency of the intengrated system than that of the rice plantation system results from aelr show that cru use enhances environmental load of the integrated system while cru use reduces environmental load of rice plantation system finally the two studies achieve some similar conclusions even based on different analysis boundaries i e introduction of cru can promote environmental sustainability of rice plantation however this study demonstrates that single cru use is more beneficial for environmental sustainability of the integrated system while lyu et al 2021 showed that bu use is more beneficial for environmental sustainability of the rice plantation system all these differences lie in distinct analysis boundaries to well address complex resource and environemntal issues generally results based on a larger analysis boundary can attain more complete information than those derived from a smaller one 4 4 economic assessment as described in table 4 n2 has the best economic cost followed by n3 and n1 compared to n1 economic cost of n2 and n3 rises by 11 13 and 3 28 respectively n2 has the highest economic output then n3 and n1 compared to n1 economic output of n2 and n3 rises by 21 84 and 11 36 respectively n2 has the highest net economic benefit then n3 and n1 compared to n1 net economic benefit of n2 and n3 rises by 30 96 and 17 54 respectively n2 has the highest benefit cost ratio followed by n3 and then n1 compared to n1 benefit cost ratio of n2 and n3 rises by 17 95 and 14 53 respectively n2 has the highest environmental benefit followed by n3 and then n1 compared to n1 environmental benefit of n2 and n3 rises by 1 71 times and 41 67 respectively n2 has the highest modified benefit cost ratio followed by n3 and then n1 compared to n1 modified benefit cost ratio of n2 and n3 rises by 26 98 and 15 87 respectively in a word results from different economic indicators all demontrate that n2 has the best economic performance followed by n3 relative to n1 when considering environmental benefit the economic benefit of each scheme all increases to different degrees however n2 is still the best one among the three schemes and this shows that the application of cru improves economic performance and environmental benefits through raising nitrogen utilization rate and saving labors which also has been proved in relevant studies geng et al 2015 li et al 2015 generally results from economic evaluation support cru use in rice plantation it is noted that compared to n1 increased environmental benefit per kilogram cru use is 0 55 for n2 application amount of cru product in n2 was 341 kg ha and 0 13 for n3 application amount of cru product in n3 was 205 kg ha respectively and they are 122 22 and 29 75 of the price of cru product the price of cru is 450 t therefore n2 produces the higher environmental benefit the environmental benefit can be used as a reference for fiscal subsidies of cru use that is at least subsidizing 30 of the price of cru to growers to encourage them to use cru in rice plantation to protect local ecological envronment in fact some local governments in china have taken related measures for example in guangdong province china the agricultural sector has encouraged farmers to use cru through financial subsidies at 25 of the market price of cru products department of agriculture and rural affairs of guangdong province 2020 4 5 cdi table 5 shows the coordination degree between encuy ceuy aesi and abcr it is found that n2 achieves the best coordination degree followed by n3 and n1 meanwhile the coordination degree rises with increasing share of cru results from iid table 5 demonstrate that for n1 carbon emission intensity has slight contribution to improvement of its comprehensive performance however energy and econmic indicators all clearly weaken its comprehensive performance and emergy sustainbaility index has no obvious effect for n2 energy indicator has the largest contribution to its comprehensive performance followed by economic performance and emergy sustainability index and carbon emission intensity have no obvious influence on its comprehensive performance for n3 energy indicator contributes the biggest to its comprehensive performance followed by economic performance however carbon emission intensity adversely influences its comprehensive performance and emergy sustainability index has no obvious effect on its comprehensive performance the study results show that those systems with part of best performance indicators could not achieve their whole best coordination degree which finally depends on total impact degree of encuy ceuy aesi and abcr on cdi for example although n1 performed the best in its carbon emission intensity its poor energy and economic performance results in the lowest coordination degree with introduction of cru in rice plantation relative to n1 encuy decreases by 53 09 for n2 and 33 15 for n3 while ceuy only rises by 2 42 for n2 and 4 85 for n3 table 2 aesi ascends by 0 55 for n2 and 0 27 for n3 table 4 and abcr climbs by 26 98 for n2 and 15 87 for n3 table 5 since positive contribution of the three indicators encuy aesi and abcr to cdi exceeds the adverse effect of ceuy on this index generally the coordination degree is improved after introduction of cru comprehensively speaking a single application of cru has the best performance based on energy consumption intensity carbon emission intensity environmental sustainability and economic benefit which highlights the significance of cru use in rice plantation however application of cru in rice plantation still incurs the following adverse impacts including 1 slightly weakening the resources structure due to increased share of purchased nonrenewable resources caused by cru manufacture 2 promoting carbon emissions mainly from ch4 emission in rice plantation and 3 enhancing economic cost of nitrogen fertilizer to some degree here cru applied are produced through the bottom side injection fluidized bed coating process and the flaw of this production process has relative low production efficiency due to the small production scale chen et al 2014 furthermore the coated process of cru has characteristics of complex process and potential environmental pollution caused by polymers azeem et al 2014 zhao et al 2021 and all these raise its economic cost and negative environmental impacts and then counteract its positive effectiveness to some degree as a result cru use is limited in improvement of the environmental sustainability level of the integrated system furthermore environmental benefit from cru use in crop production has not been widely reflected in related policies meanwhile farmers especially older farmers always hesitate even refuse to adopt cru due to its relatively higher price than urea and ammonium sulfide and ignorance of the advantages of cru on cu finally special cru varieties are also lacking which also affects nitrogen use efficiency in crop production because cru is sensitive to soil moisture soil texture and soil bioactivity azeem et al 2014 however related fertilizer enterprises have not fully considered these specific factors when manufacturing cru products all these issues affect widespread adoption of cru in crop production to different degrees therefore there is still a long way to achieve widespread adoption of cru in crop production as for relationship between among esi aesi and cdi although esi here corrected as aesi has widely used as an integrated indicator for the sustainability of systems under study generally this index concentrates on sustainability of systems under study in a long run in practice a system with higher sustainability in a long run could conflict with some short time goals such as economic benefit energy efficiency and others to address these issues some scholars have applied two or more evaluation methods to assess performance of systems from different angles including combination of emergy analysis and economic evaluation combination of emergy analysis and energy analysis etc however results from different evaluation methods could conflict with one another which can confuse final decision makers if these inconsistent results are not integrated to this end this study attempts to explore this issue through proposing an index cdi in fact this proposed index aims to search for the relative balance between long term sustainability and some short time gains economic benefit energy efficiency etc so as to provide a whole consistent conclusion for policy decision of course this index still needs further improvement in the future including specific integration ways related weight values of sub indicators 5 uncertainty and sensitivity analysis uncertainties in this study mainly arise from emergy evaluation derived from cited parameters uevs related energy convert coefficients etc those cited parameters could not well match related production systems in time and space therefore a sensitivity analysis is conducted through two scenarios to understand the impact of input parameter changes on the emergy indicators in this study the top two biggest contributors to total emergy in nfps and the top three largest contributors to total emergy in rps shown in sm 11 13 are selected as variables the scenarios are modelled based on these variables changing between 10 10 as demonstrated in sm 15 results of scenario 1 indicate that decrease of main emergy inputs will reduce the environmental load and enhance production efficiency and then raise environmental sustainability the results in scenario 2 show that increase of main inputs will result in the decreased production efficiency and increased environmental load and then weaken the environmental sustainability however changes of emergy based indicator values still fall into the scope of between 10 10 when all those variables alter from 10 to 10 therfore the results are still reliable and can also act as a reference for the following policy making 6 prospects to further promote coordinated development of the integrated sysgtem the following policy making suggestons are pproposed to deal with related adverse impacts from cru use in the future however these countermeasures still need to be deeply investigated in practice considering their diverse effects on comprehensive performance of rice production 1 improving resources structure of cru manufacture on one hand natural gas could be replaced by bioenergy sources in areas where conditions are available on the other hand adopting the renewable electricity into regional national electricity network can improve electricity mix through speeding development of electricity generation using wind solar and other renewable energy sources these measures could further improve environmental sustainability level of crop production through enhancing share of renewable resources and then further strengthening environmental friendliness of cru use 2 mitigating carbon emission intensity from rising ch4 emission in rice plantation due to cru use related measures include the reasonable choice of rice variety singh et al 1999 midseason aeration of paddy fields after short term drainage and improving organic matter management by promoting aerobic degradation through composting or incorporating crop straws into soil in autumn or winter li et al 2008 etc of course related operation conditions and parameters still need to be investigated in specific areas these measures could make crop production better adapt to china s carbon neutral strategy 3 promoting extension of agricultural machinery due to shortage of labor supply in rural areas it is necessary to further promote extension of agricultural machinery for reducing dependance of rice production on labor with rapid economic development and rising urbanization rate the shortage of full time farmers is becoming serious in rural areas which will further raise reliance of crop production on agricultural machinery in the future during the course of rice cultivation and harvest agricultural machinery such as tractors harvesters etc is mainly driven by diesel which has the enormous contribution to total energy use by the end of 2019 the number of tractors had exceeded 22 24 million in china which consumed diesel of 14 68 million tons in agriculture national bureau of statistics 2020 moreover due to the impact of terrain and the transportation distance power consumption of agricultural machinery will become bigger in hilly areas just like this study area and this also further increases diesel consumption to reduce environmental emissions from diesel use the following measures can be considered firstly diesel structure should be improved through using biodiesel asokan et al 2018 uyumaz 2018 secondly traditional tractors could be updated to electric or electrified tractors gao and xue 2020 7 conclusions the study put forward a set of methods and related indicators to evaluate coordinated development of the combined system composed of n fertilizer production and rice plantation from angles of energy consumption carbon emission environmental performance and economic benefit and then the presented approach was applied to a study case in southwest china this study results demonstrate that 1 n2 has the highest energy efficiency followed by n3 and n1 orderly 2 n3 possess the largest carbon emission intensity followed by n2 and n1 in sequence 3 n2 has the highest environmental sustainability followed by n3 and n1 4 n2 has the best economic performance followed by n3 and n1 and 5 n2 achieves the best coordinated development level followed by n3 and n1 generally n2 is the best scheme in the three ones and thus could be considered in this region meanwhile this study also reveals 1 the promotion of cru use to carbon emissions in the whole system which should be emphasized in the future 2 research results based on a larger analysis boundary could provide more complete policy making information than those derived from a smaller one which is necessary for sustainable development of crop production this study puts forward a set of novel methods and indicators to compare comprehensive performance of diverse fertilization schemes composed of n fertilizer production and rice plantation which can also act as one of decision making tools for evaluating other crop production systems credit authorship contribution statement yanfeng lyu raw data collection methodology writing original draft preparation

24226,with changing climate the boreal forest could potentially migrate north and become threatened by droughts in the south however whether larches the dominant tree species in eastern siberia can adapt to novel situations is largely unknown but is crucial for predicting future population dynamics exploring variable traits and trait adaptation through inheritance in an individual based model can improve our understanding and help future projections we updated the individual based spatially explicit vegetation model lavesi larix vegetation simulator used for forest predictions in eastern siberia with trait value variation and incorporated inheritance of parental values to their offspring forcing the model with both past and future climate projections we simulated two areas the expanding northern treeline and a southerly area experiencing drought while the specific trait of seed weight regulates migration the abstract drought resistance protects stands we show that trait variation with inheritance leads to an increase in migration rate 3 area increase until 2100 the drought resistance simulations show that under increasing stress including adaptive traits leads to larger surviving populations 17 of threatened under rcp 4 5 representative concentration pathway we show that with the increase expected under the rcp 8 5 scenario vast areas 80 of the extrapolated area of larch forest are threatened and could disappear due to drought as adaptation plays only a minor role under strong warming we conclude that variable traits facilitate the availability of variants under environmental changes inheritance allows populations to adapt to environments and promote successful traits which leads to populations that can spread faster and be more resilient provided the changes are not too drastic in both time and magnitude we show that trait variation and inheritance contribute to more accurate models that can improve our understanding of responses of boreal forests to global change keywords adaptive trait conifer individual based simulation larix simulation spatially explicit trait variation vegetation model data availability the code and simulation data will be made available the weather data used is available from the cited sources 1 introduction with the expected climate warming the boreal forest of eastern siberia will potentially undergo changes in the near future bonan 2008 the warming of the climate may lead to a shift in range towards the north mamet et al 2019 and an overall reduction in area due to drought diebacks in the south villén peréz et al 2020 as one of the largest terrestrial ecosystems changes in or especially a collapse of the boreal forest could have far reaching effects both with regard to the release of stored carbon schaphoff et al 2016 and in the change in albedo bonan 2008 to predict future boreal forest response simulations should be as accurate as possible aubin et al 2016 while acknowledging that models need to make simplifications for example assuming uniform trees one area that could be improved is trait variability as this can have large impacts on the outcome of predictions verheijen et al 2015 to allow for variation over time and to assign more realistic trait values adaptation of traits would further improve the models this could serve to limit the overestimation of trait variation and allow for plasticity between generations northern leading edge range expansion one of the results of a warming climate is the expansion of tree species into areas previously too cold for survival mamet et al 2019 as warmer climate leads to better growth zhang et al 2019 the northern forest line has historically always shifted with changes in climate and is expected to continue to do so mcdonald et al 2008 while estimates of the potential range of species could be done using climate constraints this would neglect other factors since trees are immobile and seed dispersal is a limiting factor in range expansions of forest populations a fast advancing potential range can lead to a time lag effect where the actual treeline is behind its potential position lloyd 2005 due to this a simple model that lacks spatial dispersion cannot predict future distributions hence vegetation modelling that can address these questions is needed a further factor is the variation in seed weight e g wieczorek et al 2017 barchenkov 2011 as different seeds can be transported different distances by the wind due to their weight with heavier seeds having a higher descent speed debain et al 2003 greene and johnson 1993 augspurger and franson 1987 southern rear edge drought dieback projected increases of droughts are assumed to reduce the forested area and give way to steppe vegetation mamet et al 2019 while the increase of temperature is expected to coincide with an increase in precipitation current predictions indicate that this will be of a smaller magnitude and thus still result in a more arid climate harris et al 2020 these data also show that the effect is not limited to the southern edge of the distribution area but also applies to other areas such as central yakutia generally trees are locally able to adapt to drought conditions at the cost of decreased growth mcdowell et al 2008 read and stokes 2006 as found for populations of l gmelinii kagawa et al 2006 and other species of larch in siberia zhirnova et al 2020 however it is not known how well populations would be able to adapt to predicted environmental changes and where populations could survive this has a strong impact on carbon storage and overall global warming therefore it is important to be able to include adaptation into models both the expansion north chapin and starfield 1997 kruse et al 2016 2022 and the drought in the south brazhnik and shugart 2015 have been studied previously using models to predict future development one of these models is the individual based spatially explicit model lavesi larix vegetation simulator that was development for simulating the migration north of larix gmelinii kruse et al 2016 and has since been expanded to include further boreal forest species among other kruse et al 2022 for the north it is estimated that the larches will replace the tundra kruse and herzschuh 2022 but that the time lag created by the migration of the trees could lead to the formation of grassland chapin and starfield 1997 the droughts are expected to reduce the forested area in the south brazhnik and shugart 2015 the models covering this region are rather few though and do not include adaptation of traits trait variation is a parameter different types of vegetation modellers are striving to include dynamic global vegetation models dgvms are designed and tuned for global simulations and are historically mainly concerned with plant functional types maréchaux et al 2021 due to limitation in the computational resources they often do not include dispersal like scheiter and higgins 2009 there are models like adgvm2 scheiter et al 2013 that include trait variation of plant functional types and allow for adaptation over time this process is however limited to a community level for the trait pool and thus does not include scale seed distribution even in models using individual trees with trait variation there are still restrictions due to their abstract implementation of vegetation sakeschewski et al 2015 scheiter and higgins 2009 another option is to work with smaller scaled individual based models ibms that simulate all individual trees and all life history stages in a given area but are therefore limited in the size of the area they can simulate such models allow for the inclusion of other small scale interactions such as explicit dispersal for both seeds and pollination these can then be used to simulate adaptation of traits across a landscape in response to their environment one model that does include traits variation but not adaptation is grassmind which as the name implies is focused on grasses and as such at a fine scale schmid et al 2021 as pointed out by romero mujali et al 2019 there are still only a few models that include adaptation and most of these do not simulate actual species but rather abstract model species here we adapt the model lavesi to evaluate the impact of trait variation and inheritance on key variables of larch forests of eastern eurasia survival in the south by incorporating changes in drought resistance and migration in the north by considering differences in seed weights we aim to understand the dynamics of boreal larch forest in a warming eastern eurasia and formulated the following specific research questions will the migration and survival of larches be positively affected by our implementation of trait variation and adaptation in the model what is the effect of adaptive traits on larch forest distribution in siberia under a warming climate 2 methods 2 1 general model description we selected for our study the individual based spatially explicit model lavesi that was developed to simulate population dynamics of widespread larix gmelinii in north eastern siberia kruse et al 2016 and developed for treeline migration with a parametrisation for the taymyr region kruse et al 2016 wieczorek et al 2017 it simulates the life cycle of all trees in a given area for each year starting from the seed stage hence the model already includes the study species and was recently further equipped with new functions which lay the groundwork for this study besides seed dispersal wind dependent and spatially explicit pollination was introduced kruse et al 2018 in short the model simulates every year by going through the following sub routines established in previous publications of the model kruse et al 2016 kruse et al 2018 initialisation the environmental information elevation slope terrain water index of the simulated area is read in and filled in the model s structures the weather provided in monthly temperature and precipitation values is read for a given number of years each simulation run starts with an empty area and seeds are introduced to the area during a spin up period at the start of the model environment is updated as density map is calculated for the area in which the density influence is recorded for the trees the competition between trees is calculated based on the basal diameter in a given area of the density map formula 1 the active layer depth is estimated based on the number of days exceeding 0 c 1 d e n s i t y i n f l u e n

one individual for the year is then derived from this by including the density index of the tree based on the diameter the tree height is estimated formula 3 2 g r o w t h m a x d i a m e t e r p r e

randomly determined whether the tree dies and is removed from the simulation the calculation is based on long term weather values the calculated drought strength competition of surrounding trees the age and size of the tree and a base mortality rate for each of these a mortality value is calculated these are then summed up and compared to a randomly generated number if the sum of death probabilities is larger the tree dies the death of seeds is determined at this step as well although the mortality rate for these is fixed ageing the last step is an increase in the age of both the seeds and the trees since every year is simulated the age is advanced by once each cycle the seeds are removed once they have reached a certain 3 years age limit 2 2 new model development the new features of the model are variation and inheritance of traits in a previous version of the model lavesi kruse et al 2016 almost all traits were the same for every individual only maturation height being randomly assigned of the same species which is referred to as the uniform type throughout this article in this work we created variation and adaptation for the seed weight and the drought resistance both use the same following principles in their trait value determination trait variation gives every newly produced seed a random value from a uniform distribution with upper and lower limits therefore every seed that is either introduced or created by a tree during the simulation has the same chance of having any trait value from the distribution this allows for variability in the traits present in the model permitting plastic responses but no adaptation while not being computationally much more intensive the inheritance adaptive traits system fig 1 on the other hand calculates a new seed value for every new seed production that is a function of the trait value of the mother tree and the pollen source geber and griffen 2003 to calculate the likely pollen source it was necessary to create a level of abstraction as calling every tree for every seed production proved too computationally intensive kruse et al 2018 for this reason a pollen grid was introduced with grid cells of in this case 100 m² the trait information of the pollen producing trees is averaged per cell and these mean grid cell values used as the trait values for that pollen source the new seed s trait value is calculated by either using a mixture distribution created by combining the two parental normal distributions or by a normal distribution around a weighted average of the pollen source and the seed producing tree for the normal distributions the box muller transform is used box and muller 1958 the mixed distribution is achieved by creating normal distributions for both parents and randomly selecting one or the other for the northern tree expansion both methods are used and two different weights are applied to the second method with the weight applied being equal in one case and 75 for the seed producing tree in the other case to assess the different options since all three methods produce comparative results not shown only the mixed distribution is used for the drought experiment 3 experiment for northward treeline migration 3 1 model development for the migration the model is parametrised for the taymyr region in siberia and could be used directly for the northward migration simulations kruse et al 2016 kruse et al 2019 taymyr is at the northern edge of the distribution area of l gmelinii where the species is expanding farther north as the climate warms mcdonald et al 2008 for the northward migration the trait of interest is seed weight not in units of grams but rather as relative weight to each other this trait influences three factors dispersal distance the number of seeds a tree produces and the germination rate with the first two being negatively correlated to weight and the last one positively the actual weight of a seed is not determined by the trait information the seeds carry but rather by the tree producing the seeds when seeds are introduced at the start of the simulation or when a random variation is assigned a seed is randomly given a normally distributed selected weight value with the average being one and the upper and lower boundaries being 5 3 and 1 3 these trait value limits for seed weight also hold true for seeds created using adaptation the three impacts in the model of the seed weight are all based on the relative seed weight the number of seeds produced by a tree is divided by the squared weight determined by the trees seed weight value of those seeds seed number seed weight2 the germination of seeds is multiplied by 0 12 and the seed weight from which 1 is subtracted this subtraction leads to a decrease with seeds below 1 and an increase when seeds with a weight above 1 are used when the seed weight is exactly average there is neither a positive nor negative effect germination 0 12 seed weight 1 the extent of the effect was based on a study by gorian et al 2007 the distance is divided by the square root or the seed weight d i s t a n c e s e e d w e i g h t 3 2 simulations for the migration simulation runs are performed using a transect representing a slice of the northern forest line with a size of 10 km x 0 2 km and seeds being reintroduced when leaving to the eastern or western side to simulate the continuation of the forest in either direction the simulations are forced for 2000 years using randomised weather taken from the period 1901 2018 from cru ts4 0 harris et al 2020 for the location 98 e 70 66 n with the temperature for the site being lowered by 0 5 c this location is close to the treeline and model test runs indicated that it has a climate that is barely above the required minimum for tree growth the decrease in temperature was introduced to bring the temperature to the very edge if the temperature was decreased further no growth occurred in the first 50 years 2000 seeds per year were introduced from the south with a negative exponential dispersal function and given trait values according to one of the three scenarios uniform variation and inheritance for model spin up the population was restricted during the first 500 years to the southern 1 km x 0 2 km to allow a population to establish afterwards the entire area becomes uniformly inhabitable each of the simulation scenarios was repeated 30 times to counteract variation to compare migration rates under the scenarios a quasi binomial model was established using the percentage of the area south of the forest line along the 10 km long transect over time the forest line is defined as the northernmost position at which forest density does not fall below a threshold of one tree per hectare where a tree has to be 1 3 m tall the statistical analysis was performed using the statistical tool r r core team 2020 the mapping of the effect of seed weight adaptation on the broader scale was conducted using the results of a large scale simulation based on a uniform trait model by kruse and herzschuh 2022 as our baseline in detail the simulated treeline position through time over 2000 3000 ce common era stemming from the transect study covering the region between the current treeline and the arctic ocean was modified using the binomial curves obtained in this study for the adaptation the two variants are then shown on a map of the area this approach was chosen because simulation of a transect of the required length with the higher temperatures was unmanageable in the currently unoptimised version as the required computational power was too large to cope with the increase of trees 4 experiment for southern tree die back 4 1 model development for the drought for simulations of the southern region prone to increasing drought in a warming climate the area of central yakutia was chosen as the model was parameterised for northern distribution areas of the study species l gmelinii the model had to be newly parameterised to be applicable in the south we incorporated an abstracted drought resistance trait with a value from 0 to 100 with 100 representing drought immunity this trait is negatively correlated with the growth rate of trees as they need to invest in this adaptation in the model the trait represents an unspecific resistivity to drought fire which has in reality multiple sources that larch can adapt to drought was shown in studies for larix decidua plesa et al 2019 george et al 2019 new parameterisation was needed after introducing the drought resistance trait as the drought calculation present no longer gave reasonable results in the test described below in lavesi drought is calculated by using the monthly temperature and precipitation data and calculating a general drought mortality for each year a decreasing function with a limit of zero based on tree height is then used to calculate drought mortality of individual trees for a given year this drought mortality is then included in the calculations determining if a tree dies that year for any reason thus larger numbers lead to more tree death kruse et al 2016 to parameterise the model to the southern species distribution we created four transects appendix fig 6 across the species line 4 plots above and below the species line per transect using both species distribution maps mamet et al 2019 and satellite images source google earth to determine where the species can be found this enables us to find a parameterisation for the drought components by using a pattern orientated modelling approach gallagher et al 2021 these plots are simulated and forced with cru ts weather data of random years 1901 2018 on an area of 200 m x 200 m and inheritance data resulting in either a population or not appedix fig 7 the simulations that predict presence absence are achieved by altering the drought in two separate places to determine the values a range of values was tested and the best fit calculated the drought strength present in an area is first calculated based on temperature and precipitation if the evaporation rate exceeds input by precipitation the drought strength is calculated based on the active air temperature once a certain value is reached this overall drought strength is for this version after parametrisation appendix fig 8 increased by applying the formula drought 0 3863 ² the second change is in the formula estimating the individual drought strength applied to a tree in the previous version of the model the drought strength decreases as the tree grows taller via multiplication with the formula 1 0 h e i g h t o f t r e e in this version a value of 0 5 is added after this step to increase the amount of drought stress applied to the trees and ensure even very tall trees are still meaningfully affected whereas previously large trees became effectively immune to drought after this calculation the drought resistance factor is applied to get the final drought mortality 4 2 simulations for the drought when running simulations for a region first the current drought resistance of the population is determined from simulations forced using randomised trace he 2011 data from 1 to 1900 ce for a given location for a period of 10 000 years and allowing the trees to adapt to the conditions this assumes that the trees would be adapted to the conditions that were present before the 20th century over time the yearly average trait value for drought resistance of new trees oscillates around a value that is assumed to be the optimal trait value for the location the average is calculated from the values from simulation years 4000 10 000 this optimum is then used as the value for uniform tests and as the centre point for the distribution used by both variation and for initial seeds the inheritance simulations the simulations are performed using a transect representing a slice of an area expected to be affected by droughts in the future based on the calculated drought strengths for the area to simulate a wide range of conditions the transect is split into individual simulations as the length of the simulated transect is too limited to cover the desired range of drought conditions to cover an even wider range of conditions more plots randomly distributed in the surrounding area of the transect are included fig 2 for each grid cell of weather data a simulation is performed on an area of 400 m x 400 m for the first 1000 years simulations are forced with random years selected from weather data from cru ts covering 1901 2018 the first 1000 years are both to simulate the current conditions of the populations and as the spin up phase to allow the forests to establish from seeds introduced over the entire area the subsequent 2000 years use the same data but with the temperature and precipitation raised to the level predicted by the cmip5 giorgetta et al 2012 data using the rcp 4 5 scenario for 2260 2300 ce as it covers both strong and weak drought over the area the scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 only showed the corresponding extreme results each of the simulation scenarios for every plot was repeated ten times to counteract variation for comparison of the drought die back rates revealed by the simulation setup a quasi binomial model was established using the percentage of the average number trees that are over 1 3 m tall in the last 200 years of the simulation and comparing it to the average of the last 200 years of the spin up phase that is under the current climate conditions the drought strength is the average value calculated by the model for the simulation years these models are created for all three scenarios the spatial upscaling of the simulation results was performed by calculating the drought value for every cell with a size of 0 5 x 0 5 using the same formula as in lavesi and survival curves from which the expected population change is calculated when a population size falls below 5 the population is considered extinct the comparative results are shown limited to the current area of boreal forest for the region fig 2 olson et al 2001 5 results 5 1 impact of trait value variation and inheritance on larch forest dynamics in the focus regions the three trait scenarios uniform random variation and inherited traits lead to a difference in the percentage area the forest line reaches which increases over time fig 3 a value of 0 5 indicates that the tree line has reached up to half the length of the transect initially the area covered by forest is the same in all scenarios and continues to slowly increase after spin up of 500 years but they diverge around simulation year 900 in the later stage the migration rate increases further and both the randomly variable traits and inheritable adaptive traits scenarios increase faster than the uniform traits scenario adaptive traits have the fastest migration rates and farthest forest cover extent of the simulation transect the average seed weight decreases under the adaptation variant over time survival under different drought strengths based on different simulation plots using the rcp 4 5 scenario weather data decreases with increasing drought fig 4 earlier offset of drought affecting the population sizes can be seen at lower drought strength in the uniform and randomly variable drought resistance scenarios while populations with adaptive trait values are more resilient in those adaptive populations the average drought resistance increases after the drought increase once the drought reaches a value of 1 2 all populations are expected to have died out with some already having died at a value of 1 5 2 siberian wide impact of adaptation on future larch forests the results extrapolated from the two results above onto the larger area show that the harsher the rcp scenario used for predictions is the faster the migration is and the stronger the drought die out fig 5 table 1 predictions further into the future generally lead to larger changes but to smaller effects from adaptation through migrations as the species is expected to have reached the coastline in most places the exception to this is rcp 2 6 in which there is a reduction of drought severity and the adaptive migration has the largest impact the results obtained using the climate data from the rcp 4 5 scenario and the time frame of 2260 2300 shows an interestingly varied response there are many areas that are estimated to have surviving populations although the estimations for many of the locations lead to lower population sizes when using the uniform traits compared to the adaptation traits up to 11 of the area is estimated to have populations go extinct when using only uniform traits for simulations but 17 of this area 2 of the total population area is expected to survive when factoring adaptation into the extrapolation for migration having adaptive traits is expected to extend the range in areas where the treeline has not yet reached the ocean by an area of 35 778 km² table 1 6 discussion 6 1 impacts of trait value variation and inheritance on larch forest dynamics our results suggest that the migration rate of forests into northern tundra areas is faster for scenarios with seed weight variation this effect is even stronger in the adaptation scenario since the average trait value of the populations can change due to heritability of the seed characteristics as was found by barchenkov 2011 the offspring of a tree with light seed has a greater chance of migrating farther north and also has a greater chance of producing light seeds themselves this leads first to a decrease in seed weight as those seeds are spread farther and cover larger areas and in consequence a faster migration can be observed as the overall lighter seeds are spreading farther this continues until the simulation area is covered thus inheritance combines the average seed weight variation and local fine scale adaptation and it can ultimately influence the simulated migration rate the observed migration rate mcdonald et al 2008 kharuk et al 2018 already includes such variation warmer temperatures increase the migration rate and lead to the populations reaching the coastline faster this is due to warmer climate leading to faster tree growth and thus allowing the trees to reach their seed producing stage earlier and to be more prolific kruse et al 2019 kruse and herzschuh 2022 therefore an increase in temperature not only leads to a larger inhabitable area but also to faster migration into an area that is already habitable but not yet colonised mcdonald et al 2008 the simulations can be influenced by long distance dispersal events fayard et al 2009 which could lead to some heavier seeds randomly being transported a long way therefore adaptation can sometimes lead to slower expansion if a population initially has heavier seeds although the general trend is towards faster migrations as long distance dispersal events are more likely with lighter seeds in our model previous studies have estimated that the time lag caused by the slow migration of trees could lead to grassland forming in the warming northern areas chapin and starfield 1997 our study shows that this might not happen because of the faster migration of the trees when considering variation and adaptation in areas that experience a strong drought the population size is reduced due to increased tree mortality in the inherited adaptation and random variation scenarios there is a range of different drought adaptations leading to the possibility of pre adapted trees being present initially in both scenarios some trees survive however in the adaptation scenario the offspring are more likely to be drought adapted as well whereas the offspring in the variation scenario have the same chance of being adapted as their parents and with increased change in drought strength the likelihood of this being a useful adaptation becomes smaller therefore the number of viable offspring is much smaller under the variation scenario and the population cannot recover their numbers easily and is more likely to die out due to random events the model behaves reasonably with respect to droughts and the simulation results match observations that show smaller populations of siberian larches are more affected by drought khansoritoreh et al 2017 populations that are affected by disturbances have fewer individuals and denser tree stands lead to shallower permafrost thaw kropp et al 2019 thus impacting the landscape and carbon stored furthermore droughts weaken pine populations which are exacerbated by secondary effects such as insects or fungi leading to a higher mortality kharuk et al 2013 with warmer temperature also making natural disturbances more likely in boreal forests seidl et al 2020 therefore simulations that result in a local population barely surviving could be interpreted as a threat of extinction which is likely to cause reduced forest survival and probably prevent recolonisation under such conditions this study finds a larger increase in temperature is needed to lead to drought related die out compared to a previous study brazhnik and shugart 2015 this could be due to the different study areas and their inclusion of terrain but might also stem from our assumption that the trees are adapted to the conditions from before the 20th century the strong difference in forest dieback between the three scenarios underlines the importance of an accurate prediction of the climate currently there is some evidence for rcp 8 5 to be the closest schwalm et al 2020 which would mean that greater areas of the current larch population could be threatened the inclusion of variation and adaptation of key traits in an individual based model affects modelled population dynamics as in nature variation of traits in our model allows a local population to include a range of drought resistances and survive smaller droughts ovenden et al 2021 and inheritance allows it to adapt to the prevailing conditions savolainen et al 2007 thus the model only needs to have a small range of variation around the optimum along with the possibility for a population to be optimised for past conditions in a fast changing environment svenning and sandel 2013 when including traits in a model using adaptation it is vital to ensure the traits represented in the model are inheritable as some traits can be almost exclusively influenced by the environment geber and griffen 2003 and the degree of this phenotypic plasticity can be limited by other factors valladares et al 2007 differences in both seed weight wieczorek et al 2017 barchenkov 2011 and drought resistance kagawa et al 2006 have been found between populations of larix gmelinii in general larix gmelinii does have genetic variation between and within populations larionova et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 6 2 siberian wide impact of adaptation on future larch forests we could show that the impact of warming is meliorated with the adaptation of key traits while more inhabitable areas in the north might open up for tree growth the migration rate might not be able to keep up with the changing possible range kruse et al 2016 the response in the south however will be faster once the trees start dying from drought but could be delayed with a weaker decline if temperature rises only gradually and trees are able to adapt at some point a breakpoint will be reached and the population disappears where this breakpoint lies depends on the rate of adaptation in the tree populations simulations ignoring adaptation are going to place the threshold at a lower level than is realistic as populations cannot migrate further north indefinitely as the coastline prevents expansion north mamet et al 2019 drought triggered die out could affect large parts of the population if temperatures increase to the level of rcp 8 5 as predicted by schwalm et al 2020 hence migration north cannot offset the dieback south indefinitely our simulations show the potential future development larix gmelinii while this larch species and other similar larch species are dominant over large areas especially at the northern margin abaimov et al 1998 in the west and south mixed forests with evergreen taxa prevail this means that the predictions can only be taken as predictions for the survival of larch species in northern areas and therefore the overall forest cover might react differently while it is known that other species of the biome are experiencing droughts as well kharuk et al 2017 both shuman et al 2011 and tchebakova et al 2016 predict a change in forest type for their study region that depends upon the climate scenario used mixed forests could also increase the likelihood of larches dying out as the current simulations only consider pure larch forests and as discussed previously smaller populations that are more isolated are more likely to die out and the effect of future climate change might be more adverse on larches in mixed forest mixed forest can also directly increase the drought that larch experiences because some species cause the soils to dry out more bonan 2008 this could lead to stronger effects on larches in mixed forest than predicted our simulation study shows that the majority of tree cover change depends largely on the actual change in climate the stronger the climate changes the more drastic the effects can be expected although initial increases in temperature can result in better tree growth zhang et al 2019 further increases lead to drought zhirnova et al 2020 in addition topography can play a role in migration and larch abundance as passing a mountain range is more challenging than crossing flat terrain macias fauria and johnson 2013 sato and kobayashi 2017 our simulations and the resulting extrapolations do not take topography into account explicitly yet the underlying climate data reflect the broader changes 6 3 modelling trait adaptation to climate change random variation and inheritable adaptation of traits allows for a range of trait values to be present within the simulated population when change occurs be it to allow for new growth or an adverse effect on plant health this does come with two related issues the first being lower population numbers as only a few trees are well suited to any one circumstance and the second being that all trait variations are always available this can lead to populations surviving even if the changes are very drastic and happen quickly both these shortcomings are addressed by the introduction of inheritable adaptive traits hence our model allows for small scale local adaptation and for variation in traits to coexist within the same area as long as the advantages are not too unequal while our study already discusses changes to a large ecosystem that could impact global systems schaphoff et al 2016 bonan 2008 the implemented functions combined with dispersal and pollination kruse et al 2018 could be applied to other models and contribute to research of further global problems for this research we limited the scope to one adaptable trait per region seed weight in the north and drought tolerance in the south to reduce variation between the simulations and thus allow for a clearer differentiation of the effects while it is possible to include more larch species and with recent developments many boreal tree species kruse et al 2022 this study uses the species the model as was originally parameterised kruse et al 2016 since l gmelinii is the dominant species over vast areas of eastern siberia abaimov et al 1998 7 conclusions the inclusion of random variation and inheritable adaptive traits has the potential to change the results of predictions to an extent that warrants future adoption of the process in studies allowing more dynamic responses of trees to be modelled simulations over long timescales or of taxa with widely varying traits are greatly enhanced by these new inclusions because species are able to adapt to changed conditions but also appear maladapted if changes are happening too fast when only variation is used maladaptation cannot be simulated especially at the regional scale the limiting factor for inclusion is the increased amount of computational resources required to perform the additional calculations to determine the pollen source and the new trait values thus small scale simulations with either few generations or a small area may not gain sufficient benefit to warrant the new inclusion of adaptation from our results we could infer that while larch forests are able to spread farther north with increasing temperature this spread is ultimately limited and cannot under the rcp 8 5 scenario offset the potential loss of large forest areas due to drought the rate at which this predicted change happens is not only affected by climate but also by the choice of trait parameterisation in the simulations with the inheritance of traits new possibilities for simulations arise changes over long time scales or heterogeneous landscapes can be simulated with the trees adapting to local or temporal conditions these simulations can later be expanded by introducing trees from other populations or more drought adapted species

24226,with changing climate the boreal forest could potentially migrate north and become threatened by droughts in the south however whether larches the dominant tree species in eastern siberia can adapt to novel situations is largely unknown but is crucial for predicting future population dynamics exploring variable traits and trait adaptation through inheritance in an individual based model can improve our understanding and help future projections we updated the individual based spatially explicit vegetation model lavesi larix vegetation simulator used for forest predictions in eastern siberia with trait value variation and incorporated inheritance of parental values to their offspring forcing the model with both past and future climate projections we simulated two areas the expanding northern treeline and a southerly area experiencing drought while the specific trait of seed weight regulates migration the abstract drought resistance protects stands we show that trait variation with inheritance leads to an increase in migration rate 3 area increase until 2100 the drought resistance simulations show that under increasing stress including adaptive traits leads to larger surviving populations 17 of threatened under rcp 4 5 representative concentration pathway we show that with the increase expected under the rcp 8 5 scenario vast areas 80 of the extrapolated area of larch forest are threatened and could disappear due to drought as adaptation plays only a minor role under strong warming we conclude that variable traits facilitate the availability of variants under environmental changes inheritance allows populations to adapt to environments and promote successful traits which leads to populations that can spread faster and be more resilient provided the changes are not too drastic in both time and magnitude we show that trait variation and inheritance contribute to more accurate models that can improve our understanding of responses of boreal forests to global change keywords adaptive trait conifer individual based simulation larix simulation spatially explicit trait variation vegetation model data availability the code and simulation data will be made available the weather data used is available from the cited sources 1 introduction with the expected climate warming the boreal forest of eastern siberia will potentially undergo changes in the near future bonan 2008 the warming of the climate may lead to a shift in range towards the north mamet et al 2019 and an overall reduction in area due to drought diebacks in the south villén peréz et al 2020 as one of the largest terrestrial ecosystems changes in or especially a collapse of the boreal forest could have far reaching effects both with regard to the release of stored carbon schaphoff et al 2016 and in the change in albedo bonan 2008 to predict future boreal forest response simulations should be as accurate as possible aubin et al 2016 while acknowledging that models need to make simplifications for example assuming uniform trees one area that could be improved is trait variability as this can have large impacts on the outcome of predictions verheijen et al 2015 to allow for variation over time and to assign more realistic trait values adaptation of traits would further improve the models this could serve to limit the overestimation of trait variation and allow for plasticity between generations northern leading edge range expansion one of the results of a warming climate is the expansion of tree species into areas previously too cold for survival mamet et al 2019 as warmer climate leads to better growth zhang et al 2019 the northern forest line has historically always shifted with changes in climate and is expected to continue to do so mcdonald et al 2008 while estimates of the potential range of species could be done using climate constraints this would neglect other factors since trees are immobile and seed dispersal is a limiting factor in range expansions of forest populations a fast advancing potential range can lead to a time lag effect where the actual treeline is behind its potential position lloyd 2005 due to this a simple model that lacks spatial dispersion cannot predict future distributions hence vegetation modelling that can address these questions is needed a further factor is the variation in seed weight e g wieczorek et al 2017 barchenkov 2011 as different seeds can be transported different distances by the wind due to their weight with heavier seeds having a higher descent speed debain et al 2003 greene and johnson 1993 augspurger and franson 1987 southern rear edge drought dieback projected increases of droughts are assumed to reduce the forested area and give way to steppe vegetation mamet et al 2019 while the increase of temperature is expected to coincide with an increase in precipitation current predictions indicate that this will be of a smaller magnitude and thus still result in a more arid climate harris et al 2020 these data also show that the effect is not limited to the southern edge of the distribution area but also applies to other areas such as central yakutia generally trees are locally able to adapt to drought conditions at the cost of decreased growth mcdowell et al 2008 read and stokes 2006 as found for populations of l gmelinii kagawa et al 2006 and other species of larch in siberia zhirnova et al 2020 however it is not known how well populations would be able to adapt to predicted environmental changes and where populations could survive this has a strong impact on carbon storage and overall global warming therefore it is important to be able to include adaptation into models both the expansion north chapin and starfield 1997 kruse et al 2016 2022 and the drought in the south brazhnik and shugart 2015 have been studied previously using models to predict future development one of these models is the individual based spatially explicit model lavesi larix vegetation simulator that was development for simulating the migration north of larix gmelinii kruse et al 2016 and has since been expanded to include further boreal forest species among other kruse et al 2022 for the north it is estimated that the larches will replace the tundra kruse and herzschuh 2022 but that the time lag created by the migration of the trees could lead to the formation of grassland chapin and starfield 1997 the droughts are expected to reduce the forested area in the south brazhnik and shugart 2015 the models covering this region are rather few though and do not include adaptation of traits trait variation is a parameter different types of vegetation modellers are striving to include dynamic global vegetation models dgvms are designed and tuned for global simulations and are historically mainly concerned with plant functional types maréchaux et al 2021 due to limitation in the computational resources they often do not include dispersal like scheiter and higgins 2009 there are models like adgvm2 scheiter et al 2013 that include trait variation of plant functional types and allow for adaptation over time this process is however limited to a community level for the trait pool and thus does not include scale seed distribution even in models using individual trees with trait variation there are still restrictions due to their abstract implementation of vegetation sakeschewski et al 2015 scheiter and higgins 2009 another option is to work with smaller scaled individual based models ibms that simulate all individual trees and all life history stages in a given area but are therefore limited in the size of the area they can simulate such models allow for the inclusion of other small scale interactions such as explicit dispersal for both seeds and pollination these can then be used to simulate adaptation of traits across a landscape in response to their environment one model that does include traits variation but not adaptation is grassmind which as the name implies is focused on grasses and as such at a fine scale schmid et al 2021 as pointed out by romero mujali et al 2019 there are still only a few models that include adaptation and most of these do not simulate actual species but rather abstract model species here we adapt the model lavesi to evaluate the impact of trait variation and inheritance on key variables of larch forests of eastern eurasia survival in the south by incorporating changes in drought resistance and migration in the north by considering differences in seed weights we aim to understand the dynamics of boreal larch forest in a warming eastern eurasia and formulated the following specific research questions will the migration and survival of larches be positively affected by our implementation of trait variation and adaptation in the model what is the effect of adaptive traits on larch forest distribution in siberia under a warming climate 2 methods 2 1 general model description we selected for our study the individual based spatially explicit model lavesi that was developed to simulate population dynamics of widespread larix gmelinii in north eastern siberia kruse et al 2016 and developed for treeline migration with a parametrisation for the taymyr region kruse et al 2016 wieczorek et al 2017 it simulates the life cycle of all trees in a given area for each year starting from the seed stage hence the model already includes the study species and was recently further equipped with new functions which lay the groundwork for this study besides seed dispersal wind dependent and spatially explicit pollination was introduced kruse et al 2018 in short the model simulates every year by going through the following sub routines established in previous publications of the model kruse et al 2016 kruse et al 2018 initialisation the environmental information elevation slope terrain water index of the simulated area is read in and filled in the model s structures the weather provided in monthly temperature and precipitation values is read for a given number of years each simulation run starts with an empty area and seeds are introduced to the area during a spin up period at the start of the model environment is updated as density map is calculated for the area in which the density influence is recorded for the trees the competition between trees is calculated based on the basal diameter in a given area of the density map formula 1 the active layer depth is estimated based on the number of days exceeding 0 c 1 d e n s i t y i n f l u e n

randomly determined whether the tree dies and is removed from the simulation the calculation is based on long term weather values the calculated drought strength competition of surrounding trees the age and size of the tree and a base mortality rate for each of these a mortality value is calculated these are then summed up and compared to a randomly generated number if the sum of death probabilities is larger the tree dies the death of seeds is determined at this step as well although the mortality rate for these is fixed ageing the last step is an increase in the age of both the seeds and the trees since every year is simulated the age is advanced by once each cycle the seeds are removed once they have reached a certain 3 years age limit 2 2 new model development the new features of the model are variation and inheritance of traits in a previous version of the model lavesi kruse et al 2016 almost all traits were the same for every individual only maturation height being randomly assigned of the same species which is referred to as the uniform type throughout this article in this work we created variation and adaptation for the seed weight and the drought resistance both use the same following principles in their trait value determination trait variation gives every newly produced seed a random value from a uniform distribution with upper and lower limits therefore every seed that is either introduced or created by a tree during the simulation has the same chance of having any trait value from the distribution this allows for variability in the traits present in the model permitting plastic responses but no adaptation while not being computationally much more intensive the inheritance adaptive traits system fig 1 on the other hand calculates a new seed value for every new seed production that is a function of the trait value of the mother tree and the pollen source geber and griffen 2003 to calculate the likely pollen source it was necessary to create a level of abstraction as calling every tree for every seed production proved too computationally intensive kruse et al 2018 for this reason a pollen grid was introduced with grid cells of in this case 100 m² the trait information of the pollen producing trees is averaged per cell and these mean grid cell values used as the trait values for that pollen source the new seed s trait value is calculated by either using a mixture distribution created by combining the two parental normal distributions or by a normal distribution around a weighted average of the pollen source and the seed producing tree for the normal distributions the box muller transform is used box and muller 1958 the mixed distribution is achieved by creating normal distributions for both parents and randomly selecting one or the other for the northern tree expansion both methods are used and two different weights are applied to the second method with the weight applied being equal in one case and 75 for the seed producing tree in the other case to assess the different options since all three methods produce comparative results not shown only the mixed distribution is used for the drought experiment 3 experiment for northward treeline migration 3 1 model development for the migration the model is parametrised for the taymyr region in siberia and could be used directly for the northward migration simulations kruse et al 2016 kruse et al 2019 taymyr is at the northern edge of the distribution area of l gmelinii where the species is expanding farther north as the climate warms mcdonald et al 2008 for the northward migration the trait of interest is seed weight not in units of grams but rather as relative weight to each other this trait influences three factors dispersal distance the number of seeds a tree produces and the germination rate with the first two being negatively correlated to weight and the last one positively the actual weight of a seed is not determined by the trait information the seeds carry but rather by the tree producing the seeds when seeds are introduced at the start of the simulation or when a random variation is assigned a seed is randomly given a normally distributed selected weight value with the average being one and the upper and lower boundaries being 5 3 and 1 3 these trait value limits for seed weight also hold true for seeds created using adaptation the three impacts in the model of the seed weight are all based on the relative seed weight the number of seeds produced by a tree is divided by the squared weight determined by the trees seed weight value of those seeds seed number seed weight2 the germination of seeds is multiplied by 0 12 and the seed weight from which 1 is subtracted this subtraction leads to a decrease with seeds below 1 and an increase when seeds with a weight above 1 are used when the seed weight is exactly average there is neither a positive nor negative effect germination 0 12 seed weight 1 the extent of the effect was based on a study by gorian et al 2007 the distance is divided by the square root or the seed weight d i s t a n c e s e e d w e i g h t 3 2 simulations for the migration simulation runs are performed using a transect representing a slice of the northern forest line with a size of 10 km x 0 2 km and seeds being reintroduced when leaving to the eastern or western side to simulate the continuation of the forest in either direction the simulations are forced for 2000 years using randomised weather taken from the period 1901 2018 from cru ts4 0 harris et al 2020 for the location 98 e 70 66 n with the temperature for the site being lowered by 0 5 c this location is close to the treeline and model test runs indicated that it has a climate that is barely above the required minimum for tree growth the decrease in temperature was introduced to bring the temperature to the very edge if the temperature was decreased further no growth occurred in the first 50 years 2000 seeds per year were introduced from the south with a negative exponential dispersal function and given trait values according to one of the three scenarios uniform variation and inheritance for model spin up the population was restricted during the first 500 years to the southern 1 km x 0 2 km to allow a population to establish afterwards the entire area becomes uniformly inhabitable each of the simulation scenarios was repeated 30 times to counteract variation to compare migration rates under the scenarios a quasi binomial model was established using the percentage of the area south of the forest line along the 10 km long transect over time the forest line is defined as the northernmost position at which forest density does not fall below a threshold of one tree per hectare where a tree has to be 1 3 m tall the statistical analysis was performed using the statistical tool r r core team 2020 the mapping of the effect of seed weight adaptation on the broader scale was conducted using the results of a large scale simulation based on a uniform trait model by kruse and herzschuh 2022 as our baseline in detail the simulated treeline position through time over 2000 3000 ce common era stemming from the transect study covering the region between the current treeline and the arctic ocean was modified using the binomial curves obtained in this study for the adaptation the two variants are then shown on a map of the area this approach was chosen because simulation of a transect of the required length with the higher temperatures was unmanageable in the currently unoptimised version as the required computational power was too large to cope with the increase of trees 4 experiment for southern tree die back 4 1 model development for the drought for simulations of the southern region prone to increasing drought in a warming climate the area of central yakutia was chosen as the model was parameterised for northern distribution areas of the study species l gmelinii the model had to be newly parameterised to be applicable in the south we incorporated an abstracted drought resistance trait with a value from 0 to 100 with 100 representing drought immunity this trait is negatively correlated with the growth rate of trees as they need to invest in this adaptation in the model the trait represents an unspecific resistivity to drought fire which has in reality multiple sources that larch can adapt to drought was shown in studies for larix decidua plesa et al 2019 george et al 2019 new parameterisation was needed after introducing the drought resistance trait as the drought calculation present no longer gave reasonable results in the test described below in lavesi drought is calculated by using the monthly temperature and precipitation data and calculating a general drought mortality for each year a decreasing function with a limit of zero based on tree height is then used to calculate drought mortality of individual trees for a given year this drought mortality is then included in the calculations determining if a tree dies that year for any reason thus larger numbers lead to more tree death kruse et al 2016 to parameterise the model to the southern species distribution we created four transects appendix fig 6 across the species line 4 plots above and below the species line per transect using both species distribution maps mamet et al 2019 and satellite images source google earth to determine where the species can be found this enables us to find a parameterisation for the drought components by using a pattern orientated modelling approach gallagher et al 2021 these plots are simulated and forced with cru ts weather data of random years 1901 2018 on an area of 200 m x 200 m and inheritance data resulting in either a population or not appedix fig 7 the simulations that predict presence absence are achieved by altering the drought in two separate places to determine the values a range of values was tested and the best fit calculated the drought strength present in an area is first calculated based on temperature and precipitation if the evaporation rate exceeds input by precipitation the drought strength is calculated based on the active air temperature once a certain value is reached this overall drought strength is for this version after parametrisation appendix fig 8 increased by applying the formula drought 0 3863 ² the second change is in the formula estimating the individual drought strength applied to a tree in the previous version of the model the drought strength decreases as the tree grows taller via multiplication with the formula 1 0 h e i g h t o f t r e e in this version a value of 0 5 is added after this step to increase the amount of drought stress applied to the trees and ensure even very tall trees are still meaningfully affected whereas previously large trees became effectively immune to drought after this calculation the drought resistance factor is applied to get the final drought mortality 4 2 simulations for the drought when running simulations for a region first the current drought resistance of the population is determined from simulations forced using randomised trace he 2011 data from 1 to 1900 ce for a given location for a period of 10 000 years and allowing the trees to adapt to the conditions this assumes that the trees would be adapted to the conditions that were present before the 20th century over time the yearly average trait value for drought resistance of new trees oscillates around a value that is assumed to be the optimal trait value for the location the average is calculated from the values from simulation years 4000 10 000 this optimum is then used as the value for uniform tests and as the centre point for the distribution used by both variation and for initial seeds the inheritance simulations the simulations are performed using a transect representing a slice of an area expected to be affected by droughts in the future based on the calculated drought strengths for the area to simulate a wide range of conditions the transect is split into individual simulations as the length of the simulated transect is too limited to cover the desired range of drought conditions to cover an even wider range of conditions more plots randomly distributed in the surrounding area of the transect are included fig 2 for each grid cell of weather data a simulation is performed on an area of 400 m x 400 m for the first 1000 years simulations are forced with random years selected from weather data from cru ts covering 1901 2018 the first 1000 years are both to simulate the current conditions of the populations and as the spin up phase to allow the forests to establish from seeds introduced over the entire area the subsequent 2000 years use the same data but with the temperature and precipitation raised to the level predicted by the cmip5 giorgetta et al 2012 data using the rcp 4 5 scenario for 2260 2300 ce as it covers both strong and weak drought over the area the scenarios rcp 2 6 and rcp 8 5 only showed the corresponding extreme results each of the simulation scenarios for every plot was repeated ten times to counteract variation for comparison of the drought die back rates revealed by the simulation setup a quasi binomial model was established using the percentage of the average number trees that are over 1 3 m tall in the last 200 years of the simulation and comparing it to the average of the last 200 years of the spin up phase that is under the current climate conditions the drought strength is the average value calculated by the model for the simulation years these models are created for all three scenarios the spatial upscaling of the simulation results was performed by calculating the drought value for every cell with a size of 0 5 x 0 5 using the same formula as in lavesi and survival curves from which the expected population change is calculated when a population size falls below 5 the population is considered extinct the comparative results are shown limited to the current area of boreal forest for the region fig 2 olson et al 2001 5 results 5 1 impact of trait value variation and inheritance on larch forest dynamics in the focus regions the three trait scenarios uniform random variation and inherited traits lead to a difference in the percentage area the forest line reaches which increases over time fig 3 a value of 0 5 indicates that the tree line has reached up to half the length of the transect initially the area covered by forest is the same in all scenarios and continues to slowly increase after spin up of 500 years but they diverge around simulation year 900 in the later stage the migration rate increases further and both the randomly variable traits and inheritable adaptive traits scenarios increase faster than the uniform traits scenario adaptive traits have the fastest migration rates and farthest forest cover extent of the simulation transect the average seed weight decreases under the adaptation variant over time survival under different drought strengths based on different simulation plots using the rcp 4 5 scenario weather data decreases with increasing drought fig 4 earlier offset of drought affecting the population sizes can be seen at lower drought strength in the uniform and randomly variable drought resistance scenarios while populations with adaptive trait values are more resilient in those adaptive populations the average drought resistance increases after the drought increase once the drought reaches a value of 1 2 all populations are expected to have died out with some already having died at a value of 1 5 2 siberian wide impact of adaptation on future larch forests the results extrapolated from the two results above onto the larger area show that the harsher the rcp scenario used for predictions is the faster the migration is and the stronger the drought die out fig 5 table 1 predictions further into the future generally lead to larger changes but to smaller effects from adaptation through migrations as the species is expected to have reached the coastline in most places the exception to this is rcp 2 6 in which there is a reduction of drought severity and the adaptive migration has the largest impact the results obtained using the climate data from the rcp 4 5 scenario and the time frame of 2260 2300 shows an interestingly varied response there are many areas that are estimated to have surviving populations although the estimations for many of the locations lead to lower population sizes when using the uniform traits compared to the adaptation traits up to 11 of the area is estimated to have populations go extinct when using only uniform traits for simulations but 17 of this area 2 of the total population area is expected to survive when factoring adaptation into the extrapolation for migration having adaptive traits is expected to extend the range in areas where the treeline has not yet reached the ocean by an area of 35 778 km² table 1 6 discussion 6 1 impacts of trait value variation and inheritance on larch forest dynamics our results suggest that the migration rate of forests into northern tundra areas is faster for scenarios with seed weight variation this effect is even stronger in the adaptation scenario since the average trait value of the populations can change due to heritability of the seed characteristics as was found by barchenkov 2011 the offspring of a tree with light seed has a greater chance of migrating farther north and also has a greater chance of producing light seeds themselves this leads first to a decrease in seed weight as those seeds are spread farther and cover larger areas and in consequence a faster migration can be observed as the overall lighter seeds are spreading farther this continues until the simulation area is covered thus inheritance combines the average seed weight variation and local fine scale adaptation and it can ultimately influence the simulated migration rate the observed migration rate mcdonald et al 2008 kharuk et al 2018 already includes such variation warmer temperatures increase the migration rate and lead to the populations reaching the coastline faster this is due to warmer climate leading to faster tree growth and thus allowing the trees to reach their seed producing stage earlier and to be more prolific kruse et al 2019 kruse and herzschuh 2022 therefore an increase in temperature not only leads to a larger inhabitable area but also to faster migration into an area that is already habitable but not yet colonised mcdonald et al 2008 the simulations can be influenced by long distance dispersal events fayard et al 2009 which could lead to some heavier seeds randomly being transported a long way therefore adaptation can sometimes lead to slower expansion if a population initially has heavier seeds although the general trend is towards faster migrations as long distance dispersal events are more likely with lighter seeds in our model previous studies have estimated that the time lag caused by the slow migration of trees could lead to grassland forming in the warming northern areas chapin and starfield 1997 our study shows that this might not happen because of the faster migration of the trees when considering variation and adaptation in areas that experience a strong drought the population size is reduced due to increased tree mortality in the inherited adaptation and random variation scenarios there is a range of different drought adaptations leading to the possibility of pre adapted trees being present initially in both scenarios some trees survive however in the adaptation scenario the offspring are more likely to be drought adapted as well whereas the offspring in the variation scenario have the same chance of being adapted as their parents and with increased change in drought strength the likelihood of this being a useful adaptation becomes smaller therefore the number of viable offspring is much smaller under the variation scenario and the population cannot recover their numbers easily and is more likely to die out due to random events the model behaves reasonably with respect to droughts and the simulation results match observations that show smaller populations of siberian larches are more affected by drought khansoritoreh et al 2017 populations that are affected by disturbances have fewer individuals and denser tree stands lead to shallower permafrost thaw kropp et al 2019 thus impacting the landscape and carbon stored furthermore droughts weaken pine populations which are exacerbated by secondary effects such as insects or fungi leading to a higher mortality kharuk et al 2013 with warmer temperature also making natural disturbances more likely in boreal forests seidl et al 2020 therefore simulations that result in a local population barely surviving could be interpreted as a threat of extinction which is likely to cause reduced forest survival and probably prevent recolonisation under such conditions this study finds a larger increase in temperature is needed to lead to drought related die out compared to a previous study brazhnik and shugart 2015 this could be due to the different study areas and their inclusion of terrain but might also stem from our assumption that the trees are adapted to the conditions from before the 20th century the strong difference in forest dieback between the three scenarios underlines the importance of an accurate prediction of the climate currently there is some evidence for rcp 8 5 to be the closest schwalm et al 2020 which would mean that greater areas of the current larch population could be threatened the inclusion of variation and adaptation of key traits in an individual based model affects modelled population dynamics as in nature variation of traits in our model allows a local population to include a range of drought resistances and survive smaller droughts ovenden et al 2021 and inheritance allows it to adapt to the prevailing conditions savolainen et al 2007 thus the model only needs to have a small range of variation around the optimum along with the possibility for a population to be optimised for past conditions in a fast changing environment svenning and sandel 2013 when including traits in a model using adaptation it is vital to ensure the traits represented in the model are inheritable as some traits can be almost exclusively influenced by the environment geber and griffen 2003 and the degree of this phenotypic plasticity can be limited by other factors valladares et al 2007 differences in both seed weight wieczorek et al 2017 barchenkov 2011 and drought resistance kagawa et al 2006 have been found between populations of larix gmelinii in general larix gmelinii does have genetic variation between and within populations larionova et al 2004 zhang et al 2013 6 2 siberian wide impact of adaptation on future larch forests we could show that the impact of warming is meliorated with the adaptation of key traits while more inhabitable areas in the north might open up for tree growth the migration rate might not be able to keep up with the changing possible range kruse et al 2016 the response in the south however will be faster once the trees start dying from drought but could be delayed with a weaker decline if temperature rises only gradually and trees are able to adapt at some point a breakpoint will be reached and the population disappears where this breakpoint lies depends on the rate of adaptation in the tree populations simulations ignoring adaptation are going to place the threshold at a lower level than is realistic as populations cannot migrate further north indefinitely as the coastline prevents expansion north mamet et al 2019 drought triggered die out could affect large parts of the population if temperatures increase to the level of rcp 8 5 as predicted by schwalm et al 2020 hence migration north cannot offset the dieback south indefinitely our simulations show the potential future development larix gmelinii while this larch species and other similar larch species are dominant over large areas especially at the northern margin abaimov et al 1998 in the west and south mixed forests with evergreen taxa prevail this means that the predictions can only be taken as predictions for the survival of larch species in northern areas and therefore the overall forest cover might react differently while it is known that other species of the biome are experiencing droughts as well kharuk et al 2017 both shuman et al 2011 and tchebakova et al 2016 predict a change in forest type for their study region that depends upon the climate scenario used mixed forests could also increase the likelihood of larches dying out as the current simulations only consider pure larch forests and as discussed previously smaller populations that are more isolated are more likely to die out and the effect of future climate change might be more adverse on larches in mixed forest mixed forest can also directly increase the drought that larch experiences because some species cause the soils to dry out more bonan 2008 this could lead to stronger effects on larches in mixed forest than predicted our simulation study shows that the majority of tree cover change depends largely on the actual change in climate the stronger the climate changes the more drastic the effects can be expected although initial increases in temperature can result in better tree growth zhang et al 2019 further increases lead to drought zhirnova et al 2020 in addition topography can play a role in migration and larch abundance as passing a mountain range is more challenging than crossing flat terrain macias fauria and johnson 2013 sato and kobayashi 2017 our simulations and the resulting extrapolations do not take topography into account explicitly yet the underlying climate data reflect the broader changes 6 3 modelling trait adaptation to climate change random variation and inheritable adaptation of traits allows for a range of trait values to be present within the simulated population when change occurs be it to allow for new growth or an adverse effect on plant health this does come with two related issues the first being lower population numbers as only a few trees are well suited to any one circumstance and the second being that all trait variations are always available this can lead to populations surviving even if the changes are very drastic and happen quickly both these shortcomings are addressed by the introduction of inheritable adaptive traits hence our model allows for small scale local adaptation and for variation in traits to coexist within the same area as long as the advantages are not too unequal while our study already discusses changes to a large ecosystem that could impact global systems schaphoff et al 2016 bonan 2008 the implemented functions combined with dispersal and pollination kruse et al 2018 could be applied to other models and contribute to research of further global problems for this research we limited the scope to one adaptable trait per region seed weight in the north and drought tolerance in the south to reduce variation between the simulations and thus allow for a clearer differentiation of the effects while it is possible to include more larch species and with recent developments many boreal tree species kruse et al 2022 this study uses the species the model as was originally parameterised kruse et al 2016 since l gmelinii is the dominant species over vast areas of eastern siberia abaimov et al 1998 7 conclusions the inclusion of random variation and inheritable adaptive traits has the potential to change the results of predictions to an extent that warrants future adoption of the process in studies allowing more dynamic responses of trees to be modelled simulations over long timescales or of taxa with widely varying traits are greatly enhanced by these new inclusions because species are able to adapt to changed conditions but also appear maladapted if changes are happening too fast when only variation is used maladaptation cannot be simulated especially at the regional scale the limiting factor for inclusion is the increased amount of computational resources required to perform the additional calculations to determine the pollen source and the new trait values thus small scale simulations with either few generations or a small area may not gain sufficient benefit to warrant the new inclusion of adaptation from our results we could infer that while larch forests are able to spread farther north with increasing temperature this spread is ultimately limited and cannot under the rcp 8 5 scenario offset the potential loss of large forest areas due to drought the rate at which this predicted change happens is not only affected by climate but also by the choice of trait parameterisation in the simulations with the inheritance of traits new possibilities for simulations arise changes over long time scales or heterogeneous landscapes can be simulated with the trees adapting to local or temporal conditions these simulations can later be expanded by introducing trees from other populations or more drought adapted species

24227,biological conservation depends increasingly on the establishment of protected areas that include as many species as possible and are extensive compact and connected various optimization models have been developed to address one or more of these goals this article develops a set of models that can be used sequentially or separately to promote all four assuming that species are mapped across a rectangular grid we first identify core areas that are extensive and compact by maximizing the density of the graph associated with the reserve this minimizes the number of boundary edges suitably normalized and thus reduces opportunities for organisms to leave the core areas and external threats to enter we then identify contiguous corridors between these compact areas based on costs and species conservation goals allowing the judicious replacement of core elements where possible this suite of optimization models can assist in designing an efficient and effective system of compact protected areas along with connecting corridors keywords compactness conservation areas corridors graph density optimization models reserve site selection data availability all empirical data used in this study can be found in the modern repository in github https github com lweeras modern git 1 introduction in modern reserve design conservationists seek to designate areas for protection that all else being equal i protect as many species as possible and are ii extensive iii compact and iv connected to one another the arguments are now well known reserves that protect more species will be more effective biologically and more easily justified economically and politically extensive reserves can support large populations that are less vulnerable to intrinsic factors such as demographic stochasticity chance variation in births deaths and sex composition lande 1988 and the loss of genetic variation through inbreeding and chance inheritance frankham 2005 o grady et al 2006 as well as from extrinsic factors such as catastrophes fires floods hurricanes and climate change beier 2012 bengtsson et al 2003 compact reserves will be less affected by threats that enter through reserve boundaries such as altered microclimates illegal grazing and wood cutting disease poaching and predation murcia 1995 they may also be easier and cheaper to manage and protect bruner et al 2004 finally connected reserves will allow for the movement of individuals between sites buffering against downward fluctuations in numbers or genetic diversity sustaining populations and evolutionary processes diamond 1975 mccullough 1996 wilson and willis 1975 and allowing species to track changing climates beier 2012 dinerstein et al 2020 hannah 2011 at far less effort and cost to alternatives such as assisted migration krosby et al 2010 these ideas informed and motivated conservation planning from local to global scales kingsland 2002 olson and dinerstein 2002 and the number cumulative area and connectivity of reserves quickly grew jenkins and joppa 2009 unep wcmc accessed 2021 while the biological imperative to create large and connected reserves is now clear there are significant economic political and social costs to setting lands aside from human use conservationists need to designate reserves that are as effective and efficient as possible but initially lacked two essential tools for doing so first they had limited knowledge of many species distributions especially in remote and species rich areas such as the tropics so there was little confidence in the effectiveness of any proposed reserve to protect species williams et al 2002 second even when species distributions were known conservationists had limited tools to find the most efficient set of sites to preserve these species there has been continued improvement in both areas and the science of reserve design now draws on increasingly complete data and sophisticated analytical tools early attempts to achieve the first goal protecting the most species focused on identifying and protecting sites that were hotspots of various kinds for example that were high in endemic species in taxonomically unique species in endemics and total species or in endemics and threats reviewed in brooks et al 2006 these approaches did not use all the available data on species distributions and several researchers proposed instead using a greedy algorithm selecting the most diverse site and then adding in stepwise fashion subsequent sites that contain the greatest number of species not yet represented providing complementarity a key early principle in reserve design reviewed in margules and pressey 2000 pressey et al 1993 this approach is easily implemented but does not guarantee an optimum in coverage or efficiency since the value of any particular site depends ultimately on which other sites are also selected later methods from mathematical optimization were introduced to regional conservation planning for example in the us gap analysis program scott et al 1993 to identify sites that would protect all species of interest an early application kiester et al 1996 mapped all 357 species of vertebrates in idaho onto a grid of 389 hexagons each 640 km 2 in area and asked for each size of a reserve system of 1 2 3 hexagons which specific hexagons would protect the most species global optima were found for sets of up to five hexagons by exhaustive search larger sets were identified using an ibm optimizing subroutine library for a maximal location covering problem church et al 1996 this approach was extended globally though with necessarily lower resolution rodrigues et al 2004a b numerous studies have now treated the reserve design problem as a set or maximal set covering problem respectively seeking the most efficient solution to protect all species or the most species with a reserve system of a given size or budget cabeza and moilanen 2001 these approaches easily accommodate sites that are already protected or that are weighted to reflect their differing costs or benefits to species conservation while these approaches do identify sites that are efficient in space and cost the sites chosen tend to be small and remote from one another and not ideal for the long term for example the four hexagons in idaho with greatest combined diversity of vertebrates include one each from the northern rainforest central boreal forest southwest desert and southeast snake river basin to be fair with larger total reserve sizes more hexagons the set covering analyses find more equivalent solutions providing flexibility in decision making another early principle in reserve design pressey et al 1993 however there clearly was a need to formally address these additional goals a number of models have now been devised to design reserve systems that are efficient in protecting species and that also satisfy the additional goals of being connected compact or both connectivity can be measured in a variety of ways butler et al 2022 keeley et al 2021 pascual hortal and saura 2006 here we focus on structural or habitat connectivity of an ecoscape early work was conducted on establishing connected reserves önal and briers 2002 2005 2006 williams et al 2002 followed by a more recent treatment billionnet 2012 a variety of optimization models have also been developed for connected reserve design that incorporates aspects of species home range gupta et al 2019 and species relocation dissanayake et al 2012 in order to model compactness one line of research focused on minimizing the sum of pairwise distances or maximum distance between sites in a given cluster nalle et al 2002a önal and briers 2002 alternative measures are the sum of distances or maximum distance to an optimally chosen central site within the cluster billionnet 2016 önal et al 2016 wang and önal 2016 williams et al 2005 another approach to promote compactness minimizes the perimeter or scaled perimeter of the cluster daigle et al 2020 fischer and church 2003 mcdonnell et al 2002 öhman and lämås 2005 önal and briers 2003 possingham et al 2000 wright et al 1983 a thorough description of alternative compactness measures and their mathematical formulation can be found in billionnet 2021 some notable efforts have sought to generate reserves that are both connected and compact billionnet 2016 cova and church 2000 önal et al 2016 wang and önal 2016 williams and revelle 1996 williams 1998 biobjective approaches have been studied in order to combine two measures of compactness nalle et al 2002a b our previous work weerasena et al 2014 used a hierarchical optimization approach to create compact clusters of sites the well known marxan software ball et al 2009 employs a biobjective approach that tries to simultaneously maximize compactness and minimize total site acquisition cost though originally implemented using simulated annealing ball et al 2009 solution by integer linear programming was later added beyer et al 2016 connectivity between protected areas is now considered integral to any system of protected areas alagador et al 2012 especially in light of continued climate change and is mandated in many international conservation targets ward et al 2020 connectivity between reserves can be provided in various ways for mobile species stepping stones along migration pathways may be sufficient as for example with migratory waterfowl and the us national wildlife refuge system fischman 2005 for species that are less mobile or that cannot move through human dominated landscapes corridors may need to be continuous the corridors themselves may serve as conduits for movement for what beier and loe 1992 called passage species that simply transit the corridor or they may need to be habitats for corridor dwellers that live and reproduce in them hess and fischer 2001 in the first case corridors can be tacked on afterwards to a system of large compact nature reserves in the second the corridors are better viewed as part of a single connected reserve various methods have been developed to identify efficient or effective corridors between existing reserves using individual based models circuit theory graph theory or least cost measures among others reviewed in hilty et al 2020 hall et al 2021 notable contributions for addition of corridors using optimization techniques include conrad et al 2012 gomes 2011 dilkina et al 2017 dissanayake et al 2012 gupta et al 2019 hamaide et al 2022 sessions 1992 suter et al 2008 and williams 1998 a number of studies have used mathematical optimization to simultaneously identify compact reserves and connecting corridors billionnet 2013 fuller and sarkar 2006 earlier versions of marxan could find corridors with the help of manual inputs or specialized scripts though a new program marxan connect daigle et al 2020 now streamlines that process the present work continues along such lines by formulating a particular measure of compactness network density creating compact clusters of sites that protect species within a given cost budget and then judiciously adjusting these clusters to enable the provision of efficient and species rich corridors that join them this yields a system of connected reserves that jointly satisfies the four goals outlined at the beginning of this section it should be emphasized that we illustrate here a sequential process that first identifies compact clusters of core areas then constructs corridors that link these clusters and finally allows adjustment of the original clusters to achieve a feasible solution that respects a budgetary constraint these three steps which involve the use of optimization models for their solution can also be applied individually to either create compact clusters to connect existing core areas or to adjust a system of core areas plus connecting corridors we believe that the flexible approach developed here is especially applicable when natural core areas reserves are geographically distant from one another so that the addition of noncompact single parcel width corridors makes ecological and economic sense 2 optimization models 2 1 measuring compactness for simplicity we assume that potential reserve sites are defined on a rectangular grid of uniform sites fig 1 shows illustrative examples in which six sites indicated by the outlined squares might be selected to define a potential reserve within the entire grid it is useful to define the graph g n e associated with a potential reserve consisting of the selected sites nodes n and in which the graph edges e indicate adjacency of sites in n specifically two sites a b n are adjacent with a b e if they share a common side let n n and m e denote respectively the number of nodes and the number of edges in g for example the graph associated with the reserve shown in fig 1 a has n 6 nodes and m 5 edges in general a potential reserve consists of m pairs of adjacent sites and has p exterior defining boundary lines since grid cells are uniform we assume for simplicity that the distance between adjacent sites is 1 and that the distance between nonadjacent sites is given by the minimum number of edges joining them in g as discussed in section 1 compactness can been defined in a number of ways in our study we concentrate one specific measure of compactness namely the density of the graph g n e which is defined as δ m n the reason for using the term density here arises from the general concept of graph density defined as the ratio of the number of edges in a graph to the maximum number of possible edges since a reserve graph g is embedded in the plane the maximum number of edges in g is at most 3 n 6 chartrand and zhang 2005 consequently the ratio m n does indeed measure the density of a reserve graph it is useful to note that for any regular grid of sites e g triangular rectangular hexagonal we must have m 3 n 6 so that the density δ m n will be bounded above by 3 we argue that maximizing the density of the associated graph is a reasonable goal for achieving compactness indeed maximizing the graph density δ is closely related to minimizing the perimeter p the sum of lengths of all boundary edges of the reserve namely for a graph g n e embedded in a uniform rectangular grid all unit length cell sides there are four lines surrounding each cell giving a total count of 4 n lines defined by the figure this is also equal to the number of boundary edges p plus twice the number of graph edges m giving 4 n p 2 m and so 4 p n 2 δ therefore maximizing the density δ is equivalent to minimizing a normalized form of the perimeter p biologically maximizing the density of a reserve graph then minimizes the proportion of boundaries across which organisms can leave a reserve or external threats can enter by such normalization the density measure allows us to compare reserve configurations containing different numbers of sites n previous investigations have measured compactness using a different normalization by comparing the perimeter to the circumference of a circle with the same area öhman and lämås 2005 possingham et al 2000 billionnet 2021 considers compactness to be measured by the ratio of the perimeter to the area of the reserve since we assume uniform grid cells minimizing this measure is then equivalent to maximizing the graph density as an illustration the densities of the reserves depicted in fig 1 are respectively 5 6 1 and 7 6 so the reserve shown in fig 1 c would be classified as the most compact configuration of the three which is intuitively reasonable as a further example suppose that the selected reserve sites form a rectangle with r rows and c columns then the density is calculated to be δ 2 r c r c this quantity is maximized by making r and c as equal as possible conforming to the idea that a square shaped reserve achieves the most compact rectangular shape a square shaped reserve with r rows and r columns then has density δ 2 2 r approaching the limiting value δ 2 as discussed in section 2 2 an upper bound of 2 on reserve graph density holds for rectangular grids and is important in developing the solution technique discussed there 2 2 models for creating compact reserves in this section we develop an optimization framework for creating compact reserves based on maximizing the graph density δ m n we suppose that the system of possible reserve sites is defined by a rectangular grid g of uniformly sized cells each represented by an ordered pair i j g if two cells i j and k l share a common side we say they are adjacent the set n i j indicates the neighborhood of i j namely those grid cells adjacent to cell i j the optimization models developed here and subsequently identify a compact set of sites constituting a possible reserve taking into account the desired representation of species and a budgetary constraint these models require the following inputs s number of conservation species to be protected a s set of sites i j inhabited by species of type s where s 1 2 s b total budget available for the reserve system b i j budgetary cost of purchasing conserving or maintaining site i j we define decision variables x i j to indicate which grid sites i j are selected for inclusion in the reserve system x i j 1 if site i j g is selected 0 otherwise we use this notation to define the graph g n e associated with a stipulated reserve namely n i j x i j 1 and e i j k l x i j x k l 1 k l n i j then the graph density can be expressed as the ratio 1 δ 1 2 i j g k l n i j x i j x k l i j g x i j the denominator of 1 counts the total number of sites in the reserve system g the numerator of 1 counts the number of adjacent pairs of sites in g and is divided by 2 to avoid double counting the number of actual edges in g to obtain a feasible configuration of sites with maximum density we can solve the following 0 1 nonlinear optimization model p 1 2 p 1 maximize 1 2 i j g k l n i j x i j x k l i j g x i j 3 subject to i j a s x i j n s for all s 1 2 s 4 i j g b i j x i j b 5 x i j 0 1 for all i j g constraint 3 enforces the requirement that to protect species of type s adequately we must select at least n s sites in which species s is present constraint 4 ensures that the total cost of selected sites does not exceed the conservation budget b the objective function represented in 2 is a ratio of two functions f x and g x with the numerator being a quadratic in the 0 1 decision variables x let ω be the feasible region defined by 3 5 using concepts from fractional programming borrero et al 2017 we instead solve the following problem max f x λ g x x ω the value λ is to be selected so that this new objective function value achieves the maximum value 0 this can be accomplished by applying dinkelbach s algorithm dinkelbach 1967 in order to identify the optimal λ which will then equal the maximum value of the ratio f x g x over x ω for our problem we have some natural bounds on the optimal value λ from section 2 1 we know 4 n p 2 m 2 m so that f x g x m n 2 also we expect that m n holds for any reasonable configuration so that m n 1 consequently the optimal λ can be found by searching the interval 1 2 say starting with the initial value λ 1 5 note that in the optimization problem max f x λ g x x ω the function f x involves quadratic terms x i j x k l using a standard transformation this optimization problem can be converted into an equivalent one involving 0 1 decision variables only in a linear fashion namely define the new binary variables y i j k l x i j x k l y i j k l 1 if both sites i j and k l are selected 0 otherwise the following constraints then ensure that y i j k l equals 1 if and only if sites i j and k l are both selected 6 y i j k l x i j for all i j k l g 7 y i j k l x k l for all i j k l g 8 x i j x k l y i j k l 1 for all i j k l g 9 y i j k l 0 for all i j k l g specifically constraints 6 7 ensure that y i j k l must equal to 0 unless both x i j and x k l equal 1 while constraint 8 ensures that if both i j and k l are selected for conservation then y i j k l must equal 1 consequently y i j k l x i j x k l always holds moreover it can be shown that these y i j k l variables can be relaxed to be continuous rather than binary thus the following linear mixed integer model p 2 can be iteratively solved using dinkelbach s algorithm to identify a reserve configuration with maximum density λ 10 p 2 maximize 1 2 i j g k l n i j y i j k l λ i j g x i j subject to 3 9 as an illustration of this approach consider the problem posed by pimm and lawton 1998 in which there are 16 species a p distributed across a 10 10 grid see fig 2 suppose that each species s should appear in at least two sites so that n s 2 for all s in addition suppose that at most b 15 sites can be chosen achieved by setting all b i j 1 we used matlab version r2020a matlab 2020 cplex optimization studio version 12 9 0 ibm 2020 python 3 7 and a macbook pro equipped with an intel i7 processor and 16 gb memory to solve our optimization models dinkelbach s algorithm converged to an optimal solution x x i j after just two iterations in less than 10 s with λ δ 21 15 1 4 this solution is given in fig 3 which displays the 0 1 values of x the shaded squares highlight the 15 sites selected for the reserve 2 3 alternative solutions the maximum density solution to the pimm and lawton problem shown in fig 3 is just one optimal solution to the model p 2 an alternative solution also with δ m n 21 15 1 4 is displayed in fig 4 having alternative optimal solutions is quite valuable as it provides decision makers the opportunity to apply additional criteria to select a configuration from among those alternative optima a family of optimal solutions to the original problem can be found by adding suitable constraints to the original formulation let x x i j denote an optimal solution found by solving model p 2 let i 0 be the set of indices i j for which x i j 0 and let i 1 be the set of indices i j for which x i j 1 then add to the original model p 2 the following constraint 11 x i j i j i 1 x i j i j i 0 i 1 1 and solve model p 2 with this added constraint constraint 11 cuts off the current optimal solution x moreover it can be shown that this added constraint does not preclude any other alternative optimal solution balas and jeroslow 1972 if solution of model p 2 with this added constraint produces the same objective function value we have now identified an alternative optimal solution this process continues by adding one new constraint of the form 11 each time based on the 0 1 nature of the optimal x just found once we obtain a smaller value of the objective function the process can stop this procedure will generate all alternative optimal configurations we illustrate this generation process by solving a problem previously introduced in weerasena et al 2014 this problem involves a 14 14 grid of sites in which there are three species a b c with n a 49 n b 41 n c 44 and an upper bound b 61 on the number of selected sites the distribution of species on these 196 sites is depicted in fig 5 solving this problem using model p 2 results in the solution shown in fig 6 a the optimal density was therefore achieved not by creating a single cluster but was identified by the model as consisting of three separate compact clusters of sites by applying the procedure discussed here we generated a number of alternative optimal solutions several of which are displayed in fig 6 b d notice that the models developed here do not ensure connectivity of the entire reserve system to explore this further we consider the 14 14 problem just introduced now with more general site costs b i j generated using a uniform distribution over the interval 1 10 fig 7 displays the cost values for the individual reserve sites we now apply model p 2 in order to generate compact clusters using the upper bound b 290 two of the resulting optimal solutions are shown in fig 8 the first contains four clusters and the second contains three clusters since our objective is to generate a reserve system that is connected the following section will discuss an efficient approach for judiciously adding corridors to connect such clusters it should be noted that solution of model p 2 never required more than 10 cpu seconds for any of the results shown in figs 6 and 8 2 4 addition of corridors as seen in section 2 3 model p 2 can produce compact disjoint clusters of core areas to be protected we now develop a heuristic for adding corridors to connect these clusters in a manner that uses relatively few corridor sites since the added corridor sites provide habitat for species a secondary objective will be to bias the selection of corridor sites in favor of those that are species rich the addition of corridors to connect wildlife reserves has been approached using a variety of optimization techniques önal and briers 2006 develop an integer programming formulation to create a fully connected reserve that satisfies species representation constraints however there is no assurance that the resulting configuration achieves compactness by contrast a number of researchers have developed models for connecting existing clusters of wildlife reserves possibly compact in an optimal way by treating the problem as a network steiner tree problem dilkina et al 2017 hamaide et al 2022 williams and revelle 1998 williams and snyder 2005 or as a connected subgraph problem conrad et al 2012 dilkina and gomes 2010 our approach takes as given a compact set of wildlife reserves and seeks to connect them using a one parcel wide corridor system in a computationally effective manner possibly our approach can be extended to develop a corridor system that takes into account corridor geometry matisziw et al 2015 st john et al 2018 wang et al 2022 yemshanov et al 2022 this is clearly an avenue for further exploration in order to connect clusters using relatively few corridor sites in an efficient way we developed a heuristic that sequentially joins nearest clusters until all are connected at which point we can identify efficient corridors joining the given clusters initially we identify two existing clusters that are closest to one another measured by the minimum number of corridor sites needed to join them since there will generally be multiple ways to minimally connect these two clusters we select a minimum length corridor whose constituent sites contain the largest number of species the original two clusters plus this identified corridor are then coalesced into a new pseudo cluster and the process is repeated note that such corridors need not necessarily directly join two original clusters they may attach to a previously added corridor in this way producing a heuristically obtained steiner tree of corridors joining the original clusters more specifically consider disjoint clusters c 1 c 2 c k produced by applying model p 2 we expand in turn clusters c 1 c 2 c k by one layer of adjacent sites until two expanded sets connect this can be accomplished by keeping the current collection of k sets in a queue adding to the set at the front of the queue all new sites that are adjacent to that set and then placing this expanded set at the end of the queue eventually two of the original clusters say c i and c j will become connected since there are multiple ways in which c i and c j can be connected with the fewest number of corridors sites we use a suitably adapted longest path algorithm to identify a minimum number of connecting sites that contain the maximum number of species giving rise to a new cluster to replace c i and c j then this process is repeated now with a smaller number of expanded clusters to eventually identify a set of corridors that connect all of the original clusters c 1 c 2 c k this heuristic runs very quickly especially in comparison to the exact approach discussed in section 3 1 our computational experience shows that the heuristic solutions produced are either optimal or near optimal there are several ways in which we can if desired generate alternative configurations that join the original clusters c 1 c 2 c k in a near optimal way first of all it is straightforward to modify our longest path algorithm to generate alternative corridor designs that join c i and c j with a minimum length corridor containing the maximum number of species if additional alternative configurations are desired then the original ordering of c 1 c 2 c k in the queue data structure can be permuted and the entire process can be repeated since our heuristic is reasonably efficient such multiple invocations can produce a rich set of alternative optimal solutions we illustrate in fig 9 the result of applying this approach to the configuration displayed in fig 6 a which contains three compact clusters for ease of illustration we rename these clusters as a l s then we expand each cluster in turn by adding one layer at a time the first layer added to cluster a contains adjacent sites labeled b the first layer added to cluster l contains adjacent sites labeled m and the first layer added to cluster s contains adjacent sites labeled t the result of these first level expansions is shown in fig 9 a let us denote these expanded clusters as a 1 l 1 s 1 since these expanded clusters are still disjoint the expansion process is continued namely a second layer of adjacent sites labeled c is added to a 1 and then a second layer of adjacent sites labeled n is added to l 1 resulting in the enlarged clusters a 2 and l 2 shown in fig 9 b at this point we observe that clusters a 2 and l 2 meet along the indicated double lines shown in fig 9 b meaning that the two original clusters a and l can be merged using a corridor involving sites b c n m then among the relevant possibilities we use a modified longest path algorithm to select the b c n m corridor with maximum species representation this process is then repeated with the two expanded clusters now available until they merge the added corridors that result are shown dark in fig 10 a this heuristic added nine extra sites connecting the three original clusters shown in fig 6 a these added corridor sites cover an additional 4 4 4 of species a b c respectively having identified a set of say m promising corridor sites to connect the original clusters c i we can consider two options the first is to identify for decision makers the proposed set of corridors which involves adding the fewest number of unit width corridor sites that have the most impact in terms of increasing species numbers they can then weight the benefit of adding these particular sites to the overall reserve versus the added cost alternatively we can seek to identify certain boundary sites whose removal will still result in a connected system that respects the species and budgetary constraints 3 4 removing a relatively small number of these boundary sites is expected to have small impact on the overall compactness of the original reserve clusters the following discussion indicates how this can be approached by developing an appropriate 0 1 integer programming model for species s let e s denote the number of sites in the current clusters containing s in excess of n s plus the number of corridor sites containing s so e s represents the excess number of sites containing s present in the current configuration of clusters and corridors in addition certain sites appearing on the boundary of the original clusters c i can be removed without disconnecting its containing cluster let k denote the set of such boundary sites such non disconnecting boundary sites can be found efficiently with the computation time growing linearly with the number of nodes and edges in the graph tarjan 1972 we would like to determine a set of boundary sites i j k to remove to maintain feasibility of the system with the added corridors and removed boundary sites consequently we solve the following optimization problem 12 p 3 minimize i j k x i j 13 subject to i j a s k x i j e s for all s s 14 i j k x i j m 15 x i j 0 1 for all i j k constraint 13 ensures that the removed boundary sites maintain feasibility of the species requirement 3 after adding the corridor sites and removing the boundary sites k constraint 14 ensures that enough boundary sites are removed to account for the m added corridor sites thus maintaining the original budgetary requirement 4 if model p 3 provides a feasible solution then we are able to incorporate all the extra sites used to create the corridors if this model is infeasible then we can solve again with an alternative set of corridors to illustrate this process we return to the situation shown in fig 6 a in which the species and cost requirements are given by n a n b n c 49 41 44 and b 61 for the solution shown in fig 10 a we obtain species coverage 49 42 44 for the three clusters involving 61 sites the corridors shown add nine corridor sites with species coverage 4 4 4 model p 3 produces a feasible solution with nine boundary sites represented in fig 10 b as cells with dotted sides these nine boundary sites remove species coverage of 4 5 4 giving a net species coverage original corridor boundary of 49 42 44 4 4 4 4 5 4 49 41 44 a connected feasible solution involving b 61 sites this approach can also be applied to instances with general site costs b i j to illustrate consider the solution with four clusters in fig 8 a that was generated by applying model p 2 using our previously described method for adding species rich corridors we identified the eight corridor sites shown in fig 11 a we now discuss in general how to determine a set of boundary sites to remove to compensate for the addition of corridor sites suppose that m corridor sites have been added to a configuration of disjoint clusters we solve the following optimization problem p 4 which generalizes the model p 3 employed in the uniform cost case here b is the additional cost in excess of b incurred when these m corridor sites are added 16 p 4 minimize i j k x i j 17 subject to i j a s k x i j e s for all s s 18 i j k b i j x i j b 19 x i j 0 1 for all i j k a solution of p 4 identifies a set of boundary sites that can be removed from the configuration to restore feasibility that is a solution that satisfies constraints 3 4 in model p 1 for the example with corridors shown in fig 11 a application of model p 4 identifies seven sites to remove giving the final configuration shown in fig 11 b here the total cost is 288 18 51 36 51 76 287 78 290 the species requirements are also satisfied 3 model evaluation and real world data sets this section assesses the quality and the effectiveness of our overall approach we evaluate our methodology using test cases previously discussed as well as a more extensive real world data set first we compare the heuristic approach for corridor generation discussed in section 2 4 with an exact approach next we study the performance of our proposed models on data sets derived from real world examples all computations reported were performed using the computational environment specified in section 2 2 3 1 an exact model for corridor generation we used the optimization model proposed in billionnet 2021 to evaluate the quality of the solutions produced by the heuristic algorithm described in section 2 4 this flow based optimization model is similar to those developed for various steiner tree problems ljubić 2021 specifically the billionnet approach seeks to connect up at minimum total cost a given set of clusters c 1 c 2 c k by using a set of intermediate sites i j where there is a cost k i j associated with each site i j the model assumes that if a site i j is already protected or included in a cluster the cost associated with that site is zero recall that the heuristic approach developed in section 2 4 is designed to identify a fewest number of corridors that connect the given clusters and that have the largest impact in terms of increasing species number thus to have a reasonable comparison of our heuristic algorithm with the billionnet flow model we modified the objective function of the billionnet model as follows for each site i j that is not included in one of the given clusters we define the site cost k i j m s i j where m is a sufficiently large positive number and s i j is the total number of species contained in site i j as a result identifying a set of corridor sites with the minimum total cost k i j is equivalent to identifying a smallest set of corridor sites that overall contain the maximum number of species when we applied this exact model to the two examples illustrated in figs 6 a and 8 a the exact model and the heuristic algorithm produced corridors with the same number of corridor sites and the same number of additional species specifically the exact and heuristic solutions were identical for the instance shown in fig 8 a in contrast the exact model produced an alternative set of corridors for the instance shown in fig 6 a both solutions are displayed in fig 12 the heuristic approach took 0 0015 and 0 0020 s while the exact model took 41 and 45 s to produce corridors for the test cases given in figs 6 a and 8 a respectively 3 2 results using a real world data set next we discuss the quality and effectiveness of our overall approach using a data set obtained from the atlas of the vascular flora of the iberian peninsula afliber ramos gutiérrez et al 2021 thirty species were selected at random from this source which contains distribution data for thousands of plant species in spain and portugal distribution data for the 30 species was then filtered down to a 200 km 200 km block and analyzed at the 10 km 10 km resolution the region of portugal and spain outlined in fig 13 a was selected because the level of completeness of distribution records was relatively high and the species richness was relatively low the corresponding species numbers s i j are tabulated in fig 13 b for our next set of analyses we assume uniform site costs b i j 1 the first set of computational tests investigated the 10 10 data set from the top left block of fig 13 and considered separately the cases n s 1 and n s 2 for all species s for each of these two cases the overall cost budget b was set equal to 10 20 30 40 and 50 the results of running model p 2 are shown in fig 14 where it is seen that in all cases we obtained a single nearly square cluster table 1 shows the optimal value λ and the cpu time in seconds required by the dinkelbach algorithm to solve model p 2 in each case convergence was achieved in at most two iterations of the algorithm in order to explore larger problems and the addition of corridors we considered the entire 20 20 system displayed in fig 13 b first we applied model p 2 to five separate instances whose characteristics are given in table 2 for each species s the number of required species n s is a random integer uniformly drawn from the interval 1 20 the results obtained from model p 2 for these five instances are shown in fig 15 where it is seen that in all cases we obtained multiple clusters table 3 displays the number of clusters produced the optimal graph density value λ and the computation time respectively for example model p 2 produced four clusters with graph density 1 1333 for problem 1 it took 19 49 s to obtain this result second we applied the exact and heuristic methods to add corridors to these clustered systems resulting in the corridors shown dark in fig 16 the leftmost column of this figure displays the corridors produced by the exact method while the rightmost column displays the corridors produced by our heuristic algorithm numerical results associated with this analysis are provided in table 4 for problems 3 and 4 the exact and heuristic approaches used the same set of corridor sites to connect all clusters for problems 1 2 and 5 the heuristic method identified corridors containing one extra site compared to the exact method notice that with one extra site we achieve a significantly larger number of species this reflects the advantage of prioritizing species rich sites in our models for corridor selection table 4 shows that the computation time of the heuristic method is less than 0 3 s for all test problems which is some 600 times faster than the exact flow based model billionnet 2021 to further validate the effectiveness of our heuristic we applied model p 2 to a set of test instances with nonuniform site costs b i j randomly generated from the interval 1 10 three different random scenarios were considered corresponding to three independent sets of randomly selected b i j with associated sum of all site costs b t o t a l 2190 2176 2159 for each such b t o t a l the overall budget value b was varied as 5 10 and 15 of b t o t a l as in the prior analyses the number of required species n s is a random integer uniformly drawn from the interval 1 20 we considered ten separate test instances with nonuniform site costs whose characteristics are given in table 5 model p 2 was then applied to each test instance table 6 displays the number of clusters produced the optimal graph density λ and the computation time respectively we then applied the exact and heuristic methods to add corridors to these clustered systems with nonuniform site costs the numerical results associated with this analysis are provided in table 7 only for problem 14 did the heuristic method identify more corridors to connect all clusters compared to the exact method in that case the heuristic added just one extra site and in the process added five to the number of covered species furthermore as seen in table 7 the computation time of the heuristic method is less than 0 8 s for all test problems some two orders of magnitude less than that for the exact method this analysis again highlights the efficiency of our heuristic method in comparison to the exact model when applied to problems with nonuniform site costs 4 discussion protected areas are generally viewed as the primary mechanism by which to preserve biological diversity for example in the aichi biodiversity target 11 of protecting at least 17 of terrestrial lands with ecologically represented and well connected systems of protected areas cobd 2010 there has been significant progress toward meeting these global goals of coverage and connectivity but challenges remain and the goals themselves are now viewed as inadequate we have described a method to delineate a system of connected reserves that is efficient in protecting species in the next sections we summarize the contributions and limitations of our approach address some caveats and outline some further extensions of this work 4 1 contributions of our approach we have described a suite of algorithms to aid in designing efficient systems of protected areas that contain extensive compact cores along with their connecting corridors specifically we first identify reserve systems comprised of a single or several compact clusters we discuss how in fact a set of alternative compact areas can be generated by our model important in pursuing the investigation of alternative designs using a heuristic approach we then connect any resulting disjoint clusters with corridors chosen for their conservation values our computational study suggests that this heuristic is reasonably efficient and typically near optimal in performance this approach addresses our four goals of designing efficient reserve systems that provide species coverage and are extensive compact and connected a third optimization model can be applied if desired to remove certain boundary sites of the compact cores to compensate for the addition of the identified corridor sites it is important to note that these three optimization models can be applied sequentially or individually to aid decision makers our approach shares features with many others in systematic reserve planning first it is implemented for presence absence data on species or habitat types communities or other features of conservation interest on a rectangular array second it can take existing protected areas as fixed and build strategically on them for greater coverage and connectivity third our model can be used to justify the inclusion of particular sites in a reserve and identify alternatives if those sites are not chosen there are ways in which our approach departs from others in the literature notably we employ a somewhat novel measure of compactness to guide the optimization models while maximizing the graph density δ is mathematically equivalent to certain other measures proposed in the literature our measure satisfies 1 δ 2 making it easy to initialize the dinkelbach algorithm using λ 1 5 for hexagonal grids we have the bounds 1 δ 3 and so could initialize with λ 2 even for the largest problems analyzed here this algorithm converged in at most four iterations moreover our density measure allows a comparison between candidate reserves possessing different sizes since δ must have a numerical value within the interval 1 2 we also indicate how it is possible to generate alternative compact clusters all having maximum density by systematically adding a new constraint 11 at each step to problem p 2 to illustrate the potential for such exploration we found over 40 alternative solutions when investigating the 14 14 test problem of weerasena et al 2014 by sequentially adding constraints of the form 11 to model p 2 this is an important consideration since it enables the analyst to provide a rich set of alternative configurations which can then be evaluated by decision makers additionally we explicitly consider exchanging core for corridor sites if they can better serve the twin goals of coverage and connectivity this option is a natural result of seeking to maximize the conservation return on investments kareiva 2010 indeed fuller et al 2010 suggests that strategically trading the 1 least cost effective of australia s nearly 7000 protected areas could dramatically increase the conservation value of the protected area system our approach can also be used to quantify the costs and benefits of connecting versus enlarging reserves adams et al 2019 falcy and estades 2007 critical when the funds and political and social will for the protection of lands are limited seidl et al 2021 corridors will often be through developed landscapes and may require restoration making them expensive competitors for limited funds with core reserves indeed this was one of simberloff et al s 1992 primary concerns about proposed corridor systems in florida one other feature of our modeling approach is worth emphasizing the optimization model p 1 strictly segregates the objective function from the species representation and budget constraints unlike approaches like marxan ball et al 2009 daigle et al 2020 which incorporate cost boundary length and possibly conservation targets into a single objective function the latter approach requires a judicious selection of weighting factors since these components have quite different units moreover if the decision maker wishes to systematically vary these weighting factors to obtain a set of alternative reserve designs the binary nature of the variables makes it impossible in general to generate all non inferior pareto optimal solutions williams 1998 by contrast we optimize density a single objective subject to constraints on total cost in units and species representation in numbers the decision maker will have a good sense of the total cost budget and also the species representation requirements and if desired can parametrically vary these values 4 2 caveats and extensions there are a number of caveats in this work first the distributions of many species even among relatively well studied birds ocampo peñuela et al 2016 may not be known with certainty and there will be cases in which species are inaccurately omitted from or assigned to sites these errors are of particular concern in tropical forests which are rich in biodiversity but not in survey data amano and sutherland 2013 donaldson et al 2016 meyer et al 2016 rodrigues 2011 tydecks et al 2018 methods for reserve planning have addressed these uncertainties in various ways reviewed in arthur et al 2002 the threshold approach considers a species to be present in a site if its expectation of occurring there exceeds some threshold say 90 and then maximizes the coverage of species that exceed this threshold haight et al 2000 this ignores sites for which species just miss the threshold but uses standard maximum coverage algorithms in contrast the expected coverage approach maximizes the expected number of species covered using all the data but in a nonlinear 0 1 optimization problem of greater difficulty polasky et al 2000 watts et al 2020 modified marxan to incorporate four kinds of uncertainty that a species or some other feature occurs in a site that it occurs but might disappear that it occurs but might be degraded and no longer contribute to conservation goals and that it does not occur but might appear through ecological succession or other mechanisms haider et al 2018 presented a robust optimization approach that protects against worst case scenarios while rosing et al 2002 defended heuristic methods including their own when the underlying data are too soft to support optimal solutions after all csuti et al 1997 found that 17 of 18 heuristic approaches covered at least 422 species in oregon with 23 sites just shy of the optimum of 426 additional errors can arise simply from the choice of grid size and origin dunn 2010 witte et al 2008 and all can lead to the inefficiencies or failures in a reserve design we view this investigation as a first step in creating an integrated approach to reserve design encouraged by the efficiency and quality of results for the 20 20 real world test problems we plan to expand our set of test data to encompass larger examples in order to accommodate additional data sources we also plan to generalize our approach to incorporate sites defined on hexagonal grids or more generally defined on an arbitrary graph another avenue for future investigation is expanding the width of added corridors currently one parcel wide to promote a more accommodating habitat for transit 5 closing comments the 2011 aichi accords set a lofty goal of protecting 17 of terrestrial lands worldwide which helped focus attention on the biodiversity crisis and launch an enormous increase in protected lands unfortunately this growth has been far from optimal in terms of protecting biodiversity often favoring lands of limited agricultural or other value rather than ones satisfying specific conservation goals maxwell et al 2020 stokstad 2020 the resulting biases and shortfalls represent a lost opportunity visconti et al 2019 which must be countered in future conservation efforts in addition there has been a continued downgrading and degazetting of protected areas around the world mascia and pailler 2011 ruaro et al 2020 symes et al 2016 conservatively affecting an area equal to that of mexico kroner et al 2019 and undermining all these conservation efforts finally there is growing concern that the goal of protecting 17 of terrestrial lands will not suffice to protect the earth s biodiversity even 40 may not be enough leclère et al 2020 there are now calls to protect far more lands from 30 dinerstein et al 2019 to 50 wilson 2016 and with more specific objectives baillie and zhang 2018 noss et al 2012 proposed objectives include protecting key biodiversity areas visconti et al 2019 climate refugia and connectivity carrasco et al 2021 carroll and noss 2021 wilderness watson et al 2018 and ecosystem functions maxwell et al 2020 achieving no net loss of natural ecosystems maron et al 2020 limiting further climate change arneth et al 2020 dinerstein et al 2020 and extinctions rounsevell et al 2020 and accommodating other conservation and development goals di marco et al 2016 sala et al 2021 tilman et al 2017 these conservation goals will require significant additional growth in the protected area networks on earth that is strategic in minimizing costs and conflicts with other needs our integrated approach begins to address this challenge by providing for the joint design of large compact reserves with their connecting corridors

24227,biological conservation depends increasingly on the establishment of protected areas that include as many species as possible and are extensive compact and connected various optimization models have been developed to address one or more of these goals this article develops a set of models that can be used sequentially or separately to promote all four assuming that species are mapped across a rectangular grid we first identify core areas that are extensive and compact by maximizing the density of the graph associated with the reserve this minimizes the number of boundary edges suitably normalized and thus reduces opportunities for organisms to leave the core areas and external threats to enter we then identify contiguous corridors between these compact areas based on costs and species conservation goals allowing the judicious replacement of core elements where possible this suite of optimization models can assist in designing an efficient and effective system of compact protected areas along with connecting corridors keywords compactness conservation areas corridors graph density optimization models reserve site selection data availability all empirical data used in this study can be found in the modern repository in github https github com lweeras modern git 1 introduction in modern reserve design conservationists seek to designate areas for protection that all else being equal i protect as many species as possible and are ii extensive iii compact and iv connected to one another the arguments are now well known reserves that protect more species will be more effective biologically and more easily justified economically and politically extensive reserves can support large populations that are less vulnerable to intrinsic factors such as demographic stochasticity chance variation in births deaths and sex composition lande 1988 and the loss of genetic variation through inbreeding and chance inheritance frankham 2005 o grady et al 2006 as well as from extrinsic factors such as catastrophes fires floods hurricanes and climate change beier 2012 bengtsson et al 2003 compact reserves will be less affected by threats that enter through reserve boundaries such as altered microclimates illegal grazing and wood cutting disease poaching and predation murcia 1995 they may also be easier and cheaper to manage and protect bruner et al 2004 finally connected reserves will allow for the movement of individuals between sites buffering against downward fluctuations in numbers or genetic diversity sustaining populations and evolutionary processes diamond 1975 mccullough 1996 wilson and willis 1975 and allowing species to track changing climates beier 2012 dinerstein et al 2020 hannah 2011 at far less effort and cost to alternatives such as assisted migration krosby et al 2010 these ideas informed and motivated conservation planning from local to global scales kingsland 2002 olson and dinerstein 2002 and the number cumulative area and connectivity of reserves quickly grew jenkins and joppa 2009 unep wcmc accessed 2021 while the biological imperative to create large and connected reserves is now clear there are significant economic political and social costs to setting lands aside from human use conservationists need to designate reserves that are as effective and efficient as possible but initially lacked two essential tools for doing so first they had limited knowledge of many species distributions especially in remote and species rich areas such as the tropics so there was little confidence in the effectiveness of any proposed reserve to protect species williams et al 2002 second even when species distributions were known conservationists had limited tools to find the most efficient set of sites to preserve these species there has been continued improvement in both areas and the science of reserve design now draws on increasingly complete data and sophisticated analytical tools early attempts to achieve the first goal protecting the most species focused on identifying and protecting sites that were hotspots of various kinds for example that were high in endemic species in taxonomically unique species in endemics and total species or in endemics and threats reviewed in brooks et al 2006 these approaches did not use all the available data on species distributions and several researchers proposed instead using a greedy algorithm selecting the most diverse site and then adding in stepwise fashion subsequent sites that contain the greatest number of species not yet represented providing complementarity a key early principle in reserve design reviewed in margules and pressey 2000 pressey et al 1993 this approach is easily implemented but does not guarantee an optimum in coverage or efficiency since the value of any particular site depends ultimately on which other sites are also selected later methods from mathematical optimization were introduced to regional conservation planning for example in the us gap analysis program scott et al 1993 to identify sites that would protect all species of interest an early application kiester et al 1996 mapped all 357 species of vertebrates in idaho onto a grid of 389 hexagons each 640 km 2 in area and asked for each size of a reserve system of 1 2 3 hexagons which specific hexagons would protect the most species global optima were found for sets of up to five hexagons by exhaustive search larger sets were identified using an ibm optimizing subroutine library for a maximal location covering problem church et al 1996 this approach was extended globally though with necessarily lower resolution rodrigues et al 2004a b numerous studies have now treated the reserve design problem as a set or maximal set covering problem respectively seeking the most efficient solution to protect all species or the most species with a reserve system of a given size or budget cabeza and moilanen 2001 these approaches easily accommodate sites that are already protected or that are weighted to reflect their differing costs or benefits to species conservation while these approaches do identify sites that are efficient in space and cost the sites chosen tend to be small and remote from one another and not ideal for the long term for example the four hexagons in idaho with greatest combined diversity of vertebrates include one each from the northern rainforest central boreal forest southwest desert and southeast snake river basin to be fair with larger total reserve sizes more hexagons the set covering analyses find more equivalent solutions providing flexibility in decision making another early principle in reserve design pressey et al 1993 however there clearly was a need to formally address these additional goals a number of models have now been devised to design reserve systems that are efficient in protecting species and that also satisfy the additional goals of being connected compact or both connectivity can be measured in a variety of ways butler et al 2022 keeley et al 2021 pascual hortal and saura 2006 here we focus on structural or habitat connectivity of an ecoscape early work was conducted on establishing connected reserves önal and briers 2002 2005 2006 williams et al 2002 followed by a more recent treatment billionnet 2012 a variety of optimization models have also been developed for connected reserve design that incorporates aspects of species home range gupta et al 2019 and species relocation dissanayake et al 2012 in order to model compactness one line of research focused on minimizing the sum of pairwise distances or maximum distance between sites in a given cluster nalle et al 2002a önal and briers 2002 alternative measures are the sum of distances or maximum distance to an optimally chosen central site within the cluster billionnet 2016 önal et al 2016 wang and önal 2016 williams et al 2005 another approach to promote compactness minimizes the perimeter or scaled perimeter of the cluster daigle et al 2020 fischer and church 2003 mcdonnell et al 2002 öhman and lämås 2005 önal and briers 2003 possingham et al 2000 wright et al 1983 a thorough description of alternative compactness measures and their mathematical formulation can be found in billionnet 2021 some notable efforts have sought to generate reserves that are both connected and compact billionnet 2016 cova and church 2000 önal et al 2016 wang and önal 2016 williams and revelle 1996 williams 1998 biobjective approaches have been studied in order to combine two measures of compactness nalle et al 2002a b our previous work weerasena et al 2014 used a hierarchical optimization approach to create compact clusters of sites the well known marxan software ball et al 2009 employs a biobjective approach that tries to simultaneously maximize compactness and minimize total site acquisition cost though originally implemented using simulated annealing ball et al 2009 solution by integer linear programming was later added beyer et al 2016 connectivity between protected areas is now considered integral to any system of protected areas alagador et al 2012 especially in light of continued climate change and is mandated in many international conservation targets ward et al 2020 connectivity between reserves can be provided in various ways for mobile species stepping stones along migration pathways may be sufficient as for example with migratory waterfowl and the us national wildlife refuge system fischman 2005 for species that are less mobile or that cannot move through human dominated landscapes corridors may need to be continuous the corridors themselves may serve as conduits for movement for what beier and loe 1992 called passage species that simply transit the corridor or they may need to be habitats for corridor dwellers that live and reproduce in them hess and fischer 2001 in the first case corridors can be tacked on afterwards to a system of large compact nature reserves in the second the corridors are better viewed as part of a single connected reserve various methods have been developed to identify efficient or effective corridors between existing reserves using individual based models circuit theory graph theory or least cost measures among others reviewed in hilty et al 2020 hall et al 2021 notable contributions for addition of corridors using optimization techniques include conrad et al 2012 gomes 2011 dilkina et al 2017 dissanayake et al 2012 gupta et al 2019 hamaide et al 2022 sessions 1992 suter et al 2008 and williams 1998 a number of studies have used mathematical optimization to simultaneously identify compact reserves and connecting corridors billionnet 2013 fuller and sarkar 2006 earlier versions of marxan could find corridors with the help of manual inputs or specialized scripts though a new program marxan connect daigle et al 2020 now streamlines that process the present work continues along such lines by formulating a particular measure of compactness network density creating compact clusters of sites that protect species within a given cost budget and then judiciously adjusting these clusters to enable the provision of efficient and species rich corridors that join them this yields a system of connected reserves that jointly satisfies the four goals outlined at the beginning of this section it should be emphasized that we illustrate here a sequential process that first identifies compact clusters of core areas then constructs corridors that link these clusters and finally allows adjustment of the original clusters to achieve a feasible solution that respects a budgetary constraint these three steps which involve the use of optimization models for their solution can also be applied individually to either create compact clusters to connect existing core areas or to adjust a system of core areas plus connecting corridors we believe that the flexible approach developed here is especially applicable when natural core areas reserves are geographically distant from one another so that the addition of noncompact single parcel width corridors makes ecological and economic sense 2 optimization models 2 1 measuring compactness for simplicity we assume that potential reserve sites are defined on a rectangular grid of uniform sites fig 1 shows illustrative examples in which six sites indicated by the outlined squares might be selected to define a potential reserve within the entire grid it is useful to define the graph g n e associated with a potential reserve consisting of the selected sites nodes n and in which the graph edges e indicate adjacency of sites in n specifically two sites a b n are adjacent with a b e if they share a common side let n n and m e denote respectively the number of nodes and the number of edges in g for example the graph associated with the reserve shown in fig 1 a has n 6 nodes and m 5 edges in general a potential reserve consists of m pairs of adjacent sites and has p exterior defining boundary lines since grid cells are uniform we assume for simplicity that the distance between adjacent sites is 1 and that the distance between nonadjacent sites is given by the minimum number of edges joining them in g as discussed in section 1 compactness can been defined in a number of ways in our study we concentrate one specific measure of compactness namely the density of the graph g n e which is defined as δ m n the reason for using the term density here arises from the general concept of graph density defined as the ratio of the number of edges in a graph to the maximum number of possible edges since a reserve graph g is embedded in the plane the maximum number of edges in g is at most 3 n 6 chartrand and zhang 2005 consequently the ratio m n does indeed measure the density of a reserve graph it is useful to note that for any regular grid of sites e g triangular rectangular hexagonal we must have m 3 n 6 so that the density δ m n will be bounded above by 3 we argue that maximizing the density of the associated graph is a reasonable goal for achieving compactness indeed maximizing the graph density δ is closely related to minimizing the perimeter p the sum of lengths of all boundary edges of the reserve namely for a graph g n e embedded in a uniform rectangular grid all unit length cell sides there are four lines surrounding each cell giving a total count of 4 n lines defined by the figure this is also equal to the number of boundary edges p plus twice the number of graph edges m giving 4 n p 2 m and so 4 p n 2 δ therefore maximizing the density δ is equivalent to minimizing a normalized form of the perimeter p biologically maximizing the density of a reserve graph then minimizes the proportion of boundaries across which organisms can leave a reserve or external threats can enter by such normalization the density measure allows us to compare reserve configurations containing different numbers of sites n previous investigations have measured compactness using a different normalization by comparing the perimeter to the circumference of a circle with the same area öhman and lämås 2005 possingham et al 2000 billionnet 2021 considers compactness to be measured by the ratio of the perimeter to the area of the reserve since we assume uniform grid cells minimizing this measure is then equivalent to maximizing the graph density as an illustration the densities of the reserves depicted in fig 1 are respectively 5 6 1 and 7 6 so the reserve shown in fig 1 c would be classified as the most compact configuration of the three which is intuitively reasonable as a further example suppose that the selected reserve sites form a rectangle with r rows and c columns then the density is calculated to be δ 2 r c r c this quantity is maximized by making r and c as equal as possible conforming to the idea that a square shaped reserve achieves the most compact rectangular shape a square shaped reserve with r rows and r columns then has density δ 2 2 r approaching the limiting value δ 2 as discussed in section 2 2 an upper bound of 2 on reserve graph density holds for rectangular grids and is important in developing the solution technique discussed there 2 2 models for creating compact reserves in this section we develop an optimization framework for creating compact reserves based on maximizing the graph density δ m n we suppose that the system of possible reserve sites is defined by a rectangular grid g of uniformly sized cells each represented by an ordered pair i j g if two cells i j and k l share a common side we say they are adjacent the set n i j indicates the neighborhood of i j namely those grid cells adjacent to cell i j the optimization models developed here and subsequently identify a compact set of sites constituting a possible reserve taking into account the desired representation of species and a budgetary constraint these models require the following inputs s number of conservation species to be protected a s set of sites i j inhabited by species of type s where s 1 2 s b total budget available for the reserve system b i j budgetary cost of purchasing conserving or maintaining site i j we define decision variables x i j to indicate which grid sites i j are selected for inclusion in the reserve system x i j 1 if site i j g is selected 0 otherwise we use this notation to define the graph g n e associated with a stipulated reserve namely n i j x i j 1 and e i j k l x i j x k l 1 k l n i j then the graph density can be expressed as the ratio 1 δ 1 2 i j g k l n i j x i j x k l i j g x i j the denominator of 1 counts the total number of sites in the reserve system g the numerator of 1 counts the number of adjacent pairs of sites in g and is divided by 2 to avoid double counting the number of actual edges in g to obtain a feasible configuration of sites with maximum density we can solve the following 0 1 nonlinear optimization model p 1 2 p 1 maximize 1 2 i j g k l n i j x i j x k l i j g x i j 3 subject to i j a s x i j n s for all s 1 2 s 4 i j g b i j x i j b 5 x i j 0 1 for all i j g constraint 3 enforces the requirement that to protect species of type s adequately we must select at least n s sites in which species s is present constraint 4 ensures that the total cost of selected sites does not exceed the conservation budget b the objective function represented in 2 is a ratio of two functions f x and g x with the numerator being a quadratic in the 0 1 decision variables x let ω be the feasible region defined by 3 5 using concepts from fractional programming borrero et al 2017 we instead solve the following problem max f x λ g x x ω the value λ is to be selected so that this new objective function value achieves the maximum value 0 this can be accomplished by applying dinkelbach s algorithm dinkelbach 1967 in order to identify the optimal λ which will then equal the maximum value of the ratio f x g x over x ω for our problem we have some natural bounds on the optimal value λ from section 2 1 we know 4 n p 2 m 2 m so that f x g x m n 2 also we expect that m n holds for any reasonable configuration so that m n 1 consequently the optimal λ can be found by searching the interval 1 2 say starting with the initial value λ 1 5 note that in the optimization problem max f x λ g x x ω the function f x involves quadratic terms x i j x k l using a standard transformation this optimization problem can be converted into an equivalent one involving 0 1 decision variables only in a linear fashion namely define the new binary variables y i j k l x i j x k l y i j k l 1 if both sites i j and k l are selected 0 otherwise the following constraints then ensure that y i j k l equals 1 if and only if sites i j and k l are both selected 6 y i j k l x i j for all i j k l g 7 y i j k l x k l for all i j k l g 8 x i j x k l y i j k l 1 for all i j k l g 9 y i j k l 0 for all i j k l g specifically constraints 6 7 ensure that y i j k l must equal to 0 unless both x i j and x k l equal 1 while constraint 8 ensures that if both i j and k l are selected for conservation then y i j k l must equal 1 consequently y i j k l x i j x k l always holds moreover it can be shown that these y i j k l variables can be relaxed to be continuous rather than binary thus the following linear mixed integer model p 2 can be iteratively solved using dinkelbach s algorithm to identify a reserve configuration with maximum density λ 10 p 2 maximize 1 2 i j g k l n i j y i j k l λ i j g x i j subject to 3 9 as an illustration of this approach consider the problem posed by pimm and lawton 1998 in which there are 16 species a p distributed across a 10 10 grid see fig 2 suppose that each species s should appear in at least two sites so that n s 2 for all s in addition suppose that at most b 15 sites can be chosen achieved by setting all b i j 1 we used matlab version r2020a matlab 2020 cplex optimization studio version 12 9 0 ibm 2020 python 3 7 and a macbook pro equipped with an intel i7 processor and 16 gb memory to solve our optimization models dinkelbach s algorithm converged to an optimal solution x x i j after just two iterations in less than 10 s with λ δ 21 15 1 4 this solution is given in fig 3 which displays the 0 1 values of x the shaded squares highlight the 15 sites selected for the reserve 2 3 alternative solutions the maximum density solution to the pimm and lawton problem shown in fig 3 is just one optimal solution to the model p 2 an alternative solution also with δ m n 21 15 1 4 is displayed in fig 4 having alternative optimal solutions is quite valuable as it provides decision makers the opportunity to apply additional criteria to select a configuration from among those alternative optima a family of optimal solutions to the original problem can be found by adding suitable constraints to the original formulation let x x i j denote an optimal solution found by solving model p 2 let i 0 be the set of indices i j for which x i j 0 and let i 1 be the set of indices i j for which x i j 1 then add to the original model p 2 the following constraint 11 x i j i j i 1 x i j i j i 0 i 1 1 and solve model p 2 with this added constraint constraint 11 cuts off the current optimal solution x moreover it can be shown that this added constraint does not preclude any other alternative optimal solution balas and jeroslow 1972 if solution of model p 2 with this added constraint produces the same objective function value we have now identified an alternative optimal solution this process continues by adding one new constraint of the form 11 each time based on the 0 1 nature of the optimal x just found once we obtain a smaller value of the objective function the process can stop this procedure will generate all alternative optimal configurations we illustrate this generation process by solving a problem previously introduced in weerasena et al 2014 this problem involves a 14 14 grid of sites in which there are three species a b c with n a 49 n b 41 n c 44 and an upper bound b 61 on the number of selected sites the distribution of species on these 196 sites is depicted in fig 5 solving this problem using model p 2 results in the solution shown in fig 6 a the optimal density was therefore achieved not by creating a single cluster but was identified by the model as consisting of three separate compact clusters of sites by applying the procedure discussed here we generated a number of alternative optimal solutions several of which are displayed in fig 6 b d notice that the models developed here do not ensure connectivity of the entire reserve system to explore this further we consider the 14 14 problem just introduced now with more general site costs b i j generated using a uniform distribution over the interval 1 10 fig 7 displays the cost values for the individual reserve sites we now apply model p 2 in order to generate compact clusters using the upper bound b 290 two of the resulting optimal solutions are shown in fig 8 the first contains four clusters and the second contains three clusters since our objective is to generate a reserve system that is connected the following section will discuss an efficient approach for judiciously adding corridors to connect such clusters it should be noted that solution of model p 2 never required more than 10 cpu seconds for any of the results shown in figs 6 and 8 2 4 addition of corridors as seen in section 2 3 model p 2 can produce compact disjoint clusters of core areas to be protected we now develop a heuristic for adding corridors to connect these clusters in a manner that uses relatively few corridor sites since the added corridor sites provide habitat for species a secondary objective will be to bias the selection of corridor sites in favor of those that are species rich the addition of corridors to connect wildlife reserves has been approached using a variety of optimization techniques önal and briers 2006 develop an integer programming formulation to create a fully connected reserve that satisfies species representation constraints however there is no assurance that the resulting configuration achieves compactness by contrast a number of researchers have developed models for connecting existing clusters of wildlife reserves possibly compact in an optimal way by treating the problem as a network steiner tree problem dilkina et al 2017 hamaide et al 2022 williams and revelle 1998 williams and snyder 2005 or as a connected subgraph problem conrad et al 2012 dilkina and gomes 2010 our approach takes as given a compact set of wildlife reserves and seeks to connect them using a one parcel wide corridor system in a computationally effective manner possibly our approach can be extended to develop a corridor system that takes into account corridor geometry matisziw et al 2015 st john et al 2018 wang et al 2022 yemshanov et al 2022 this is clearly an avenue for further exploration in order to connect clusters using relatively few corridor sites in an efficient way we developed a heuristic that sequentially joins nearest clusters until all are connected at which point we can identify efficient corridors joining the given clusters initially we identify two existing clusters that are closest to one another measured by the minimum number of corridor sites needed to join them since there will generally be multiple ways to minimally connect these two clusters we select a minimum length corridor whose constituent sites contain the largest number of species the original two clusters plus this identified corridor are then coalesced into a new pseudo cluster and the process is repeated note that such corridors need not necessarily directly join two original clusters they may attach to a previously added corridor in this way producing a heuristically obtained steiner tree of corridors joining the original clusters more specifically consider disjoint clusters c 1 c 2 c k produced by applying model p 2 we expand in turn clusters c 1 c 2 c k by one layer of adjacent sites until two expanded sets connect this can be accomplished by keeping the current collection of k sets in a queue adding to the set at the front of the queue all new sites that are adjacent to that set and then placing this expanded set at the end of the queue eventually two of the original clusters say c i and c j will become connected since there are multiple ways in which c i and c j can be connected with the fewest number of corridors sites we use a suitably adapted longest path algorithm to identify a minimum number of connecting sites that contain the maximum number of species giving rise to a new cluster to replace c i and c j then this process is repeated now with a smaller number of expanded clusters to eventually identify a set of corridors that connect all of the original clusters c 1 c 2 c k this heuristic runs very quickly especially in comparison to the exact approach discussed in section 3 1 our computational experience shows that the heuristic solutions produced are either optimal or near optimal there are several ways in which we can if desired generate alternative configurations that join the original clusters c 1 c 2 c k in a near optimal way first of all it is straightforward to modify our longest path algorithm to generate alternative corridor designs that join c i and c j with a minimum length corridor containing the maximum number of species if additional alternative configurations are desired then the original ordering of c 1 c 2 c k in the queue data structure can be permuted and the entire process can be repeated since our heuristic is reasonably efficient such multiple invocations can produce a rich set of alternative optimal solutions we illustrate in fig 9 the result of applying this approach to the configuration displayed in fig 6 a which contains three compact clusters for ease of illustration we rename these clusters as a l s then we expand each cluster in turn by adding one layer at a time the first layer added to cluster a contains adjacent sites labeled b the first layer added to cluster l contains adjacent sites labeled m and the first layer added to cluster s contains adjacent sites labeled t the result of these first level expansions is shown in fig 9 a let us denote these expanded clusters as a 1 l 1 s 1 since these expanded clusters are still disjoint the expansion process is continued namely a second layer of adjacent sites labeled c is added to a 1 and then a second layer of adjacent sites labeled n is added to l 1 resulting in the enlarged clusters a 2 and l 2 shown in fig 9 b at this point we observe that clusters a 2 and l 2 meet along the indicated double lines shown in fig 9 b meaning that the two original clusters a and l can be merged using a corridor involving sites b c n m then among the relevant possibilities we use a modified longest path algorithm to select the b c n m corridor with maximum species representation this process is then repeated with the two expanded clusters now available until they merge the added corridors that result are shown dark in fig 10 a this heuristic added nine extra sites connecting the three original clusters shown in fig 6 a these added corridor sites cover an additional 4 4 4 of species a b c respectively having identified a set of say m promising corridor sites to connect the original clusters c i we can consider two options the first is to identify for decision makers the proposed set of corridors which involves adding the fewest number of unit width corridor sites that have the most impact in terms of increasing species numbers they can then weight the benefit of adding these particular sites to the overall reserve versus the added cost alternatively we can seek to identify certain boundary sites whose removal will still result in a connected system that respects the species and budgetary constraints 3 4 removing a relatively small number of these boundary sites is expected to have small impact on the overall compactness of the original reserve clusters the following discussion indicates how this can be approached by developing an appropriate 0 1 integer programming model for species s let e s denote the number of sites in the current clusters containing s in excess of n s plus the number of corridor sites containing s so e s represents the excess number of sites containing s present in the current configuration of clusters and corridors in addition certain sites appearing on the boundary of the original clusters c i can be removed without disconnecting its containing cluster let k denote the set of such boundary sites such non disconnecting boundary sites can be found efficiently with the computation time growing linearly with the number of nodes and edges in the graph tarjan 1972 we would like to determine a set of boundary sites i j k to remove to maintain feasibility of the system with the added corridors and removed boundary sites consequently we solve the following optimization problem 12 p 3 minimize i j k x i j 13 subject to i j a s k x i j e s for all s s 14 i j k x i j m 15 x i j 0 1 for all i j k constraint 13 ensures that the removed boundary sites maintain feasibility of the species requirement 3 after adding the corridor sites and removing the boundary sites k constraint 14 ensures that enough boundary sites are removed to account for the m added corridor sites thus maintaining the original budgetary requirement 4 if model p 3 provides a feasible solution then we are able to incorporate all the extra sites used to create the corridors if this model is infeasible then we can solve again with an alternative set of corridors to illustrate this process we return to the situation shown in fig 6 a in which the species and cost requirements are given by n a n b n c 49 41 44 and b 61 for the solution shown in fig 10 a we obtain species coverage 49 42 44 for the three clusters involving 61 sites the corridors shown add nine corridor sites with species coverage 4 4 4 model p 3 produces a feasible solution with nine boundary sites represented in fig 10 b as cells with dotted sides these nine boundary sites remove species coverage of 4 5 4 giving a net species coverage original corridor boundary of 49 42 44 4 4 4 4 5 4 49 41 44 a connected feasible solution involving b 61 sites this approach can also be applied to instances with general site costs b i j to illustrate consider the solution with four clusters in fig 8 a that was generated by applying model p 2 using our previously described method for adding species rich corridors we identified the eight corridor sites shown in fig 11 a we now discuss in general how to determine a set of boundary sites to remove to compensate for the addition of corridor sites suppose that m corridor sites have been added to a configuration of disjoint clusters we solve the following optimization problem p 4 which generalizes the model p 3 employed in the uniform cost case here b is the additional cost in excess of b incurred when these m corridor sites are added 16 p 4 minimize i j k x i j 17 subject to i j a s k x i j e s for all s s 18 i j k b i j x i j b 19 x i j 0 1 for all i j k a solution of p 4 identifies a set of boundary sites that can be removed from the configuration to restore feasibility that is a solution that satisfies constraints 3 4 in model p 1 for the example with corridors shown in fig 11 a application of model p 4 identifies seven sites to remove giving the final configuration shown in fig 11 b here the total cost is 288 18 51 36 51 76 287 78 290 the species requirements are also satisfied 3 model evaluation and real world data sets this section assesses the quality and the effectiveness of our overall approach we evaluate our methodology using test cases previously discussed as well as a more extensive real world data set first we compare the heuristic approach for corridor generation discussed in section 2 4 with an exact approach next we study the performance of our proposed models on data sets derived from real world examples all computations reported were performed using the computational environment specified in section 2 2 3 1 an exact model for corridor generation we used the optimization model proposed in billionnet 2021 to evaluate the quality of the solutions produced by the heuristic algorithm described in section 2 4 this flow based optimization model is similar to those developed for various steiner tree problems ljubić 2021 specifically the billionnet approach seeks to connect up at minimum total cost a given set of clusters c 1 c 2 c k by using a set of intermediate sites i j where there is a cost k i j associated with each site i j the model assumes that if a site i j is already protected or included in a cluster the cost associated with that site is zero recall that the heuristic approach developed in section 2 4 is designed to identify a fewest number of corridors that connect the given clusters and that have the largest impact in terms of increasing species number thus to have a reasonable comparison of our heuristic algorithm with the billionnet flow model we modified the objective function of the billionnet model as follows for each site i j that is not included in one of the given clusters we define the site cost k i j m s i j where m is a sufficiently large positive number and s i j is the total number of species contained in site i j as a result identifying a set of corridor sites with the minimum total cost k i j is equivalent to identifying a smallest set of corridor sites that overall contain the maximum number of species when we applied this exact model to the two examples illustrated in figs 6 a and 8 a the exact model and the heuristic algorithm produced corridors with the same number of corridor sites and the same number of additional species specifically the exact and heuristic solutions were identical for the instance shown in fig 8 a in contrast the exact model produced an alternative set of corridors for the instance shown in fig 6 a both solutions are displayed in fig 12 the heuristic approach took 0 0015 and 0 0020 s while the exact model took 41 and 45 s to produce corridors for the test cases given in figs 6 a and 8 a respectively 3 2 results using a real world data set next we discuss the quality and effectiveness of our overall approach using a data set obtained from the atlas of the vascular flora of the iberian peninsula afliber ramos gutiérrez et al 2021 thirty species were selected at random from this source which contains distribution data for thousands of plant species in spain and portugal distribution data for the 30 species was then filtered down to a 200 km 200 km block and analyzed at the 10 km 10 km resolution the region of portugal and spain outlined in fig 13 a was selected because the level of completeness of distribution records was relatively high and the species richness was relatively low the corresponding species numbers s i j are tabulated in fig 13 b for our next set of analyses we assume uniform site costs b i j 1 the first set of computational tests investigated the 10 10 data set from the top left block of fig 13 and considered separately the cases n s 1 and n s 2 for all species s for each of these two cases the overall cost budget b was set equal to 10 20 30 40 and 50 the results of running model p 2 are shown in fig 14 where it is seen that in all cases we obtained a single nearly square cluster table 1 shows the optimal value λ and the cpu time in seconds required by the dinkelbach algorithm to solve model p 2 in each case convergence was achieved in at most two iterations of the algorithm in order to explore larger problems and the addition of corridors we considered the entire 20 20 system displayed in fig 13 b first we applied model p 2 to five separate instances whose characteristics are given in table 2 for each species s the number of required species n s is a random integer uniformly drawn from the interval 1 20 the results obtained from model p 2 for these five instances are shown in fig 15 where it is seen that in all cases we obtained multiple clusters table 3 displays the number of clusters produced the optimal graph density value λ and the computation time respectively for example model p 2 produced four clusters with graph density 1 1333 for problem 1 it took 19 49 s to obtain this result second we applied the exact and heuristic methods to add corridors to these clustered systems resulting in the corridors shown dark in fig 16 the leftmost column of this figure displays the corridors produced by the exact method while the rightmost column displays the corridors produced by our heuristic algorithm numerical results associated with this analysis are provided in table 4 for problems 3 and 4 the exact and heuristic approaches used the same set of corridor sites to connect all clusters for problems 1 2 and 5 the heuristic method identified corridors containing one extra site compared to the exact method notice that with one extra site we achieve a significantly larger number of species this reflects the advantage of prioritizing species rich sites in our models for corridor selection table 4 shows that the computation time of the heuristic method is less than 0 3 s for all test problems which is some 600 times faster than the exact flow based model billionnet 2021 to further validate the effectiveness of our heuristic we applied model p 2 to a set of test instances with nonuniform site costs b i j randomly generated from the interval 1 10 three different random scenarios were considered corresponding to three independent sets of randomly selected b i j with associated sum of all site costs b t o t a l 2190 2176 2159 for each such b t o t a l the overall budget value b was varied as 5 10 and 15 of b t o t a l as in the prior analyses the number of required species n s is a random integer uniformly drawn from the interval 1 20 we considered ten separate test instances with nonuniform site costs whose characteristics are given in table 5 model p 2 was then applied to each test instance table 6 displays the number of clusters produced the optimal graph density λ and the computation time respectively we then applied the exact and heuristic methods to add corridors to these clustered systems with nonuniform site costs the numerical results associated with this analysis are provided in table 7 only for problem 14 did the heuristic method identify more corridors to connect all clusters compared to the exact method in that case the heuristic added just one extra site and in the process added five to the number of covered species furthermore as seen in table 7 the computation time of the heuristic method is less than 0 8 s for all test problems some two orders of magnitude less than that for the exact method this analysis again highlights the efficiency of our heuristic method in comparison to the exact model when applied to problems with nonuniform site costs 4 discussion protected areas are generally viewed as the primary mechanism by which to preserve biological diversity for example in the aichi biodiversity target 11 of protecting at least 17 of terrestrial lands with ecologically represented and well connected systems of protected areas cobd 2010 there has been significant progress toward meeting these global goals of coverage and connectivity but challenges remain and the goals themselves are now viewed as inadequate we have described a method to delineate a system of connected reserves that is efficient in protecting species in the next sections we summarize the contributions and limitations of our approach address some caveats and outline some further extensions of this work 4 1 contributions of our approach we have described a suite of algorithms to aid in designing efficient systems of protected areas that contain extensive compact cores along with their connecting corridors specifically we first identify reserve systems comprised of a single or several compact clusters we discuss how in fact a set of alternative compact areas can be generated by our model important in pursuing the investigation of alternative designs using a heuristic approach we then connect any resulting disjoint clusters with corridors chosen for their conservation values our computational study suggests that this heuristic is reasonably efficient and typically near optimal in performance this approach addresses our four goals of designing efficient reserve systems that provide species coverage and are extensive compact and connected a third optimization model can be applied if desired to remove certain boundary sites of the compact cores to compensate for the addition of the identified corridor sites it is important to note that these three optimization models can be applied sequentially or individually to aid decision makers our approach shares features with many others in systematic reserve planning first it is implemented for presence absence data on species or habitat types communities or other features of conservation interest on a rectangular array second it can take existing protected areas as fixed and build strategically on them for greater coverage and connectivity third our model can be used to justify the inclusion of particular sites in a reserve and identify alternatives if those sites are not chosen there are ways in which our approach departs from others in the literature notably we employ a somewhat novel measure of compactness to guide the optimization models while maximizing the graph density δ is mathematically equivalent to certain other measures proposed in the literature our measure satisfies 1 δ 2 making it easy to initialize the dinkelbach algorithm using λ 1 5 for hexagonal grids we have the bounds 1 δ 3 and so could initialize with λ 2 even for the largest problems analyzed here this algorithm converged in at most four iterations moreover our density measure allows a comparison between candidate reserves possessing different sizes since δ must have a numerical value within the interval 1 2 we also indicate how it is possible to generate alternative compact clusters all having maximum density by systematically adding a new constraint 11 at each step to problem p 2 to illustrate the potential for such exploration we found over 40 alternative solutions when investigating the 14 14 test problem of weerasena et al 2014 by sequentially adding constraints of the form 11 to model p 2 this is an important consideration since it enables the analyst to provide a rich set of alternative configurations which can then be evaluated by decision makers additionally we explicitly consider exchanging core for corridor sites if they can better serve the twin goals of coverage and connectivity this option is a natural result of seeking to maximize the conservation return on investments kareiva 2010 indeed fuller et al 2010 suggests that strategically trading the 1 least cost effective of australia s nearly 7000 protected areas could dramatically increase the conservation value of the protected area system our approach can also be used to quantify the costs and benefits of connecting versus enlarging reserves adams et al 2019 falcy and estades 2007 critical when the funds and political and social will for the protection of lands are limited seidl et al 2021 corridors will often be through developed landscapes and may require restoration making them expensive competitors for limited funds with core reserves indeed this was one of simberloff et al s 1992 primary concerns about proposed corridor systems in florida one other feature of our modeling approach is worth emphasizing the optimization model p 1 strictly segregates the objective function from the species representation and budget constraints unlike approaches like marxan ball et al 2009 daigle et al 2020 which incorporate cost boundary length and possibly conservation targets into a single objective function the latter approach requires a judicious selection of weighting factors since these components have quite different units moreover if the decision maker wishes to systematically vary these weighting factors to obtain a set of alternative reserve designs the binary nature of the variables makes it impossible in general to generate all non inferior pareto optimal solutions williams 1998 by contrast we optimize density a single objective subject to constraints on total cost in units and species representation in numbers the decision maker will have a good sense of the total cost budget and also the species representation requirements and if desired can parametrically vary these values 4 2 caveats and extensions there are a number of caveats in this work first the distributions of many species even among relatively well studied birds ocampo peñuela et al 2016 may not be known with certainty and there will be cases in which species are inaccurately omitted from or assigned to sites these errors are of particular concern in tropical forests which are rich in biodiversity but not in survey data amano and sutherland 2013 donaldson et al 2016 meyer et al 2016 rodrigues 2011 tydecks et al 2018 methods for reserve planning have addressed these uncertainties in various ways reviewed in arthur et al 2002 the threshold approach considers a species to be present in a site if its expectation of occurring there exceeds some threshold say 90 and then maximizes the coverage of species that exceed this threshold haight et al 2000 this ignores sites for which species just miss the threshold but uses standard maximum coverage algorithms in contrast the expected coverage approach maximizes the expected number of species covered using all the data but in a nonlinear 0 1 optimization problem of greater difficulty polasky et al 2000 watts et al 2020 modified marxan to incorporate four kinds of uncertainty that a species or some other feature occurs in a site that it occurs but might disappear that it occurs but might be degraded and no longer contribute to conservation goals and that it does not occur but might appear through ecological succession or other mechanisms haider et al 2018 presented a robust optimization approach that protects against worst case scenarios while rosing et al 2002 defended heuristic methods including their own when the underlying data are too soft to support optimal solutions after all csuti et al 1997 found that 17 of 18 heuristic approaches covered at least 422 species in oregon with 23 sites just shy of the optimum of 426 additional errors can arise simply from the choice of grid size and origin dunn 2010 witte et al 2008 and all can lead to the inefficiencies or failures in a reserve design we view this investigation as a first step in creating an integrated approach to reserve design encouraged by the efficiency and quality of results for the 20 20 real world test problems we plan to expand our set of test data to encompass larger examples in order to accommodate additional data sources we also plan to generalize our approach to incorporate sites defined on hexagonal grids or more generally defined on an arbitrary graph another avenue for future investigation is expanding the width of added corridors currently one parcel wide to promote a more accommodating habitat for transit 5 closing comments the 2011 aichi accords set a lofty goal of protecting 17 of terrestrial lands worldwide which helped focus attention on the biodiversity crisis and launch an enormous increase in protected lands unfortunately this growth has been far from optimal in terms of protecting biodiversity often favoring lands of limited agricultural or other value rather than ones satisfying specific conservation goals maxwell et al 2020 stokstad 2020 the resulting biases and shortfalls represent a lost opportunity visconti et al 2019 which must be countered in future conservation efforts in addition there has been a continued downgrading and degazetting of protected areas around the world mascia and pailler 2011 ruaro et al 2020 symes et al 2016 conservatively affecting an area equal to that of mexico kroner et al 2019 and undermining all these conservation efforts finally there is growing concern that the goal of protecting 17 of terrestrial lands will not suffice to protect the earth s biodiversity even 40 may not be enough leclère et al 2020 there are now calls to protect far more lands from 30 dinerstein et al 2019 to 50 wilson 2016 and with more specific objectives baillie and zhang 2018 noss et al 2012 proposed objectives include protecting key biodiversity areas visconti et al 2019 climate refugia and connectivity carrasco et al 2021 carroll and noss 2021 wilderness watson et al 2018 and ecosystem functions maxwell et al 2020 achieving no net loss of natural ecosystems maron et al 2020 limiting further climate change arneth et al 2020 dinerstein et al 2020 and extinctions rounsevell et al 2020 and accommodating other conservation and development goals di marco et al 2016 sala et al 2021 tilman et al 2017 these conservation goals will require significant additional growth in the protected area networks on earth that is strategic in minimizing costs and conflicts with other needs our integrated approach begins to address this challenge by providing for the joint design of large compact reserves with their connecting corridors

24228,in semi arid regions land vulnerability and food security are crucial challenges for the scientific community as millions of livestock keepers depend on rangeland ecosystem services however the aravalli range is a fragile ecotonal arid ecosystem of western india which acts as a barrier against the desertification of the thar desert besides increasing biotic pressure land cover change precipitation variability and climate water deficits have a high potential to render the exploitation of resources unsustainable this study is on the urgent basis addressing the sensitivity fragility and vulnerability status for rangeland ecosystem conservation management practices based on 17 distinct environmental indicators under five themes topography geo climatic socio economic ecological and edaphic which measure their susceptibility then they evaluate their characteristics and sensitivity responses as well as the resilience capabilities of the areas utilizing the integrative methodology of the e psr ecosystem pressure sensitivity and resilience model using a weightage decision matrix geostatistical approach as a result the study area is categorised into four eco sensitive areas i ii iii and iv they have an area of 4 1 62 5 32 2 and 1 2 respectively as well vulnerability reasons i e human intervention regulations and management strategies for the arid rangeland ecosystem were discussed to achieve eco sensitivity and ecosystem stability in this study area the government and conservationists must manage invasive species dominance and adjust buffer zones in reserve areas in addition study suggests using cutting edge technology for monitoring in sum this study helps governments and ecologists understand arid mountainous environments their sensitivity and management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords central aravalli region ecological vulnerability geostatistical approach rangeland ecology weightage decision matrix data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction globally 40 of the area has dryland which sustains more than two billion people of the total population drylands and land degradation 2019 its environment is stressed due to the scanty rainfall hot weather and high population density that pertain to agriculture grazing and pastureland as well as being susceptible to land degradation and urbanisation azarm et al 2022 bilen and turan 2021 peters et al 2015 resource utilization and economic developmental activities have pressurised the dry rangeland ecosystem worldwide to increase agricultural yield deforestation wildfires and other activities azimi et al 2022 deb et al 2014 however anthropogenic actions have placed significant pressure on the local to the global environment resulting in habitat loss and a decline in local biodiversity degrading soil water and air quality and accelerating climate change he et al 2018 li et al 2009 moreover recently global organizations governments and the scientific community have expressed alarm over rangeland eco sensitiveness perturbation and ecological vulnerability the ecosystem vulnerability as defined in the ipcc s third assessment report is defined as an ecosystem s sensitive response and capacity to self recover in the face of external intervention at a specific spatiotemporal scale and its result of the interaction of natural characteristics and human activity yifan 2020 chen 2008 ipcc 2001 even so the natural environment has progressed to a point where it is vulnerable this is due to a series of crises such as biodiversity loss animal conflicts disruption of biogeochemical cycles depletion of groundwater supplies desertification and global warming boori et al 2021 yu et al 2020 fang et al 2019 jha and gundimeda 2019 maiti et al 2017 these catastrophes have posed a peril to living beings forest acreage and rangeland ecology and are susceptible to their sensitivity and vulnerability moreover ecological sensitivity and vulnerability security and management are critical components of resolving the stress between the economy and ecology and their sensitivity to the region duan et al 2022 turan et al 2022 yadav et al 2021 cumming and allen 2017 williams and kapustka 2000 the arid climatic condition is overwhelmed by natural stresses like drought flood soil erosion and erratic changes in vegetation productivity x yan et al 2022 martínez valderrama et al 2021 so on an immediate control and improvement of the rangeland of the ecological environment are needed and careful management of the interactions is required to maintain their sensitivity therefore ecological zoning conservation and planning are required which employ a variety of strategies and processes to regulate and maintain the region s guide resource use human intervention and ecosystem services functions dossou et al 2021 turan et al 2019 everard et al 2017 however to assess such regularities and irregularities an eco sensitivity assessment can be done to decipher the phenomenon despite this the eco sensitivity assessment is an effective approach for conserving and enhancing the ecological environment by assessing its present status and providing trustworthy data for executing appropriate ecological management pursuits quantifying and evaluating an ecosystem s vulnerability eco sensitivity and susceptibility to both natural and human caused disturbances may produce ecological disruption ramachandra et al 2018 dai et al 2011 the traditional elegance of land use had a detrimental effect on biological and resource rich areas and substantial regional environmental problems were caused by improper land use in fragile and sensitive areas azarm et al 2022 the ecological sensitivity assessment of the rangeland ecosystem is important for understanding the nature of the area and its ability to adapt over time today s eco sensitivity is measured by a number of detrimental themes including land use change edaphic factors socioeconomic factors and climatic factors this includes assessing past and current circumstances and forecasting future changes in the ecological environment including its spatial and temporal distribution underlying mechanisms and trend analysis yifan 2020 mei et al 2018 rangeland ecosystem vulnerability eco vulnerability assessment is a holistic approach and evaluation procedures such as the spr model the ecological vulnerability index evaluation method the comprehensive index evaluation methodology the landscape pattern method and the fuzzy evaluation method are frequently used in studies and other publications chen et al 2021 wu et al 2018 meng et al 2010 the psr pressure sensitivity resilience model has been widely used in ecologically fragile region studies recently including fragile areas of the northern hemisphere resource depleted cities and eco problem regions to comprehensive assessment of rangeland ecological vulnerability based on robust regional relevance and available datasets hazbavi et al 2019 butt et al 2019 nandy et al 2015 xie et al 2015 rangeland s ecosystem vulnerability can be quantified using three primary variables based on natural and human caused characteristics pressure sensitivity and resilience as a result we construct an e psr model with essential variables of the ecosystem pressure sensitivity resilience model which entails a detailed analysis of ecosystem vulnerability pandey et al 2020 maikhuri et al 2017 xu et al 2011 this stage of the model s construction based on the availability of environmental variables is critical to comprehending the current state of ecosystem vulnerability in the study area thus recent research has focused on environmentally fragile areas particularly in ecologically sensitive regions however globally limited studies have been carried out on eco sensitive areas despite studies on climate change land use dynamics groundwater and soil degradation shyam et al 2022 a raj and sharma 2022 punia et al 2021 habib et al 2017 hussain 2015 the arid environment and its ecologically sensitive regions have been less concerned for the indian subcontinent the aravalli range eco sensitivity pertains to the climate and desertification of the western and north central parts therefore the current study uses neoapproach to assess the varied topographical region the central aravalli rangeland ecosystem of western india which has an ecotonal region of arid climatic conditions thus the current study develops the e psr model underneath five theme datasets ecology surface condition socio economic topography and geo climatic variables which are integrated with the geo statistical model to evaluate the vulnerability of the rangeland ecosystem additionally using land use land cover lulc datasets from 2020 we calculated the biomass of the region using global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi lidar datasets from 2020 along with forest ground sample plots and other datasets then based on the developed e psr integrated approach over study assess the 1 nature of environmental parameters traits and correlation 2 spatial ecosystem pressure and their sensitivity towards rangeland area 3 resilience towards their ecosystem sensitivity and pressure of the rangeland 4 zonation of the eco sensitive areas based on vulnerability for the conservation planning as 5 assess the qualitative as well as quantitative nature of the rangeland ecosystem 6 proposed the regulation prohibition and permitted activities based on this study prioritizing eco sensitive areas thus allows the sustainable development goals framework to be implemented with conservation policies through stakeholder engagement also it assists authorities planners and policymakers in comprehending the state of affairs and the steps necessary for regulation and prosecution 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the aravalli range is a repository of numerous endemic flora and fauna and is home to diverse faith social and linguistic groups it is a part of the ancient aravalli arrangement whose orogeny was 2 5 billion years ago in three phases raj and sharma 2022 bhuiyan et al 2006 but its orogeny was between 1 7 and 2 2 billion years ago it has several ecological regions depending on the altitude latitude edaphic and climatic characteristics administratively middle aravalli range is spread over four districts ajmer udaipur rajasmand and pali in the central part of rajasthan india it lies between 24 30 26 30 n and 73 35 74 50 n covering an area of 23 001 km2 fig 1 its width is n s to a maximum of 220 km and w e to a maximum width of 50 km the ecotonal stretch between the thar desert and the hill forest range creates a narrower border from north to south diagonally this range has varied geographical features with moderate forest seasonal rivers and abundant flora fauna further it has three distinct agroclimatic zones the semiarid eastern plain the transitional plain of the luni basin the sub humid southern eastern plain hussain 2015 and it has 20 tahsil or mandals clusters of villages the ecotonal region has arid and dry climatic conditions but average temperatures in the study area range from 20 to 42 c and rainfall has ranged from 15 to 60 cm over the last 60 years upadhaya 2014 raj and sharma 2022 also elevation varies north to south between 600 to 1300 m 2 2 datasets the current research primarily used remote sensing socio economic geo climatic and topographical datasets table 1 for rangeland ecosystem sensitivity assessment the current study s data were compiled from landsat 8 oli imagery with a spatial resolution of 30 m also digital elevation model dem of srtm suttle radar topography mission having resolution 30 m from https earthengine google com also other climatic data such as temperature rainfall and climate water deficit of terraclimate from https app climateengine com climateengine the population density data used of wordpop from https www worldpop org in 2020 with a spatial resolution of 100 m and each grid pixel represents the number of people per hectare the soil type data were derived from the https soilgrids org platform the gdp data were obtained from https resourcewatch org data explore and https m rbi org in with a spatial resolution of 1000 m of the year 2020 and the soil type data were used to calculate 2 3 eco vulnerability assessment approach around the 1990s socioeconomic and policy indicators dominated vulnerability assessment following the incorporation of an obligatory sustainability approach into the rio declaration in 1992 environmental and ecological indicators flourished and gained prominence in the early 2000s in several countries and international fora oecd 2008 it also prompted the development of numerous indicators by state global agencies including ecological indicators for vulnerability assessment beroya eitner 2016 however the search for reliable ecological indicators begins in the context of vulnerability analysis especially concerning long term biodiversity risk adaptation and climate change in the range this conceptual model of sensitive ecological receptors proposed three components external exposure innate sensitivity and recovery capacity in a region hong et al 2016 song et al 2010 consequently there is a lack of conceptual agreement about ecosystem vulnerability and factors that contribute to it but ecosystem vulnerability assessment encompasses a rangeland of activities having several stages thus due to the fact that scientific definitions vary widely amongst disciplines assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems is a complex undertaking so the current study is considered as the concept of pressure sensitivity and resilience which is intended to aid in assessing rangeland vulnerability or higher ecological levels 2 4 indicator s selection for eco vulnerability sensitivity resilience and pressure are all components of ecosystem vulnerability in particular regions due to the presence of an unstable frame structure and the system s inability to deal with it as a result it will demonstrate ecosystem resilience by continuing to evolve in the desired direction in the face of external interference and demonstrating sensitivity to external interference yang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 according to previous literature on ecosystem vulnerability assessment the central aravalli range possesses typical pressure sensitivity resilience psr characteristics kumar et al 2020 lv et al 2019 yadav et al 2018 as a result we concentrated on human interference incorporated a variety of environmental factors and attempted to develop an environmental vulnerability ev index system based on the composition and function of resource based design by utilising three components for the psr model fig 2 ecosystem pressure refers to the degree to which ecology is disrupted by external factors such as anthropogenic activity and output demands zou and yoshino 2017 ramachandra et al 2018 the degree of response of an ecosystem to pressure is determined by the system s environmental factors and is referred to as ecological sensitivity deb et al 2014 ecosystem resilience is defined as the capacity of a system to withstand disruption and reorganise itself during change while retaining essentially the same functions structures identities and feedback as before the disruption or change fang et al 2019 liu et al 2017 based on the literature survey about eco sensitivity and the bio geography and climatic variables of the study area a total of 17 indicators table 1 were chosen for the psr model variables are related to the topographical attributes geo climatic edaphic vegetation cover socio economic and human induced activities that may affect the susceptibility of an ecosystem and make it more vulnerable to external perturbations indicators including slope aspect elevation average temperature mean precipitation climate water deficit vegetation coverage biomass soil erodibility index land use land change gross domestic product population density mining zones ecotonal area urbanisation extent and road network were chosen to characterize sensitivity these indicators were chosen because they are widely available and easily adaptable to measuring the ev of the central aravalli region furthermore because the ecological environment incorporates human aspects it includes the environmental pressures imposed by economic and social activity these indicators were chosen because they are widely available and easily adaptable to the measurement of the ev in the central aravalli region additionally because the ecological environment encompasses human characteristics it encompasses the environmental pressures imposed by economic and social activity chen et al 2021 therefore the current study used a variety of indicators to develop a comprehensive model for assessing eco sensitive vulnerability 2 5 e psr ecosystem pressure sensitivity and resilience model 2 5 1 ecosystem pressure ecological pressure intensity is a measure of how exposed rangeland ecosystems are to external pressures and disturbances it is used to evaluate the influence of human activities and economic development on the local ecosystem to quantify the pressure in this study urban extent population growth gdp mining area agricultural activities and road network extension were selected chen et al 2021 liu et al 2017 ecosystem vulnerability is related to ecological pressure which means that more exposure makes an ecosystem more vulnerable 2 5 2 ecosystem sensitivity ecosystem sensitivity is a term that refers to the rangeland ecosystem s sensitivity to external stressors hruska et al 2017 its value can be used to quantify the ecological consequences of external stressors yang et al 2020 sensitivity to the environment is inextricably linked to local environmental issues indexes can be classified into four categories based on the ecosystem problems encountered in the study areas topographical and geomorphological geo climatic edaphic land cover and human induced activities at present the central aravalli rangeland s leading environmental problems are mining and land encroachment soil erosion and soil salinization yadav et al 2018 everard et al 2017 sharma et al 2012 natural disasters such as sand dust storms and desertification are primarily determined by the regional climate and biogeographical condition of the study area and thus the elevation slope and soil erosion indexes and land use classes were chosen to characterize ecological sensitivity for the rangeland ramachandra et al 2018 jin et al 2020 2 5 3 ecosystem resilience ecosystem resilience has risen in popularity and applicability considerably over the years as a result of its critical role in favourably impacting ecosystem vulnerability repairment morimoto and negishi 2019 it refers to an ecosystem s capacity to self regulate and self recover when disturbances from inside and outside do not surpass the elasticity of any rangeland ecosystem song et al 2010 qiao et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 the robustness of each component is dependant on its composition and structure as indices of ecological resilience we looked at net primary productivity a biological abundance index landscape diversity and protected forest area ecosystem resilience is inversely proportional to ecological fragility a greater level of resilience implies a lower level of vulnerability 2 6 land use land cover and biomass the current study analysed land use and land cover change in the year 2020 using the landsat 8 oli toa composite dataset this recommended solution makes use of the random forest supervised classification technique to determine the current lulc status of the google earth engine code editor platform gee x yan et al 2022 prior to image classification a sample of training data for seven classes must be precisely described waterbodies open forests dense forests an agricultural area barren land settlements and mining area however the most difficult and critical step in the supervised classification process is selecting data points for training the classifier later accuracy assessment is the most frequently used method for representing the accuracy of a classified lulc map by systematically comparing pixels or polygons to ground reference data the machine learning approach establishes the relationship between these two sets of data via overall accuracy which is composed of producer and user accuracy as shown in table 2 forest health indicators such as biomass demonstrate the forest s importance as a global carbon sink therefore the forest is regarded as the primary source of carbon sequestration as a result estimating forest biomass is critical for determining the amount of energy stored in trees and assessing climate change the central aravalli region s protected areas such as kumbhalgarh wls and todgarh raoli wls support medium sized trees 8 25 m sparse forests typically have less biomass than dense undisturbed forests or grassland this research used lidar gedi datasets and field data to evaluate the biomass of the region and aid with ground plot dataset using equation 2 for the year 2020 latifah et al 2021 1 agb 0 0673 x ρ d 2 h 0 976 where ρ is wood density d is tree girth diameter and h is tree hight 2 7 eco vulnerability index eco vi pre processing of each measure led to a calculation of an ecological vulnerability index eco vi the ecosystem vulnerability index eco vi is calculated after data standardisation yang et al 2020 national research council 2000 indicator weight calculation and eco vi computation 1 standardisation of data 2 1 positive trait s x i j x i j x j m i n x j max x j min 2 2 negative trait s x i j x j m a x x i j x j max x j min where x ij represents the standardized value of index j in grid cell i xij represents the actual value of index j in grid cell i and xj min xj max are the lowest and highest values respectively of index j of the study area 1 weightage matrix method for indicators an analytic hierarchy process ahp technique was used to generate the indicator weights the following are the major steps after speaking with experts create a pair of comparing scales between indicators construct a hierarchical structure model and generate measurable component ranking outcomes by judging and comparing significance degrees obtain a comparison judgement matrix evaluate the matrix for consistency and compute the weight of each evaluation standard the results of the test revealed that the consistency fulfilled the standards and that the indicator weights were accurate table 3 lists the weightages assigned to each variable of various themes considering the minimal impact on the landscape and also to prioritise conservation regions for future planning the weightages were assigned iteratively across the landscape with varied themes for a development solution and monitoring developing a weightage metric score analysis requires knowledge of multi disciplines termorshuizen and opdam 2009 and planning integrates the present and future needs in the landscape assigning weightages based on the relative significance of themes beinat 1997 provides a transparent mechanism for combining multiple data sets together to infer the significance the weightage is given by 3 eco vulnerability index j n w j x i j where evi is positive relation with vulnerability wj is the weight of the index j and n is the evaluation index number rangeland forest ecosystem pattern investigation is essential to understand the alteration in landscape dynamics due to change under anthropogenic disturbances land use land change analysis using remote sensing data was based on the forest cover proportion ramachandra et al 2018 land uses were assessed using remote sensing data analysis and grids were prioritised according to their forest cover percentage statistics on forest fragmentation are calculated according to a standard approach rama et al 2009 ramachandra et al 2018 2 8 weightage matrix decision method and sensitivity analysis ecosystem vulnerability assessment is a method for defining the eco sensitive zone in a rangeland ecosystem that will regulate strategic management and ecosystem services it is a complicated process that involves the interaction of the natural environment with human activity as a result of the literature review there is no unified framework for establishing an ecological vulnerability evaluation index due to the disparate definitions used across scientific disciplines the model of ecosystem pressure sensitivity resilience was used in this study to develop an evaluation index system by incorporating natural and human factors creating an evaluation index system for the study area ecology the degree to which the ecological system is susceptible to natural and human disturbance is known as environmental sensitivity instability leads to potential vulnerability at the ecosystem level of rangeland topographical characteristics climate vegetation cover and land use land change can all affect an ecosystem s susceptibility and make it more vulnerable to external perturbations zou et al 2021a as aforementioned to evaluate ecosystem vulnerability it is critical to assign a weight to each indicator the ahp determines the weight by constructing a judgement matrix using pair wise comparisons which heavily rely on the prior experience and knowledge of experts in calculating weight a certain amount of subjectivity is unavoidable zou et al 2021b the ecological environment s vulnerability is influenced more strongly by a greater weight the weight is calculated using the weight matrix method formula 4 1 h j j 1 n λ j k 2 j 1 16 k 1 n 4 2 w j h j j 1 17 h j j 1 16 hj denotes the common factor variance of each indicator wj denotes the index weight λ jk denotes the main component load matrix j denotes the index s ranking position k denotes the number of main components and m denotes the total number of main components this paper conducted a sensitivity analysis to ensure that the weights of each index are reasonable and to determine which indicators have the greatest potential impact on the results each index factor s sensitivity analysis was carried out one by one using the mutual test method of ms excel calculations the number of weights and the boundary 1 to 2 are set so that the initial value is 1 the step size is 0 125 and the other variables values are all set to 1 also shown are the weights of the 16 indicators that were subjected to a sensitivity analysis table 4 2 9 field investigations after conducting a comprehensive assessment of the literature and reviewing current studies on land use land change and biomass it was determined that ground truthing is a critical component of remote sensing while working in ecologically sensitive locations in contrast the aravalli hill rangeland has a distinctive topographical structure and encompasses over 23 001 km2 however substantial ground sampling needs adequate financial support and time as a result we used random sampling techniques to cover the entire region which is classified as vulnerable and environmentally sensitive as a result of its land use land change including waterbodies forest area open and dense agricultural land barren land settlement and mining area in 2020 and 2021 is shown in fig 3 the current study covered ecologically vulnerable regions of the central aravalli range with the majority of ground sampling points collected in settlements mining areas agricultural fields and forest land throughout ajmer and rajasmand districts as well as biomass sample plots collected in protected areas kumbhalgarh wls and todgarah raoli wls with each protected area taking 70 to 80 sample plots for biomass estimation whose measurement is 25 25 m as per required dataset 2 10 draft proposal for esz for conservation planning to determine the optimal size of then ecological sensitive zone esz surrounding the rangeland region all relevant factors were taken into account including forest cover physiography human occupation and the area s biodiversity characteristics although the central aravalli range is home to several ave s and butterfly species the proximity of the periphery touch thar desert and adjacent side gangetic plains has been considered a significant factor in determining the protected region s environmental status and its environs 3 results 3 1 eco vulnerability assessment of the central aravalli range the eco vulnerability analysis is based on the psr pressure state and response model developed by oced and other international organisations in 1994 this study evolved the psr model into the e psr ecological pressure sensitivity and resilience model based on a literature review and previous eco sensitivity assessments and monitoring of different locations chen et al 2021 yang et al 2020 liu et al 2017 li et al 2009 therefore current research assesses the ecosystem sensitivity based on the vulnerability status of the central aravalli range which is categorised into four classes eco sensitive area i eco sensitive area ii eco sensitive area iii and eco sensitive area iv as shown in fig 7 moreover this study used five theme indicators such as socio economic condition climatic condition topographical condition surface condition and human interference which are categorised under the e psr model and the weightage and ranking are specified based on the weightage matrix geostatistical approach explained in table 3 assaf and saadeh 2008 3 2 spatial distribution of ecosystem pressure ecosystem pressure is defined based on the socio economic status of the region the current study used population density and gross domestic product gdp of the central aravalli range in 2020 according to figs 4 a and b population density ranges between 425 and 7414 people km2 with 98 of the area falling under less than 425 people km2 and only cities with high population density having between 425 and 7414 people km2 in contrast population density weightage is defined as 1 to 10 based on their population density class with the lowest weightage having 98 area and the other 3 5 7 and 10 wt having 2 area of the study area figs 4c and d depict spatial gdp and its weightage in us dollars in 2020 the gdp of the central aravalli range reflects that 15 to 70 dollars which is categorised into five classes whereas less than 15 covers 97 4 of the area 16 30 covers 0 021 31 50 dollars covers 1 21 of the area 51 70 covers 1 76 and above 70 covers the remaining area whose weightage is defined as 1 3 5 7 and 10 respectively 3 3 spatial distribution of ecosystem sensitivity ecosystem sensitivity is the state of the study region that indicates the regularisation of services and functions of the landscape or ecosystem this research focused on the sensitivity of the central aravalli region at present based on the e psr model the sensitivity indicator is analysed based on such parameters as dem slope aspect temperature rainfall climate water deficit soil erosion index and biomass of the vegetation shown in fig 5 however land use and land cover classes appear in sensitivity and resilience indicators for eco vulnerability however figs 5a and b depict the topographical conditions whereas the dem value of the study area is between 275 and 1271 m which is classified into five classes and their weightage is assigned between 1 to 10 from low to high but figs 5c and d illustrate the aspect of the slopy region from 1 to 359 in five classes and their weightage is assigned corresponding 1 to 10 also figs 5e and f show that the slope range is between 0 61 3 with five categories and values ranging from 1 to 10 although figs 5g h i j k and l show the climatic conditions based on rainfall temperature and climate water deficit parameters while figs 5g and h depict rainfall values between 18 39 cm annually which are categorised into five classes figs 5i and j illustrate yearly temperature profiles of between 7 44 c which are classified into five classes as well as figs 5k and l show that climate water deficits comply with evapotranspiration rate and potential evapotranspiration which values between 700 1170 have been classified into five classes and their weightages are assigned corresponding classes from 1 to 10 respectively moreover figs 5m and n depict the soil erosion index which reflects the nature of soil and its health quality values from 0 to 5 have been categorised into five groups and their weightage is assigned as corresponding between 1 and 10 respectively and figs 5o and p show the urban extent of the central aravalli region in 2020 which is categorised into two classes 0 and 1 and their weightage is assigned as 0 to 10 respectively 3 4 ecosystem resilience resilience refers to an ecosystem s capacity to resume its normal nutrient cycle and biomass production after damage caused by an ecological disturbance its assessment is a robust process because it depends upon productivity and rangeland ecosystem processes however this research focused on assessing the environmental resilience of the central aravalli range based on its biomass developmental activities reserved areas and land cover as illustrated in fig 6 from figs 6a and b depicts the road network which includes national highways and state highways network and their weightage is 07 and figs 6c and d shows biomass having value 0 to 56 tonne hectare which is categorised into five classes and their weightage assigned according although the western part of the central aravalli range behaves as an ecotonal region it is always vulnerable to desertification due to its proximity to the thar desert with a weightage of 07 hence figs 6e and f show the protected regions of the central aravalli todgarh raoli wildlife sanctuary and kumbhalgarh wildlife sanctuary that cover almost 1100 km2 of the total the weightage assigned based on ecological condition is 10 from fig 6g land use land cover is one of the crucial parameters to assessing the eco sensitivity and vulnerability of any landscape its classes belong to the pressure group and resilience of the region as a result current studies determine based on their classes such as waterbodies dense forest open forest agricultural land and barren land whether they include resilience indicators but its two classes mining and settlement classes into the pressure group 3 5 spatial distribution traits of ecosystem vulnerability standardisation of data of ecological pressure sensitivity and resilience were evaluated cross ponding to their indicator weightages over the study area fig 1 and allocation of eco sensitive areas was obtained by the geo statistical weightage overlay matrix method which is shown in table 5 and figs 7 a b and c from table 5 illustrates the evaluation of the eco sensitive regions of the central aravalli range under the e psr model which is categorised into four levels such as low moderate high and very high for these indicators as a result pressure indicator classes such as low moderate high and very high have an area of 61 9 34 5 2 5 and 1 06 of the total and sensitivity indicator areas in their respective classes of low to very high 0 04 1 64 66 1 and 32 1 respectively in the resilience indicator classes which range from low to very high the figures are 2 73 64 18 33 03 and 0 05 respectively from figs 5 and 6 the eastern part of the central aravalli range corresponds to the barren land and high climate water deficit areas whereas the lower parts of the udaipur and pali dist have a low climate water deficit and dense forest cover and the temperature is lower than the rest of the range as well the eastern part of the study area has high settlement and mining activity 3 6 spatial zonation of eco sensitive areas above we analysed 17 parameters based on the e psr model using a geo statistical weightage matrix and an overlay approach to evaluate eco vulnerability besides categorising the study area in their eco sensitive areas however the central aravalli range is divided into four eco sensitive zones which have a value range between 0 to 1 such as eco sensitive area i eco sensitive area ii eco sensitive area iii and eco sensitive area iv based on ecological pressure sensitivity and resilience factors as shown in table 6 and fig 7 from table 6 it shows that eco sensitive i has vegetation cover and balanced ecosystems which are found in the upper westerly region which has a 4 1 area eco sensitive ii has forest and agricultural land that represent a slightly stable ecosystem and resistance mostly covering the eastern and upper regions with 62 5 of the total area eco sensitive iii has potentially vulnerable in nature having barren land and agricultural class with 32 2 of total area while eco sensitive iv is vulnerable to change having a mining area class unstable environment and a challenge to restore with 1 2 of total area 4 discussion eco sensitive assessment and zonation play a vast role in a developing country s ability to protect and conserve its natural resources and biodiversity from ecosystem to biome level vulnerability assessment study previously carried out mostly on biodiversity hotspots and expanding urban developmental areas using other methods such as fuzzy ahp and entropy integrated with a geo statistical approach however this study focused on the aravalli range one of the most sensitive regions on the indian continent because it acts as a desertification shield for eastern rajasthan and central india raj and sharma 2022 although it behaves like a natural green wall and ecotonal region it serves several ecosystem functions and services as well as is home to significant endemic biodiversity in section 3 we discuss the spatial distribution of ecological pressure sensitivity and resilience as well as the eco sensitive zonation as a result 61 9 of the area covered by pressure indicators falls under the low category 61 6 of the area covered by sensitivity indicators falls under the high category 64 18 of the area covered by resilience indicators falls under the moderate category and the remainder of the area falls under other categories of their indicators although classified eco sensitive zones based on the e psr model use several parameters discussed in section 2 which assign weightage ranges of four classes such as potential 0 122 0 3002 moderate 0 3002 0 4351 high 0 4351 0 5426 and very high 0 5426 0 8123 a study by yang et al 2020 on huaibei city china to assess spatial vulnerability in terms of intensive resource exploitation and rapid industrialisation using the psr model and various environmental parameters another study carried out by chen et al 2021 over the nile delta of egypt has accounted that micro and mild vulnerable area is 65 99 and pingtan s main island showed deterioration from west to east side continually ramachandra et al 2018 study was carried out in the central western ghat india which was classified into four eco sensitive areas i to iv having a spatially 52 38 in esr i 14 29 in esr ii 13 1 in esr iii and 20 23 in esr iv another study published by zhang et al 2017 on the yellow river delta based on the psr model has reported that its ecosystem vulnerability was 0 62 and 0 68 between 2010 and 2014 which comes under the moderate vulnerability class therefore eco sensitivity quality and status assessment and management are necessary to protect ecosystem services and their function although environmentalists and working authorities need to be concerned about their level of interference regulation and guidelines and better management plans are discussed below 4 1 interferences in the central aravalli range the affecting factors of ecosystems and the disturbances to their eco sensitivity measurements are very complex sometimes primely interferences or disturbance categories in anthropogenic and natural categories to the literature the central aravalli range has been impeded by denudation from several million years ago and its western edge is being affected by a slow desertification process habib et al 2017 raj and sharma 2022 however anthropogenic interference is more tragic than natural action in the study region karanth et al 2017 everard et al 2017 furthermore the central aravalli region ajmer nagaur pali and rajasmand districts is considered the lungs of central rajasthan and is still influenced by various human activities habib et al 2017 reported that based on conducted studies over 52 sites in the aravalli range have revealed that highways built over wildlife habitats have adversely impacted the fauna in these forests pananchikal 2018 rasik 2018 also around the kumbhalgarh wildlife sanctuary miners and land encroachers try to occupy it the central aravalli s demography increased by 60 in the last two decades affecting the sensitive area and conceiving human wildlife conflicts as well as the resilience s of the shock obsessed area robbins et al 2007 kapoor et al 2009 therefore the study area has experienced a variety of challenges ranging from illicit mining and building to deforestation and depletion of groundwater recharge zones not to mention human lynching s of wildlife s environmental sustainability has been given an undue preference over resource exploitation land grabbing and conscienceless profiteering 4 2 regulation for rangeland eco sensitive areas an eco sensitive area is a type of periphery around fragile protected areas that protect or absorb anthropogenic interference to maintain their ecosystem services and function naturally this region acts as a protective boundary layer to protect the area s flora and fauna as per the literature survey it is found that in the eco sensitive areas of india some activities are prohibited regulated and promoted as per their prior basis as shown in annexure 1 a however in the protected area mining urbanisation and industries setup have to be banned and regulated to ensure monitoring afforestation and forest disease control as well as permitting organic farming or needed farming water harvesting and road widening with wildlife passes according to the above findings roads need wildlife passes in kumbhalgarh and todgarh raoli wildlife sanctuaries which is a way to manage wildlife conflicts despite the fact that this region has arid climatic conditions and little rainfall it requires water harvesting and the preparation of small ponds and wetland areas in order to maintain ecological functions therefore the government related authorities and environmentalists need to be concerned over eco sensitive regions for their safeguard to maintain the resilience of the protected and wildlife corridors endemic species homes and ecologically fragile regions 4 3 required management plan ecosystem sensitive areas need proper management strategies to prevent ecological imbalances and regional climate change in recent decades urban development and settlement growth in the central aravalli range is immensely drury 1990 raj and sharma 2022 from land use land cover classes of the year 2020 the settlement area is around 7 of the total the central aravalli region is ecologically fragile and home to more than 300 bird species and 120 butterfly species as well as lots of endemic flora although wildlife sanctuary occupies the middle and lower region it requires proper monitoring with advanced technologies such as hyperspectral for disease detection lidar for canopy estimation and growth high resolution uavs sensed wildlife conflict illicit possession wildfire situation and ground survey furthermore forest managers and regulating authorities focused on protected area buffer zone endemic species afforestation also reduce the use of fertiliser for agricultural purposes limit the use of plastic in eco sensitive areas and avoid constructing dumping sites in eco sensitive areas 5 conclusion eco sensitivity zonation and vulnerability assessment play a critical role in ecosystem management and restoration on a spatial and temporal scale at present globally eco sensitive areas are concerned or tense due to the high rate of change in land use and land cover class in india approximately 23 of the land area is classified as forest which contains the majority of the biodiversity and provides ecosystem services however the entire aravalli which covers 90 of the forest cover of rajasthan state is divided into three zones upper middle central and lower this study focused on the central range for their eco sensitivity assessment and zonation of their sensitive area for their conservation planning current research provides a distinct outlook assessment of vulnerable eco regions and measures selection regarding their role in assessment eco sensitivity zonation mapping and in management strategies contemporaries assessment in some of the studies indices were defined arbitrarily even though this study determines the indicators that were as per the oecd organisation climatology and topographical variability eco sensitivity is a fragile land areas near protected zones and ecological corridors regions which act as shock absorbers or provide high protection for ecologically dedicated protected or reserved areas therefore it assesses the levels of vulnerability of the central aravalli region in 2020 5 1 advances of study this study spatially highlights the zonation of eco sensitive areas of the central aravalli range using various themes ecology surface condition climatic conditions topographical condition and socioeconomic conditions that aid the e psr model in assessing vulnerabilities traits using a weightage ranking matrix and geostatistical approach to examine the ecological vulnerability range of 0 to 1 therefore this research evaluates spatially ecological pressure ecological sensitivity state and ecological resilience of the study area and these indicators are categorised into four classes low moderate high and very high and their combined weightage assesses eco sensitive zones into four zones eco sensitive area i eco sensitive area ii eco sensitive area iii and eco sensitive area iv having an area of 4 1 62 5 32 3 and 1 2 respectively hence these eco sensitive areas have different characteristics based on the environmental stability of the aravalli range they are low ecologically stable highly resistant and capable of recovering from outside interferences potential potentially ecologically stable low resistant and resist to self recovery moderate slightly ecologically unstable impeded function and ineligible for self recovery and high high intrusion of anthropogenic action need of restoration and management strategies at different levels from the above study we conclude that in eco sensitive regions some regulation guidelines are required which are recommended in annexure 1 b which will help the authorities in the formation of eco sensitive guidelines policies and regulations in the future 5 2 limitation of the current study inclusively this study applied an integrated e psr model with geo statistical approaches to the indicators roles and their weightages appropriate geo statistical mapping and zonation of eco sensitive areas over the central aravalli range should be discussed in this study thoroughly still due to the unavailability of some parameters or indices data of the study region such as biodiversity index landscape indices air pollution data wind speed and species richness it could not be implemented suitably over the central aravalli range the national authorities and scientific communities were unconcerned regarding their urban expansion mining activities and research facilities related to endemic vegetative species safeguarding and environmental change therefore it caused a lacuna in time series monitoring records of land use biomass and socio economic factors consequently this study used different resolution datasets between 30 m to 4000 m and from different sources discussed in section 2 to analyse vulnerability propensity towards an eco sensitive region 5 3 future scope of the study the lucrative and efficiently viable methodology developed is a generic one that can be applied to the above ecosystem at biome levels of the ecological organisation hence the improved interconnected approach is reiterated in any region where land is eco sensitive and vulnerable to environmental conditions the issue related to eco sensitivity tries to combine approaches to address primacy the forthcoming opportunity of this study is to advance an inclusive eco sensitivity management strategy using apposite indicators and apply an advanced modelling approach with parameters for future condition prediction continual monitoring and evaluation need an effective approach to conserve eco sensitive regions as shock absorber for human intervention this may potentially result in future participation in climate change adaptation and management practices using more advanced spatial technologies lidar sar and hyperspectral therefore this study may become a milestone for future studies in the central aravalli region the scientific community and government need to apply a management and regulation strategy to preserve ecology and biodiversity in the future as well credit authorship contribution statement alok raj methodology and study framing draft writing and analysis laxmi kant

24228,in semi arid regions land vulnerability and food security are crucial challenges for the scientific community as millions of livestock keepers depend on rangeland ecosystem services however the aravalli range is a fragile ecotonal arid ecosystem of western india which acts as a barrier against the desertification of the thar desert besides increasing biotic pressure land cover change precipitation variability and climate water deficits have a high potential to render the exploitation of resources unsustainable this study is on the urgent basis addressing the sensitivity fragility and vulnerability status for rangeland ecosystem conservation management practices based on 17 distinct environmental indicators under five themes topography geo climatic socio economic ecological and edaphic which measure their susceptibility then they evaluate their characteristics and sensitivity responses as well as the resilience capabilities of the areas utilizing the integrative methodology of the e psr ecosystem pressure sensitivity and resilience model using a weightage decision matrix geostatistical approach as a result the study area is categorised into four eco sensitive areas i ii iii and iv they have an area of 4 1 62 5 32 2 and 1 2 respectively as well vulnerability reasons i e human intervention regulations and management strategies for the arid rangeland ecosystem were discussed to achieve eco sensitivity and ecosystem stability in this study area the government and conservationists must manage invasive species dominance and adjust buffer zones in reserve areas in addition study suggests using cutting edge technology for monitoring in sum this study helps governments and ecologists understand arid mountainous environments their sensitivity and management graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords central aravalli region ecological vulnerability geostatistical approach rangeland ecology weightage decision matrix data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction globally 40 of the area has dryland which sustains more than two billion people of the total population drylands and land degradation 2019 its environment is stressed due to the scanty rainfall hot weather and high population density that pertain to agriculture grazing and pastureland as well as being susceptible to land degradation and urbanisation azarm et al 2022 bilen and turan 2021 peters et al 2015 resource utilization and economic developmental activities have pressurised the dry rangeland ecosystem worldwide to increase agricultural yield deforestation wildfires and other activities azimi et al 2022 deb et al 2014 however anthropogenic actions have placed significant pressure on the local to the global environment resulting in habitat loss and a decline in local biodiversity degrading soil water and air quality and accelerating climate change he et al 2018 li et al 2009 moreover recently global organizations governments and the scientific community have expressed alarm over rangeland eco sensitiveness perturbation and ecological vulnerability the ecosystem vulnerability as defined in the ipcc s third assessment report is defined as an ecosystem s sensitive response and capacity to self recover in the face of external intervention at a specific spatiotemporal scale and its result of the interaction of natural characteristics and human activity yifan 2020 chen 2008 ipcc 2001 even so the natural environment has progressed to a point where it is vulnerable this is due to a series of crises such as biodiversity loss animal conflicts disruption of biogeochemical cycles depletion of groundwater supplies desertification and global warming boori et al 2021 yu et al 2020 fang et al 2019 jha and gundimeda 2019 maiti et al 2017 these catastrophes have posed a peril to living beings forest acreage and rangeland ecology and are susceptible to their sensitivity and vulnerability moreover ecological sensitivity and vulnerability security and management are critical components of resolving the stress between the economy and ecology and their sensitivity to the region duan et al 2022 turan et al 2022 yadav et al 2021 cumming and allen 2017 williams and kapustka 2000 the arid climatic condition is overwhelmed by natural stresses like drought flood soil erosion and erratic changes in vegetation productivity x yan et al 2022 martínez valderrama et al 2021 so on an immediate control and improvement of the rangeland of the ecological environment are needed and careful management of the interactions is required to maintain their sensitivity therefore ecological zoning conservation and planning are required which employ a variety of strategies and processes to regulate and maintain the region s guide resource use human intervention and ecosystem services functions dossou et al 2021 turan et al 2019 everard et al 2017 however to assess such regularities and irregularities an eco sensitivity assessment can be done to decipher the phenomenon despite this the eco sensitivity assessment is an effective approach for conserving and enhancing the ecological environment by assessing its present status and providing trustworthy data for executing appropriate ecological management pursuits quantifying and evaluating an ecosystem s vulnerability eco sensitivity and susceptibility to both natural and human caused disturbances may produce ecological disruption ramachandra et al 2018 dai et al 2011 the traditional elegance of land use had a detrimental effect on biological and resource rich areas and substantial regional environmental problems were caused by improper land use in fragile and sensitive areas azarm et al 2022 the ecological sensitivity assessment of the rangeland ecosystem is important for understanding the nature of the area and its ability to adapt over time today s eco sensitivity is measured by a number of detrimental themes including land use change edaphic factors socioeconomic factors and climatic factors this includes assessing past and current circumstances and forecasting future changes in the ecological environment including its spatial and temporal distribution underlying mechanisms and trend analysis yifan 2020 mei et al 2018 rangeland ecosystem vulnerability eco vulnerability assessment is a holistic approach and evaluation procedures such as the spr model the ecological vulnerability index evaluation method the comprehensive index evaluation methodology the landscape pattern method and the fuzzy evaluation method are frequently used in studies and other publications chen et al 2021 wu et al 2018 meng et al 2010 the psr pressure sensitivity resilience model has been widely used in ecologically fragile region studies recently including fragile areas of the northern hemisphere resource depleted cities and eco problem regions to comprehensive assessment of rangeland ecological vulnerability based on robust regional relevance and available datasets hazbavi et al 2019 butt et al 2019 nandy et al 2015 xie et al 2015 rangeland s ecosystem vulnerability can be quantified using three primary variables based on natural and human caused characteristics pressure sensitivity and resilience as a result we construct an e psr model with essential variables of the ecosystem pressure sensitivity resilience model which entails a detailed analysis of ecosystem vulnerability pandey et al 2020 maikhuri et al 2017 xu et al 2011 this stage of the model s construction based on the availability of environmental variables is critical to comprehending the current state of ecosystem vulnerability in the study area thus recent research has focused on environmentally fragile areas particularly in ecologically sensitive regions however globally limited studies have been carried out on eco sensitive areas despite studies on climate change land use dynamics groundwater and soil degradation shyam et al 2022 a raj and sharma 2022 punia et al 2021 habib et al 2017 hussain 2015 the arid environment and its ecologically sensitive regions have been less concerned for the indian subcontinent the aravalli range eco sensitivity pertains to the climate and desertification of the western and north central parts therefore the current study uses neoapproach to assess the varied topographical region the central aravalli rangeland ecosystem of western india which has an ecotonal region of arid climatic conditions thus the current study develops the e psr model underneath five theme datasets ecology surface condition socio economic topography and geo climatic variables which are integrated with the geo statistical model to evaluate the vulnerability of the rangeland ecosystem additionally using land use land cover lulc datasets from 2020 we calculated the biomass of the region using global ecosystem dynamics investigation gedi lidar datasets from 2020 along with forest ground sample plots and other datasets then based on the developed e psr integrated approach over study assess the 1 nature of environmental parameters traits and correlation 2 spatial ecosystem pressure and their sensitivity towards rangeland area 3 resilience towards their ecosystem sensitivity and pressure of the rangeland 4 zonation of the eco sensitive areas based on vulnerability for the conservation planning as 5 assess the qualitative as well as quantitative nature of the rangeland ecosystem 6 proposed the regulation prohibition and permitted activities based on this study prioritizing eco sensitive areas thus allows the sustainable development goals framework to be implemented with conservation policies through stakeholder engagement also it assists authorities planners and policymakers in comprehending the state of affairs and the steps necessary for regulation and prosecution 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the aravalli range is a repository of numerous endemic flora and fauna and is home to diverse faith social and linguistic groups it is a part of the ancient aravalli arrangement whose orogeny was 2 5 billion years ago in three phases raj and sharma 2022 bhuiyan et al 2006 but its orogeny was between 1 7 and 2 2 billion years ago it has several ecological regions depending on the altitude latitude edaphic and climatic characteristics administratively middle aravalli range is spread over four districts ajmer udaipur rajasmand and pali in the central part of rajasthan india it lies between 24 30 26 30 n and 73 35 74 50 n covering an area of 23 001 km2 fig 1 its width is n s to a maximum of 220 km and w e to a maximum width of 50 km the ecotonal stretch between the thar desert and the hill forest range creates a narrower border from north to south diagonally this range has varied geographical features with moderate forest seasonal rivers and abundant flora fauna further it has three distinct agroclimatic zones the semiarid eastern plain the transitional plain of the luni basin the sub humid southern eastern plain hussain 2015 and it has 20 tahsil or mandals clusters of villages the ecotonal region has arid and dry climatic conditions but average temperatures in the study area range from 20 to 42 c and rainfall has ranged from 15 to 60 cm over the last 60 years upadhaya 2014 raj and sharma 2022 also elevation varies north to south between 600 to 1300 m 2 2 datasets the current research primarily used remote sensing socio economic geo climatic and topographical datasets table 1 for rangeland ecosystem sensitivity assessment the current study s data were compiled from landsat 8 oli imagery with a spatial resolution of 30 m also digital elevation model dem of srtm suttle radar topography mission having resolution 30 m from https earthengine google com also other climatic data such as temperature rainfall and climate water deficit of terraclimate from https app climateengine com climateengine the population density data used of wordpop from https www worldpop org in 2020 with a spatial resolution of 100 m and each grid pixel represents the number of people per hectare the soil type data were derived from the https soilgrids org platform the gdp data were obtained from https resourcewatch org data explore and https m rbi org in with a spatial resolution of 1000 m of the year 2020 and the soil type data were used to calculate 2 3 eco vulnerability assessment approach around the 1990s socioeconomic and policy indicators dominated vulnerability assessment following the incorporation of an obligatory sustainability approach into the rio declaration in 1992 environmental and ecological indicators flourished and gained prominence in the early 2000s in several countries and international fora oecd 2008 it also prompted the development of numerous indicators by state global agencies including ecological indicators for vulnerability assessment beroya eitner 2016 however the search for reliable ecological indicators begins in the context of vulnerability analysis especially concerning long term biodiversity risk adaptation and climate change in the range this conceptual model of sensitive ecological receptors proposed three components external exposure innate sensitivity and recovery capacity in a region hong et al 2016 song et al 2010 consequently there is a lack of conceptual agreement about ecosystem vulnerability and factors that contribute to it but ecosystem vulnerability assessment encompasses a rangeland of activities having several stages thus due to the fact that scientific definitions vary widely amongst disciplines assessing the vulnerability of ecosystems is a complex undertaking so the current study is considered as the concept of pressure sensitivity and resilience which is intended to aid in assessing rangeland vulnerability or higher ecological levels 2 4 indicator s selection for eco vulnerability sensitivity resilience and pressure are all components of ecosystem vulnerability in particular regions due to the presence of an unstable frame structure and the system s inability to deal with it as a result it will demonstrate ecosystem resilience by continuing to evolve in the desired direction in the face of external interference and demonstrating sensitivity to external interference yang et al 2020 chen et al 2021 according to previous literature on ecosystem vulnerability assessment the central aravalli range possesses typical pressure sensitivity resilience psr characteristics kumar et al 2020 lv et al 2019 yadav et al 2018 as a result we concentrated on human interference incorporated a variety of environmental factors and attempted to develop an environmental vulnerability ev index system based on the composition and function of resource based design by utilising three components for the psr model fig 2 ecosystem pressure refers to the degree to which ecology is disrupted by external factors such as anthropogenic activity and output demands zou and yoshino 2017 ramachandra et al 2018 the degree of response of an ecosystem to pressure is determined by the system s environmental factors and is referred to as ecological sensitivity deb et al 2014 ecosystem resilience is defined as the capacity of a system to withstand disruption and reorganise itself during change while retaining essentially the same functions structures identities and feedback as before the disruption or change fang et al 2019 liu et al 2017 based on the literature survey about eco sensitivity and the bio geography and climatic variables of the study area a total of 17 indicators table 1 were chosen for the psr model variables are related to the topographical attributes geo climatic edaphic vegetation cover socio economic and human induced activities that may affect the susceptibility of an ecosystem and make it more vulnerable to external perturbations indicators including slope aspect elevation average temperature mean precipitation climate water deficit vegetation coverage biomass soil erodibility index land use land change gross domestic product population density mining zones ecotonal area urbanisation extent and road network were chosen to characterize sensitivity these indicators were chosen because they are widely available and easily adaptable to measuring the ev of the central aravalli region furthermore because the ecological environment incorporates human aspects it includes the environmental pressures imposed by economic and social activity these indicators were chosen because they are widely available and easily adaptable to the measurement of the ev in the central aravalli region additionally because the ecological environment encompasses human characteristics it encompasses the environmental pressures imposed by economic and social activity chen et al 2021 therefore the current study used a variety of indicators to develop a comprehensive model for assessing eco sensitive vulnerability 2 5 e psr ecosystem pressure sensitivity and resilience model 2 5 1 ecosystem pressure ecological pressure intensity is a measure of how exposed rangeland ecosystems are to external pressures and disturbances it is used to evaluate the influence of human activities and economic development on the local ecosystem to quantify the pressure in this study urban extent population growth gdp mining area agricultural activities and road network extension were selected chen et al 2021 liu et al 2017 ecosystem vulnerability is related to ecological pressure which means that more exposure makes an ecosystem more vulnerable 2 5 2 ecosystem sensitivity ecosystem sensitivity is a term that refers to the rangeland ecosystem s sensitivity to external stressors hruska et al 2017 its value can be used to quantify the ecological consequences of external stressors yang et al 2020 sensitivity to the environment is inextricably linked to local environmental issues indexes can be classified into four categories based on the ecosystem problems encountered in the study areas topographical and geomorphological geo climatic edaphic land cover and human induced activities at present the central aravalli rangeland s leading environmental problems are mining and land encroachment soil erosion and soil salinization yadav et al 2018 everard et al 2017 sharma et al 2012 natural disasters such as sand dust storms and desertification are primarily determined by the regional climate and biogeographical condition of the study area and thus the elevation slope and soil erosion indexes and land use classes were chosen to characterize ecological sensitivity for the rangeland ramachandra et al 2018 jin et al 2020 2 5 3 ecosystem resilience ecosystem resilience has risen in popularity and applicability considerably over the years as a result of its critical role in favourably impacting ecosystem vulnerability repairment morimoto and negishi 2019 it refers to an ecosystem s capacity to self regulate and self recover when disturbances from inside and outside do not surpass the elasticity of any rangeland ecosystem song et al 2010 qiao et al 2013 zhang et al 2021 the robustness of each component is dependant on its composition and structure as indices of ecological resilience we looked at net primary productivity a biological abundance index landscape diversity and protected forest area ecosystem resilience is inversely proportional to ecological fragility a greater level of resilience implies a lower level of vulnerability 2 6 land use land cover and biomass the current study analysed land use and land cover change in the year 2020 using the landsat 8 oli toa composite dataset this recommended solution makes use of the random forest supervised classification technique to determine the current lulc status of the google earth engine code editor platform gee x yan et al 2022 prior to image classification a sample of training data for seven classes must be precisely described waterbodies open forests dense forests an agricultural area barren land settlements and mining area however the most difficult and critical step in the supervised classification process is selecting data points for training the classifier later accuracy assessment is the most frequently used method for representing the accuracy of a classified lulc map by systematically comparing pixels or polygons to ground reference data the machine learning approach establishes the relationship between these two sets of data via overall accuracy which is composed of producer and user accuracy as shown in table 2 forest health indicators such as biomass demonstrate the forest s importance as a global carbon sink therefore the forest is regarded as the primary source of carbon sequestration as a result estimating forest biomass is critical for determining the amount of energy stored in trees and assessing climate change the central aravalli region s protected areas such as kumbhalgarh wls and todgarh raoli wls support medium sized trees 8 25 m sparse forests typically have less biomass than dense undisturbed forests or grassland this research used lidar gedi datasets and field data to evaluate the biomass of the region and aid with ground plot dataset using equation 2 for the year 2020 latifah et al 2021 1 agb 0 0673 x ρ d 2 h 0 976 where ρ is wood density d is tree girth diameter and h is tree hight 2 7 eco vulnerability index eco vi pre processing of each measure led to a calculation of an ecological vulnerability index eco vi the ecosystem vulnerability index eco vi is calculated after data standardisation yang et al 2020 national research council 2000 indicator weight calculation and eco vi computation 1 standardisation of data 2 1 positive trait s x i j x i j x j m i n x j max x j min 2 2 negative trait s x i j x j m a x x i j x j max x j min where x ij represents the standardized value of index j in grid cell i xij represents the actual value of index j in grid cell i and xj min xj max are the lowest and highest values respectively of index j of the study area 1 weightage matrix method for indicators an analytic hierarchy process ahp technique was used to generate the indicator weights the following are the major steps after speaking with experts create a pair of comparing scales between indicators construct a hierarchical structure model and generate measurable component ranking outcomes by judging and comparing significance degrees obtain a comparison judgement matrix evaluate the matrix for consistency and compute the weight of each evaluation standard the results of the test revealed that the consistency fulfilled the standards and that the indicator weights were accurate table 3 lists the weightages assigned to each variable of various themes considering the minimal impact on the landscape and also to prioritise conservation regions for future planning the weightages were assigned iteratively across the landscape with varied themes for a development solution and monitoring developing a weightage metric score analysis requires knowledge of multi disciplines termorshuizen and opdam 2009 and planning integrates the present and future needs in the landscape assigning weightages based on the relative significance of themes beinat 1997 provides a transparent mechanism for combining multiple data sets together to infer the significance the weightage is given by 3 eco vulnerability index j n w j x i j where evi is positive relation with vulnerability wj is the weight of the index j and n is the evaluation index number rangeland forest ecosystem pattern investigation is essential to understand the alteration in landscape dynamics due to change under anthropogenic disturbances land use land change analysis using remote sensing data was based on the forest cover proportion ramachandra et al 2018 land uses were assessed using remote sensing data analysis and grids were prioritised according to their forest cover percentage statistics on forest fragmentation are calculated according to a standard approach rama et al 2009 ramachandra et al 2018 2 8 weightage matrix decision method and sensitivity analysis ecosystem vulnerability assessment is a method for defining the eco sensitive zone in a rangeland ecosystem that will regulate strategic management and ecosystem services it is a complicated process that involves the interaction of the natural environment with human activity as a result of the literature review there is no unified framework for establishing an ecological vulnerability evaluation index due to the disparate definitions used across scientific disciplines the model of ecosystem pressure sensitivity resilience was used in this study to develop an evaluation index system by incorporating natural and human factors creating an evaluation index system for the study area ecology the degree to which the ecological system is susceptible to natural and human disturbance is known as environmental sensitivity instability leads to potential vulnerability at the ecosystem level of rangeland topographical characteristics climate vegetation cover and land use land change can all affect an ecosystem s susceptibility and make it more vulnerable to external perturbations zou et al 2021a as aforementioned to evaluate ecosystem vulnerability it is critical to assign a weight to each indicator the ahp determines the weight by constructing a judgement matrix using pair wise comparisons which heavily rely on the prior experience and knowledge of experts in calculating weight a certain amount of subjectivity is unavoidable zou et al 2021b the ecological environment s vulnerability is influenced more strongly by a greater weight the weight is calculated using the weight matrix method formula 4 1 h j j 1 n λ j k 2 j 1 16 k 1 n 4 2 w j h j j 1 17 h j j 1 16 hj denotes the common factor variance of each indicator wj denotes the index weight λ jk denotes the main component load matrix j denotes the index s ranking position k denotes the number of main components and m denotes the total number of main components this paper conducted a sensitivity analysis to ensure that the weights of each index are reasonable and to determine which indicators have the greatest potential impact on the results each index factor s sensitivity analysis was carried out one by one using the mutual test method of ms excel calculations the number of weights and the boundary 1 to 2 are set so that the initial value is 1 the step size is 0 125 and the other variables values are all set to 1 also shown are the weights of the 16 indicators that were subjected to a sensitivity analysis table 4 2 9 field investigations after conducting a comprehensive assessment of the literature and reviewing current studies on land use land change and biomass it was determined that ground truthing is a critical component of remote sensing while working in ecologically sensitive locations in contrast the aravalli hill rangeland has a distinctive topographical structure and encompasses over 23 001 km2 however substantial ground sampling needs adequate financial support and time as a result we used random sampling techniques to cover the entire region which is classified as vulnerable and environmentally sensitive as a result of its land use land change including waterbodies forest area open and dense agricultural land barren land settlement and mining area in 2020 and 2021 is shown in fig 3 the current study covered ecologically vulnerable regions of the central aravalli range with the majority of ground sampling points collected in settlements mining areas agricultural fields and forest land throughout ajmer and rajasmand districts as well as biomass sample plots collected in protected areas kumbhalgarh wls and todgarah raoli wls with each protected area taking 70 to 80 sample plots for biomass estimation whose measurement is 25 25 m as per required dataset 2 10 draft proposal for esz for conservation planning to determine the optimal size of then ecological sensitive zone esz surrounding the rangeland region all relevant factors were taken into account including forest cover physiography human occupation and the area s biodiversity characteristics although the central aravalli range is home to several ave s and butterfly species the proximity of the periphery touch thar desert and adjacent side gangetic plains has been considered a significant factor in determining the protected region s environmental status and its environs 3 results 3 1 eco vulnerability assessment of the central aravalli range the eco vulnerability analysis is based on the psr pressure state and response model developed by oced and other international organisations in 1994 this study evolved the psr model into the e psr ecological pressure sensitivity and resilience model based on a literature review and previous eco sensitivity assessments and monitoring of different locations chen et al 2021 yang et al 2020 liu et al 2017 li et al 2009 therefore current research assesses the ecosystem sensitivity based on the vulnerability status of the central aravalli range which is categorised into four classes eco sensitive area i eco sensitive area ii eco sensitive area iii and eco sensitive area iv as shown in fig 7 moreover this study used five theme indicators such as socio economic condition climatic condition topographical condition surface condition and human interference which are categorised under the e psr model and the weightage and ranking are specified based on the weightage matrix geostatistical approach explained in table 3 assaf and saadeh 2008 3 2 spatial distribution of ecosystem pressure ecosystem pressure is defined based on the socio economic status of the region the current study used population density and gross domestic product gdp of the central aravalli range in 2020 according to figs 4 a and b population density ranges between 425 and 7414 people km2 with 98 of the area falling under less than 425 people km2 and only cities with high population density having between 425 and 7414 people km2 in contrast population density weightage is defined as 1 to 10 based on their population density class with the lowest weightage having 98 area and the other 3 5 7 and 10 wt having 2 area of the study area figs 4c and d depict spatial gdp and its weightage in us dollars in 2020 the gdp of the central aravalli range reflects that 15 to 70 dollars which is categorised into five classes whereas less than 15 covers 97 4 of the area 16 30 covers 0 021 31 50 dollars covers 1 21 of the area 51 70 covers 1 76 and above 70 covers the remaining area whose weightage is defined as 1 3 5 7 and 10 respectively 3 3 spatial distribution of ecosystem sensitivity ecosystem sensitivity is the state of the study region that indicates the regularisation of services and functions of the landscape or ecosystem this research focused on the sensitivity of the central aravalli region at present based on the e psr model the sensitivity indicator is analysed based on such parameters as dem slope aspect temperature rainfall climate water deficit soil erosion index and biomass of the vegetation shown in fig 5 however land use and land cover classes appear in sensitivity and resilience indicators for eco vulnerability however figs 5a and b depict the topographical conditions whereas the dem value of the study area is between 275 and 1271 m which is classified into five classes and their weightage is assigned between 1 to 10 from low to high but figs 5c and d illustrate the aspect of the slopy region from 1 to 359 in five classes and their weightage is assigned corresponding 1 to 10 also figs 5e and f show that the slope range is between 0 61 3 with five categories and values ranging from 1 to 10 although figs 5g h i j k and l show the climatic conditions based on rainfall temperature and climate water deficit parameters while figs 5g and h depict rainfall values between 18 39 cm annually which are categorised into five classes figs 5i and j illustrate yearly temperature profiles of between 7 44 c which are classified into five classes as well as figs 5k and l show that climate water deficits comply with evapotranspiration rate and potential evapotranspiration which values between 700 1170 have been classified into five classes and their weightages are assigned corresponding classes from 1 to 10 respectively moreover figs 5m and n depict the soil erosion index which reflects the nature of soil and its health quality values from 0 to 5 have been categorised into five groups and their weightage is assigned as corresponding between 1 and 10 respectively and figs 5o and p show the urban extent of the central aravalli region in 2020 which is categorised into two classes 0 and 1 and their weightage is assigned as 0 to 10 respectively 3 4 ecosystem resilience resilience refers to an ecosystem s capacity to resume its normal nutrient cycle and biomass production after damage caused by an ecological disturbance its assessment is a robust process because it depends upon productivity and rangeland ecosystem processes however this research focused on assessing the environmental resilience of the central aravalli range based on its biomass developmental activities reserved areas and land cover as illustrated in fig 6 from figs 6a and b depicts the road network which includes national highways and state highways network and their weightage is 07 and figs 6c and d shows biomass having value 0 to 56 tonne hectare which is categorised into five classes and their weightage assigned according although the western part of the central aravalli range behaves as an ecotonal region it is always vulnerable to desertification due to its proximity to the thar desert with a weightage of 07 hence figs 6e and f show the protected regions of the central aravalli todgarh raoli wildlife sanctuary and kumbhalgarh wildlife sanctuary that cover almost 1100 km2 of the total the weightage assigned based on ecological condition is 10 from fig 6g land use land cover is one of the crucial parameters to assessing the eco sensitivity and vulnerability of any landscape its classes belong to the pressure group and resilience of the region as a result current studies determine based on their classes such as waterbodies dense forest open forest agricultural land and barren land whether they include resilience indicators but its two classes mining and settlement classes into the pressure group 3 5 spatial distribution traits of ecosystem vulnerability standardisation of data of ecological pressure sensitivity and resilience were evaluated cross ponding to their indicator weightages over the study area fig 1 and allocation of eco sensitive areas was obtained by the geo statistical weightage overlay matrix method which is shown in table 5 and figs 7 a b and c from table 5 illustrates the evaluation of the eco sensitive regions of the central aravalli range under the e psr model which is categorised into four levels such as low moderate high and very high for these indicators as a result pressure indicator classes such as low moderate high and very high have an area of 61 9 34 5 2 5 and 1 06 of the total and sensitivity indicator areas in their respective classes of low to very high 0 04 1 64 66 1 and 32 1 respectively in the resilience indicator classes which range from low to very high the figures are 2 73 64 18 33 03 and 0 05 respectively from figs 5 and 6 the eastern part of the central aravalli range corresponds to the barren land and high climate water deficit areas whereas the lower parts of the udaipur and pali dist have a low climate water deficit and dense forest cover and the temperature is lower than the rest of the range as well the eastern part of the study area has high settlement and mining activity 3 6 spatial zonation of eco sensitive areas above we analysed 17 parameters based on the e psr model using a geo statistical weightage matrix and an overlay approach to evaluate eco vulnerability besides categorising the study area in their eco sensitive areas however the central aravalli range is divided into four eco sensitive zones which have a value range between 0 to 1 such as eco sensitive area i eco sensitive area ii eco sensitive area iii and eco sensitive area iv based on ecological pressure sensitivity and resilience factors as shown in table 6 and fig 7 from table 6 it shows that eco sensitive i has vegetation cover and balanced ecosystems which are found in the upper westerly region which has a 4 1 area eco sensitive ii has forest and agricultural land that represent a slightly stable ecosystem and resistance mostly covering the eastern and upper regions with 62 5 of the total area eco sensitive iii has potentially vulnerable in nature having barren land and agricultural class with 32 2 of total area while eco sensitive iv is vulnerable to change having a mining area class unstable environment and a challenge to restore with 1 2 of total area 4 discussion eco sensitive assessment and zonation play a vast role in a developing country s ability to protect and conserve its natural resources and biodiversity from ecosystem to biome level vulnerability assessment study previously carried out mostly on biodiversity hotspots and expanding urban developmental areas using other methods such as fuzzy ahp and entropy integrated with a geo statistical approach however this study focused on the aravalli range one of the most sensitive regions on the indian continent because it acts as a desertification shield for eastern rajasthan and central india raj and sharma 2022 although it behaves like a natural green wall and ecotonal region it serves several ecosystem functions and services as well as is home to significant endemic biodiversity in section 3 we discuss the spatial distribution of ecological pressure sensitivity and resilience as well as the eco sensitive zonation as a result 61 9 of the area covered by pressure indicators falls under the low category 61 6 of the area covered by sensitivity indicators falls under the high category 64 18 of the area covered by resilience indicators falls under the moderate category and the remainder of the area falls under other categories of their indicators although classified eco sensitive zones based on the e psr model use several parameters discussed in section 2 which assign weightage ranges of four classes such as potential 0 122 0 3002 moderate 0 3002 0 4351 high 0 4351 0 5426 and very high 0 5426 0 8123 a study by yang et al 2020 on huaibei city china to assess spatial vulnerability in terms of intensive resource exploitation and rapid industrialisation using the psr model and various environmental parameters another study carried out by chen et al 2021 over the nile delta of egypt has accounted that micro and mild vulnerable area is 65 99 and pingtan s main island showed deterioration from west to east side continually ramachandra et al 2018 study was carried out in the central western ghat india which was classified into four eco sensitive areas i to iv having a spatially 52 38 in esr i 14 29 in esr ii 13 1 in esr iii and 20 23 in esr iv another study published by zhang et al 2017 on the yellow river delta based on the psr model has reported that its ecosystem vulnerability was 0 62 and 0 68 between 2010 and 2014 which comes under the moderate vulnerability class therefore eco sensitivity quality and status assessment and management are necessary to protect ecosystem services and their function although environmentalists and working authorities need to be concerned about their level of interference regulation and guidelines and better management plans are discussed below 4 1 interferences in the central aravalli range the affecting factors of ecosystems and the disturbances to their eco sensitivity measurements are very complex sometimes primely interferences or disturbance categories in anthropogenic and natural categories to the literature the central aravalli range has been impeded by denudation from several million years ago and its western edge is being affected by a slow desertification process habib et al 2017 raj and sharma 2022 however anthropogenic interference is more tragic than natural action in the study region karanth et al 2017 everard et al 2017 furthermore the central aravalli region ajmer nagaur pali and rajasmand districts is considered the lungs of central rajasthan and is still influenced by various human activities habib et al 2017 reported that based on conducted studies over 52 sites in the aravalli range have revealed that highways built over wildlife habitats have adversely impacted the fauna in these forests pananchikal 2018 rasik 2018 also around the kumbhalgarh wildlife sanctuary miners and land encroachers try to occupy it the central aravalli s demography increased by 60 in the last two decades affecting the sensitive area and conceiving human wildlife conflicts as well as the resilience s of the shock obsessed area robbins et al 2007 kapoor et al 2009 therefore the study area has experienced a variety of challenges ranging from illicit mining and building to deforestation and depletion of groundwater recharge zones not to mention human lynching s of wildlife s environmental sustainability has been given an undue preference over resource exploitation land grabbing and conscienceless profiteering 4 2 regulation for rangeland eco sensitive areas an eco sensitive area is a type of periphery around fragile protected areas that protect or absorb anthropogenic interference to maintain their ecosystem services and function naturally this region acts as a protective boundary layer to protect the area s flora and fauna as per the literature survey it is found that in the eco sensitive areas of india some activities are prohibited regulated and promoted as per their prior basis as shown in annexure 1 a however in the protected area mining urbanisation and industries setup have to be banned and regulated to ensure monitoring afforestation and forest disease control as well as permitting organic farming or needed farming water harvesting and road widening with wildlife passes according to the above findings roads need wildlife passes in kumbhalgarh and todgarh raoli wildlife sanctuaries which is a way to manage wildlife conflicts despite the fact that this region has arid climatic conditions and little rainfall it requires water harvesting and the preparation of small ponds and wetland areas in order to maintain ecological functions therefore the government related authorities and environmentalists need to be concerned over eco sensitive regions for their safeguard to maintain the resilience of the protected and wildlife corridors endemic species homes and ecologically fragile regions 4 3 required management plan ecosystem sensitive areas need proper management strategies to prevent ecological imbalances and regional climate change in recent decades urban development and settlement growth in the central aravalli range is immensely drury 1990 raj and sharma 2022 from land use land cover classes of the year 2020 the settlement area is around 7 of the total the central aravalli region is ecologically fragile and home to more than 300 bird species and 120 butterfly species as well as lots of endemic flora although wildlife sanctuary occupies the middle and lower region it requires proper monitoring with advanced technologies such as hyperspectral for disease detection lidar for canopy estimation and growth high resolution uavs sensed wildlife conflict illicit possession wildfire situation and ground survey furthermore forest managers and regulating authorities focused on protected area buffer zone endemic species afforestation also reduce the use of fertiliser for agricultural purposes limit the use of plastic in eco sensitive areas and avoid constructing dumping sites in eco sensitive areas 5 conclusion eco sensitivity zonation and vulnerability assessment play a critical role in ecosystem management and restoration on a spatial and temporal scale at present globally eco sensitive areas are concerned or tense due to the high rate of change in land use and land cover class in india approximately 23 of the land area is classified as forest which contains the majority of the biodiversity and provides ecosystem services however the entire aravalli which covers 90 of the forest cover of rajasthan state is divided into three zones upper middle central and lower this study focused on the central range for their eco sensitivity assessment and zonation of their sensitive area for their conservation planning current research provides a distinct outlook assessment of vulnerable eco regions and measures selection regarding their role in assessment eco sensitivity zonation mapping and in management strategies contemporaries assessment in some of the studies indices were defined arbitrarily even though this study determines the indicators that were as per the oecd organisation climatology and topographical variability eco sensitivity is a fragile land areas near protected zones and ecological corridors regions which act as shock absorbers or provide high protection for ecologically dedicated protected or reserved areas therefore it assesses the levels of vulnerability of the central aravalli region in 2020 5 1 advances of study this study spatially highlights the zonation of eco sensitive areas of the central aravalli range using various themes ecology surface condition climatic conditions topographical condition and socioeconomic conditions that aid the e psr model in assessing vulnerabilities traits using a weightage ranking matrix and geostatistical approach to examine the ecological vulnerability range of 0 to 1 therefore this research evaluates spatially ecological pressure ecological sensitivity state and ecological resilience of the study area and these indicators are categorised into four classes low moderate high and very high and their combined weightage assesses eco sensitive zones into four zones eco sensitive area i eco sensitive area ii eco sensitive area iii and eco sensitive area iv having an area of 4 1 62 5 32 3 and 1 2 respectively hence these eco sensitive areas have different characteristics based on the environmental stability of the aravalli range they are low ecologically stable highly resistant and capable of recovering from outside interferences potential potentially ecologically stable low resistant and resist to self recovery moderate slightly ecologically unstable impeded function and ineligible for self recovery and high high intrusion of anthropogenic action need of restoration and management strategies at different levels from the above study we conclude that in eco sensitive regions some regulation guidelines are required which are recommended in annexure 1 b which will help the authorities in the formation of eco sensitive guidelines policies and regulations in the future 5 2 limitation of the current study inclusively this study applied an integrated e psr model with geo statistical approaches to the indicators roles and their weightages appropriate geo statistical mapping and zonation of eco sensitive areas over the central aravalli range should be discussed in this study thoroughly still due to the unavailability of some parameters or indices data of the study region such as biodiversity index landscape indices air pollution data wind speed and species richness it could not be implemented suitably over the central aravalli range the national authorities and scientific communities were unconcerned regarding their urban expansion mining activities and research facilities related to endemic vegetative species safeguarding and environmental change therefore it caused a lacuna in time series monitoring records of land use biomass and socio economic factors consequently this study used different resolution datasets between 30 m to 4000 m and from different sources discussed in section 2 to analyse vulnerability propensity towards an eco sensitive region 5 3 future scope of the study the lucrative and efficiently viable methodology developed is a generic one that can be applied to the above ecosystem at biome levels of the ecological organisation hence the improved interconnected approach is reiterated in any region where land is eco sensitive and vulnerable to environmental conditions the issue related to eco sensitivity tries to combine approaches to address primacy the forthcoming opportunity of this study is to advance an inclusive eco sensitivity management strategy using apposite indicators and apply an advanced modelling approach with parameters for future condition prediction continual monitoring and evaluation need an effective approach to conserve eco sensitive regions as shock absorber for human intervention this may potentially result in future participation in climate change adaptation and management practices using more advanced spatial technologies lidar sar and hyperspectral therefore this study may become a milestone for future studies in the central aravalli region the scientific community and government need to apply a management and regulation strategy to preserve ecology and biodiversity in the future as well credit authorship contribution statement alok raj methodology and study framing draft writing and analysis laxmi kant

24229,this study used pattern oriented modelling pom to investigate the space use and behavioural response of upstream migrating european river lamprey lampetra fluviatilis to the two dimensional hydrodynamic conditions created by an instream structure triangular profile gauging weir passive integrated transponder pit and acoustic telemetry were used to map the spatial temporal distribution patterns of lamprey as they migrated upstream acoustic doppler velocimetry and computer modelling were used to quantify the hydrodynamic environment in adherence with the pom methodology multiple movement models incorporating increasingly complex environmental feedback mechanisms and behavioural rules were created and systematically assessed to identify which factors might reproduce the observed patterns the best model was a spatially explicit eulerian lagrangian individual based model ibm that included two simple behaviours 1 tortuous non directed swimming when in low flow velocity 0 1 m s 1 and 2 persistent directed against the flow swimming in moderate to high flow velocity 0 1 m s 1 the pom indicated that flow heterogeneity was an important influence of lamprey space use and that simple behavioural rules i e two separate movement behaviours in response to flow velocity were sufficient to reproduce the main movement pattern observed avoidance of flow recirculating regions near the banks the combination of field telemetry hydrodynamic modelling and pom provided a useful framework for systematically identifying the key factors hydrodynamic and behavioural that governed the space use of the target species and would likely work well for investigating similar relationships in other aquatic species keywords lamprey hydropower telemetry fish passage individual based

influenced by a combination of multiple factors acting simultaneously such as motivational status kemp 2016b goerig and castro santos 2017 habituation raderschall et al 2011 finger et al 2016 and prior experience riotte lambert and matthiopoulos 2020 animals also switch between multiple movement modes in accordance with their broad scale ecological needs e g feeding or reproducing or fine scale environmental covariates e g habitat type or predator density gurarie et al 2009 second movement data tend to be temporally autocorrelated which makes identifying the importance of predictor variables e g flow velocity flow direction depth and channel geometry difficult with standard statistical hypothesis testing dray et al 2010 autocorrelation is often an intrinsic property of biological data and although there are ways to eliminate its effects by restricting data prior to analysis this can reduce the relevance of ecological studies dray et al 2010 designing effective environmental impact mitigation measures requires improved knowledge of how fish respond to hydrodynamics in addition to the advancement of appropriate tools to evaluate this complex relationship kemp 2012 individual based models ibms provide a useful tool for investigating fish response to complex flow fields movement is typically modelled as iterative steps to account for temporal autocorrelation

increasingly used to study fluvial ecology e g gao et al 2016 snyder et al 2019 padgett et al 2020 morrice et al 2020 likely because advances in computer technology have permitted the generation and implementation of high resolution hydrodynamic data at scales that are biologically relevant for decision making in aquatic organisms in addition ibms allow for population level effects of individual

is a need to better understand how behaviour and flow influence their movement patterns around anthropogenic river structures to address this this study used pom to investigate the hydrodynamic factors and behaviours that govern the space use of an at risk species the european river lamprey as they approached a triangular profile gauging weir specifically we quantified 1 the movement patterns of lamprey as they approached the gauging weir using acoustic and passive integrated transponder pit telemetry and 2 the hydrodynamic environment encountered using acoustic doppler velocimetry and computer modelling by integrating the biological and hydrodynamic data obtained we were able to 3 develop several spatially explicit ibms that could be used to systematically assess which hydrodynamic factors and swimming behaviours were required to reproduce the movement patterns of river lamprey observed in the field this study is both the first to track the fine scale spatial temporal 1 m 1 hz respectively movement patterns of river lamprey during their upstream spawning migration and to use ibms to systematically assess what hydrodynamic and behavioural factors are influencing their space use the results present a significant step forward in our knowledge on the movement ecology of this species and the methods used represent a useful framework for investigating similar relationships in other aquatic animals 2 methodology 2 1 study site the study site latitude 54 018884 longitude 0 88532951 wgs84 was located on the river derwent a tributary of the yorkshire ouse northeast england and encompassed a triangular profile gauging weir crump design 20 m wide micro hydroelectric power station and the downstream river reach 0 52 river kilometres rkm longitudinal distance along the river centreline fig 1 the crump weir a common type of gauging weir in the uk ireland and more widely in europe has a standard triangular profile 1 2 upstream and 1 5 downstream slopes and at a flow exceedance value of q95 has a head loss of 1 31 m and a discharge of 2 78 m3 s 1 a 15 gradient super active baffle technical fish pass length 11 2 m internal width 2 75 m is located on the true right side of the weir fig 1 the hydropower station is located on the right bank and consists of two horizontally installed kaplan turbines nominal power output 50 kw per turbine fig 1 during the study period 8 november to 20 december 2017 discharge at the site ranged from 10 4 to 52 3 m3 s 1 mean 26 6 m3 s 1 2 2 movement patterns 2 2 1 field telemetry to track the two dimensional movement of lamprey eight acoustic hydrophones hti 590 series 307 khz were installed between 0 035 and 0 085 rkm downstream of the weir fig 1 positioning of the hydrophones at mid water depth on weighted vertical lines suspended from catenary ropes that spanned the width of the river fig 1 table s1 ensured that a test tag placed randomly within the array was detected by at least three receivers at all times placement of the array closer to the weir was not possible due to rapid attenuation of sound caused by high levels of air entrainment three dimensional positioning was not possible because an undulating bathymetry and shallow water depth in key locations inhibited acoustic signal propagation the hydrophones were connected to a model 290 hti acoustic tag receiver sample rate 12 khz and a survey laptop running hti acoustictag data acquisition software six pit antennas were also installed on or near the weir to determine which routes the lamprey used as they attempted to pass upstream pit antennas function by generating a localised electromagnetic field which energises nearby tags causing them to transmit a unique identification code which is logged by a receiver the antennas at the study site consisted of two pass through type antennas one in the tailrace and one at the downstream entrance of the fish pass and two pairs of flat bed antennas at the foot of the weir each pair covering a 2 m wide zone adjacent to the true right and left wing wall fig 1 the antennas on the weir were the right bank bankside rbb right bank mid channel rbm left bank mid channel lbm and left bank bankside lbb fig 1 the rbm antenna was located at the foot of a 1 m wide channel of studded tiles that were installed to aid lamprey passage tummers et al 2018 the central 16 m of the weir was not instrumented the acoustic and pit telemetry equipment was operational at the site from 8 november to 7 december 2017 30 days 2 2 2 lamprey capture and tagging river lamprey were trapped near the tidal limit of the ouse latitude 53 880002 longitude 1 1001047 and at 53 885945 1 0959495 wgs84 using double compartment two funnel eel pots masters et al 2006 fishing on the riverbed over eight sessions between 8 29 november 2017 34 lamprey 380 mm total length were collected transported to site tagged and released at the downstream extent of the study area fig 1 table s2 previous studies indicate that lamprey captured tagged and released in this way are from the same genetic population bracken et al 2015 and exhibit a consistent upstream directed migration tendency lucas et al 2009 tummers et al 2016b 2018 each lamprey was tagged intracoelomically with a 3 65 mm diameter 32 mm long hdx pit tag texas instruments model ri trp rrhp 134 2 khz weight 0 8 g in air and a 6 8 mm diameter 20 mm long acoustic transmitter htisonar model 795 ld 307 khz weight 1 05 g in air acoustic transmitters were programmed to emit single acoustic pulses with a variable pulse interval used to identify each tag 881 1182 ms lamprey moved upstream through the hydrophone array and approached the weir under a wide range of river flows 11 1 46 4 m3 s 1 due to a transcription error pit tag data for one lamprey was unavailable all fish handling and tagging was conducted in compliance with uk home office licence number ppl 70 8720 following the animals scientific procedures act 1986 see tummers et al 2018 for further details on lamprey capture tagging and pit telemetry 2 2 3 telemetry data processing acoustic telemetry data were processed using custom software written in matlab r2017a mathworks tag positioning was undertaken in two stages 1 an initial estimate of tag position was calculated based on time difference of arrival tdoa of the signal between the three nearest hydrophones intersection of hyperbola and these positions were used to estimate the time each pulse was emitted from the tag regression analysis 2 time of arrival toa the difference in signal transmit and receive time for the three nearest hydrophones was used to calculate the final tag location intersection of circles tdoa and toa both produce multiple intersections reflecting both real and false potential detection locations at each time step during stage one and two the clustered data points that most likely represented the real lamprey position were manually selected and averaged as the focus of this study was to assess the movement dynamics of naïve lamprey as they approached a barrier only their first upstream transit through the hydrophone array was tracked to measure the spatial accuracy of the acoustic telemetry hardware and software a transmitter pulse interval 1000 ms was attached to a radio controlled survey boat arcboat equipped with a high precision global positioning system see section 2 3 for further details and repeatedly driven through the hydrophone array tag run tag runs were used to train the data analyst in the correct identification of real and false detection locations during tag positioning the spatial accuracy of the system was validated by blind processing five randomly selected tag runs through the array 887 data points in total this process revealed a median and maximum tracking error of 0 83 and 2 20 m respectively the location and time of first detection at the weir for each lamprey was extracted from the raw pit telemetry data 2 2 4 analysis of movement patterns lamprey frequently held station station holding behaviour within the array for long periods the frequency and duration that lamprey held station was quantified from the tracks as periods where they displayed cumulatively less lateral and longitudinal movement than the median acoustic tracking error 0 83 m for 30 s transit time through the study area was subdivided into the duration 1 between release and detection at the hydrophone array 2 to pass through the array and 3 between last acoustic detection and first pit detection lamprey lateral position across the channel was quantitatively assessed at seven transects t1 7 spaced 10 m apart along the river centreline oriented perpendicular to the primary flow direction fig 1 the area between the most up and downstream transect conservatively spanned the domain in which it was possible to accurately position acoustic telemetry the lamprey as they moved upstream randomisation tests manly 2007 holbrook et al 2015 were used to determine if lamprey lateral distribution was non random at each transect first a random distribution r of locations was generated along each transect to account for variable downstream water level during the study period r for each transect was calculated by generating 1000 random intersect locations for each channel width available to each lamprey as it transited upstream with all locations then aggregated second the deviation between r and the observed distribution of lamprey l at each transect was established dr l eq 1 by binning each distribution r and l into 10 equidistant bins and averaging the absolute difference between the proportion of l and r that occurred in each bin i pri and pli respectively 1 d r l p r i p l i 10 third multiple n 1000 subsamples rs number of positions per subsample equivalent to the observed number of lamprey were randomly extracted from r and the deviation between rs and r dr rs was calculated in the same way as between r and l eq 1 finally a p value was calculated as the proportion of dr rs that were higher than dr l for the randomisation tests the p value is a measure of the strength of evidence that lamprey lateral distribution was non random where p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 10 and p 0 10 indicated strong moderate weak and no evidence respectively 2 3 hydrodynamic environment water velocity and bed elevation were measured downstream of the weir under mean flow conditions discharge 27 9 m3 s 1 using a radio controlled survey boat arcboat l x w 1 95 0 72 m equipped with a sontek riversurveyor m9 acoustic doppler current profiler adcp and integrated leica viva gs14 global navigation satellite system horizontal position accuracy 8 mm 0 5 ppm raw adcp data were processed using riversurveyor v4 0 sontek to provide depth and velocity in three dimensions x y and z near the bed surface and mid column velocity magnitude was calculated from the three dimensional flow vectors and averaged mean over all depths to produce depth averaged velocity and direction given the lack of knowledge about the vertical distribution of lamprey at the study site depth averaged velocity was deemed to be the best approximation of the flow conditions they experienced bed elevation data were combined with wetted width bank half full and bank full measurements n 493 obtained using the leica viva gs14 attached to a 1 8 m survey pole and linearly interpolated to produce a digital elevation model dem for the river channel downstream of the weir weir fish pass and hydropower discharge and up and downstream water level at the site were recorded at 15 minute intervals tummers et al 2018 flow regimes experienced by the lamprey at times other than at mean discharge were modelled under nine conditions using five flows 11 1 19 9 28 8 37 6 and 46 4 m3 s 1 hydrodynamic model hm1 5 respectively with the hydropower turbines either turned on or off e g hm1 on and hm1 off table s3 no turbine on condition was needed for model hm5 as the head difference was low at this discharge and the hydropower station was not operational the software used to model the hydrodynamics was telemac 2d which is a module of the open source telemac mascaret modelling suite www opentelemac org it is acknowledged that there may have been significant vertical variation in flow at the study site but the lack of knowledge about lamprey distribution in this plane negated any potential benefits of undertaking more complex three dimensional hydrodynamic modelling the assumption of a two dimensional environment is common in aquatic movement ibms tan et al 2018 brosnan and welch 2020 dye et al 2022 and despite limitations can provide valuable insight into animal movement patterns the model geometry which consisted of an unstructured triangular mesh was constructed using data derived from engineering drawings of the weir infrastructure and using the downstream channel dem fig 1 model boundary conditions were parameterised using a constant value of water level at the downstream boundary and a constant discharge over the weir and through the fish pass and hydropower station the individual discharge values used at each inflow boundary e g through the fish pass were derived from their measured relationship with total discharge when the turbines were either on or off linear regression figure s1 table s3 each of the nine hydrodynamic simulations were run with a computational timestep of 0 01 s and to ensure model stability the boundary conditions were applied gradually by linearly ramping the upstream boundary discharge from zero over a period of 12 h the modelled hydrodynamic conditions were calibrated by comparing the output of model hm3 off closest to mean discharge with the adcp data and the bed friction values of the model adjusted so that the gradient of the correlation between modelled and measured velocity closely matched figure s2 a spatially uniform manning bed friction coefficient with a value of 0 045 m1 3 s 1 was found to provide the best comparison hm3 off produced comparable spatial flow patterns to those measured figure s3 and the root mean square error between the modelled and measured velocity along the reach was relatively low 0 19 m s 1 figure s2 2 4 pattern oriented modelling pom in this study pom was used to identify the key hydrodynamic factors and fish behaviours that govern the movement patterns of upstream migrating lamprey as they approached an instream barrier the pom approach involves the testing of multiple models of increasing complexity including at least one null model that is unrealistically simple grimm and railsback 2012 the reductionist process aims to derive the simplest model required to explain the movement patterns observed incorporating only entities variables and processes that are absolutely essential grimm and railsback 2012 in this study pom was achieved by 1 identifying potentially important movement behaviours from the telemetry data obtained 2 formulating multiple hypothetical movement models of increasing complexity based on the behaviours identified 3 assessing each model s ability to reproduce the observed patterns model performance and 4 validating the model s that performed best each of these processes are explained in detail in sections 2 4 1 to 2 4 4 2 4 1 identifying movement behaviour understanding of space use by riverine fish tends to reflect an interest in the relationship with flow e g goodwin et al 2014 kerr et al 2016 lamprey however exhibit quite different morphological and behavioural characteristics to many other fluvial species for example they lack paired fins that aid stability and hold position in challenging flows e g turbulent and high velocities by attaching to hard surfaces with their oral disc kemp et al 2009 kerr et al 2015 as a result the relative importance of hydrodynamics compared to other variables such as thigmotactic cues keefer et al 2011 kemp et al 2011 holbrook et al 2015 remains difficult to ascertain to identify the relative importance of hydrodynamics lamprey movement models were created that were both independent and dependant of flow see section 2 4 2 to parameterise these models lamprey movement behaviour was quantified from the acoustic telemetry lamprey tracks both independent ground speed gspeed and direction gdir and dependant swim speed sspeed and direction sdir of the hydrodynamic environment experienced assessment of movement behaviours for model parameterisation was undertaken using half of the acoustic telemetry tracks parameterisation lamprey n 16 with the remainder used later to provide a within site validation of the model validation lamprey n 15 gspeed m s 1 and gdir at each time step were calculated as 2 g speed x t x t 1 2 y t y t 1 2 δ t 3 g dir atan 2 x t x t 1 y t y t 1 where x and y are the cartesian coordinates at time t and atan2 is the four quadrant inverse tangent in degrees 180 180 a rotation was then applied so that gdir was relative to the course of the river upstream direction which was calculated as the tangential angle of the river centreline at the point closest to the lamprey at that time step sspeed m s 1 and sdir were calculated as 4 s s p e e d s u t 2 s v t 2 5 s d i r a t a n 2 s u t s v t where su and sv are the swim speeds m s 1 in x and y extracted at each time step from each lamprey track as 6 s u t x t 1 x t t f u x t y t 7 s v t y t 1 y t t f v x t y t where fu and fv are the flow velocities m s 1 in x and y at x and y interpolated from the hydrodynamic model with the most appropriate discharge and turbine condition probability distributions were fitted to the movement variables gspeed gdir sspeed and sdir through assessment of log likelihood scores to assess whether lamprey movement was temporally autocorrelated probability distributions of the difference between gspeed gdir sspeed and sdir between time steps were also evaluated e g eq 8 8 g spee ddiff g speed t g speed t 1 the relationships between sspeed and sdir and depth averaged flow speed fspeed and direction fdir were investigated using regression analysis broadscale trends in space use in relation to flow velocity and depth within the study area were evaluated using preference curves pv and pd respectively preference p was calculated as p u a where u and a are histograms of space used and space available respectively the histograms were constructed by calculating the normalised frequency of u and v in the study area between t1 and t7 fig 1 for increments 30 equally distributed bins of either velocity or depth for each lamprey available velocity and depth consisted of all the data from the dem water level corrected and from the most appropriate nearest discharge and turbine condition hydrodynamic model respectively used velocity and depth was the interpolated values at each tracked lamprey position from the dem and hydrodynamic models respectively final preference curves were calculated as the mean and bootstrapped n 1000 confidence intervals 95 of p for all individuals for each increment of the frequency distributions when calculating preference as the quotient of use and availability a fundamental assumption is that an organism has access to and knowledge of all space available to it which is often not the case beyer et al 2010 it is acknowledged that preference metrics which account for space sampled are superior to those merely based on availability see kerr et al 2016 in this study availability based curves enabled efficient identification of broadscale distribution patterns relative to environmental variables and facilitated the generation of movement hypotheses that were later tested and validated as part of the pom process 2 4 2 movement models seven hypothetical movement models were formulated to predict the spatial temporal distribution of upstream migrating river lamprey these included four base level movement models of increasing complexity model 1 uniform spatial temporal distribution the null model model 2 flow independent random walk model 3 flow independent correlated random walk and model 4 flow dependant correlated random walk eulerian lagrangian model in addition the following three behavioural adaptations were made to the fourth model avoidance of either a shallow areas b slow flow areas or c shallow slow flow areas model 4a c respectively model 1 was a statistical model for which a uniform spatial and temporal distribution of lamprey was assumed table 1 and was formulated because the pom process requires inclusion of a simplistic null model against which to compare later models models 2 4c were spatially explicit ibms in which agents moved through a hypothetical 2 dimensional domain representing the 0 52 rkm of channel downstream of the weir table 1 agent movement in models 2 4 was incorporated in different ways with later models being more complex for example in models 2 and 3 movement behaviour was independent of local hydrodynamics and took the form of an uncorrelated and correlated random walk respectively table 1 models 2 and 3 were formulated to test whether adequate model fit could be achieved without using any hydrodynamics data i e to ascertain whether lamprey movement might be independent of the flow field model 4 was a coupled eulerian lagrangian model in which agents were advected downstream with the flow and movement was the result of swim and flow speed and direction in two dimensions table 1 model 4 was formulated to test how important local hydrodynamics are for governing lamprey movement the addition of extra movement behaviours in models 4a c e g addition of avoidance of shallow and or slow flow regions increased model complexity further but enabled systematic testing of each behaviour in relation to the base model model 4 models 2 4c had a timestep of 1 second and were parameterised using the data generated in section 2 4 1 for models 2 4c agents were released into the model at the downstream extent of the domain fig 1 and movement occurred at each time step according to user defined rules agents were kept within the domain boundaries through checks that occurred at each time step if the agent s next movement was determined to place it outside of the model boundary then a hypothetical selection of twenty alternative movement locations were generated that fell on the perimeter of a circle centred on the last movement position and with a radius r equal to current step length of these hypothetical points the one that was closest to the erroneous position that was within and did not cross the model boundary was selected as the new movement location this method enabled continuation of the agent s movement in a direction similar to its intended movement direction and maintained the predetermined movement distance for that time step benson et al 2021 station holding was implemented into models 2 4c by assigning a probability psh 0 00299 that each agent would exhibit this behaviour at each time step psh was calculated as 9 p s h 1 1 n s h n 1 μ t l where nsh is the number of lamprey that held station n is the number of lamprey observed and μtl is the mean tracking duration when initiated the agent held station for a set number of time steps randomly assigned from a distribution logistic µ 17 8 σ 28 1 truncation 0 801 fitted to the empirical data figure s4 turbulence was simulated in model 4 and sub models by randomly varying fu and fv by a factor of r n f u 0 2 and r n f v 0 2 respectively where r x is a random number from the distribution x and n μ σ is a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ agents were removed from the model if they crossed user selected detection lines set at the pit antenna locations and at the crest of the fish pass and weir fig 1 as such agents were removed from the model if they were detected by a pit antenna or if they passed upstream changing flow conditions e g discharge and water depth during the study period figure s5 were accounted for in models 2 4c by weighting the number of agents released in each hydrodynamic model one thousand agents were released per lamprey which provided an appropriate balance between limiting model run time and ensuring emergent patterns were fully resolved i e sufficient replicates to overcome model stochasticity for example for the parameterisation lamprey the number of agents that best represented the different flow conditions experienced matching turbine condition and nearest discharge was 4000 5000 2000 3000 and 2000 released using the hm1 off hm1 on hm2 on hm4 off and hm5 off hydrodynamic model data respectively 16 000 in total this process resulted in the proportion of agents and lamprey that experienced different flow conditions being comparable when assessing the results against the validation or all lamprey the models were rerun with the appropriate number of agents to ensure comparability further details for each model are provided in the subsections below for the ibms models 2 4c model processes are summarised in a flow chart in fig 2 2 4 2 1 model 1 uniform spatial temporal distribution model 1 was a statistical model for which a uniform spatial and temporal distribution of lamprey was assumed to account for the variable channel width throughout the study period and to ensure that the assumed distribution was comparable to that observed a uniform lateral distribution at each transect t1 t7 was calculated for the wetted width available to each lamprey as they migrated upstream extrapolated from the dem and downstream water level and the results aggregated i e a weighted uniform distribution the time taken for agents to transit through the hydrophone array and their first pit detection locations were assumed to be uniformly distributed with no weighting applied 2 4 2 2 model 2 flow independent random walk model 2 was a biased random walk model e g codling et al 2008 in which agents moved through the domain independent of the hydrodynamic environment the agents were guided by river geometry course of the river extracted from the centreline with values of ground speed and direction at each timestep randomly allocated from the observed probability distributions of each pd gspeed and pd gdir respectively table 2 figure s6 movement in x and y at each timestep t was calculated as 10 x t x t 1 c o s r p d g d i r r p d g s p e e d t 11 y t y t 1 s i n r p d g d i r r p d g s p e e d t 2 4 2 3 model 3 flow independent correlated random walk model 3 was similar to model 2 in that agents moved through the domain independent of the hydrodynamic environment however movement gspeed and gdir at each time step was temporally autocorrelated initial agent gspeed and gdir values were randomly selected from the pd gspeed and pd gdir distributions table 2 figure s6 as per for model 2 subsequent gspeed and gdir values were assigned to agents as 12 g s p e e d t g s p e e d t 1 r p d g s p e e d d i f f 13 g d i r t g d i r t 1 r p d g d i r d i f f where pd gspeeddiff and pd gdirdiff are the probability distributions of observed difference in either gspeed or gdir between each time step respectively table 2 figure s6 to keep the agents moving at an appropriate speed and heading in the correct direction current gspeed and gdir values were periodically assessed against a randomly selected value from the observed probability distributions of each guidance values table 2 whether the current value was greater or lesser than the guidance value determined if the change in the movement parameter for that time step was subtracted or added respectively gspeed eq 14 gdir eq 15 14 g s p e e d t r p d g s p e e d g s p e e d t g s p e e d t 1 r p d g s p e e d d i f f g s p e e d t r p d g s p e e d g s p e e d t g s p e e d t 1 r p d g s p e e d d i f f 15 g d i r t r p d

followed the pd gspeeddiff and pd gdirdiff distributions and the direction of change was periodically adjusted to guide fish in accordance with the pd gspeed and pd gdir distributions as applying guidance every time step resulted in overly persistent agent movement paths the probability that it was applied pspeed and pdir for gspeed and gdir respectively was iteratively adjusted until agent movement distance and direction distributions matched those observed pdist 0 94 pdir 0 75 2 4 2 4 model 4 flow dependant correlated random walk in model 4 agent movement was dependant on hydrodynamics and the result of both swim and flow speed and direction in two dimensions that is agents had to actively swim against the flow to hold position or make progress upstream two different swimming behaviours in response to flow velocity were identified from assessment of the telemetry and hydrodynamic data fig 3 a and incorporated in model 4 these were 1 low flow swimming fspeed 0 1 m s 1 and 2 moderate to high flow swimming fspeed 0 1 m s 1 behaviours during low flow swimming fspeed 0 1 m s 1 swim direction was independent of flow direction and movement paths were relatively tortuous figure s7 during moderate to high flow swimming fspeed 0 1 m s 1 lamprey tended to swim against the flow swim speed was correlated with flow velocity and movement was more persistent figure s8 movement dynamics e g sspeed and sdir within model 4 were calculated in the same way for both the low flow and moderate to high flow swimming behaviours but values were randomly drawn from different probability distributions e g pd lf sspeed and pd mhf sspeed respectively table 2 guidance to keep the agents following observed swim speed and direction distributions was applied in the similar way as in model 3 with the same probability of guidance at each time step pspeed 0 94 pdir 0 75 initial sspeed and sdir values were randomly selected from the observed pd sspeed and pd sdir distributions table 2 the best distribution fit for the pd lf sdir and pd mhf sdir data occurred when absolute values were used hence the distribution is limited to between 0 and 180 in table 2 when required values generated using these distributions were multiplied by either 1 or 1 randomly selected to enable a full range of possible turn angles i e final distribution truncation 180 180 subsequent sdir values were assigned to agents as 16 s d i r t r p d s d i r s d i r t s d i r t 1 r p d s d i r d i f f s d i r t r p d s d i r s d i r t s d i r t 1 r p d s d i r d i f f to account for a linear

assessment of the depth and velocity preference curves for the parameterisation lamprey indicated that they moved through shallow and slow flow regions less frequently than expected if their distribution had been uniform throughout the study area figure s9 to evaluate whether avoidance of these regions might be influencing space use three additional movement behaviours were added to model

typically resulted in them spending less time in such areas 2 4 3 model performance the accuracy with which each of the seven models predicted the observed patterns exhibited by the parameterisation lamprey was quantified in terms of the mean absolute difference between simulated and empirical probability distributions this was achieved using three distributions 1 lamprey lateral position across the river at each of the seven perpendicular transects lateral deviation 2 upstream passage time between transect t1 and t7 temporal deviation and 3 location of first pit detection pit deviation for each deviation score lateral temporal and pit the probability distributions were standardised to ensure comparability between observed and modelled data for lateral deviation 10 equally spaced bins of normalised lateral position 0 to 1 from left to right bank along each transect widest wetted width available were used for temporal deviation 10 equally spaced bins between zero and the maximum time seconds taken for a lamprey to pass through the hydrophone array excluding outliers 2000 s were used for pit deviation eight sampling locations were used 1 6 the first pit detection location after passing upstream through the acoustic array tr fp rbb rbm lbm or lbb 7 passed upstream and 8 not detected raw and normalised lateral temporal and pit deviation scores were calculated for each model 1 4c and ranked normalised scores were calculated relative to the null model 0 and the best performing model 1 with models that performed worse than the null model attributed negative values combined overall model predictive performance was assessed as the normalised and ranked mean of the lateral temporal and pit deviation scores 2 4 4 model validation models were validated by assessing their ability to predict the spatial temporal distribution of the validation lamprey n 15 telemetry tracks that had been excluded from the parameterisation process as sample size for parameterisation and validation were similar the deviation scores generated from the models were comparable a final assessment of the best model s was undertaken by comparing the percentage error deviation score 100 in the predicted lateral temporal and pit distributions compared to the null model model 1 uniform spatial temporal and pit distribution for all lamprey telemetry tracks n 31 3 results 3 1 movement patterns of the 34 tagged lamprey released 32 were detected and 31 progressed upstream through the acoustic array the median time taken to reach the array after release was 78 2 min range 26 1 min 10

random at t2 and t3 p 0 05 fig 4 during their first upstream transit most lamprey held station at least once median frequency 1 range 0 17 for a median duration of 1 3 min range 30 s 10 1 days after passing upstream through the array for the first time 53 of lamprey n 16 were next detected at one of the pit antennas fig 4a for these the median duration between last acoustic and first pit detection was 10 7 min range 0 4 51 8 min the remaining lamprey 47 transited back into or progressed downstream beyond the array prior to detection at one of the pit antennas first pit detections for all pit tagged lamprey that passed upstream through the array n 30 predominantly occurred at the bottom of the fish pass 50 or within the hydropower tailrace 47 fig 4a 3 2 hydrodynamic environment mean wetted width velocity and depth respectively ranged from 23 4 to 31 8 m 0 34 to 0 46 m s 1 and 0 9 to 2 3 m between low 11 1 m3 s 1 and high 46 4 m3 s 1 discharge fig 5 a and b respectively hydrodynamic conditions varied considerably between transects fig 5 t1 7 e g at 11 1 m3 s 1 mean velocity was highest at t5 0 60 m s 1 range 0 04 0 88 and lowest at t2 0 14 m s 1 range 0 01 0 38 fig 5

t4 and t6 or both t2 banks fig 5 t1 7 at t2 and t3 the transects at which lamprey distribution was non random flow recirculation accounted for more than 30 of the channel width fig 5 t2 t3 areas of recirculation occurred at all discharges particularly near the right bank at t2 and t3 fig 5 3 3 pattern oriented modelling pom out of the base models model 4 and model 2 were the best and worst predictors of lamprey lateral distribution respectively figs 6 and 7 table 3 movement trajectories of agents produced by model 2 fig 6a were more persistent than those observed fig 4a and as the agents migrated upstream around each bend they tended to aggregate resulting in an uneven distribution across the channel fig 7 lateral distributions produced in model 4 matched those of lamprey well fig 7 resulting in the lowest deviation score for the base models table 3 the addition of avoidance behaviours in model 4a and model 4b resulted in poorer prediction of lateral distributions than the base model alone table 3 model 4c which included avoidance of shallow slow flow regions was the best model overall for predicting lateral distribution of lamprey table 3 median time taken for lamprey to pass through the array was 327 s with a few individuals taking longer up to 1800 s fig 8 a out of the base models model 1 was the poorest predictor of time to pass fig 8a table 3 model 3 was the best closely followed by model 4 fig 8a table 3 with predicted median agent durations of 349 and 364 s respectively the more persistent movement paths produced by model 2 fig 6a resulted in less variation in passage time and a greater peak in the distribution around the median value 324 s fig 8a the addition of avoidance behaviours in model 4a and model 4b resulted in a poorer prediction of passage time than the base model alone table 3 model 4a was particularly bad at predicting passage time fig 8a table 3 as avoidance of shallow regions around transect t4 fig 6d delayed agent upstream progress model 4c which included avoidance of shallow slow flow regions provided the best predictions of lamprey temporal distribution overall fig 8a table 3 for the parameterisation lamprey that were immediately detected at a pit antenna after transiting upstream through the hydrophone array n 7 lamprey the majority of detections 57 occurred at the tailrace followed by the fish pass 43 fig 8b models 2 and 3 were particularly poor at predicting first pit antenna detections fig 8b table 3 because there was no underlying hydrodynamic feedback to stop the agents passing upstream over the high velocity flows that occur on the weir face fig 6a and b whereas model 4 was the most predictive fig 8b table 3 none of the additional avoidance behaviour models 4a 4c improved pit detection predictions compared to the base model alone fig 8b table 3 however there was little difference in pit deviation scores between model 4b 4c and model 4 table 3 all the models erroneously predicted some detections at pit antennas on the weir face as no parameterisation lamprey were detected there fig 8b when considering lateral temporal and pit deviation collectively model 4 was the best base model at predicting movement patterns of the parameterisation lamprey table 3 the addition of avoidance behaviours in model 4a and model 4b resulted in poorer predictive power than the base model alone table 3 model 4c which also included avoidance of shallow slow flow regions was the best model overall table 3 however the relative improvement in overall performance between model 4 and 4c was small normalised score 0 96 and 1 00 respectively table 3 the lateral temporal and pit deviation scores and rankings for the validation table 4 and parameterisation lamprey table 3 were similar for each model indicating that trends in model performance were valid even when using non parameterisation data and that the best models e g model 4 and 4c have within site predictive power given the deviation scores and rankings for the parameterisation and validation lamprey model 4 and sub model 4c were selected as candidates for further assessment using all available data 31 lamprey tracks overall both models performed considerably better than the null model model 1 uniform distribution table 5 model 4 was the best predictor of lamprey temporal and pit distributions with a much smaller mean error 2 7 and 6 6 respectively compared to model 1 10 2 and 18 8 respectively table 5 model 4c was the best predictor of the lamprey lateral distribution with a mean error of 4 4 compared to 5 0 for model 1 table 5 closer inspection of the lateral distributions at each perpendicular transect revealed that model 4 and 4c produced similar results and that at t1 and t4 7 there was little difference 1 2 mean error between what they predicted and the null model fig 9 however for t2 and t3 where lamprey position was non random fig 4 both models more accurately reproduced their lateral distribution reducing the mean spatial error from 6 1 to ca 2 0 and 6 2 to ca 4 0 respectively fig 9 the small additional reduction in lateral error produced by model 4c compared to 4 can likely be attributed to some additional avoidance of regions near the true right bank in t1 4 fig 9 when considering lateral temporal and pit deviation collectively using all lamprey data model 4 the simpler model was the best model overall table 5 4 discussion this study used pom to investigate the space use and behavioural response of upstream migrating european river lamprey to the hydrodynamic conditions encountered downstream of an instream barrier three emergent patterns were used to test model performance 1 lateral distribution across the channel width 2 passage time through a hydrophone array and 3 location of first pit detection at the instream structure lamprey tended to be relatively evenly distributed laterally across the channel as they migrated upstream and approached the obstruction exhibiting a non random distribution at only two out of seven locations at these locations lamprey were less frequently detected in the recirculating low flow velocity regions that occurred near the banks median passage time through the system was ca 6 minutes and first pit detections mostly occurred at the downstream end of the fish pass 50 or in the hydropower tailrace 47 the best performing model that reproduced the observed patterns model 4 was a spatially explicit eulerian lagrangian individual based model ibm that included two simple behaviours 1 tortuous non directed swimming when in low flow velocity 0 1 m s 1 and 2 persistent directed against the flow swimming in moderate to high flow velocity 0 1 m s 1 the spatial distribution of european river lamprey as they moved upstream was similar to that reported for other lamprey species petromyzon marinus holbrook et al 2015 but notably different to that of other families for example salmonids oncorhynchus tshawytscha and oncorhynchus nerka hughes 2004 juvenile anguillids anguilla anguilla piper et al 2012 and acipenserids scaphirhynchus albus mcelroy et al 2012 tend to migrate upstream close to the channel edges most likely to reduce energy expenditure by taking advantage of the low flow velocities that occur near the bank lamprey exhibited a relatively even across channel distribution as they moved upstream and did not obviously utilise near bank low flow regions indeed they infrequently moved through near bank low flow velocity recirculation regions despite these areas potentially offering an energy efficient migration route it is currently unclear if they are actively avoiding such regions or preferentially choosing other routes e g selecting for higher velocities lamprey typically migrate upstream in unobstructed rivers near the bed boundary holbrook et al 2015 where velocities are low and therefore it is possible that they do not need to take advantage of near bank low velocity routes however acipenserids are also typically bed oriented during their upstream migration mcelroy et al 2012 and juvenile eel are known to use bed boundary conditions as they move upstream harrison et al 2014 vezza et al 2020 it is likely that additional factors not just energetics are influencing lamprey movement in these areas one potential reason why lamprey avoid recirculating low velocity regions is that they may become disoriented if local flow direction is unrepresentative of the bulk flow direction which could result in delayed migration this is exemplified by downstream moving juvenile salmonids that display more tortuous swimming and increased migration delay when flow velocities are very low in dam reservoirs ben jebria et al 2021 further work is required to understand the evolutionary advantages of lamprey movement patterns which differ from other upstream migrating species the median delay between last acoustic and first pit detection 10 7 min was greater than passage time through the array 5 8 min indicating more complex movement trajectories occurred near the weir complex movement behaviour near obstructions is commonly exhibited by other aquatic species for example downstream moving european eel switch from exhibiting semi passive movements as they approach a barrier to an exploratory search behaviour and avoidance on encountering abrupt velocity gradients piper et al 2015 sea lamprey also switch from consistent steady swimming in slow flow to alternating between short burst movements and periods of rest when flow velocities are rapid near obstructions quintella et al 2009 kemp et al 2011 high resolution spatial temporal tracking 1 m precision ca 1 hz directly downstream of the weir would have enabled quantification of alternative near barrier behaviours but this was not possible using the equipment available due to the high levels of air entrainment in this region in addition to likely exhibiting complex near barrier behaviours after their initial upstream movement and prior to pit detection almost half of the lamprey were detected moving back downstream through the hydrophone array with multiple movements up and downstream over several days being relatively common this suggests that large scale searching for passage routes is also part of the behavioural repertoire of european river lamprey when they encounter a barrier as suggested for sea lamprey davies et al 2021 the hydrodynamic environment at the study site was complex caused by a meandering channel variable water depth and spatially uneven discharge from the weir and hydropower station fluctuating discharge throughout the study period also caused considerable temporal variability in water depth channel width and hydrodynamics encountered by each lamprey the range of discharges that occurred during the study period 10 4 to 52 3 m3 s 1 was not uncommon for the time of year at this site with both lower ca 3 m3 s 1 lothian et al 2020 and higher ca 60 m3 s 1 tummers et al 2016b discharges recorded during similar periods in other years during the study period the highest predicted depth averaged velocity in the vicinity of the hydrophone array was similar under all discharges ca 1 15 m s 1 and was focussed mid channel or on the inside of the first bend downstream of the weir open channel flume experiments have found that river lamprey can progress upstream against flow velocities that range between 1 75 and 2 12 m s 1 russon and kemp 2011 with flows of 2 43 m s 1 blocking their movement kerr et al 2015 hence it is likely that flow velocity wasn t a significant barrier to their movement in the vicinity of the hydrophone array within the tail race and fish pass and on the downstream weir face predicted maximum depth averaged velocity ranged from 0 1 0 4 m s 1 2 0 2 9 m s 1 and 4 3 5 6 m s 1 respectively between flow scenarios the high predicted velocity at the fish pass and weir in comparison to lamprey swimming ability supports previous evidence of very low passage efficiency via these routes at this site unmodified fish pass 0 3 1 5 tummers et al 2016b 2018 unmodified weir 8 6 tummers et al 2018 model 4 best predicted the upstream movement patterns of lamprey as they approached the weir this spatially explicit eulerian lagrangian ibm accommodated two simple swimming behaviours 1 tortuous non directed swimming when in low flow velocity and 2 persistent directed against the flow swimming in moderate to high flow velocity the key spatial distribution patterns observed that were reproduced using these simple rules was a relatively even across channel distribution combined with the avoidance of near bank low flow velocity recirculating regions the idea that simple rules at the individual level can produce complex emergent patterns is a crucial part of complexity theory the study of complex systems herbert read 2016 in the field of aquatic movement ecology there has been a tendency to statistically identify and propose an overly complex array of hydrodynamic metrics that could influence space use see kerr et al 2016 the results of this study in line with the principles of complexity theory highlight that basic rules are often sufficient to reproduce emergent patterns additional movement rules such as the avoidance of shallow slow flow regions model 4c slightly improved spatial distribution predictions but not overall model performance model assessment and validation were carried out using a random subset of the fish movement data this constrains validation to the specific field site and range of hydrodynamic conditions that occurred during the study it is recommended that further validation of model 4 occurs using data acquired at other sites it is also worth noting that model 4 will only be applicable for predicting lamprey movements when they are actively migrating upstream during their spawning migration for other lifestages and movements e g for downstream moving transformers downstream searching behaviour or prey seeking at sea model 4 would be inappropriate as a lamprey s motivation and response to hydrodynamics is likely vastly different in these situations hydrodynamics are frequently a key predictor of space use by fish e g mcelroy et al 2012 goodwin et al 2014 silva et al 2020 but it was uncertain to what extent this would be the case for lamprey as they are thigmotactic and can move upstream by attaching to hard surfaces using their oral disk and resting between intermittent bouts of activity quintella et al 2009 kerr et al 2015 the results of this study highlight that hydrodynamics are a crucial predictor of lamprey space use as the flow dependant base model model 4 performed well whereas those where agents moved independent of flow i e using ground speed and direction distributions e g models 2 and 3 did not this result is important as identifying what data are needed to guide conservation efforts is critical not only in implementing effective mitigation but also for resource allocation and decision making e g flanagan et al 2018 the results of this study require validation at additional sites under a wider range of environmental conditions but current evidence suggests that when appropriate movement rules are used depth averaged flow velocity and direction i e available from a 2 d hydrodynamic model are sufficient to predict the key movement patterns of european river lamprey as they migrate upstream existing and widely used methods for predicting space use by lotic fish have typically been based on relatively simplistic statistical relationship between fish abundance and key environmental variables and they have been heavily criticised for this e g phabsim railsback 2016 kemp and katopodis 2017 but also see dray et al 2010 kerr et al 2016 one flaw of these simplistic methods is the assumption that preference for different environmental variables e g depth flow velocity overhead cover is independent mathur et al 1985 for example the phabsim methodology assumes that fish preference for certain depths is completely independent of the flow velocity at that location yet empirical evidence indicates this is flawed capra et al 2017 this study also provides direct evidence of the inaccuracy of this assumption for example a tentative assessment of the preference curves suggested that lamprey avoided both shallow and slow flow regions however two movement models model 4a and 4b where rules were implemented to cause agents to avoid such conditions independently performed poorly it was only when these environmental variables were treated in combination i e a rule was implemented where agents avoided areas where both depth and flow velocity were low model 4c that any improvement in model performance was observed the improvement in model performance was marginal isolated to lamprey lateral distribution but the results provide evidence for the inaccuracy of the assumption of independence of environmental variables they also highlight the importance of systematically testing movement hypotheses something that is required as part of the pom process and easily achieved using spatially explicit ibms mitigation measures to offset the impacts of aquatic habitat fragmentation are frequently ineffective e g brown et al 2013 lusardi and moyle 2017 often due to a poor understanding of fish behaviour in response to hydrodynamics resulting in a lack of transferability of technology kemp 2016b the methods used in this study a combination of field telemetry hydrodynamic modelling and pom enabled systematic identification of the key hydrodynamic and behavioural factors that governed the space use of the target species the results represent a substantial step forward in our knowledge on how the target species move as they approach an instream barrier and will aid in the development of more effective mitigation the methods used were effective and represent a useful framework for investigating similar relationships in other aquatic species credit authorship contribution statement j r kerr

hydrodynamic conditions created by an instream structure triangular profile gauging weir passive integrated transponder pit and acoustic telemetry were used to map the spatial temporal distribution patterns of lamprey as they migrated upstream acoustic doppler velocimetry and computer modelling were used to quantify the hydrodynamic environment in adherence with the pom methodology multiple movement models incorporating increasingly complex environmental feedback mechanisms and behavioural rules were created and systematically assessed to identify which factors might reproduce the

0 1 m s 1 and 2 persistent directed against the flow swimming in moderate to high flow velocity 0 1 m s 1 the pom indicated that flow heterogeneity was an important influence of lamprey space use and that simple behavioural rules i e two separate movement behaviours in response to flow velocity were sufficient to reproduce the main movement pattern observed avoidance of flow recirculating regions

is a need to better understand how behaviour and flow influence their movement patterns around anthropogenic river structures to address this this study used pom to investigate the hydrodynamic factors and behaviours that govern the space use of an at risk species the european river lamprey as they approached a triangular profile gauging weir specifically we quantified 1 the movement patterns of lamprey as they approached the gauging weir using acoustic and passive integrated transponder pit telemetry and 2 the hydrodynamic environment encountered using acoustic doppler velocimetry and computer modelling by integrating the biological and hydrodynamic data obtained we were able to 3 develop several spatially explicit ibms that could be used to systematically assess which hydrodynamic factors and swimming behaviours were required to reproduce the movement patterns of river lamprey observed in the field this study is both the first to track the fine scale spatial temporal 1 m 1 hz respectively movement patterns of river lamprey during their upstream spawning migration and to use ibms to systematically assess what hydrodynamic and behavioural factors are influencing their space use the results present a significant step forward in our knowledge on the movement ecology of this species and the methods used represent a useful framework for investigating

dimensional movement of lamprey eight acoustic hydrophones hti 590 series 307 khz were installed between 0 035 and 0 085 rkm downstream of the weir fig 1 positioning of the hydrophones at mid water depth on weighted vertical lines suspended from catenary ropes that spanned the width of the river fig 1 table s1 ensured that a test tag placed randomly within the array was detected by at least three receivers at all times placement of the array closer to the weir was not possible due to rapid attenuation of sound caused by high levels of air entrainment three dimensional positioning was not possible because an undulating bathymetry and shallow water depth in key locations inhibited acoustic signal propagation the hydrophones were connected to a model 290 hti acoustic tag receiver sample rate 12 khz and a survey laptop running hti acoustictag data acquisition software six pit antennas were also installed on or near the weir to determine which routes the lamprey used as they attempted to pass upstream pit antennas function by generating a localised electromagnetic field which energises nearby tags causing them to transmit a unique identification code which is logged by a receiver the antennas at the study site consisted of two pass through type antennas one in the tailrace and one at the downstream entrance of the fish pass and two pairs of flat bed antennas at the foot of the weir each pair covering a 2 m wide zone adjacent to the true right and left wing wall fig 1 the antennas on the weir were the right bank bankside rbb right bank mid channel rbm left bank mid channel lbm and left bank bankside lbb fig 1 the rbm antenna was located at the foot of a 1 m wide channel of studded tiles that were installed to aid lamprey passage tummers et al 2018 the central 16 m of the weir was not instrumented the acoustic and pit telemetry equipment was operational at the site from 8 november to 7 december 2017 30 days 2 2 2 lamprey capture and tagging river lamprey were trapped near the tidal limit of the ouse latitude 53 880002 longitude 1 1001047 and at 53 885945 1 0959495 wgs84 using double compartment two funnel eel pots masters et al 2006 fishing on the riverbed over eight sessions between 8 29 november 2017 34 lamprey 380 mm total length were collected transported to site tagged and released at the downstream extent of the study area fig 1 table s2 previous studies indicate that lamprey captured tagged and released in this way are from the same genetic population bracken et al 2015 and exhibit a consistent upstream directed migration tendency lucas et al 2009 tummers et al 2016b 2018 each lamprey was tagged intracoelomically with a 3 65 mm diameter 32 mm long hdx pit tag texas instruments model ri trp rrhp 134 2 khz weight 0 8 g in air and a 6 8 mm diameter 20 mm long acoustic transmitter htisonar model 795 ld 307 khz weight 1 05 g in air acoustic transmitters were programmed to emit single acoustic pulses with a variable pulse interval used to identify each tag 881 1182 ms lamprey moved upstream through the hydrophone array and approached the weir under a wide range of river flows 11 1 46 4 m3 s 1 due to a transcription error pit tag data for one lamprey was unavailable all fish handling and tagging was conducted in compliance with uk home office licence number ppl 70 8720 following the animals scientific procedures act 1986 see tummers et al 2018 for further details on lamprey capture tagging and pit telemetry 2 2 3 telemetry data processing acoustic telemetry data were processed using custom software written in matlab r2017a mathworks tag positioning was undertaken in two stages 1 an initial estimate of tag position was calculated based on time difference of arrival tdoa of the signal between the three nearest hydrophones intersection of hyperbola and these positions were used to estimate the time each pulse was emitted from the tag regression analysis 2 time of arrival toa the difference in signal transmit and receive time for the three nearest hydrophones was used to calculate the final tag location intersection of circles tdoa and toa both produce multiple intersections reflecting both real and false potential detection locations at each time step during stage one and two the clustered data points that most likely represented the real lamprey position were manually selected and averaged as the focus of this study was to assess the movement dynamics of naïve lamprey as they approached a barrier only their first upstream transit through the hydrophone array was tracked to measure the spatial accuracy of the acoustic telemetry hardware and software a transmitter pulse interval 1000 ms was attached to a radio controlled survey boat arcboat equipped with a high precision global positioning system see section 2 3 for further details and repeatedly driven through the hydrophone array tag run tag runs were used to train the data analyst in the correct identification of real and false detection locations during tag positioning the spatial accuracy of the system was validated by blind processing five randomly selected tag runs through the array 887 data points in total this process revealed a median and maximum tracking error of 0 83 and 2 20 m respectively the location and time of first detection at the weir for each lamprey was extracted from the raw pit telemetry data 2 2 4 analysis of movement patterns lamprey frequently held station station holding behaviour within the array for long periods the frequency and duration that lamprey held station was quantified from the tracks as periods where they displayed cumulatively less lateral and longitudinal movement than the median acoustic tracking error 0 83 m for 30 s transit time through the study area was subdivided into the duration 1 between release and detection at the hydrophone array 2 to pass through the array and 3 between last acoustic detection and first pit detection lamprey lateral position across the channel was quantitatively assessed at seven transects t1 7 spaced 10 m apart along the river centreline oriented perpendicular to the primary flow direction fig 1 the area between the most up and downstream transect conservatively spanned the domain in which it was possible to accurately position acoustic telemetry the lamprey as they moved upstream randomisation tests manly 2007 holbrook et al 2015 were used to determine if lamprey lateral distribution was non random at each transect first a random distribution r of locations was generated along each transect to account for variable downstream water level during the study period r for each transect was calculated by generating 1000 random intersect locations for each channel width available to each lamprey as it transited upstream with all locations then aggregated second the deviation between r and the observed distribution of lamprey l at each transect was established dr l eq 1 by binning each distribution r and l into 10 equidistant bins and averaging the absolute difference between the proportion of l and r that occurred in each bin i pri and pli respectively 1 d r l p r i p l i 10 third multiple n 1000 subsamples rs number of positions per subsample equivalent to the observed number of lamprey were randomly extracted from r and the deviation between rs and r dr rs was calculated in the same way as between r and l eq 1 finally a p value was calculated as the proportion of dr rs that were higher than dr l for the randomisation tests the p value is a measure of the strength of evidence that lamprey lateral distribution was non random where p 0 01 p 0 05 p 0 10 and p 0 10 indicated strong moderate weak and no evidence respectively 2 3 hydrodynamic environment water velocity and bed elevation were measured downstream of the weir under mean flow conditions discharge 27 9 m3 s 1 using a radio controlled survey boat arcboat l x w 1 95 0 72 m equipped with a sontek riversurveyor m9 acoustic doppler current profiler adcp and integrated leica viva gs14 global navigation satellite system horizontal position accuracy 8 mm 0 5 ppm raw adcp data were processed using riversurveyor v4 0 sontek to provide depth and velocity in three dimensions x y and z near the bed surface and mid column velocity magnitude was calculated from the three dimensional flow vectors and averaged mean over all depths to produce depth averaged velocity and direction given the lack of knowledge about the vertical distribution of lamprey at the study site depth averaged velocity was deemed to be the best approximation of the flow conditions they experienced bed elevation data were combined with wetted width bank half full and bank full measurements n 493 obtained using the leica viva gs14 attached to a 1 8 m survey pole and linearly interpolated to produce a digital elevation model dem for the river channel downstream of the weir weir fish pass and hydropower discharge and up and downstream water level at the site were recorded at 15 minute intervals tummers et al 2018 flow regimes experienced by the lamprey at times other than at mean discharge were modelled under nine conditions using five flows 11 1 19 9 28 8 37 6 and 46 4 m3 s 1 hydrodynamic model hm1 5 respectively with the hydropower turbines either turned on or off e g hm1 on and hm1 off table s3 no turbine on condition was needed for model hm5 as the head difference was low at this discharge and the hydropower station was not operational the software used to model the hydrodynamics was telemac 2d which is a module of the open source telemac mascaret modelling suite www opentelemac org it is acknowledged that there may have been significant vertical variation in flow at the study site but the lack of knowledge about lamprey distribution in this plane negated any potential benefits of undertaking more complex three dimensional hydrodynamic modelling the assumption of a two dimensional environment is common in aquatic movement ibms tan et al 2018 brosnan and welch 2020 dye et al 2022 and despite limitations can provide valuable insight into animal movement patterns the model geometry which consisted of an unstructured triangular mesh was constructed using data derived from engineering drawings of the weir infrastructure and using the downstream channel dem fig 1 model boundary conditions were parameterised using a constant value of water level at the downstream boundary and a constant discharge over the weir and through the fish pass and hydropower station the individual discharge values used at each inflow boundary e g through the fish pass were derived from their measured relationship with total discharge when the turbines were either on or off linear regression figure s1 table s3 each of the nine hydrodynamic simulations were run with a computational timestep of 0 01 s and to ensure model stability the boundary conditions were applied gradually by linearly ramping the upstream boundary discharge from zero over a period of 12 h the modelled hydrodynamic conditions were calibrated by comparing the output of model hm3 off closest to mean discharge with the adcp data and the bed friction values of the model adjusted so that the gradient of the correlation between modelled and measured velocity closely matched figure s2 a spatially uniform manning bed friction coefficient with a value of 0 045 m1 3 s 1 was found to provide the best comparison hm3 off produced comparable spatial flow patterns to those measured figure s3 and the root mean square error between the modelled and measured velocity along the reach was relatively low 0 19 m s 1 figure s2 2 4 pattern oriented modelling pom in this study pom was used to identify the key hydrodynamic factors and fish behaviours that govern the movement patterns of upstream migrating lamprey as they approached an instream barrier the pom approach involves the testing of multiple models of increasing complexity including at least one null model that is unrealistically simple grimm and railsback 2012 the reductionist process aims to derive the simplest model required to explain the movement patterns observed incorporating only entities variables and processes that are absolutely essential grimm and railsback 2012 in this study pom was achieved by 1 identifying potentially important movement behaviours from the telemetry data obtained 2 formulating multiple hypothetical movement models of increasing complexity based on the behaviours identified 3 assessing each model s ability to reproduce the observed patterns model performance and 4 validating the model s that performed best each of these processes are explained in detail in sections 2 4 1 to 2 4 4 2 4 1 identifying movement behaviour understanding of space use by riverine fish tends to reflect an interest in the relationship with flow e g goodwin et al 2014 kerr et al 2016 lamprey however exhibit quite different morphological and behavioural characteristics to many other fluvial species for example they lack paired fins that aid stability and hold position in challenging flows e g turbulent and high velocities by attaching to hard surfaces with their oral disc kemp et al 2009 kerr et al 2015 as a result the relative importance of hydrodynamics compared to other variables such as thigmotactic cues keefer et al 2011 kemp et al 2011 holbrook et al 2015 remains difficult to ascertain to identify the relative importance of hydrodynamics lamprey movement models were created that were both independent and dependant of flow see section 2 4 2 to parameterise these models lamprey movement behaviour was quantified from the acoustic telemetry lamprey tracks both independent ground speed gspeed and direction gdir and dependant swim speed sspeed and direction sdir of the hydrodynamic environment experienced assessment of movement behaviours for model parameterisation was undertaken using half of the acoustic telemetry tracks parameterisation lamprey n 16 with the remainder used later to provide a within site validation of the model validation lamprey n 15 gspeed m s 1 and gdir at each time step were calculated as 2 g speed x t x t 1 2 y t y t 1 2 δ t 3 g dir atan 2 x t x t 1 y t y t 1 where x and y are the cartesian coordinates at time t and atan2 is the four quadrant inverse tangent in degrees 180 180 a rotation was then applied so that gdir was relative to the course of the river upstream direction which was calculated as the tangential angle of the river centreline at the point closest to the lamprey at that time step sspeed m s 1 and sdir were calculated as 4 s s p e e d s u t 2 s v t 2 5 s d i r a t a n 2 s u t s v t where su and sv are the swim speeds m s 1 in x and y extracted at each time step from each lamprey track as 6 s u t x t 1 x t t f u x t y t 7 s v t y t 1 y t t f v x t y t where fu and fv are the flow velocities m s 1 in x and y at x and y interpolated from the hydrodynamic model with the most appropriate discharge and turbine condition probability distributions were fitted to the movement variables gspeed gdir sspeed and sdir through assessment of log likelihood scores to assess whether lamprey movement was temporally autocorrelated probability distributions of the difference between gspeed gdir sspeed and sdir between time steps were also evaluated e g eq 8 8 g spee ddiff g speed t g speed t 1 the relationships between sspeed and sdir and depth averaged flow speed fspeed and direction fdir were investigated using regression analysis broadscale trends in space use in relation to flow velocity and depth within the study area were evaluated using preference curves pv and pd respectively preference p was calculated as p u a where u and a are histograms of space used and space available respectively the histograms were constructed by calculating the normalised frequency of u and v in the study area between t1 and t7 fig 1 for increments 30 equally distributed bins of either velocity or depth for each lamprey available velocity and depth consisted of all the data from the dem water level corrected and from the most appropriate nearest discharge and turbine condition hydrodynamic model respectively used velocity and depth was the interpolated values at each tracked lamprey position from the dem and hydrodynamic models respectively final preference curves were calculated as the mean and bootstrapped n 1000 confidence intervals 95 of p for all individuals for each increment of the frequency distributions when calculating preference as the quotient of use and availability a fundamental assumption is that an organism has access to and knowledge of all space available to it which is often not the case beyer et al 2010 it is acknowledged that preference metrics which account for space sampled are superior to those merely based on availability see kerr et al 2016 in this study availability based curves enabled efficient identification of broadscale distribution patterns relative to environmental variables and facilitated the generation of movement hypotheses that were later tested and validated as part of the pom process 2 4 2 movement models seven hypothetical movement models were formulated to predict the spatial temporal distribution of upstream migrating river lamprey these included four base level movement models of increasing complexity model 1 uniform spatial temporal distribution the null model model 2 flow independent random walk model 3 flow independent correlated random walk and model 4 flow dependant correlated random walk eulerian lagrangian model in addition the following three behavioural adaptations were made to the fourth model avoidance of either a shallow areas b slow flow areas or c shallow slow flow areas model 4a c respectively model 1 was a statistical model for which a uniform spatial and temporal distribution of lamprey was assumed table 1 and was formulated because the pom process requires inclusion of a simplistic null model against which to compare later models models 2 4c were spatially explicit ibms in which agents moved through a hypothetical 2 dimensional domain representing the 0 52 rkm of channel downstream of the weir table 1 agent movement in models 2 4 was incorporated in different ways with later models being more complex for example in models 2 and 3 movement behaviour was independent of local hydrodynamics and took the form of an uncorrelated and correlated random walk respectively table 1 models 2 and 3 were formulated to test whether adequate model fit could be achieved without using any hydrodynamics data i e to ascertain whether lamprey movement might be independent of the flow field model 4 was a coupled eulerian lagrangian model in which agents were advected downstream with the flow and movement was the result of swim and flow speed and direction in two dimensions table 1 model 4 was formulated to test how important local hydrodynamics are for governing lamprey movement the addition of extra movement behaviours in models 4a c e g addition of avoidance of shallow and or slow flow regions increased model complexity further but enabled systematic testing of each behaviour in relation to the base model model 4 models 2 4c had a timestep of 1 second and were parameterised using the data generated in section 2 4 1 for models 2 4c agents were released into the model at the downstream extent of the domain fig 1 and movement occurred at each time step according to user defined rules agents were kept within the domain boundaries through checks that occurred at each time step if the agent s next movement was determined to place it outside of the model boundary then a hypothetical selection of twenty alternative movement locations were generated that fell on the perimeter of a circle centred on the last movement position and with a radius r equal to current step length of these hypothetical points the one that was closest to the erroneous position that was within and did not cross the model boundary was selected as the new movement location this method enabled continuation of the agent s movement in a direction similar to its intended movement direction and maintained the predetermined movement distance for that time step benson et al 2021 station holding was implemented into models 2 4c by assigning a probability psh 0 00299 that each agent would exhibit this behaviour at each time step psh was calculated as 9 p s h 1 1 n s h n 1 μ t l where nsh is the number of lamprey that held station n is the number of lamprey observed and μtl is the mean tracking duration when initiated the agent held station for a set number of time steps randomly assigned from a distribution logistic µ 17 8 σ 28 1 truncation 0 801 fitted to the empirical data figure s4 turbulence was simulated in model 4 and sub models by randomly varying fu and fv by a factor of r n f u 0 2 and r n f v 0 2 respectively where r x is a random number from the distribution x and n μ σ is a normal distribution with mean μ and standard deviation σ agents were removed from the model if they crossed user selected detection lines set at the pit antenna locations and at the crest of the fish pass and weir fig 1 as such agents were removed from the model if they were detected by a pit antenna or if they passed upstream changing flow conditions e g discharge and water depth during the study period figure s5 were accounted for in models 2 4c by weighting the number of agents released in each hydrodynamic model one thousand agents were released per lamprey which provided an appropriate balance between limiting model run time and ensuring emergent patterns were fully resolved i e sufficient replicates to overcome model stochasticity for example for the parameterisation lamprey the number of agents that best represented the different flow conditions experienced matching turbine condition and nearest discharge was 4000 5000 2000 3000 and 2000 released using the hm1 off hm1 on hm2 on hm4 off and hm5 off hydrodynamic model data respectively 16 000 in total this process resulted in the proportion of agents and lamprey that experienced different flow conditions being comparable when assessing the results against the validation or all lamprey the models were rerun with the appropriate number of agents to ensure comparability further details for each model are provided in the subsections below for the ibms models 2 4c model processes are summarised in a flow chart in fig 2 2 4 2 1 model 1 uniform spatial temporal distribution model 1 was a statistical model for which a uniform spatial and temporal distribution of lamprey was assumed to account for the variable channel width throughout the study period and to ensure that the assumed distribution was comparable to that observed a uniform lateral distribution at each transect t1 t7 was calculated for the wetted width available to each lamprey as they migrated upstream extrapolated from the dem and downstream water level and the results aggregated i e a weighted uniform distribution the time taken for agents to transit through the hydrophone array and their first pit detection locations were assumed to be uniformly distributed with no weighting applied 2 4 2 2 model 2 flow independent random walk model 2 was a biased random walk model e g codling et al 2008 in which agents moved through the domain independent of the hydrodynamic environment the agents were guided by river geometry course of the river extracted from the centreline with values of ground speed and direction at each timestep randomly allocated from the observed probability distributions of each pd gspeed and pd gdir respectively table 2 figure s6 movement in x and y at each timestep t was calculated as 10 x t x t 1 c o s r p d g d i r r p d g s p e e d t 11 y t y t 1 s i n r p d g d i r r p d g s p e e d t 2 4 2 3 model 3 flow independent correlated random walk model 3 was similar to model 2 in that agents moved through the domain independent of the hydrodynamic environment however movement gspeed and gdir at each time step was temporally autocorrelated initial agent gspeed and gdir values were randomly selected from the pd gspeed and pd gdir distributions table 2 figure s6 as per for model 2 subsequent gspeed and gdir values were assigned to agents as 12 g s p e e d t g s p e e d t 1 r p d g s p e e d d i f f 13 g d i r t g d i r t 1 r p d g d i r d i f f where pd gspeeddiff and pd gdirdiff are the probability distributions of observed difference in either gspeed or gdir between each time step respectively table 2 figure s6 to keep the agents moving at an appropriate speed and heading in the correct direction current gspeed and gdir values were periodically assessed against a randomly selected value from the observed probability distributions of each guidance values table 2 whether the current value was greater or lesser than the guidance value determined if the change in the movement parameter for that time step was subtracted or added respectively gspeed eq 14 gdir eq 15 14 g s p e e d t r p d g s p e e d g s p e e d t g s p e e d t 1 r p d g s p e e d d i f f g s p e e d t r p d g s p e e d g s p e e d t g s p e e d t 1 r p d g s p e e d d i f f 15 g d i r t r p d

followed the pd gspeeddiff and pd gdirdiff distributions and the direction of change was periodically adjusted to guide fish in accordance with the pd gspeed and pd gdir distributions as applying guidance every time step resulted in overly persistent agent movement paths the probability that it was applied pspeed and pdir for gspeed and gdir respectively was iteratively adjusted until agent movement distance and direction distributions matched those observed pdist 0 94 pdir 0 75 2 4 2 4 model 4 flow dependant correlated random walk in model 4 agent movement was dependant on hydrodynamics and the result of both swim and flow speed and direction in two dimensions that is agents had to actively swim against the flow to hold position or make progress upstream two different swimming behaviours in response to flow velocity were identified from assessment of the telemetry and hydrodynamic data fig 3 a and incorporated in model 4 these were 1 low flow swimming fspeed 0 1 m s 1 and 2 moderate to high flow swimming fspeed 0 1 m s 1 behaviours during low flow swimming fspeed 0 1 m s 1 swim direction was independent of flow direction and movement paths were relatively tortuous figure s7 during moderate to high flow swimming fspeed 0 1 m s 1 lamprey tended to swim against the flow swim speed was correlated with flow velocity and movement was more persistent figure s8 movement dynamics e g sspeed and sdir within model 4 were calculated in the same way for both the low flow and moderate to high flow swimming behaviours but values were randomly drawn from different probability distributions e g pd lf sspeed and pd mhf sspeed respectively table 2 guidance to keep the agents following observed swim speed and direction distributions was applied in the similar way as in model 3 with the same probability of guidance at each time step pspeed 0 94 pdir 0 75 initial sspeed and sdir values were randomly selected from the observed pd sspeed and pd sdir distributions table 2 the best distribution fit for the pd lf sdir and pd mhf sdir data occurred when absolute values were used hence the distribution is limited to between 0 and 180 in table 2 when required values generated using these distributions were multiplied by either 1 or 1 randomly selected to enable a full range of possible turn angles i e final distribution truncation 180 180 subsequent sdir values were assigned to agents as 16 s d i r t r p d s d i r s d i r t s d i r t 1 r p d s d i r d i f f s d i r t r p d s d i r s d i r t s d i r t 1 r p d s d i r d i f f to account for a linear

identified from the analysis described in section 2 4 1 fig 3b values of a and b in eq 17 were zero during low flow swimming figure s7 and 0 75 and 0 40 respectively during moderate to high flow swimming figure s8 agent movement in x in y was calculated as 18 x t x t 1 f u r n f u 0 2 t c o s s d i r s s p e e d t 19 y t y t 1 f v r n f v 0 2 t s i n s d i r s s p e e d t 2 4 2 5 models 4a c assessment of the depth and velocity preference curves for the parameterisation lamprey indicated that they moved through shallow and slow flow regions less frequently than expected if their distribution had been uniform throughout the study area figure s9 to evaluate whether avoidance of these regions might be influencing space use three additional movement behaviours were added to model 4 avoidance of either shallow areas model 4a slow flow areas model 4b or shallow slow flow areas model 4c depth and velocity avoidance thresholds davoid and vavoid respectively were set at 1 m and 0 1 m s 1 respectively at each time step depth and velocity at the agent s location adepth and avelocity respectively were interpolated from the hydrodynamic model if adepth davoid model 4a avelocity vavoid model 4b or adepth davoid and avelocity vavoid model 4c then avoidance behaviour was initiated avoidance behaviour superseded all other movement behaviours and consisted of the fish moving towards deeper model 4a and 4c or higher velocity model 4b areas gradients of increasing depth θ d and velocity θ v were calculated for each hydrodynamic model eqs 20 and 21 respectively and interpolated at each agent position as required 20 θ d a t a n 2 d x d y 21 θ v a t a n 2 v x v y steering towards θ d and θ v occurred by adding or subtracting a random change in bearing from the

r pd s dirdiff during avoidance behaviour agents therefore steered away from either shallow and or slow flow regions in the direction left or right that most closely aligned them with increasing velocity or depth but their turn angles continued to adhere to pd sdirdiff agents displaying avoidance behaviour might not immediately exit an undesirable region e g shallow water but the behaviour typically resulted in them spending less time in such areas 2 4 3 model performance the accuracy with which each of the seven models predicted the observed patterns exhibited by the parameterisation lamprey was quantified in terms of the mean absolute difference between simulated and empirical probability distributions this was achieved using three distributions 1 lamprey lateral position across the river at each of the seven perpendicular transects lateral deviation 2 upstream passage time between transect t1 and t7 temporal deviation and 3 location of first pit detection pit deviation for each deviation score lateral temporal and pit the probability distributions were standardised to ensure comparability between observed and modelled data for lateral deviation 10 equally spaced bins of normalised lateral position 0 to 1 from left to right bank along each transect widest wetted width available were used for temporal deviation 10 equally spaced bins between zero and the maximum time seconds taken for a lamprey to pass through the hydrophone array excluding outliers 2000 s were used for pit deviation eight sampling locations were used 1 6 the first pit detection location after passing upstream through the acoustic array tr fp rbb rbm lbm or lbb 7 passed upstream and 8 not detected raw and normalised lateral temporal and pit deviation scores were calculated for each model 1 4c and ranked normalised scores were calculated relative to the null model 0 and the best performing model 1 with models that performed worse than the null model attributed negative values combined overall model predictive performance was assessed as the normalised and ranked mean of the lateral temporal and pit deviation scores 2 4 4 model validation models were validated by assessing their ability to predict the spatial temporal distribution of the validation lamprey n 15 telemetry tracks that had been excluded from the parameterisation process as sample size for parameterisation and validation were similar the deviation scores generated from the models were comparable a final assessment of the best model s was undertaken by comparing the percentage error deviation score 100 in the predicted lateral temporal and pit distributions compared to the null model model 1 uniform spatial temporal and pit distribution for all lamprey telemetry tracks n 31 3 results 3 1 movement

all pit tagged lamprey that passed upstream through the array n 30 predominantly occurred at the bottom of the fish pass 50 or within the hydropower tailrace 47 fig 4a 3 2 hydrodynamic environment

t4 and t6 or both t2 banks fig 5 t1 7 at t2 and t3 the transects at which lamprey distribution was non random flow recirculation accounted for more than 30 of the channel width fig 5 t2 t3 areas of recirculation occurred at all discharges particularly near the right bank at t2 and t3 fig 5 3 3 pattern oriented modelling pom out of the base models model 4 and model 2 were the best and worst predictors of lamprey lateral distribution respectively figs 6 and 7 table 3 movement trajectories of agents produced by model 2 fig 6a were more persistent than those observed fig 4a and as the agents migrated upstream around each bend they tended to aggregate resulting in an uneven distribution across the channel fig 7 lateral distributions produced in model 4 matched those of lamprey well fig 7 resulting in the lowest deviation score for the base models table 3 the addition of avoidance behaviours in model 4a and model 4b resulted in poorer prediction of lateral distributions than the base model alone table 3 model 4c which included avoidance of shallow slow flow regions was the best model overall for predicting lateral distribution of lamprey table 3 median time taken for lamprey to pass through the array was 327 s with a few individuals taking longer up to 1800 s fig 8 a out of the base models model 1 was the poorest predictor of time to pass fig 8a table 3 model 3 was the best closely followed by model 4 fig 8a table 3 with predicted median agent durations of 349 and 364 s respectively the more persistent movement paths produced by model 2 fig 6a resulted in less variation in passage time and a greater peak in the distribution around the median value 324 s fig 8a the addition of avoidance behaviours in model 4a and model 4b resulted in a poorer prediction of passage time than the base model alone table 3 model 4a was particularly bad at predicting passage time fig 8a table 3 as avoidance of shallow regions around transect t4 fig 6d delayed agent upstream progress model 4c which included avoidance of shallow slow flow regions provided the best predictions of lamprey temporal distribution overall fig 8a table 3 for the parameterisation lamprey that were immediately detected at a pit antenna after transiting upstream through the hydrophone array n 7 lamprey the majority of detections 57 occurred at the tailrace followed by the fish pass 43 fig 8b models 2 and 3 were particularly poor at predicting first pit antenna detections fig 8b table 3 because there was no underlying hydrodynamic feedback to stop the agents passing upstream over the high velocity flows that occur on the weir face fig 6a and b whereas model 4 was the most predictive fig 8b table 3 none of the additional avoidance behaviour models 4a 4c improved pit detection predictions compared to the base model alone fig 8b table 3 however there was little difference in pit deviation scores between model 4b 4c and model 4 table 3 all the models erroneously predicted some detections at pit antennas on the weir face as no parameterisation lamprey were detected there fig 8b when considering lateral temporal and pit deviation collectively model 4 was the best base model at predicting movement patterns of the parameterisation lamprey table 3 the addition of avoidance behaviours in model 4a and model 4b resulted in poorer predictive power than the base model alone table 3 model 4c which also included avoidance of shallow slow flow regions was the best model overall table 3 however the relative improvement in overall performance between model 4 and 4c was small normalised score 0 96 and 1 00 respectively table 3 the lateral temporal and pit deviation scores and rankings for the validation table 4 and parameterisation lamprey table 3 were similar for each model indicating that trends in model performance were valid even when using non parameterisation data and that the best models e g model 4 and 4c have within site predictive power given the deviation scores and rankings for the parameterisation and validation lamprey model 4 and sub model 4c were selected as candidates for further assessment using all available data 31 lamprey tracks overall both models performed considerably better than the null model model 1 uniform distribution table 5 model 4 was the best predictor of lamprey temporal and pit distributions with a much smaller mean error 2 7 and 6 6 respectively compared to model 1 10 2 and 18 8 respectively table 5 model 4c was the best predictor of the lamprey lateral distribution with a mean error of 4 4 compared to 5 0 for model 1 table 5 closer inspection of the lateral distributions at each perpendicular transect revealed that model 4 and 4c produced similar results and that at t1 and t4 7 there was little difference 1 2 mean error between what they predicted and the null model fig 9 however for t2 and t3 where lamprey position was non random fig 4 both models more accurately reproduced their lateral distribution reducing the mean spatial error from 6 1 to ca 2 0 and 6 2 to ca 4 0 respectively fig 9 the small additional reduction in lateral error produced by model 4c compared to 4 can likely be attributed to some additional avoidance of regions near the true right bank in t1 4 fig 9 when considering lateral temporal and pit deviation collectively using all lamprey data model 4 the simpler model was the best model overall table 5 4 discussion this study used pom to investigate the space use and behavioural response of upstream migrating european river lamprey to the hydrodynamic conditions encountered downstream of an instream barrier three emergent patterns were used to test model performance 1 lateral distribution across the channel width 2 passage time through a hydrophone array and 3 location of first pit detection at the instream structure lamprey tended to be relatively evenly distributed laterally across the channel as they migrated upstream and approached the obstruction exhibiting a non random distribution at only two out of seven locations at these locations lamprey were less frequently detected in the recirculating low flow velocity regions that occurred near the banks median passage time through the system was ca 6 minutes and first pit detections mostly occurred at the downstream end of the fish pass 50 or in the hydropower tailrace 47 the best performing model that reproduced the observed patterns model 4 was a spatially explicit eulerian lagrangian individual based model ibm that included two simple behaviours 1 tortuous non directed swimming when in low flow velocity 0 1 m s 1 and 2 persistent directed against the flow swimming in moderate to high flow velocity 0 1 m s 1 the spatial distribution of european river lamprey as they moved upstream was similar to that reported for other lamprey species petromyzon marinus holbrook et al 2015 but notably different to that of other families for example salmonids oncorhynchus tshawytscha and oncorhynchus nerka hughes 2004 juvenile anguillids anguilla anguilla piper et al 2012 and acipenserids scaphirhynchus albus mcelroy et al 2012 tend to migrate upstream close to the channel edges most likely to reduce energy expenditure by taking advantage of the low flow velocities that occur near the bank lamprey exhibited a relatively even across channel distribution as they moved upstream and did not obviously utilise near bank low flow regions indeed they infrequently moved through near bank low flow velocity recirculation regions despite these areas potentially offering an energy efficient migration route it is currently unclear if they are actively avoiding such regions or preferentially choosing other routes e g selecting for higher velocities lamprey typically migrate upstream in unobstructed rivers near the bed boundary holbrook et al 2015 where velocities are low and therefore it is possible that they do not need to take advantage of near bank low velocity routes however acipenserids are also typically bed oriented during their upstream migration mcelroy et al 2012 and juvenile eel are known to use bed boundary conditions as they move upstream harrison et al 2014 vezza et al 2020 it is likely that additional factors not just energetics are influencing lamprey movement in these areas one potential reason why lamprey avoid recirculating low velocity regions is that they may become disoriented if local flow direction is unrepresentative of the bulk flow direction which could result in delayed migration this is exemplified by downstream moving juvenile salmonids that display more tortuous swimming and increased migration delay when flow velocities are very low in dam reservoirs ben jebria et al 2021 further work is required to understand the evolutionary advantages of lamprey movement patterns which differ from other upstream migrating species the median delay between last acoustic and first pit detection 10 7 min was greater than passage time through the array 5 8 min indicating more complex movement trajectories occurred near the weir complex movement behaviour near obstructions is commonly exhibited by other aquatic species for example downstream moving european eel switch from exhibiting semi passive movements as they approach a barrier to an exploratory search behaviour and avoidance on encountering abrupt velocity gradients piper et al 2015 sea lamprey also switch from consistent steady swimming in slow flow to alternating between short burst movements and periods of rest when flow velocities are rapid near obstructions quintella et al 2009 kemp et al 2011 high resolution spatial temporal tracking 1 m precision ca 1 hz directly downstream of the weir would have enabled quantification of alternative near barrier behaviours but this was not possible using the equipment available due to the high levels of air entrainment in this region in addition to likely exhibiting complex near barrier behaviours after their initial upstream movement and prior to pit detection almost half of the lamprey were detected moving back downstream through the hydrophone array with multiple movements up and downstream over several days being relatively common this suggests that large scale searching for passage routes is also part of the behavioural repertoire of european river lamprey when they encounter a barrier as suggested for sea lamprey davies et al 2021 the hydrodynamic environment at the study site was complex caused by a meandering channel variable water depth and spatially uneven discharge from the weir and hydropower station fluctuating discharge throughout the study period also caused considerable temporal variability in water depth channel width and hydrodynamics encountered by each lamprey the range of discharges that occurred during the study period 10 4 to 52 3 m3 s 1 was not uncommon for the time of year at this site with both lower ca 3 m3 s 1 lothian et al 2020 and higher ca 60 m3 s 1 tummers et al 2016b discharges recorded during similar periods in other years during the study period the highest predicted depth averaged velocity in the vicinity of the hydrophone array was similar under all discharges ca 1 15 m s 1 and was focussed mid channel or on the inside of the first bend downstream of the weir open channel flume experiments have found that river lamprey can progress upstream against flow velocities that range between 1 75 and 2 12 m s 1 russon and kemp 2011 with flows of 2 43 m s 1 blocking their movement kerr et al 2015 hence it is likely that flow velocity wasn t a significant barrier to their movement in the vicinity of the hydrophone array within the tail race and fish pass and on the downstream weir face predicted maximum depth averaged velocity ranged from 0 1 0 4 m s 1 2 0 2 9 m s 1 and 4 3 5 6 m s 1 respectively between flow scenarios the high predicted velocity at the fish pass and weir in comparison to lamprey swimming ability supports previous evidence of very low passage efficiency via these routes at this site unmodified fish pass 0 3 1 5 tummers et al 2016b 2018 unmodified weir 8 6 tummers et al 2018 model 4 best predicted the upstream movement patterns of lamprey as they approached the weir this spatially explicit eulerian lagrangian ibm accommodated two simple swimming behaviours 1 tortuous non directed swimming when in low flow velocity and 2 persistent directed against the flow swimming in moderate to high flow velocity the key spatial distribution patterns observed that were reproduced using these simple rules was a relatively even across channel distribution combined with the avoidance of near bank low flow velocity recirculating regions the idea that simple rules at the individual level can produce complex emergent patterns is a crucial part of complexity theory the study of complex systems herbert read 2016 in the field of aquatic movement ecology there has been a tendency to statistically identify and propose an overly complex array of hydrodynamic metrics that could influence space use see kerr et al 2016 the results of this study in line with the principles of complexity theory highlight that basic rules are often sufficient to reproduce emergent patterns additional movement rules such as the avoidance of shallow slow flow regions model 4c slightly improved spatial distribution predictions but not overall model performance model assessment and validation were carried out using a random subset of the fish movement data this constrains validation to the specific field site and range of hydrodynamic conditions that occurred during the study it is recommended that further validation of model 4 occurs using data acquired at other sites it is also worth noting that model 4 will only be applicable for predicting lamprey movements when they are actively migrating upstream during their spawning migration for other lifestages and movements e g for downstream moving transformers downstream searching behaviour or prey seeking at sea model 4 would be inappropriate as a lamprey s motivation and response to hydrodynamics is likely vastly different in these situations hydrodynamics are frequently a key predictor of space use by fish e g mcelroy et al 2012 goodwin et al 2014 silva et al 2020 but it was uncertain to what extent this would be the case for lamprey as they are thigmotactic and can move upstream by attaching to hard surfaces using their oral disk and resting between intermittent bouts of activity quintella et al 2009 kerr et al 2015 the results of this study highlight that hydrodynamics are a crucial predictor of lamprey space use as the flow dependant base model model 4 performed well whereas those where agents moved independent of flow i e using ground speed and direction distributions e g models 2 and 3 did not this result is important as identifying what data are needed to guide conservation efforts is critical not only in implementing effective mitigation but also for resource allocation and decision making e g flanagan et al 2018 the results of this study require validation at additional sites under a wider range of environmental conditions but current evidence suggests that when appropriate movement rules are used depth averaged flow velocity and direction i e available from a 2 d hydrodynamic model are sufficient to predict the key movement patterns of european river lamprey as they migrate upstream existing and widely used methods for predicting space use by lotic fish have typically been based on relatively simplistic statistical relationship between fish abundance and key environmental variables and they have been heavily criticised for this e g phabsim railsback 2016 kemp and katopodis 2017 but also see dray et al 2010 kerr et al 2016 one flaw of these simplistic methods is the assumption that preference for different environmental variables e g depth flow velocity overhead cover is independent mathur et al 1985 for example the phabsim methodology assumes that fish preference for certain depths is completely independent of the flow velocity at that location yet empirical evidence indicates this is flawed capra et al 2017 this study also provides direct evidence of the inaccuracy of this assumption for example a tentative assessment of the preference curves suggested that lamprey avoided both shallow and slow flow regions however two movement models model 4a and 4b where rules were implemented to cause agents to avoid such conditions independently performed poorly it was only when these environmental variables were treated in combination i e a rule was implemented where agents avoided areas where both depth and flow velocity were low model 4c that any improvement in model performance was observed the improvement in model performance was marginal isolated to lamprey lateral distribution but the results provide evidence for the inaccuracy of the assumption of independence of environmental variables they also highlight the importance of systematically testing movement hypotheses something that is required as part of the pom process and easily achieved using spatially explicit ibms mitigation measures to offset the impacts of aquatic habitat fragmentation are frequently ineffective e g brown et al 2013 lusardi and moyle 2017 often due to a poor understanding of fish behaviour in response to hydrodynamics resulting in a lack of transferability of technology kemp 2016b the methods used in this study a combination of field telemetry hydrodynamic modelling and pom enabled systematic identification of the key hydrodynamic and behavioural factors that governed the space use of the target species the results represent a substantial step forward in our knowledge on how the target species move as they approach an instream barrier and will aid in the development of more effective mitigation the methods used were effective and represent a useful framework for investigating similar relationships in other aquatic species credit authorship contribution statement j r kerr
