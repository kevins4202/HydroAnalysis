16790,both cyanobacterial bloom and antibiotic resistance have aggravated worldwide and posed a global threat to public health in recent years cyanobacteria can exhibit discrepancy between their resistance genotype and susceptible phenotype due to antibiotic heteroresistance which leads to difficulties in unambiguously classifying cyanobacterial strains as susceptible or resistant here we profiled the prevalence and mechanisms of antibiotic heteroresistance in cyanobacterial strains isolated from 50 sites across four eutrophicated lakes in china among 300 cyanobacterial isolates tested against 19 different antibiotics over 90 of cyanobacterial isolates exhibited hr to multiple antibiotics and 19 5 of isolate antibiotic interactions classified as susceptible by traditional minimum inhibitory concentration mic estimates were designated heteroresistant over 97 of these monoclonal hr cases were unstable with an increased resistance of subpopulations due to amplification of known resistance genes with high fitness cost wide type cyanobacterial isolates of synechococcus synechocystis anabaena and microcystis aeruginosa exposed to sub mic level of four antibiotics evolved high level resistance with little fitness cost resulting in stable polyclonal hr both stable polyclonal hr and unstable monoclonal hr observed in different cyanobacterial strains can be promoted under environmental levels of antibiotic pressure the highly prevalent and unstable monoclonal hr with the potential for susceptibility misclassification highlighted underestimation of cyanobacteria derived antibiotic resistance cost effective strategies should be developed to identify heteroresistance in cyanobacteria and to avoid false positive or negative results in traditional susceptibility testing

introduction the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance has become a global threat to public health particularly as a collateral covid 19 pandemic effect with one estimate predicting that it will cause 10 million worldwide deaths per year by 2050 and surpass deaths due to cancer o neill 2016 the extensive use of antibiotics and their subsequent release into treated and untreated sewage hospital wastewater aquaculture discharges and agricultural runoff has led to the widespread occurrence evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args in aquatic environments especially in china liu et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 yang et al 2018 the presence of various aquatic resistome elements potentially complicates the analysis of sources and sinks of args under antibiotic pressure zhu et al 2017 in recent years accelerated eutrophication has increased the frequency magnitude and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater and marine ecosystems worldwide huisman et al 2018 cyanobacteria as the ubiquitous group of gram negative photosynthetic prokaryotes with bacteria like structure and adaptation ability to environmental pressures are considered as a significant reservoir and source for the acquisition and propagation of args wang et al 2020 because of their ubiquity in aquatic environment cyanobacteria are exposed to antibiotic pollution and in straight contact with native bacteria harbouring multiple args and related mobile genetic elements mges dias et al 2019 cyanobacteria derived antibiotic resistance depends on genes located on chromosomes and on extrachromosomal mobile genetic elements plasmids transposons or integrons which carries multiple antibiotic resistance genes guo et al 2018 args disseminate through two pathways vertical transfer bacterial reproduction and horizontal transfer including conjugation transfer of mobile genetic elements transformation uptake of naked dna and transduction use of bacteriophages as transporters of genetic information perry et al 2014 conjugation mainly mediated by mobile genetic elements is considered as the principle mode for the dissemination of args among environmental bacteria s√∏rensen et al 2005 as the main vector carrying multiple args mobile genetic units such as transposable elements or plasmids play a critical role in mediating the horizontal transfer of dna into a wide range of gram negative bacteria and contributing to the bacterial dissemination of args among human or other animal pathogens wang et al 2015 cyanobacteria can acquire this type of genetic element harbouring args from other bacterial species cooccurring in their habitat further disseminating it to other microorganisms dias et al 2019 meanwhile approximately 90 bacterial species mostly human pathogens have been identified as naturally transformable johnsborg et al 2007 natural transformation for naked dna uptake and arg propagation occurs broadly for not only pathogenic bacteria but also resident bacteria in various environmental media overballe petersen et al 2013 both phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance deciphering the role of cyanobacteria in water resistome have been explored by field works and laboratory experiments dias et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 freshwater cyanobacteria may be naturally constitutively non susceptible to antibiotics or may acquire antibiotic non susceptibility due to environmental selection pressure by antibiotic exposure or to the transference of antibiotic resistance genes from bacteria dias et al 2015 some cyanobacterial strains exhibit low susceptibility to the majority of antibiotics due to their intrinsic resistance evolved resistance through spontaneous mutations under constant antibiotic selection or acquisition of args from cooccurring bacteria dias et al 2015 the presence of args and resistance mutations can result in phenotypic resistance generally predicting a correlation between bacterial genotype and phenotype lin et al 2020 surprisingly several cyanobacterial strains demonstrated apparent discrepancies between their susceptible phenotype and resistance genotype for specific antibiotics it is difficult to explain this seemingly contradictory fact that cyanobacterial strains deemed susceptible to antibiotics by evaluating minimum inhibitory concentrations mics using microdilution methodology may even in the absence of inherited resistance confer genotypic resistance to specific antibiotics dias et al 2019 these divergent observations complicate the analysis of genotyping results from pcr amplification and suggest a necessity to further understand the limitation of traditional antibiotic sensitivity testing ast approaches for cyanobacteria a potential reason for the limitation of using current mic estimates as the unique criterion for the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics is heteroresistance hr el halfawy and valvano 2015 identical bacterial cells in one population can exhibit antibiotic hr which is a phenotype in which a bacterial isolate contains subpopulations with reduced antibiotic susceptibility compared with that of the main population band et al 2019 the resistant subpopulations of cyanobacteria may have different origins that are the result of different genetic mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in antibiotic resistance phenotypes heteroresistance can be detected in populations that result from mixed infections of two genetically distinct populations susceptible and resistant or from rare spontaneous resistant mutants that slowly increase in proportion under antibiotic pressure in a population of susceptible cells polyclonal heteroresistance andersson et al 2019 in the case of polyclonal heteroresistance antibiotic susceptibility tests performed on pure clones would result in detection of a fully susceptible or fully resistant phenotype depending on which of the two populations resistant or susceptible the purified clone originated from el halfawy and valvano 2015 alternatively heterogeneity in resistance could also be generated from a single clone that differentiates into two populations susceptible and resistant at high frequency in the absence of antibiotic pressure monoclonal heteroresistance andersson et al 2019 in the case of monoclonal heteroresistance pure clones contain frequent spontaneous subpopulations of resistant cells and a pure culture from a purified clone displays a heteroresistance phenotype such heteroresistant populations lead to difficulties in unambiguously classifying bacteria as susceptible or resistant and eventually an underestimation of antibiotic resistance through traditional ast approaches using microdilution methodology van hal et al 2011 the hr prevalence for most antibiotics and its contribution to antibiotic treatment failure have been known in clinical bacteria mascellino et al 2017 nicoloff et al 2019 we hypothesize that heteroresistance hr within cyanobacterial isolates may lead to the misdiagnosis of cyanobacterial strains with a resistant subpopulation as fully susceptible however the prevalence and mechanism of hr in cyanobacteria for different classes of antibiotics are still largely unclear to address these issues we presented evidence for the high prevalence of hr among environmental cyanobacteria samples detected with diverse and abundant args we comprehensively investigated the genetic mechanism responsible for monoclonal and polyclonal hr in different cyanobacterial strains and demonstrated that most detected monoclonal hr cases could be attributed to unstable gene amplification of known args this study alerted the risk of this unstable and transient hr phenotype resulting in rapid reversion to susceptibility prior to laboratory test for potential resistance and thus underestimation of cyanobacteria derived resistome understanding the prevalence and mechanism of hr in cyanobacteria contributes to accurately evaluate the ecological risk of antibiotic resistance in the aquatic environment by using cyanobacteria as a model organism in view of ecotoxicology our findings explained the false negatives of resistant cyanobacterial cells influencing ast results reported by previous studies and emphasized the need to develop a cost efficient clinical laboratory strategy for hr identification to replace traditional mic estimates 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection a total of 50 sampling sites were carefully selected in taihu lake hongze lake chaohu lake and dianchi lake

water purification system bedford ma usa cyanobacterial strains from distinct genera were isolated from blooming areas and subjected to ast for resistance phenotype identification and population analysis profile pap test for heteroresistance examination respectively the cyanobacterial samples were subjected to successive rounds of serial dilution and streaked across bg11 agar plates the native isolates were successfully maintained in a laboratory culture chamber as stock cultures of axenic monostrains the stock cultures were incubated at 25 0 0 5 c under a 14 10 h light dark photoperiod with a light intensity of 50 5 Œºe m s the following wild type isolates were used as controls for paps and inocula for mutant selection synechococcus sp pcc 7942 synechocystis sp pcc 6803 anabaena sp pcc 7120 and microcystis aeruginosa pcc 7806 2 4 antibiotic sensitivity test an ast for each parent and all presumptive mutants was conducted as described previously dias et al 2015 with minor modification detailed in text s3 cyanobacterial cells from the stock cultures were plated and single colonies were randomly picked these colonies were organized by broth microdilutions in 96 well plates and were grown in a range of different antibiotic concentrations for 14 days each in triplicate the mic of single colonies from each population was considered the lowest antibiotic concentration that totally inhibited cyanobacterial cell growth the putative mic value was determined by visible growth in relation to controls the absence of undamaged cells and in some cases the inviability of the remaining cells after reinoculation the maintenance of antibiotic activity was verified by performing a quality control stability assay of using the bacterial standard strain e coli

dilutions of parallel growing cyanobacterial isolates were inoculated in 96 well plates supplemented with or without doubling dilutions of respective antibiotics were conducted as described previously band et al 2016 with minor modifications briefly bg11 broth media were made for each antibiotic at eight specific concentrations at 0 0 125 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 times the resistance level of the main population each in triplicate dual paps were prepared similarly with both drugs at the same seven concentrations of their respective antibiotics in each medium the frequency of cells growing eightfold above the highest concentration that did not affect the growth of the dominant population was defined as the hr frequency and calculated by dividing the cyanobacterial population growing in the presence of antibiotics by the total cell population without antibiotic selection schematic diagram shown in fig s2 hr prevalence is defined as the percentage of heteroresistant isolates among the tested isolates by paps an isolate was classified as resistant if the number of colonies that grew at the resistance level of the main population was at least 50 of the number that grew in the antibiotic free group a nonresistant isolate was classified as heteroresistant if the number of colonies that grew eightfold above the resistance level of the main population was at least 0 0001 1 in 106 of the number that grew in the antibiotic free group an isolate was classified as susceptible if it was classified as neither resistant nor heteroresistant 2 6 selection of resistant mutants at sub minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics the procedure for mutant selection experiments has been described previously wistrand yuen et al 2018 the evolution of the resistance level in response to the antibiotic selection ratio and subculturing passages was investigated by a central composite experimental design combined with response surface modeling the experimental and modeling methodology are described in texts s4 and s5 tables s12 s15 and fig s3 the antibiotic selection ratio defined as the ratio between the antibiotic selection concentration and parental strain mic ranged at five discrete levels between 0 001 and 0 5 a total of 25 subculturing passages were performed for all treatments each in five replicates the wild type cyanobacterial isolates used as inocula were prepared by diluting stock cultures and incubated in sterile bg11 broth medium without antibiotics aliquots 1 ml of exponentially growing cyanobacterial cultures at an initial density of 1 15 0 15 106 cells ml were transferred to 50 ml of fresh bg11 broth medium containing erythromycin ciprofloxacin amoxicillin or tetracycline at designed sub mic concentrations after 72 h of incubation 1 ml of the test medium with cyanobacterial cells was collected and subcultured in 50 ml of fresh bg11 medium containing the same concentrations of antibiotics for another 72 h e coli atcc 47076 was used as a quality control organism at each passage the cultures were examined for resistance development by ast after 25 successive passages presumptive resistant mutants at least four resistant colonies from each lineage were isolated using broth microdilution and cultured for paps and stability testing the proportion of confirmed resistant mutants is defined as the fraction of mutants present at the resistance level of the main population for each culture at least a 10 ml aliquot was pelleted and stored at 20 c for dna extraction 2 7 stability testing of antibiotic resistance antibiotic resistant colonies selected from pap test medium or mutant selection test medium were reisolated on similar antibiotic selective plates and grown in sterile bg11 medium supplemented with the same antibiotic selection pressure as the plate from which the resistant colonies originated for each test two to four colonies isolated from the subpopulation with decreased susceptibility were used mics were determined after 72 h of incubation of the selected colonies for each culture a 10 ml aliquot was collected centrifuged and stored at 20 c for dna extraction to test the stability of resistance the cultures were then grown for 50 successive passages 1 ml inoculated into 50 ml of bg11 broth medium for each passage without antibiotic selection schematic diagram shown in fig s4 parental strains were grown in the absence of antibiotics as a control to confirm that amplifications were present before antibiotic selection and not induced by the antibiotics the mics were examined for resistance development at each passage and the resistance was deemed unstable if the mic clearly decreased or reverted to that of the parental isolate in at least one of the cultures in the absence of antibiotics for fitness cost measurements the relative growth rates were followed and normalized to that of the parental hr isolate aliquots from each culture were collected for dna extraction as described above gene amplification levels amplification copy number per plasmid plasmid copy numbers were verified by qpcr 2 8 statistical analysis heatmaps were generated with qpcr data of arg absolute abundance expressed in copies per gram dry weight of cyanobacterial cells the relative abundance of args was calculated by normalizing arg gene copies to 16s rrna gene copies args 16s rrna the interaction network was constructed by using cytoscape 3 6 1 https cytoscape org to visualize the cooccurrence patterns between cyanobacterial taxa and args all possible pairwise spearman s rank

minneapolis mn usa 3 results 3 1 distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in cyanobacteria a total of 39 target genes 16s rrna transposase gene class 1 integron integrase gene and 36 args were detected in the cyanobacterial samples from 50 sites of four lakes fig 1 a these args conferring resistance to almost all major classes of antibiotics commonly administered to humans and animals represented all major resistance mechanisms antibiotic inactivation 36 efflux pumps 31 target protection 19 target replacement 8 and target alteration 6 fig s5 heatmap analysis showed that the args detected in these cyanobacteria samples were highly abundant ranging from 1 15 105 to 3 58 108 copies per gram of dry weight of cyanobacterial cells these args were commonly detected with lower abundance in surface water and sediments sampled from the four lakes table s2 major sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 sul2 tetracycline resistance genes teta tetb quinolone resistance genes qnrb and multidrug resistance genes oprj qach were consistently detected with relatively high abundances 106 copies per gram dry weight of cyanobacterial cells in the cyanobacterial samples the abundance of major args was significantly correlated with the concentration of sulfonamide and tetracycline residues detected in the study area fig s6 the cell density and the relative abundance of args in cyanobacteria samples were significantly higher in the bloom season than in the nonbloom season p 0 05 fig 1b and fig s7 the diversity of args detected in samples from the nonbloom area was higher than that in samples from the bloom area table s16 network analysis showed that synechococcus synechocystis anabaena and microcystis from the cyanobacterial families were most significantly correlated with arg and mge groups p 0 05 fig s8 principal component analysis pca of the arg distribution profile revealed that samples obtained from bloom and nonbloom areas clustered distinctly during the bloom season but did not differentiate during the nonbloom season fig 1c the relative abundances of args were significantly correlated with those of both the transposase and integron integrase genes p 0 05 fig 1d and e 3 2 prevalence of monoclonal heteroresistance in cyanobacterial isolates the interrogation of a collection of 300 isolates six isolates from each sampling site for their antibiotic susceptibility and hr using mic estimates and paps is shown in fig 2 among 39 900 conditions 300 isolates 19 antibiotics 7 antibiotic concentrations for the proportion of surviving cyanobacterial cells hr was observed for each tested antibiotic and the proportion of isolates exhibiting hr varied widely for different antibiotics ranging from 0 8 for ampicillin to 67 8 for nalidixic acid fig 2a notably 99 of the tested isolates were heteroresistant to at least one antibiotic and approximately 90 exhibited hr to at least two antibiotics fig 2b the average of the pap curves for isolate antibiotic interactions classified as susceptible or resistant by ast were plotted fig 2c the average pap curve for isolates classified as susceptible by ast but heteroresistant by pap exhibited an average of five logs of killing at the resistance level of the main population while those classified as susceptible by both ast and pap demonstrated six logs of killing those designated resistant by ast but heteroresistant by pap had at least two logs of killing at the resistance level of the main population a total of 78 3 of the isolate antibiotic interactions were classified as resistant by ast and 21 7 were classified as susceptible fig 2d however 20 of the interactions classified as resistant by ast and 19 5 of those classified as susceptible by ast were actually heteroresistant fig 2c overall paps revealed that cyanobacterial samples exhibited hr in 19 9 of the interactions fig 2d the investigation of all 171 dual antibiotic combinations of 19 antibiotics through a total of 1 368 tests with a subset of eight isolates exhibiting multiple hr to the variety of antibiotics is given in fig 2e targeting hr classified as susceptible by ast hr hr s resulted in greater killing than targeting hr classified as resistant by ast hr hr r antibiotic combinations to which an isolate was classified as susceptible by ast were highly effective in reducing cyanobacterial levels 99 4 killed by six logs when the combination classified as susceptible by ast was segregated into those involving two antibiotics to which the given isolate was designated heteroresistant by pap hr hr the reduction in cyanobacterial levels was higher than the reduction observed using only the single antibiotic to which the given isolate was heteroresistant hr alone table s17 however only 86 9 of hr hr combinations killed six logs of cyanobacteria cells when the combination classified as susceptible by ast involved two antibiotics to which a given isolate was designated heteroresistant by pap hr hr 3 3 evolution of polyclonal heteroresistance in wild type cyanobacterial strains a resistance selection experiment in which antibiotic sensitive cyanobacterial strains were separately exposed to sub mic levels of four antibiotics showed that the resistance level increased dramatically in a stepwise fashion over time with all parallel populations showing strikingly similar qualitative and quantitative evolutionary pathways fig 3 a ciprofloxacin resistance in anabaena and synechocystis and tetracycline resistance in synechococcus and synechocystis emerged consistently between six and eight passages while other resistant variants were generated before the fifth passage in all four tested strains at the end of 25 serial subculturing passages the mic values of the evolved strains for the antibiotics erythromycin ciprofloxacin amoxicillin and tetracycline to which they evolved resistance micres increased by 1 280 1 600 8 000 and 640 fold compared to the mics of their parental susceptible strains micsusc respectively further analyses of the resistance levels of the selected 0 008 5 38 mutant clones with increased resistance through single colony isolation and purification from five independent lineages are shown in fig 3b hr was observed with a prevalence of 88 100 in all 16 cyanobacteria antibiotic combinations in most lineages the populations were stably heterogeneous with regard to resistance containing heteroresistant subpopulations with frequencies varying from 2 9 10 8 to 6 10 2 at the antibiotic concentration corresponding to eightfold above the resistance level of the main population we investigated the interactive effect of the antibiotic selection ratio and subculturing passages on the development of hr in these cyanobacterial strains the hr frequency had a significant positive relation with the antibiotic selection ratio and subculturing passage number p 0 05 fig 3c with the selection ratio ranging from 0 001 to 0 5 the passage at which hr emerged shifted from 19 to 3 and the maximum value of evolved hr frequency increased from 5 7 10 4 to 6 45 10 2 3 4 stability of monoclonal heteroresistance in the absence of antibiotic selection the assays of 50 randomly resistant colonies with decreased susceptibility isolated from the subpopulations of confirmed hr cases in paps for hr stability are shown in fig 4 among 171 antibiotic isolate hr combinations the resistance level of the subpopulations was stable only in four cases 2 3 after 50 successive passages in the absence of antibiotics while the resistance of the remaining 167 cases 97 7 was unstable fig 4a to assess the growth rate of parental heteroresistant isolates resistant clones selected after growth were compared with antibiotics and revertants selected in the absence of antibiotics to determine whether reversion of a fitness cost is important for instability in hr cases fig 4b among nine cyanobacterial strains the resistant clones had a high fitness cost 23 62 that was partially compensated in the revertants 18 51 faster growth than the resistant clones from which they evolved to determine the genetic mechanism behind the most common unstable hr phenotype we performed qpcr of known resistance genes on the parental heteroresistant strain resistant clones with decreased susceptibility and revertants fig 4c amplification of known resistance genes with antibiotic selection was recorded in all nine cyanobacterial genera and the upper copy number level of the amplified units varied from 2 9 synechococcus to 61 8 anabaena in the absence of antibiotic selection the upper amplification level of revertants decreased by 1 3 47 6 fold compared to that of resistant clones the resistance level mic partially or completely reverted back to the level of parental isolates in the absence of antibiotic selection as the summary schema describing hr mechanisms shows in fig 4d the monoclonal hr phenotype in cyanobacterial strains is usually accompanied by the highly unstable amplification of known resistance genes and a high fitness cost while polyclonal hr related to mutations improving resistance and having little to no effect on fitness is genetically stable 4 discussion the traditional ast method assays the growth of the entire cyanobacterial population in the presence of different antibiotics by performing liquid media based diagnostics and classifies isolate antibiotic pairs as only resistant or susceptible difficult to diagnose with standard estimates of mic hr is likely to cause common misdiagnosis of strains with a resistant subpopulation as fully susceptible by ast it is therefore important to reveal the prevalence and mechanism of hr in cyanobacteria for different classes of antibiotics and to explore the reason behind the discrepancy of phenotypic and genotypic resistance of cyanobacteria by using a strict definition of hr and a systematic approach of paps our study indicated that hr was widespread and applicable to most available antibiotics and a large proportion of cyanobacteria a significant proportion of the isolate antibiotic interactions designated resistant by ast should be attributed to hr although args and mges were found to be highly prevalent in the tested cyanobacteria samples over 20 of isolate antibiotic pairs were designated susceptible by ast the detected hr was associated with higher frequency resistant subpopulations 1 in 100 cells whereas the undetected hr was associated with lower frequency resistant subpopulations 1 in 10 000 cells previous studies have discussed the synergistic effect of antibiotic combinations on cyanobacteria and found that their logs of killing were greater than what would be predicted using the mic for each antibiotic alone gonz√°lez pleiter et al 2013 wang et al 2019 in this study combination therapy with two antibiotics targeting hr hr hr resulted in significantly greater killing than monotherapy with a single antibiotic to which an isolate was heteroresistant hr alone which could be described as synergism antibiotic combinations classified as susceptible by ast targeting multiple hr hr hr s interactions led to decreased logs of killing of cyanobacterial cells compared to that of combinations targeting homogenous susceptibility s s s interactions our results indicated that the synergistic efficacy of the antibiotic combination in reducing cyanobacterial levels and preventing subsequent growth might depend on multiple hr instead of designating hr instances as homogenous susceptibility the quantification of the frequency of the resistant subpopulation in hr would be essential when evaluating the synergism of antibiotic combination regimens we exposed susceptible wild type cyanobacteria to constant sub mic levels of antibiotics for 25 passages and found that high level resistance up to 8000 fold micsusc evolved in several independent lineages our study revealed that cyanobacteria could also evolve with high level resistance under very weak and constant antibiotic selective pressure with selection ratios lower than 1 since the possibility of preexisting hr in these tested wild type isolates or horizontal gene transfer during the selection experiment has been ruled out de novo selected gene mutations were most likely the single route contributing to hr development in a subpopulation of cells for mutants of a single strain generated under our experimental design in the enclosed system the fraction of evolved hr at sub mic concentrations was found to be positively correlated with the strength of selection pressure selection ratio which was in line with a previous hypothesis ge et al 2017 the selective effect for hr differed among strains and genera which could be partially explained by the different genetic backgrounds resistance characteristics types of mutations conferring resistance and fitness costs defined as reduced competitiveness in the absence of antibiotics associated with the mutations at low levels of antibiotic pressure the main driving force of resistance selection shifts from the resistance to fitness cost of mutations in the present study the lowest selection ratios among these tested strains that still generated resistant mutants were in the range of 1 10 3 1 25 10 3 which were lower than those reported in e coli for ciprofloxacin selection 4 35 10 3 and in salmonella typhimurium for tetracycline 1 10 2 gullberg et al 2011 the minimal selective concentration msc defines the antibiotic concentration needed to overcome the fitness cost of each resistance determinant and is expressed as a fraction of the micsusc the lower anticipated msc is associated with a smaller fitness cost that favors the accumulation of mutants at sub mic concentrations andersson and hughes 2014 explaining why the given selection concentration showed a higher preference for cyanobacterial strains with a lower micsusc i e higher selection ratio taking into consideration both the micsusc and msc the higher selection ratio is therefore a significant parameter for the stronger selective effects of resistance mutations at sub mic concentrations of antibiotics the stability of the polyclonal hr was tested to verify that the resistance phenotype of clones isolated from the resistant subpopulation did not decrease following growth for 50 successive subculturing passages in the absence of antibiotics generally frequent mutation and gene amplification are two types of mutation mechanism that lead to the generation of antibiotic heteroresistance the frequent mutations that confer resistance with low or no fitness cost are genetically stable point mutations insertion sequence insertions and small deletions andersson et al 2019 the stable polyclonal hr could be attributed to low fitness cost mutations which accumulated and evolved over many generations through the selection process the cost of resistance has to be compensated by the reduction in growth of the susceptible strains induced by the antibiotic except for the two cases detected with unstable hr microcystis mutants selected by amoxicillin and tetracycline mutant growth rate reduction in comparison to the parent varied in the range of 0 2 to 4 1 among the tested cyanobacterial strains previous studies have pointed out that the variation in fitness cost incurred by different types of mutations is one of the critical factors for resistance selection at sub mic concentrations of antibiotics andersson and hughes 2014 gullberg et al 2011 the fitness costs of various resistant mutants ranged from 0 2 to 3 among e coli and s typhimurium mutants selected by ciprofloxacin and tetracycline sandegren 2014 which were slightly higher than the fitness cost of stable resistant mutants detected in our tested cyanobacterial strains at sub mic levels resistant mutants conferring fitness costs lower than the growth reduction in susceptible populations are competitive gullberg et al 2011 it is interesting to note that despite the low antibiotic concentrations used only those mutants exhibiting increasing resistance levels but very low fitness costs were enriched antibiotic concentrations chosen for the mutant selection experiment were the same as the msc determined in the competitions between wild type and mutant isolates and the enriched resistant cyanobacteria likely carried resistance mutations with a fitness cost that was significantly lower than that of the previously studied mutations since the resulting resistance selected for higher fitness is less likely to reverse in the absence of antibiotics andersson and hughes 2010 it could be therefore predicted that sub mic selected resistant mutants in cyanobacterial populations possessing little fitness cost or mutations that compensate for the fitness cost and do not affect the resistant phenotype would be more stable than those selected by high concentrations of antibiotics in contrast to polyclonal hr monoclonal hr observed with pure cyanobacterial isolates generating frequent spontaneous subpopulations of susceptible and resistant cells when grown in the absence of antibiotics due to the reversibility of the resistance phenotype can be attributed to the unstable genetic mechanism our results demonstrate that over 97 of the hr cases observed in these environmental isolates selected from paps are unstable unstable heteroresistance involving an intrinsic instability of the resistance mutation caused by spontaneous unstable tandem amplification of resistance genes is the most common mechanism underlying heteroresistance in gram negative species such as cyanobacteria nicoloff et al 2019 in the presence of antibiotic selection resistant cells with gene amplification of resistance genes on either plasmids or chromosomes were selected and enriched while the absence of antibiotic favors the growth of susceptible revertants with reduced gene copy number the reduction in copy number and resistance level could be explained by the fitness costs associated with gene amplification where cyanobacterial revertants lacking gene amplifications grew faster in the absence of antibiotic selection than resistant mutants with amplifications spontaneous unstable gene amplification of resistance genes has been reported as the most common mechanism responsible for unstable hr in gram negative species such as e coli schechter et al 2018 salmonella enterica hjort et al 2016 acinetobacter baumannii anderson et al 2018 and klebsiella pneumonia nicoloff et al 2019 genetic amplifications confer a fitness cost and they readily segregate to lower copy numbers in the absence of selective pressure adler et al 2014 our data indicate that the mutations causing resistance in unstable hr cases are both costly and unstable and that fitness costs associated with gene amplification act as drivers for the population to revert to susceptibility in the absence of antibiotic selection the possibility of evolution from resistant mutants initially carrying unstable amplifications to stable mutants with little fitness cost during growth with antibiotic selection should be considered other types of mutations linked to point mutations insertion sequence insertions or small deletions conferring a high fitness cost have been proposed as possible mechanisms for non amplification driven unstable hr andersson et al 2019 but are unlikely to be the main mechanism for the detected unstable hr in this study the risk of reversion to a susceptible phenotype depends on the number of generations grown under non antibiotic selective conditions and the rate of amplification loss which in turn depends on the intrinsic loss rate and the fitness costs associated with the amplification has been described andersson et al 2019 amplification driven unstable hr in cyanobacteria may result in rapid reversion to the original genotype and phenotype in the absence of antibiotic pressure before the standard ast 5 conclusions our work is one of the first to highlight how hr in cyanobacteria and its instability are so prevalent and difficult to diagnose with traditional ast leading to a common misdiagnosis of cyanobacterial strains with a resistant subpopulation as fully susceptible notably both the evolution of high level resistance causing stable polyclonal hr and the unstable gene amplification involved in monoclonal hr observed in different cyanobacterial strains can be promoted at environmental levels of antibiotic pressure our discovery of unstable gene amplification associated monoclonal hr mechanisms further accentuates the underestimation of cyanobacteria derived resistance illustrating a major limitation of using current mic estimates as the unique criterion for determining the antibiotic susceptibility of cyanobacteria and emphasizing the significance of developing rapid and facile methods to identify hr in cyanobacterial samples polyclonal hr causing problems in diagnosing resistance in some cyanobacterial species called for the improvement of sampling and analysis of mixed populations that contain small resistant subpopulations despite being time consuming and costly improved diagnostics allowing the detection of hr with high specificity and sensitivity such as paps should be

16790,both cyanobacterial bloom and antibiotic resistance have aggravated worldwide and posed a global threat to public health in recent years cyanobacteria can exhibit discrepancy between their resistance genotype and susceptible phenotype due to antibiotic heteroresistance which leads to difficulties in unambiguously classifying cyanobacterial strains as susceptible or resistant here we profiled the prevalence and mechanisms of antibiotic heteroresistance in cyanobacterial strains isolated from 50 sites across four eutrophicated lakes in china among 300 cyanobacterial isolates tested against 19 different antibiotics over 90 of cyanobacterial isolates exhibited hr to multiple antibiotics and 19 5 of isolate antibiotic interactions classified as susceptible by traditional minimum inhibitory concentration mic estimates were designated heteroresistant over 97 of these monoclonal hr cases were unstable with an increased resistance of subpopulations due to amplification of known resistance genes with high fitness cost wide type cyanobacterial isolates of synechococcus synechocystis anabaena and microcystis aeruginosa exposed to sub mic level of four antibiotics evolved high level resistance with little fitness cost resulting in stable polyclonal hr both stable polyclonal hr and unstable monoclonal hr observed in different cyanobacterial strains can be promoted under environmental levels of antibiotic pressure the highly prevalent and unstable monoclonal hr with the potential for susceptibility misclassification highlighted underestimation of cyanobacteria derived antibiotic resistance cost effective strategies should be developed to identify heteroresistance in cyanobacteria and to avoid false positive or negative results in traditional susceptibility testing

introduction the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance has become a global threat to public health particularly as a collateral covid 19 pandemic effect with one estimate predicting that it will cause 10 million worldwide deaths per year by 2050 and surpass deaths due to cancer o neill 2016 the extensive use of antibiotics and their subsequent release into treated and untreated sewage hospital wastewater aquaculture discharges and agricultural runoff has led to the widespread occurrence evolution and dissemination of antibiotic resistance genes args in aquatic environments especially in china liu et al 2018 qiao et al 2018 yang et al 2018 the presence of various aquatic resistome elements potentially complicates the analysis of sources and sinks of args under antibiotic pressure zhu et al 2017 in recent years accelerated eutrophication has increased the frequency magnitude and duration of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater and marine ecosystems worldwide huisman et al 2018 cyanobacteria as the ubiquitous group of gram negative photosynthetic prokaryotes with bacteria like structure and adaptation ability to environmental pressures are considered as a significant reservoir and source for the acquisition and propagation of args wang et al 2020 because of their ubiquity in aquatic environment cyanobacteria are exposed to antibiotic pollution and in straight contact with native bacteria harbouring multiple args and related mobile genetic elements mges dias et al 2019 cyanobacteria derived antibiotic resistance depends on genes located on chromosomes and on extrachromosomal mobile genetic elements plasmids transposons or integrons which carries multiple antibiotic resistance genes guo et al 2018 args disseminate through two pathways vertical transfer bacterial reproduction and horizontal transfer including conjugation transfer of mobile genetic elements transformation uptake of naked dna and transduction use of bacteriophages as transporters of genetic information perry et al 2014 conjugation mainly mediated by mobile genetic elements is considered as the principle mode for the dissemination of args among environmental bacteria s√∏rensen et al 2005 as the main vector carrying multiple args mobile genetic units such as transposable elements or plasmids play a critical role in mediating the horizontal transfer of dna into a wide range of gram negative bacteria and contributing to the bacterial dissemination of args among human or other animal pathogens wang et al 2015 cyanobacteria can acquire this type of genetic element harbouring args from other bacterial species cooccurring in their habitat further disseminating it to other microorganisms dias et al 2019 meanwhile approximately 90 bacterial species mostly human pathogens have been identified as naturally transformable johnsborg et al 2007 natural transformation for naked dna uptake and arg propagation occurs broadly for not only pathogenic bacteria but also resident bacteria in various environmental media overballe petersen et al 2013 both phenotypic and genotypic antibiotic resistance deciphering the role of cyanobacteria in water resistome have been explored by field works and laboratory experiments dias et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 freshwater cyanobacteria may be naturally constitutively non susceptible to antibiotics or may acquire antibiotic non susceptibility due to environmental selection pressure by antibiotic exposure or to the transference of antibiotic resistance genes from bacteria dias et al 2015 some cyanobacterial strains exhibit low susceptibility to the majority of antibiotics due to their intrinsic resistance evolved resistance through spontaneous mutations under constant antibiotic selection or acquisition of args from cooccurring bacteria dias et al 2015 the presence of args and resistance mutations can result in phenotypic resistance generally predicting a correlation between bacterial genotype and phenotype lin et al 2020 surprisingly several cyanobacterial strains demonstrated apparent discrepancies between their susceptible phenotype and resistance genotype for specific antibiotics it is difficult to explain this seemingly contradictory fact that cyanobacterial strains deemed susceptible to antibiotics by evaluating minimum inhibitory concentrations mics using microdilution methodology may even in the absence of inherited resistance confer genotypic resistance to specific antibiotics dias et al 2019 these divergent observations complicate the analysis of genotyping results from pcr amplification and suggest a necessity to further understand the limitation of traditional antibiotic sensitivity testing ast approaches for cyanobacteria a potential reason for the limitation of using current mic estimates as the unique criterion for the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics is heteroresistance hr el halfawy and valvano 2015 identical bacterial cells in one population can exhibit antibiotic hr which is a phenotype in which a bacterial isolate contains subpopulations with reduced antibiotic susceptibility compared with that of the main population band et al 2019 the resistant subpopulations of cyanobacteria may have different origins that are the result of different genetic mechanisms underlying heterogeneity in antibiotic resistance phenotypes heteroresistance can be detected in populations that result from mixed infections of two genetically distinct populations susceptible and resistant or from rare spontaneous resistant mutants that slowly increase in proportion under antibiotic pressure in a population of susceptible cells polyclonal heteroresistance andersson et al 2019 in the case of polyclonal heteroresistance antibiotic susceptibility tests performed on pure clones would result in detection of a fully susceptible or fully resistant phenotype depending on which of the two populations resistant or susceptible the purified clone originated from el halfawy and valvano 2015 alternatively heterogeneity in resistance could also be generated from a single clone that differentiates into two populations susceptible and resistant at high frequency in the absence of antibiotic pressure monoclonal heteroresistance andersson et al 2019 in the case of monoclonal heteroresistance pure clones contain frequent spontaneous subpopulations of resistant cells and a pure culture from a purified clone displays a heteroresistance phenotype such heteroresistant populations lead to difficulties in unambiguously classifying bacteria as susceptible or resistant and eventually an underestimation of antibiotic resistance through traditional ast approaches using microdilution methodology van hal et al 2011 the hr prevalence for most antibiotics and its contribution to antibiotic treatment failure have been known in clinical bacteria mascellino et al 2017 nicoloff et al 2019 we hypothesize that heteroresistance hr within cyanobacterial isolates may lead to the misdiagnosis of cyanobacterial strains with a resistant subpopulation as fully susceptible however the prevalence and mechanism of hr in cyanobacteria for different classes of antibiotics are still largely unclear to address these issues we presented evidence for the high prevalence of hr among environmental cyanobacteria samples detected with diverse and abundant args we comprehensively investigated the genetic mechanism responsible for monoclonal and polyclonal hr in different cyanobacterial strains and demonstrated that most detected monoclonal hr cases could be attributed to unstable gene amplification of known args this study alerted the risk of this unstable and transient hr phenotype resulting in rapid reversion to susceptibility prior to laboratory test for potential resistance and thus underestimation of cyanobacteria derived resistome understanding the prevalence and mechanism of hr in cyanobacteria contributes to accurately evaluate the ecological risk of antibiotic resistance in the aquatic environment by using cyanobacteria as a model organism in view of ecotoxicology our findings explained the false negatives of resistant cyanobacterial cells influencing ast results reported by previous studies and emphasized the need to develop a cost efficient clinical laboratory strategy for hr identification to replace traditional mic estimates 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites and sample collection a total of 50 sampling sites were carefully selected in taihu lake hongze lake chaohu lake and dianchi lake which are the four most eutrophic freshwater lakes with serious cyanobacterial blooms in china introduction of the study area and sampling sites is shown in text s1 fig s1 and table s1 intensive

minor modification detailed in text s3 cyanobacterial cells from the stock cultures were plated and single colonies were randomly picked these colonies were organized by broth microdilutions in 96 well plates and were grown in a range of different antibiotic concentrations for 14 days each in triplicate the mic of single colonies from each population was considered the lowest antibiotic

dilutions of parallel growing cyanobacterial isolates were inoculated in 96 well plates supplemented with or without doubling dilutions of respective antibiotics were conducted as described previously band et al 2016 with minor modifications briefly bg11 broth media were made for each antibiotic at eight specific concentrations at 0 0 125 0 25 0 5 1 0 2 0 4 0 and 8 0 times the resistance level of the main population each in triplicate dual paps were prepared similarly with both drugs at the same seven concentrations of their respective antibiotics in each medium the frequency of cells growing eightfold above the highest concentration that did not affect the growth of the dominant population was defined as the hr frequency and calculated by dividing the cyanobacterial population growing in the presence of antibiotics by the total cell population without antibiotic selection schematic diagram shown in fig s2 hr prevalence is defined as the percentage of heteroresistant isolates among the tested isolates by paps an isolate was classified as resistant if the number of colonies that grew at the resistance level of the main population was at least 50 of the number that grew in the antibiotic free group a nonresistant isolate was classified as heteroresistant if the number of colonies that grew eightfold above the resistance level of the main population was at least 0 0001 1 in 106 of the number that grew in the antibiotic free group an isolate was classified as susceptible if it was classified as neither resistant nor heteroresistant 2 6 selection of resistant mutants at sub minimal inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics the procedure for mutant selection experiments has been described previously wistrand yuen et al 2018 the evolution of the resistance level in response to the antibiotic selection ratio and subculturing passages was investigated by a central composite experimental design combined with response surface modeling the experimental and modeling methodology are described in texts s4 and s5 tables s12 s15 and fig s3 the antibiotic selection ratio defined as the ratio between the antibiotic selection concentration and parental strain mic ranged at five discrete levels between 0 001 and 0 5 a total of 25 subculturing passages were performed for all treatments each in five replicates the wild type cyanobacterial isolates used as inocula were prepared by diluting stock cultures and incubated in sterile bg11 broth medium without antibiotics aliquots 1 ml of exponentially growing cyanobacterial cultures at an initial density of 1 15 0 15 106 cells ml were transferred to 50 ml of fresh bg11 broth medium containing erythromycin ciprofloxacin amoxicillin or tetracycline at designed sub mic concentrations after 72 h of incubation 1 ml of the test medium with cyanobacterial cells was collected and subcultured in 50 ml of fresh bg11 medium containing the same concentrations of antibiotics for another 72 h e coli atcc 47076 was used as a quality control organism at each passage the cultures were examined for resistance development by ast after 25 successive passages presumptive resistant mutants at least four resistant colonies from each lineage were isolated using broth microdilution and cultured for paps and stability testing the proportion of confirmed resistant mutants is defined as the fraction of mutants present at the resistance level of the main population for each culture at least a 10 ml aliquot was pelleted and stored at 20 c for dna extraction 2 7 stability testing of antibiotic resistance antibiotic resistant colonies selected from pap test medium or mutant selection test medium were reisolated on similar antibiotic selective plates and grown in sterile bg11 medium supplemented with the same antibiotic selection pressure as the plate from which the resistant colonies originated for each test two to four colonies isolated from the subpopulation with decreased susceptibility were used mics were determined after 72 h of incubation of the selected colonies for each culture a 10 ml aliquot was collected centrifuged and stored at 20 c for dna extraction to test the stability of resistance the cultures were then grown for 50 successive passages 1 ml inoculated into 50 ml of bg11 broth medium for each passage without antibiotic selection schematic diagram shown in fig s4 parental strains were grown in the absence of antibiotics as a control to confirm that amplifications were present before antibiotic selection and not induced by the antibiotics the mics were examined for resistance development at each passage and the resistance was deemed unstable if the mic clearly decreased or reverted to that of the parental isolate in at least one of the cultures in the absence of antibiotics for fitness cost measurements the relative growth rates were followed and normalized to that of the parental hr isolate aliquots from each culture were collected for dna extraction as described above gene amplification levels amplification copy number per plasmid plasmid copy numbers were verified by qpcr 2 8 statistical analysis heatmaps were generated with qpcr data of arg absolute abundance expressed in copies per gram dry weight of cyanobacterial cells the relative abundance of args was calculated by normalizing arg gene copies to 16s rrna gene copies args 16s rrna the interaction network was constructed by using cytoscape 3 6 1 https cytoscape org to visualize the cooccurrence patterns between cyanobacterial taxa and args all possible pairwise spearman s rank

detected in the cyanobacterial samples from 50 sites of four lakes fig 1 a these args conferring resistance to almost all major classes of antibiotics commonly administered to humans and animals represented all major resistance mechanisms antibiotic inactivation 36 efflux pumps 31 target protection 19 target replacement 8 and target alteration 6 fig s5 heatmap analysis showed that the args detected in these cyanobacteria samples were highly abundant ranging from 1 15 105 to 3 58 108 copies per gram of dry weight of cyanobacterial cells these args were commonly detected with lower abundance in surface water and sediments sampled from the four lakes table s2 major sulfonamide resistance genes sul1 sul2 tetracycline resistance genes teta tetb quinolone resistance genes qnrb and multidrug resistance genes oprj qach were consistently detected with relatively high abundances 106 copies per gram dry weight of cyanobacterial cells in the cyanobacterial samples the abundance of major args was significantly correlated with the concentration of sulfonamide and tetracycline residues detected in the study area fig s6 the cell density and the relative abundance of args in cyanobacteria samples were significantly higher in the bloom season than in the nonbloom season p 0 05 fig 1b and fig s7 the diversity of args detected in samples from the nonbloom area was higher than that in samples from the bloom area table s16 network analysis showed that synechococcus synechocystis anabaena and microcystis from the cyanobacterial families were most significantly correlated with arg and mge groups p 0 05 fig s8 principal component analysis pca of the arg distribution profile revealed that samples obtained from bloom and nonbloom areas clustered distinctly during the bloom season but did not differentiate during the nonbloom season fig 1c the relative abundances of args were significantly correlated with those of both the transposase and integron integrase genes p 0 05 fig 1d and e 3 2 prevalence of monoclonal heteroresistance in cyanobacterial isolates the interrogation of a collection of 300 isolates six isolates from each sampling site for their antibiotic susceptibility and hr using mic estimates and paps is shown in fig 2 among 39 900 conditions 300 isolates 19 antibiotics 7 antibiotic concentrations for the proportion of surviving cyanobacterial cells hr was observed for each tested antibiotic and the proportion of isolates exhibiting hr varied widely for different antibiotics ranging from 0 8 for ampicillin to 67 8 for nalidixic acid fig 2a notably 99 of the tested isolates were heteroresistant to at least one antibiotic and approximately 90 exhibited hr to at least two antibiotics fig 2b the average of the pap curves for isolate antibiotic interactions classified as susceptible or resistant by ast were plotted fig 2c the average pap curve for isolates classified as susceptible by ast but heteroresistant by pap exhibited an average of five logs of killing at the resistance level of the main population while those classified as susceptible by both ast and pap demonstrated six logs of killing those designated resistant by ast but heteroresistant by pap had at least two logs of killing at the resistance level of the main population a total of 78 3 of the isolate antibiotic interactions were classified as resistant by ast and 21 7 were classified as susceptible fig 2d however 20 of the interactions classified as resistant by ast and 19 5 of those classified as susceptible by ast were actually heteroresistant fig 2c overall paps revealed that cyanobacterial samples exhibited hr in 19 9 of the interactions fig 2d the investigation of all 171 dual antibiotic combinations of 19 antibiotics through a total of 1 368 tests with a subset of eight isolates exhibiting multiple hr to the variety of antibiotics is given in fig 2e targeting hr classified as susceptible by ast hr hr s resulted in greater killing than targeting hr classified as resistant by ast hr hr r antibiotic combinations to which an isolate was classified as susceptible by ast were highly effective in reducing cyanobacterial levels 99 4 killed by six logs when the combination classified as susceptible by ast was segregated into those involving two antibiotics to which the given isolate was designated heteroresistant by pap hr hr the reduction in cyanobacterial levels was higher than the reduction observed using only the single antibiotic to which the given isolate was heteroresistant hr alone table s17 however only 86 9 of hr hr combinations killed six logs of cyanobacteria cells when the combination classified as susceptible by ast involved two antibiotics to which a given isolate was designated heteroresistant by pap hr hr 3 3 evolution of polyclonal heteroresistance in wild type cyanobacterial strains a resistance selection experiment in which antibiotic sensitive cyanobacterial strains were separately exposed to sub mic levels of four antibiotics showed that the resistance level increased dramatically in a stepwise fashion over time with all parallel populations showing strikingly similar qualitative and quantitative evolutionary pathways fig 3 a ciprofloxacin resistance in anabaena and synechocystis and tetracycline resistance in synechococcus and synechocystis emerged consistently between six and eight passages while other resistant variants were generated before the fifth passage in all four tested strains at the end of 25 serial subculturing passages the mic values of the evolved strains for the antibiotics erythromycin ciprofloxacin amoxicillin and tetracycline to which they evolved resistance micres increased by 1 280 1 600 8 000 and 640 fold compared to the mics of their parental susceptible strains micsusc respectively further analyses of the resistance levels of the selected 0 008 5 38 mutant clones with increased resistance through single colony isolation and purification from five independent lineages are shown in fig 3b hr was observed with a prevalence of 88 100 in all 16 cyanobacteria antibiotic combinations in most lineages the populations were stably heterogeneous with regard to resistance containing heteroresistant subpopulations with frequencies varying from 2 9 10 8 to 6 10 2 at the antibiotic concentration corresponding to eightfold above the resistance level of the main population we investigated the interactive effect of the antibiotic selection ratio and subculturing passages on the development of hr in these cyanobacterial strains the hr frequency had a significant positive relation with the antibiotic selection ratio and subculturing passage number p 0 05 fig 3c with the selection ratio ranging from 0 001 to 0 5 the passage at which hr emerged shifted from 19 to 3 and the maximum value of evolved hr frequency increased from 5 7 10 4 to 6 45 10 2 3 4 stability of monoclonal heteroresistance in the absence of antibiotic selection the assays of 50 randomly resistant colonies with decreased susceptibility isolated from the subpopulations of confirmed hr cases in paps for hr stability are shown in fig 4 among 171 antibiotic isolate hr combinations the resistance level of the subpopulations was stable only in four cases 2 3 after 50 successive passages in the absence of antibiotics while the resistance of the remaining 167 cases 97 7 was unstable fig 4a to assess the growth rate of parental heteroresistant isolates resistant clones selected after growth were compared with antibiotics and revertants selected in the absence of antibiotics to determine whether reversion of a fitness cost is important for instability in hr cases fig 4b among nine cyanobacterial strains the resistant clones had a high fitness cost 23 62 that was partially compensated in the revertants 18 51 faster growth than the resistant clones from which they evolved to determine the genetic mechanism behind the most common unstable hr phenotype we performed qpcr of known resistance genes on the parental heteroresistant strain resistant clones with decreased susceptibility and revertants fig 4c amplification of known resistance genes with antibiotic selection was recorded in all nine cyanobacterial genera and the upper copy number level of the amplified units varied from 2 9 synechococcus to 61 8 anabaena in the absence of antibiotic selection the upper amplification level of revertants decreased by 1 3 47 6 fold compared to that of resistant clones the resistance level mic partially or completely reverted back to the level of parental isolates in the absence of antibiotic selection as the summary schema describing hr mechanisms shows in fig 4d the monoclonal hr phenotype in cyanobacterial strains is usually accompanied by the highly unstable amplification of known resistance genes and a high fitness cost while polyclonal hr related to mutations improving resistance and having little to no effect on fitness is genetically stable 4 discussion the traditional ast method assays the growth of the entire cyanobacterial population in the presence of different antibiotics by performing liquid media based diagnostics and classifies isolate antibiotic pairs as only resistant or susceptible difficult to diagnose with standard estimates of mic hr is likely to cause common misdiagnosis of strains with a resistant subpopulation as fully susceptible by ast it is therefore important to reveal the prevalence and mechanism of hr in cyanobacteria for different classes of antibiotics and to explore the reason behind the discrepancy of phenotypic and genotypic resistance of cyanobacteria by using a strict definition of hr and a systematic approach of paps our study indicated that hr was widespread and applicable to most available antibiotics and a large proportion of cyanobacteria a significant proportion of the isolate antibiotic interactions designated resistant by ast should be attributed to hr although args and mges were found to be highly prevalent in the tested cyanobacteria samples over 20 of isolate antibiotic pairs were designated susceptible by ast the detected hr was associated with higher frequency resistant subpopulations 1 in 100 cells whereas the undetected hr was associated with lower frequency resistant subpopulations 1 in 10 000 cells previous studies have discussed the synergistic effect of antibiotic combinations on cyanobacteria and found that their logs of killing were greater than what would be predicted using the mic for each antibiotic alone gonz√°lez pleiter et al 2013 wang et al 2019 in this study combination therapy with two antibiotics targeting hr hr hr resulted in significantly greater killing than monotherapy with a single antibiotic to which an isolate was heteroresistant hr alone which could be described as synergism antibiotic combinations classified as susceptible by ast targeting multiple hr hr hr s interactions led to decreased logs of killing of cyanobacterial cells compared to that of combinations targeting homogenous susceptibility s s s interactions our results indicated that the synergistic efficacy of the antibiotic combination in reducing cyanobacterial levels and preventing subsequent growth might depend on multiple hr instead of designating hr instances as homogenous susceptibility the quantification of the frequency of the resistant subpopulation in hr would be essential when evaluating the synergism of antibiotic combination regimens we exposed susceptible wild type cyanobacteria to constant sub mic levels of antibiotics for 25 passages and found that high level resistance up to 8000 fold micsusc evolved in several independent lineages our study revealed that cyanobacteria could also evolve with high level resistance under very weak and constant antibiotic selective pressure with selection ratios lower than 1 since the possibility of preexisting hr in these tested wild type isolates or horizontal gene transfer during the selection experiment has been ruled out de novo selected gene mutations were most likely the single route contributing to hr development in a subpopulation of cells for mutants of a single strain generated under our experimental design in the enclosed system the fraction of evolved hr at sub mic concentrations was found to be positively correlated with the strength of selection pressure selection ratio which was in line with a previous hypothesis ge et al 2017 the selective effect for hr differed among strains and genera which could be partially explained by the different genetic backgrounds resistance characteristics types of mutations conferring resistance and fitness costs defined as reduced competitiveness in the absence of antibiotics associated with the mutations at low levels of antibiotic pressure the main driving force of resistance selection shifts from the resistance to fitness cost of mutations in the present study the lowest selection ratios among these tested strains that still generated resistant mutants were in the range of 1 10 3 1 25 10 3 which were lower than those reported in e coli for ciprofloxacin selection 4 35 10 3 and in salmonella typhimurium for tetracycline 1 10 2 gullberg et al 2011 the minimal selective concentration msc defines the antibiotic concentration needed to overcome the fitness cost of each resistance determinant and is expressed as a fraction of the micsusc the lower anticipated msc is associated with a smaller fitness cost that favors the accumulation of mutants at sub mic concentrations andersson and hughes 2014 explaining why the given selection concentration showed a higher preference for cyanobacterial strains with a lower micsusc i e higher selection ratio taking into consideration both the micsusc and msc the higher selection ratio is therefore a significant parameter for the stronger selective effects of resistance mutations at sub mic concentrations of antibiotics the stability of the polyclonal hr was tested to verify that the resistance phenotype of clones isolated from the resistant subpopulation did not decrease following growth for 50 successive subculturing passages in the absence of antibiotics generally frequent mutation and gene amplification are two types of mutation mechanism that lead to the generation of antibiotic heteroresistance the frequent mutations that confer resistance with low or no fitness cost are genetically stable point mutations insertion sequence insertions and small deletions andersson et al 2019 the stable polyclonal hr could be attributed to low fitness cost mutations which accumulated and evolved over many generations through the selection process the cost of resistance has to be compensated by the reduction in growth of the susceptible strains induced by the antibiotic except for the two cases detected with unstable hr microcystis mutants selected by amoxicillin and tetracycline mutant growth rate reduction in comparison to the parent varied in the range of 0 2 to 4 1 among the tested cyanobacterial strains previous studies have pointed out that the variation in fitness cost incurred by different types of mutations is one of the critical factors for resistance selection at sub mic concentrations of antibiotics andersson and hughes 2014 gullberg et al 2011 the fitness costs of various resistant mutants ranged from 0 2 to 3 among e coli and s typhimurium mutants selected by ciprofloxacin and tetracycline sandegren 2014 which were slightly higher than the fitness cost of stable resistant mutants detected in our tested cyanobacterial strains at sub mic levels resistant mutants conferring fitness costs lower than the growth reduction in susceptible populations are competitive gullberg et al 2011 it is interesting to note that despite the low antibiotic concentrations used only those mutants exhibiting increasing resistance levels but very low fitness costs were enriched antibiotic concentrations chosen for the mutant selection experiment were the same as the msc determined in the competitions between wild type and mutant isolates and the enriched resistant cyanobacteria likely carried resistance mutations with a fitness cost that was significantly lower than that of the previously studied mutations since the resulting resistance selected for higher fitness is less likely to reverse in the absence of antibiotics andersson and hughes 2010 it could be therefore predicted that sub mic selected resistant mutants in cyanobacterial populations possessing little fitness cost or mutations that compensate for the fitness cost and do not affect the resistant phenotype would be more stable than those selected by high concentrations of antibiotics in contrast to polyclonal hr monoclonal hr observed with pure cyanobacterial isolates generating frequent spontaneous subpopulations of susceptible and resistant cells when grown in the absence of antibiotics due to the reversibility of the resistance phenotype can be attributed to the unstable genetic mechanism our results demonstrate that over 97 of the hr cases observed in these environmental isolates selected from paps are unstable unstable heteroresistance involving an intrinsic instability of the resistance mutation caused by spontaneous unstable tandem amplification of resistance genes is the most common mechanism underlying heteroresistance in gram negative species such as cyanobacteria nicoloff et al 2019 in the presence of antibiotic selection resistant cells with gene amplification of resistance genes on either plasmids or chromosomes were selected and enriched while the absence of antibiotic favors the growth of susceptible revertants with reduced gene copy number the reduction in copy number and resistance level could be explained by the fitness costs associated with gene amplification where cyanobacterial revertants lacking gene amplifications grew faster in the absence of antibiotic selection than resistant mutants with amplifications spontaneous unstable gene amplification of resistance genes has been reported as the most common mechanism responsible for unstable hr in gram negative species such as e coli schechter et al 2018 salmonella enterica hjort et al 2016 acinetobacter baumannii anderson et al 2018 and klebsiella pneumonia nicoloff et al 2019 genetic amplifications confer a fitness cost and they readily segregate to lower copy numbers in the absence of selective pressure adler et al 2014 our data indicate that the mutations causing resistance in unstable hr cases are both costly and unstable and that fitness costs associated with gene amplification act as drivers for the population to revert to susceptibility in the absence of antibiotic selection the possibility of evolution from resistant mutants initially carrying unstable amplifications to stable mutants with little fitness cost during growth with antibiotic selection should be considered other types of mutations linked to point mutations insertion sequence insertions or small deletions conferring a high fitness cost have been proposed as possible mechanisms for non amplification driven unstable hr andersson et al 2019 but are unlikely to be the main mechanism for the detected unstable hr in this study the risk of reversion to a susceptible phenotype depends on the number of generations grown under non antibiotic selective conditions and the rate of amplification loss which in turn depends on the intrinsic loss rate and the fitness costs associated with the amplification has been described andersson et al 2019 amplification driven unstable hr in cyanobacteria may result in rapid reversion to the original genotype and phenotype in the absence of antibiotic pressure before the standard ast 5 conclusions our work is one of the first to highlight how hr in cyanobacteria and its instability are so prevalent and difficult to diagnose with traditional ast leading to a common misdiagnosis of cyanobacterial strains with a resistant subpopulation as fully susceptible notably both the evolution of high level resistance causing stable polyclonal hr and the unstable gene amplification involved in monoclonal hr observed in different cyanobacterial strains can be promoted at environmental levels of antibiotic pressure our discovery of unstable gene amplification associated monoclonal hr mechanisms further accentuates the underestimation of cyanobacteria derived resistance illustrating a major limitation of using current mic estimates as the unique criterion for determining the antibiotic susceptibility of cyanobacteria and emphasizing the significance of developing rapid and facile methods to identify hr in cyanobacterial samples polyclonal hr causing problems in diagnosing resistance in some cyanobacterial species called for the improvement of sampling and analysis of mixed populations that contain small resistant subpopulations despite being time consuming and costly improved diagnostics allowing the detection of hr with high specificity and sensitivity such as paps should be implemented in future studies to prevent the misclassification of hr as susceptibility author contributions z y w q w c and j y z designed the study and methodology z y w c y c and x x c performed the

16791,sulfate radical so4 based oxidation shows great promise in wastewater treatment and subsurface remediation for the first time we demonstrated that so4 could induce the transformation of ammonium nh4 to nitrophenolic byproducts using high resolution mass spectrometry in combination with 15n labeling mono nitro and di nitro phenolic byproducts were identified in a sample containing 1 mm nh4 and 10 mg l natural organic matter nom following heat activated peroxydisulfate pds oxidation at pds dose of 1 mm the formation of p nitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid reached 0 21 and 0 30 Œºm respectively in 12 h and then decreased the formation of 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid increased monotonically reaching 0 37 and 0 62 Œºm respectively in 24 h one electron oxidation of nh4 to form aminyl radicals nh2 was the first step of the transformation the reaction of nh2 with oxygen was a key step in propagating radical chain reactions leading to nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 as a key nitrating agent the reactive sites susceptible to nitrating in nom molecules are not limited to phenolic moieties we found that aromatic carboxylate moieties could be in situ transformed to phenolics by so4 thus contributed to nitrophenolic byproducts formation as well considering the ubiquitous presence of nh4 in the environment formation of nitrophenolic byproducts will be widespread when so4 is applied for onsite remediation which should be taken into consideration when evaluating the feasibility of this technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords sulfate radical ammonium nitrogen dioxide radical natural organic matter nitrophenolic byproducts 1 introduction sulfate radical so4 oxidation is a promising technology for wastewater treatment and in situ remediation of contaminated groundwaters ghanbari and moradi 2017 long et al 2014 matzek and carter 2016 tsitonaki et al 2010 zhang et al 2015 zhou et al 2018 so4 can be generated by the activation of peroxydisulfate pds or peroxymonosulfate pms using heat transition metals ghanbari and moradi 2017 tsitonaki et al 2010 etc so4 has a comparable redox potential to oh and can degrade a wide spectrum of organic contaminants neta et al 1977 even those hard to be degraded by oh such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances bruton and sedlak 2018 qian et al 2016 however formation of hazardous byproducts in so4 oxidation processes has become an increasing concern several studies have shown that halides can be oxidized by so4 generating reactive halogen species such as free halogens and halogen radicals which can react with natural organic matter nom to yield halogenated byproducts i e haloforms and haloacetic acids fang and shang 2012 lu et al 2016 2015 wang et al 2017b 2017c 2014 more recently we demonstrated that nitrite no2 an anion commonly occurring in groundwaters could be transformed to nitroaromatic byproducts in so4 oxidation processes ji et al 2019 2017 2018 yang et al 2019 2021 this is due to the oxidation of no2 by so4 generating nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 e0 1 03 v neta et al 1988 which react with nom yang et al 2019 the phenolic moieties in nom macromolecules were demonstrated to be the principle sites for no2 attack yang et al 2019 2021 nitration starts with h abstraction on the phenolic substrate forming a phenoxy radical intermediate followed by the addition of no2 at the para or ortho position barzaghi and herrmann 2002 bedini et al 2012 nitroaromatics are usually toxic carcinogenic and mutagenic posing a potential threat to ecosystems and human health ju and parales 2010 kovacic and somanathan 2014 ammonium nh4 serves as both a substrate and product of metabolism it is present in various wastewaters it is also the most abundant form of inorganic nitrogen in waters and soils nh4 is also massively released into the environment as fertilizers and causes eutrophication of surface waters nh4 concentrations of 0 112 8 71 mg l as nitrogen were detected in groundwaters in the usa xin et al 2019 its concentration in surface waters is higher over 10 mg l was detected in eutrophicated rivers and lakes in china zhang et al 2019 nh4 in soils ranges from a few to hundreds of mg kg for instance nh4 concentrations from 4 22 to 204 3 mg kg were reported in soils of southern china zhang et al 2020 to date little is known regarding how nh4 is transformed in so4 oxidation processes from a thermodynamic perspective under oxidative conditions nh4 can be oxidized to nitrate no3 but detailed reaction pathways have not been reported laszlo et al 1998 instead the transformation of nh4 in oh oxidation processes is relatively understood several studies have reported that nh4 can be oxidized by oh to form aminyl radicals nh2 e0 0 7 0 8 v which combine with oxygen molecules forming aminylperoxyl radicals nh2oo clarke et al 2008 dwibedy et al 1996 huang et al 2008 laszlo et al 1998 pagsberg 1972 stanbury 1989 wang et al

yield no2 or no2 respectively de laat et al 2010 dey 2011 john and james 1999 wu et al 2019 the reactions and rate constants are present in table 1 we propose that nh4 undergoes a similar transformation pathway in so4 oxidation processes because so4 has a similar oxidation potency to oh since no and no2 are formed as important intermediates they are likely to be scavenged by nom and other phenolic substrates in the system leading to nitrophenolic byproducts in the present study this hypothesis was assessed using 15n labeling in combination of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms to trace the transformation of nitrogen and demonstrate whether ammonium can be transformed to nitrophenolic byproducts in so4 oxidation processes in addition effort was devoted to identify the structural characteristics of nom moieties susceptible to nitration results of this study suggest that formation of nitrophenolic byproducts might have been significantly underestimated when so4 is applied to groundwater and soil remediation 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals and materials all reagents were of the purest quality available 15n labeled ammonium sulfate 15nh4 2so4 99 was

physiochemical properties and contents of soil organic matter and nitrogen are provided in table s1 in supporting information si detailed pretreatment and measurement procedures can be found in the text s1 of si 2 2 reaction setup transformation of nh4 in the heat activated pds oxidation process was explored in a series of 250 ml erlenmeyer flasks each flask contained 100 ml solution made of 10 mg l nom as toc appropriate amounts of nh4 and pds nh4 consisted of 50 14nh4 2so4 and 50 15nh4 2so4 the ph of the solution was buffered at 7 with 10 mm phosphate in addition parallel samples containing 100 14nh4 or methanol or purged with n2 were prepared all flasks were incubated in a water bath at 60 c the dissolved oxygen concentration in solution was measured using a dissolved oxygen analyzer mettler toledo switzerland at pre set time intervals one flask from each group was transferred to an ice bath a 3 ml aliquot was withdrawn for nh4 no2 and no3 analysis using the fiastar 5000 flow injection auto analyzer foss tecator denmark the remaining sample was adjusted to ph 2 using concentrated sulfuric acid and enriched in 2 ml methanol via solid phase extraction spe details of the extraction procedure are provided in the text s2 of si controls without the addition of ammonium or pds or heating were run concurrently all experiments were conducted in duplicate soil samples were treated in 50 ml centrifuge vials with screwcaps to each vial 10 g soil an appropriate amount of pds stock solution and ultra pure water were added to form a total liquid volume of 15 ml and final pds concentration of 30 mmol kg the vials were incubated in a thermostatic shaker at 250 rpm at 60 c and at pre set time intervals a vial was transferred to an ice bath and then centrifuged at 4000 rpm for 10 min chen et al 2016 yang et al 2021 nitrophenolic compounds in the supernatant and the remaining soil were extracted for further analysis a detailed description of the extraction procedures can be found in the text s3 of si all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 identification and quantification of nitrogenous byproducts the nitrogenous byproducts in enriched water samples were identified and quantified using a method presented in a previously reported study yang et al 2019 since 50 of the ammonium was labeled with 15n if a nitrogenous compound is derived from ammonium it is expected to have characteristic m 1 m 2 m n isotopes where n is the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule and the ratio of the abundance of these isotope peaks equals to the binomial expansion of 1 1 n this characteristic signature allows the identification of any nitrogenous byproducts having nitrogen originated from the ammonium in the reaction system briefly the samples were first analyzed using an agilent 1200 hplc coupled with an agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms with electrospray ionization esi source santa clara ca usa the sample was delivered to the esi source without going through an hplc column ms was operated at negative esi and full scan m z 50 1000 mode ms peaks related to nh4 transformation products were identified according to the diagnostic isotopic signature endowed by 15n labeling then accurate masses of the nitrogenous byproducts were obtained using an ab sciex triple tof 5600 high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight ms foster city ca usa after the peak was identified to be nitrogenous byproducts fragmentation patterns ms ms was performed to derive possible molecular structures finally the identities and quantities of products were determined using agilent hplc ms ms by comparing the retention time and peak area with authentic standards if available the separation was accomplished on an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 150 mm 2 1 mm i d 3 5 Œºm ms was operated at multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode details on the setup and conditions are provided in the texts s2 s4 of si 2 4 epr analysis no was analyzed by a bruker emx electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker germany after trapping by fe dtcs 3 freshly prepared by mixing dtcs and feso4 solutions at a molar ratio of 5 1 chen et al 2017 details of the procedure and instrumental setup can be found in the text s5 of si 2 5 model compounds study to gain more insights into the reaction mechanisms phenol and ba were used to mimic the reactivity of nom a total of 50 ml of solution was prepared which contained only one individual model compound at a concentration of 50 Œºm appropriate amounts of nh4 and pds nh4 consisted of 50 14nh4 2so4 and 50 15nh4 2so4 parallel samples containing 100 14nh4 or methanol or n2 purging were also prepared other conditions were the same as those mentioned above at pre set time intervals a 0 5 ml aliquot was sampled and immediately chilled in an ice bath a shimadzu 20ad hplc shimadzu japan equipped with an spd m20a diode array detector and an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 250 4 6 mm i d 5 Œºm was employed to do the analysis details in the text s6 of si the remaining sample was concentrated by spe and analyzed using agilent 6410 triple quadrupole ms as described above controls without the addition of ammonium or pds or heating were run concurrently all experiments were conducted in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of nitrogenous byproducts in water samples fig 1 a illustrates the ms of the nom subjected to heat pds nh4 treatment the diagnostic 15n isotope signature is evident while it is not found in neither the treatment without nh4 fig s1b or the controls without heating or pds or ammonium figs 1b and s1c for example the peak at m z 138 was accompanied by an m 1 isotope of approximately equal abundance while this isotopic peak was absent in the treatment without 15n labeling fig s1a this unambiguously indicates that the corresponding compound was originated from the inorganic nh4 in addition the molecular weight mw of the corresponding compound was 139 negative esi and according to the nitrogen rule it can be inferred that as the mw is an odd number the compound has an odd number of nitrogen atoms which is also consistent with the isotopic signature once this peak was identified as a nitrogenous byproduct possible molecular structures were proposed according to the ms ms pattern fig s2 and accurate mw table 2 finally this compound was assigned as p nitrophenol after comparison with authentic standards using this approach the peak of m z 182 was identified to be mostly composed of 5 nitrosalicylic acid while its isomer 4 hydroxy 3 nitrobenzoic acid made a minor contribution the peaks at m z 183 and m z 227 were identified as 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid respectively fig s3 the peaks at m z 166 m z 198 m z 213 m z 226 and m z 239 were also identified as nitro or nitroso phenolic compounds with carboxyl alkyl and or methyl substitutions on the phenolic ring with their possible structures illustrated in table 2 however their exact identities cannot be ascertained without authentic standards fig 2 a exhibits the time dependent formation of the identified nitrophenolic byproducts the formation of mono nitro byproducts i e p nitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid increased initially and then declined while the formation of di nitro byproducts i e 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid increased monotonically the maximum yields of p nitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid at 12 h were 0 21 and 0 30 Œºm respectively the concentrations of di nitro byproducts exceeded those of mono nitro byproducts after 15 h reaching 0 37 and 0 62 Œºm at 24 h for 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid respectively therefore it can be inferred that nitro groups are sequentially substituted to the phenolic ring fig 2b shows that the yields of nitrophenolic byproducts increased initially and then decreased with higher pds doses the maximum concentrations of p nitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid were 0 27 and 0 48 Œºm respectively at a pds dose of 0 6 mm while the highest yields of 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid were 0 49 and 0 87 Œºm at a pds dose of 1 2 mm respectively higher pds doses result in more so4 allowing nitrogenous byproducts to be further degraded fig 2c indicates that higher ammonium concentrations resulted in higher levels of mono nitro byproducts and less di nitro byproducts according to chen et al 2020 the formation of a phenoxy radical intermediate is a key step in nitration with this step mostly resulting from the one electron oxidation of substrates by so4 a higher abundance of nh4 results in the consumption of more so4 and therefore mono nitro byproducts have less chance to be transformed to phenoxy radicals and the formation of di nitro byproducts were suppressed 3 2 identification of nitrogenous byproducts in soil samples the soil sample contained 26 78 mg kg ammonium nitrogen and 0 01 mg kg nitrate nitrogen with an organic carbon content of 14 90 g kg table s1 no additional nitrogen was added p nitrophenol m nitrophenol 5 nitrosalicylic acid 4 hydroxy 3 nitrobenzoic and 2 4 dinitrophenol were detected by hplc ms ms after the heat pds treatment figs s4 s6 in addition the peak at m z 154 was attributed to nitrophenolic byproducts with 2 hydroxyl groups on the phenolic ring although the exact positions of the functional groups remain unknown without authentic standards their possible structures are illustrated in table s2 these nitrophenolic byproducts were mostly present in soil water implying they are relatively mobile and readily transported via runoff lin et al 2000 yang et al 2021 fig 3 shows the time dependent formation of the identified nitrogenous byproducts samples were analyzed by ms ms without hplc separation the yields in the soil sample represent the sum of individual isomers contributing to the ms peak assuming the isomers have a same ionization efficiency and fragmentation pattern in other words the values based on peak m z 138 and m z 182 represent the overall quantities of mono nitrophenols and hydroxy mono nitrobenzoic acids respectively in a sample more details can be found in the texts s3 and s4 of si the formation of nitrophenolic byproducts increased first and then decreased with a pds dose of 30 mmol kg the maximum formation of mono nitrophenols and hydroxy mono nitrobenzoic acids reached 0 0045 and 0 007 Œºmol kg between 8 and 12 h respectively 3 3 transformation pathways of ammonium the formation of nitrophenolic byproducts indicates the oxidation of nh4 so4 generated by the activation of pds played a key role because no nitrogenous byproducts were detected in the control without heat activation fig 1b the importance of so4 is also evidenced by the absence of nitrogenous byproducts in the treatment with so4 quenched by methanol fig s7 like the oh oxidation process one electron oxidation of nh4 forming nh2 is presumed to be the first step of the transformation huang et al 2008 laszlo et al 1998 pagsberg 1972 bimolecular rate constants of 1 4 107 m 1s 1 and 3 5 105 m 1s 1 were reported for the oxidation of nh3 and nh4 by so4 respectively r1 r2 neta et al 1988 in addition as oh is always co present with so4 though its concentration is very low at acidic and neutral conditions liang and su 2009 it could also be responsible for the oxidation of ammonium r3 r4 laszlo et al 1998 zhang et al 2019 nh2 can be terminated by combining with oh forming a hydroxylamine nh2oh r5 or coupling to each other forming hydrazine n2h4 r6 pagsberg 1972 hydroxylamine and hydrazine can be oxidized to n2 by pds so4 or oh r7 r10 ball et al 1985 feng et al 2017 gonzalez and braun 1996 in addition nh2 can react with dissolved oxygen forming nh2oo r11 laszlo et al 1998 pagsberg 1972 nh2oo isomerizes rapidly to hnooh and then decomposes to no r12 laszlo et al 1998 pagsberg 1972 in this study the formation of no was visualized by epr analysis as illustrated in fig s8 the no fe dtcs 3 spin adduct is characterized by the isotropic epr signal at g value of 2 04 with a triplet superhyperfine structure a n of 12 5 g chen et al 2017 this signal of no was absent without pds or nh4 no can be oxidized by oh to yield no2 r13 wu et al 2019 which is further oxidized by so4 or oh to form no2 r14 r15 john and james 1999 neta et al 1977 alternatively no can be directly oxidized by dissolved oxygen to form no2 r16 wu et al 2019 coupling of two no2 forms n2o4 which is hydroxylated to no3 r17 r18 john and james 1999 this reaction pathway is depicted in fig 4 fig s9 shows the concentrations of inorganic nitrogen species during heat pds treatment it appears that reduced nh4 was almost quantitively transformed to no3 in the absence of organic substrates in the presence of nom no and no2 can be incorporated into nom molecules to form nitrophenolic byproducts which has been demonstrated in prior studies yang et al 2019 2021 as a result the yield of no3 at 24 h was reduced from 0 162 mm to 0 096 mm fig s9 according to the pathway shown in fig 4 the reaction of nh2 with oxygen is a key step in the propagation of radical chain reactions leading to nitrate and nitrating agents to verify this the dissolved oxygen concentration in samples was reduced from 4 83 to 1 38 mg l by n2 purging resulting in the nitrophenolic byproducts formation being significantly reduced fig s10 while the no3 formation was also greatly suppressed fig s9 3 4 reactive sites in nom molecules phenolic moieties in nom macromolecules are recognized to be the main reactive sites for no2 attack in the prior studies yang et al 2019 2021 herein phenol was selected as a model compound to mimic the reactivity of nom to elucidate the nitration pathway in the heat pds nh4 system fig 1c shows the ms spectra of phenol upon heat pds nh4 treatment according to the 15n isotopic signature peaks of m z 122 m z 138 and m z 214 can be easily identified to be nitrogenous byproducts after comparing with the authentic standards fig 5 the peak of m z 138 was determined to be o nitrophenol and p nitrophenol which were also identified in nom and soil samples the peak of m z 122 was identified to be p nitrosophenol and the peak of m z 214 is probably attributed to nitroso diphenyls their possible structures are illustrated in table s3 the formation of the identified nitrogenous byproducts increased first and then declined with the prolonging of reaction time fig 6 or increase of pds dose fig s11b with the increase of ammonium concentration their yields increased monotonically fig s11c no nitrogenous byproducts were detected in the presence of excessive methanol fig s12 after purged with n2 the yields of nitrophenolic byproducts were greatly suppressed fig s11a these observations are in accordance with those found in nom samples figs 2 s7 and s10 and justify the rationality of phenolic moieties as the reactive sites for nitration nitration of phenols is a two step reaction the first step is the h abstraction on the phenoxy oxygen to generate a phenoxy radical this step can be accomplished by either no2 or so4 chen et al 2020 yang et al 2019 according to chen et al so4 reacts with phenols primarily via one electron transfer generating phenoxy radicals which plays a dominant role chen et al 2020 the second step is the addition of a no2 to the phenoxy radical at its ortho or para position to form nitrophenols barzaghi and herrmann 2002 bedini et al 2012 no can also combine with phenoxy radicals forming nitroso substituted byproducts vione et al 2004a 2004b which explains the formation of p nitrosophenol m z 122 nitrosophenols are not stable and can be degraded by so4 or oxidized to nitrophenols in the heat pds process fig s13 nitrosophenols can also be oxidized by so4 to phenoxy radicals which couple with other phenoxy radicals forming nitroso diphenyls m z 214 it was unexpected that nitrophenolic byproducts m z 138 and m z 183 including p nitrophenol o nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol and 2 6 dinitrophenol were also identified after comparing with the authentic standards when the phenol was replaced by ba during the heat pds nh4 treatment figs 1d and 5 fig s14 presents the time dependent formation of the identified nitrogenous byproducts the concentrations of o nitrophenol and p nitrophenol increased first and then declined di nitrophenolic byproducts appeared after 6 h and increased continuously note that the formation of nitrophenols from ba was significantly higher than those from phenol at identical conditions as shown in fig 6 the temporal maximum formation of o nitrophenol and p nitrophenol from ba appeared at 4 and 6 h with the yields reaching 2 95 and 1 23 Œºm respectively however the respective highest yields of o nitrophenol and p nitrophenol from phenol were only 0 23 and 0 30 Œºm which appeared at 4 and 5 h this suggests that aromatic carboxylate moieties might even play a more significant role than phenolics as the substrates in nitrophenolic byproducts formation the bimolecular rate constants of so4 reacting with phenol and ba are 8 8 109 m 1s 1 and 1 2 109 m 1s 1 respectively neta et al 1977 wojn√°rovits and tak√°cs 2019 it implies that phenol is more rapidly oxidized by so4 than ba giving other conditions identical in other words nh4 has more chance to react with so4 in the presence of ba generating more nitrating agents no and no2 which favors the formation of nitrated byproducts owing to the electron withdrawing carboxylic acid group on the aromatic ring ba is relatively electron deficient its redox potential is 1 01 v franck et al 2013 which is almost equal to that of no2 1 03 v thus directly oxidation of ba by no2 is probably unfavorable however ba can be transformed to phenol by so4 the reaction is initiated by transferring an electron from the carboxylate oxygen to a so4 followed by kolbe decarboxylation to form a benzene radical which further transforms to phenol hori et al 2004 neta et al 1977 such a decarboxylation hydroxylation is a main transformation pathway of aromatic carboxylic acids and is widely observed in so4 oxidation processes criquet and leitner 2015 fu et al 2019 lu et al 2016 zemel h and w 1978 fig s15 shows the formation of phenol along with the degradation of ba in the heat pds oxidation process in the absence or presence of nh4 this result implies that phenolic substrates for nitrating can be in situ generated from aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of so4 thus the potential of nom to form nitrogenous byproducts in so4 oxidation processes might have been significantly underestimated given that nom molecules are rich of aromatic moieties with carboxylate substitution croue et al 2000 sillanpaa et al 2015 which tend to be transformed by so4 to phenolics susceptible to nitrating the proposed transformation pathway of ba and phenol in the heat pds nh4 oxidation process is depicted in fig 7 4 conclusions in the present study transformation of ammonium to nitrophenolic byproducts in a heat activated pds oxidation process was demonstrated using 15n isotope labeling in combination with ms analysis during this process nh4 was oxidized by so4 and following a radical chain reaction to generate no2 which acted as the primary nitrating agent phenolic moieties in nom molecules acted as the direct sites for nitrating moreover these substrates could be in situ generated because of the reactions between so4 and aromatic carboxylate moieties of nom this means that the nitrophenolic byproducts formation potential of nom is significantly higher than what was assumed earlier in previous studies we revealed that nitrite could be transformed to nitrophenolic byproducts by so4 ji et al 2019 2017 2018 yang et al 2019 2021 compared to nitrite ammonium is ubiquitous in wastewaters and environment at concentrations much higher than nitrite thus formation of nitrophenolic byproducts will be widespread when so4 is applied to wastewaters and contaminated subsurface with ammonium playing a significant role in their formation which is of emerging

16791,sulfate radical so4 based oxidation shows great promise in wastewater treatment and subsurface remediation for the first time we demonstrated that so4 could induce the transformation of ammonium nh4 to nitrophenolic byproducts using high resolution mass spectrometry in combination with 15n labeling mono nitro and di nitro phenolic byproducts were identified in a sample containing 1 mm nh4 and 10 mg l natural organic matter nom following heat activated peroxydisulfate pds oxidation at pds dose of 1 mm the formation of p nitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid reached 0 21 and 0 30 Œºm respectively in 12 h and then decreased the formation of 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid increased monotonically reaching 0 37 and 0 62 Œºm respectively in 24 h one electron oxidation of nh4 to form aminyl radicals nh2 was the first step of the transformation the reaction of nh2 with oxygen was a key step in propagating radical chain reactions leading to nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 as a key nitrating agent the reactive sites susceptible to nitrating in nom molecules are not limited to phenolic moieties we found that aromatic carboxylate moieties could be in situ transformed to phenolics by so4 thus contributed to nitrophenolic byproducts formation as well considering the ubiquitous presence of nh4 in the environment formation of nitrophenolic byproducts will be widespread when so4 is applied for onsite remediation which should be taken into consideration when evaluating the feasibility of this technology graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

activation of peroxydisulfate pds or peroxymonosulfate pms using heat transition metals ghanbari and moradi 2017 tsitonaki et al 2010 etc so4 has a comparable redox potential to oh and can degrade a wide spectrum of organic contaminants neta et al 1977 even those hard to be degraded by oh such as per and polyfluoroalkyl substances bruton and sedlak 2018 qian et al 2016 however formation of hazardous byproducts in so4 oxidation processes has become an increasing concern several studies have shown that halides can be oxidized by so4 generating reactive halogen species such as free

2017c 2014 more recently we demonstrated that nitrite no2 an anion commonly occurring in groundwaters could be transformed to nitroaromatic byproducts in so4 oxidation processes ji et al 2019 2017 2018 yang et al 2019 2021 this is due to the oxidation of no2 by so4 generating nitrogen dioxide radicals no2 e0 1 03 v neta et al 1988 which react with nom yang et al 2019 the phenolic moieties in

ecosystems and human health ju and parales 2010 kovacic and somanathan 2014 ammonium nh4 serves as both a substrate and product of metabolism it is present in various wastewaters it is also the most abundant form of inorganic nitrogen in waters and soils nh4 is also massively released into the environment as fertilizers and causes eutrophication of surface waters nh4 concentrations of 0 112 8 71

regarding how nh4 is transformed in so4 oxidation processes from a thermodynamic perspective under oxidative conditions nh4 can be oxidized to nitrate no3 but detailed reaction pathways have not been reported laszlo et al 1998 instead the transformation of nh4 in oh oxidation processes is relatively understood several studies have reported that nh4 can be oxidized by oh to form aminyl radicals nh2

transformation pathway in so4 oxidation processes because so4 has a similar oxidation potency to oh since no and no2 are formed as important intermediates they are likely to be scavenged by nom and other phenolic substrates in the system leading to nitrophenolic byproducts in the present study this hypothesis was assessed using 15n labeling in combination of high resolution mass spectrometry hrms to trace the transformation of nitrogen and demonstrate whether ammonium can be transformed to nitrophenolic byproducts in so4 oxidation processes in addition effort was devoted to identify the structural characteristics of nom moieties susceptible to nitration results of this study suggest that formation of nitrophenolic byproducts might have been significantly underestimated when so4 is

for 10 min chen et al 2016 yang et al 2021 nitrophenolic compounds in the supernatant and the remaining soil were extracted for further analysis a detailed description of the extraction procedures can be found in the text s3 of si all experiments were conducted in triplicate 2 3 identification and quantification of nitrogenous byproducts the nitrogenous byproducts in enriched water samples were identified and quantified using a method presented in a previously reported study yang et al 2019 since 50 of the ammonium was labeled with 15n if a nitrogenous compound is derived from ammonium it is expected to have characteristic m 1 m 2 m n isotopes where n is the number of nitrogen atoms in the molecule and the ratio of the abundance of these isotope peaks equals to the binomial expansion of 1 1 n this characteristic signature allows the identification of any nitrogenous byproducts having nitrogen originated from the ammonium in the reaction system briefly the samples were first analyzed using an agilent 1200 hplc coupled with an agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer ms with electrospray ionization esi source santa clara ca usa the sample was delivered to the esi source without going through an hplc column ms was operated at negative esi and full scan m z 50 1000 mode ms peaks related to nh4 transformation products were identified according to the diagnostic isotopic signature endowed by 15n labeling then accurate masses of the nitrogenous byproducts were obtained using an ab sciex triple tof 5600 high resolution hybrid quadrupole time of flight ms foster city ca usa after the peak was identified to be nitrogenous byproducts fragmentation patterns ms ms was performed to derive possible molecular structures finally the identities and quantities of products were determined using agilent hplc ms ms by comparing the retention time and peak area with authentic standards if available the separation was accomplished on an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 150 mm 2 1 mm i d 3 5 Œºm ms was operated at multiple reaction monitoring mrm mode details on the setup and conditions are provided in the texts s2 s4 of si 2 4 epr analysis no was analyzed by a bruker emx electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometer epr bruker germany after trapping by fe dtcs 3 freshly prepared by mixing dtcs and feso4 solutions at a molar ratio of 5 1 chen et al 2017 details of the procedure and instrumental setup can be found in the text s5 of si 2 5 model compounds study to gain more insights into the reaction mechanisms phenol and ba were used to mimic the reactivity of nom a total of 50 ml of solution was prepared which contained only one individual model compound at a concentration of 50 Œºm appropriate amounts of nh4 and pds nh4 consisted of 50 14nh4 2so4 and 50 15nh4 2so4 parallel samples containing 100 14nh4 or methanol or n2 purging were also prepared other conditions were the same as those mentioned above at pre set time intervals a 0 5 ml aliquot was sampled and immediately chilled in an ice bath a shimadzu 20ad hplc shimadzu japan equipped with an spd m20a diode array detector and an agilent zorbax eclipse plus c18 column 250 4 6 mm i d 5 Œºm was employed to do the analysis details in the text s6 of si the remaining sample was concentrated by spe and analyzed using agilent 6410 triple quadrupole ms as described above controls without the addition of ammonium or pds or heating were run concurrently all experiments were conducted in duplicate 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of nitrogenous byproducts in water samples fig 1 a illustrates the ms of the nom subjected to heat pds nh4 treatment the diagnostic 15n isotope signature is evident while it is not found in neither the treatment without nh4 fig s1b or the controls without heating or pds or ammonium figs 1b and s1c for example the peak at m z 138 was accompanied by an m 1 isotope of approximately equal abundance while this isotopic peak was absent in the treatment without 15n labeling fig s1a this unambiguously indicates that the corresponding compound was originated from the inorganic nh4 in addition the molecular weight mw of the corresponding compound was 139 negative esi and according to the nitrogen rule it can be inferred that as the mw is an odd number the compound has an odd number of nitrogen atoms which is also consistent with the isotopic signature once this peak was identified as a nitrogenous byproduct possible molecular structures were proposed according to the ms ms pattern fig s2 and accurate mw table 2 finally this compound was assigned as p nitrophenol after comparison with authentic standards using this approach the peak of m z 182 was identified to be mostly composed of 5 nitrosalicylic acid while its isomer 4 hydroxy 3 nitrobenzoic acid made a minor contribution the peaks at m z 183 and m z 227 were identified as 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid respectively fig s3 the peaks at m z 166 m z 198 m z 213 m z 226 and m z 239 were also identified as nitro or nitroso phenolic compounds with carboxyl alkyl and or methyl substitutions on the phenolic ring with their possible structures illustrated in table 2 however their exact identities cannot be ascertained without authentic standards fig 2 a exhibits the time dependent formation of the identified nitrophenolic byproducts the formation of mono nitro byproducts i e p nitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid increased initially and then declined while the formation of di nitro byproducts i e 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid increased monotonically the maximum yields of p nitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid at 12 h were 0 21 and 0 30 Œºm respectively the concentrations of di nitro byproducts exceeded those of mono nitro byproducts after 15 h reaching 0 37 and 0 62 Œºm at 24 h for 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid respectively therefore it can be inferred that nitro groups are sequentially substituted to the phenolic ring fig 2b shows that the yields of nitrophenolic byproducts increased initially and then decreased with higher pds doses the maximum concentrations of p nitrophenol and 5 nitrosalicylic acid were 0 27 and 0 48 Œºm respectively at a pds dose of 0 6 mm while the highest yields of 2 4 dinitrophenol and 3 5 dinitrosalicylic acid were 0 49 and 0 87 Œºm at a pds dose of 1 2 mm respectively higher pds doses result in more so4 allowing nitrogenous byproducts to be further degraded fig 2c indicates that higher ammonium concentrations resulted in higher levels of mono nitro byproducts and less di nitro byproducts according to chen et al 2020 the formation of a phenoxy radical intermediate is a key step in nitration with this step mostly resulting from the one electron oxidation of substrates by so4 a higher abundance of nh4 results in the consumption of more so4 and therefore mono nitro byproducts have less chance to be transformed to phenoxy radicals and the formation of di nitro byproducts were suppressed 3 2 identification of nitrogenous byproducts in soil samples the soil sample contained 26 78 mg kg ammonium nitrogen and 0 01 mg kg nitrate nitrogen with an organic carbon content of 14 90 g kg table s1 no additional nitrogen was added p nitrophenol m nitrophenol 5 nitrosalicylic acid 4 hydroxy 3 nitrobenzoic and 2 4 dinitrophenol were detected by hplc ms ms after the heat pds treatment figs s4 s6 in addition the peak at m z 154 was attributed to nitrophenolic byproducts with 2 hydroxyl groups on the phenolic ring although the exact positions of the functional groups remain unknown without authentic standards their possible structures are illustrated in table s2 these nitrophenolic byproducts were mostly present in soil water implying they are relatively mobile and readily transported via runoff lin et al 2000 yang et al 2021 fig 3 shows the time dependent formation of the identified nitrogenous byproducts samples were analyzed by ms ms without hplc separation the yields in the soil sample represent the sum of individual isomers contributing to the ms peak assuming the isomers have a same ionization efficiency and fragmentation pattern in other words the values based on peak m z 138 and m z 182 represent the overall quantities of mono nitrophenols and hydroxy mono nitrobenzoic acids respectively in a sample more details can be found in the texts s3 and s4 of si the formation of nitrophenolic byproducts increased first and then decreased with a pds dose of 30 mmol kg the maximum formation of mono nitrophenols and hydroxy mono nitrobenzoic acids reached 0 0045 and 0 007 Œºmol kg between 8 and 12 h respectively 3 3 transformation pathways of ammonium the formation of nitrophenolic byproducts indicates the oxidation of nh4 so4 generated by the activation of pds played a key role because no nitrogenous byproducts were detected in the control without heat activation fig 1b the importance of so4 is also evidenced by the absence of nitrogenous byproducts in the treatment with so4 quenched by methanol fig s7 like the oh oxidation process one electron oxidation of nh4 forming nh2 is presumed to be the first step of the transformation huang et al 2008 laszlo et al 1998 pagsberg 1972 bimolecular rate constants of 1 4 107 m 1s 1 and 3 5 105 m 1s 1 were reported for the oxidation of nh3 and nh4 by so4 respectively r1 r2 neta et al 1988 in addition as oh is always co present with so4 though its concentration is very low at acidic and neutral conditions liang and su 2009 it could also be responsible for the oxidation of ammonium r3 r4 laszlo et al 1998 zhang et al 2019 nh2 can be terminated by combining with oh forming a hydroxylamine nh2oh r5 or coupling to each other forming hydrazine n2h4 r6 pagsberg 1972 hydroxylamine and hydrazine can be oxidized to n2 by pds so4 or oh r7 r10 ball et al 1985 feng et al 2017 gonzalez and braun 1996 in addition nh2 can react with dissolved oxygen forming nh2oo r11 laszlo et al 1998 pagsberg 1972 nh2oo isomerizes rapidly to hnooh and then decomposes to no r12 laszlo et al 1998 pagsberg 1972 in this study the formation of no was visualized by epr analysis as illustrated in fig s8 the no fe dtcs 3 spin adduct is characterized by the isotropic epr signal at g value of 2 04 with a triplet superhyperfine structure a n of 12 5 g chen et al 2017 this signal of no was absent without pds or nh4 no can be oxidized by oh to yield no2 r13 wu et al 2019 which is further oxidized by so4 or oh to form no2 r14 r15 john and james 1999 neta et al 1977 alternatively no can be directly oxidized by dissolved oxygen to form no2 r16 wu et al 2019 coupling of two no2 forms n2o4 which is hydroxylated to no3 r17 r18 john and james 1999 this reaction pathway is depicted in fig 4 fig s9 shows the concentrations of inorganic nitrogen species during heat pds treatment it appears that reduced nh4 was almost quantitively transformed to no3 in the absence of organic substrates in the presence of nom no and no2 can be incorporated into nom molecules to form nitrophenolic byproducts which has been demonstrated in prior studies yang et al 2019 2021 as a result the yield of no3 at 24 h was reduced from 0 162 mm to 0 096 mm fig s9 according to the pathway shown in fig 4 the reaction of nh2 with oxygen is a key step in the propagation of radical chain reactions leading to nitrate and nitrating agents to verify this the dissolved oxygen concentration in samples was reduced from 4 83 to 1 38 mg l by n2 purging resulting in the nitrophenolic byproducts formation being significantly reduced fig s10 while the no3 formation was also greatly suppressed fig s9 3 4 reactive sites in nom molecules phenolic moieties in nom macromolecules are recognized to be the main reactive sites for no2 attack in the prior studies yang et al 2019 2021 herein phenol was selected as a model compound to mimic the reactivity of nom to elucidate the nitration pathway in the heat pds nh4 system fig 1c shows the ms spectra of phenol upon heat pds nh4 treatment according to the 15n isotopic signature peaks of m z 122 m z 138 and m z 214 can be easily identified to be nitrogenous byproducts after comparing with the authentic standards fig 5 the peak of m z 138 was determined to be o nitrophenol and p nitrophenol which were also identified in nom and soil samples the peak of m z 122 was identified to be p nitrosophenol and the peak of m z 214 is probably attributed to nitroso diphenyls their possible structures are illustrated in table s3 the formation of the identified nitrogenous byproducts increased first and then declined with the prolonging of reaction time fig 6 or increase of pds dose fig s11b with the increase of ammonium concentration their yields increased monotonically fig s11c no nitrogenous byproducts were detected in the presence of excessive methanol fig s12 after purged with n2 the yields of nitrophenolic byproducts were greatly suppressed fig s11a these observations are in accordance with those found in nom samples figs 2 s7 and s10 and justify the rationality of phenolic moieties as the reactive sites for nitration nitration of phenols is a two step reaction the first step is the h abstraction on the phenoxy oxygen to generate a phenoxy radical this step can be accomplished by either no2 or so4 chen et al 2020 yang et al 2019 according to chen et al so4 reacts with phenols primarily via one electron transfer generating phenoxy radicals which plays a dominant role chen et al 2020 the second step is the addition of a no2 to the phenoxy radical at its ortho or para position to form nitrophenols barzaghi and herrmann 2002 bedini et al 2012 no can also combine with phenoxy radicals forming nitroso substituted byproducts vione et al 2004a 2004b which explains the formation of p nitrosophenol m z 122 nitrosophenols are not stable and can be degraded by so4 or oxidized to nitrophenols in the heat pds process fig s13 nitrosophenols can also be oxidized by so4 to phenoxy radicals which couple with other phenoxy radicals forming nitroso diphenyls m z 214 it was unexpected that nitrophenolic byproducts m z 138 and m z 183 including p nitrophenol o nitrophenol 2 4 dinitrophenol and 2 6 dinitrophenol were also identified after comparing with the authentic standards when the phenol was replaced by ba during the heat pds nh4 treatment figs 1d and 5 fig s14 presents the time dependent formation of the identified nitrogenous byproducts the concentrations of o nitrophenol and p nitrophenol increased first and then declined di nitrophenolic byproducts appeared after 6 h and increased continuously note that the formation of nitrophenols from ba was significantly higher than those from phenol at identical conditions as shown in fig 6 the temporal maximum formation of o nitrophenol and p nitrophenol from ba appeared at 4 and 6 h with the yields reaching 2 95 and 1 23 Œºm respectively however the respective highest yields of o nitrophenol and p nitrophenol from phenol were only 0 23 and 0 30 Œºm which appeared at 4 and 5 h this suggests that aromatic carboxylate moieties might even play a more significant role than phenolics as the substrates in nitrophenolic byproducts formation the bimolecular rate constants of so4 reacting with phenol and ba are 8 8 109 m 1s 1 and 1 2 109 m 1s 1 respectively neta et al 1977 wojn√°rovits and tak√°cs 2019 it implies that phenol is more rapidly oxidized by so4 than ba giving other conditions identical in other words nh4 has more chance to react with so4 in the presence of ba generating more nitrating agents no and no2 which favors the formation of nitrated byproducts owing to the electron withdrawing carboxylic acid group on the aromatic ring ba is relatively electron deficient its redox potential is 1 01 v franck et al 2013 which is almost equal to that of no2 1 03 v thus directly oxidation of ba by no2 is probably unfavorable however ba can be transformed to phenol by so4 the reaction is initiated by transferring an electron from the carboxylate oxygen to a so4 followed by kolbe decarboxylation to form a benzene radical which further transforms to phenol hori et al 2004 neta et al 1977 such a decarboxylation hydroxylation is a main transformation pathway of aromatic carboxylic acids and is widely observed in so4 oxidation processes criquet and leitner 2015 fu et al 2019 lu et al 2016 zemel h and w 1978 fig s15 shows the formation of phenol along with the degradation of ba in the heat pds oxidation process in the absence or presence of nh4 this result implies that phenolic substrates for nitrating can be in situ generated from aromatic carboxylic acids in the presence of so4 thus the potential of nom to form nitrogenous byproducts in so4 oxidation processes might have been significantly underestimated given that nom molecules are rich of aromatic moieties with carboxylate substitution croue et al 2000 sillanpaa et al 2015 which tend to be transformed by so4 to phenolics susceptible to nitrating the proposed transformation pathway of ba and phenol in the heat pds nh4 oxidation process is depicted in fig 7 4 conclusions in the present study transformation of ammonium to nitrophenolic byproducts in a heat activated pds oxidation process was demonstrated using 15n isotope labeling in combination with ms analysis during this process nh4 was oxidized by so4 and following a radical chain reaction to generate no2 which acted as the primary nitrating agent phenolic moieties in nom molecules acted as the direct sites for nitrating moreover these substrates could be in situ generated because of the reactions between so4 and aromatic carboxylate moieties of nom this means that the nitrophenolic byproducts formation potential of nom is significantly higher than what was assumed earlier in previous studies we revealed that nitrite could be transformed to nitrophenolic byproducts by so4 ji et al 2019 2017 2018 yang et al 2019 2021 compared to nitrite ammonium is ubiquitous in wastewaters and environment at concentrations much higher than nitrite thus formation of nitrophenolic byproducts will be widespread when so4 is applied to wastewaters and contaminated subsurface with ammonium playing a significant role in their formation which is of emerging

lake dianchi li et al 2019 however lakes show different levels of resilience to algal blooms despite receiving similar amounts of nutrients janssen et al 2014 liu et al 2010 natural factors such as morphometric climate and sediment characteristics could explain up to 58 of the variance in chlorophyll a and are therefore considered as fundamental properties causing this inter lake variability in vulnerability to algal blooms liu et al 2010 messager et al 2016 sch√§fer et al 2014 morphometric lake characteristics are indicators of lake dimensions such as depth lake area and shoreline development i e a measure of shoreline irregularity defined as shoreline length over lake area for instance lake vulnerability to algal blooms is affected by the depth which increases the nutrient buffer capacity liu et al 2010 qin et al 2020 the lake area which increases wind induced resuspension evans 1994 scheffer 2004 and shoreline development which creates wind shelters for macrophytes andersson 2001 aronow 1984 janssen et al 2014 climate characteristics are long term meteorological conditions such as ice periods and water temperature in the epilimnion and hypolimnion for example climate conditions affect the vulnerability to algal blooms by driving the timing of mixing and stratification of lakes and thereby determining nutrient losses and release processes janssen et al 2019b qin et al 2020 sediment characteristics are indicators of the bottom materials of lakes such as sediment density and clay and sand content sediment characteristics affect the vulnerability to algal blooms by regulating the phosphorus mobility and resuspension processes in lakes s√∏ndergaard et al 2003 here we aim to assess the effects of unique lake characteristics on lake vulnerability to algal blooms we assessed 19 536 lakes larger than 0 1 km2 including glacial ponds and reservoirs in mainland china fig 1 extracted from hydrolakes messager et al 2016 first we group the lakes based on their stratification classes and analyze the spatial variabilities of these stratification classes next we study how lake morphometric climate and sediment characteristics vary among the stratification classes finally we simulate the effect of typical lake characteristics per stratification class on the vulnerability of lakes to algal blooms we define vulnerability as the possibility of being harmed by algal blooms when being exposed to stress from nutrient pollution a lake can thus be highly vulnerable yet if the nutrient pollution remains sufficiently low algal blooms will not occur our characterization provides an important baseline to inform policymakers in what regions lakes are potentially most vulnerable to algal blooms methods in our analysis we 1 group lakes into stratification classes to determine how these classes are spatially distributed 2 identify the morphometric climate and sediment characteristics to assess the variation in lake characteristics among stratification classes and 3 assess the lake vulnerability to algal blooms for representative lakes each reflecting a stratification class below we describe the methods for these steps data collection of lake characteristics morphometric characteristics to study the lake morphometric characteristics we included lake area depth and shoreline development a measure of lake shape calculated as a ratio between shoreline length and circumference of a circle with the same area from the hydrolakes database developed by messager et al 2016 the hydrolakes database is considered the most complete database of lakes around the world the morphometric characteristics are provided with acceptable ranges for uncertainty yet with a better predictive power for larger lakes than smaller lakes messager et al 2016 the hydrolakes database is based on seven different databases canvec swbd modis nhd ecrins glwd and grand that used radar technology long term imagery composites and topographic maps to extract polygons of individual lakes with a surface area larger than 0 1 km2 the extracted polygons are post processed by messager et al 2016 for quality assurance lake area and shoreline development followed from respectively the surface area and circumference of the final set of polygons messager et al 2016 calculated average lake depth using an elevation model validated on 5000 lakes combined with elevation data from earthenv dem90 robinson et al 2014 to study the morphometric characteristics we selected the lakes from the hydrolakes database located in mainland china climate characteristics for the lake climate characteristics we used the vic lake model bowling and lettenmaier 2010 to simulate the daily 1d temperature profile for every single lake within the set of lakes selected from hydrolakes vic lake is a 1 dimensional lake temperature model bowling and lettenmaier 2010 and is based on seminal work on the lake energy balance by hostetler and bartlein 1990 hostetler 1991 and patterson and hamblin 1988 previous studies have used vic lake to simulate water temperatures and ice cover for a variety of lakes bowling and lettenmaier 2010 mishra et al 2011 and the model has been used in isimip inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project for climate impact studies on lakes isimip 2020 we ran vic lake to simulate water temperature for the period 1900 2005 with 0 5 m depth temperature intervals as input we used climate forcing 1900 2005 from four climate models from isimip gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 this climate data are available on a 0 5 x0 5 lat long grid and includes air temperature precipitation atmospheric pressure incoming short and longwave radiation vapor pressure and wind speed we simulated the lake temperature for each lake using the climate forcing of the grid that coincided with the lake s pour point location i e lake outlet as provided by hydrolakes all temperatures were height corrected to adjust for lower temperatures at higher elevation using a fixed lapse rate of 6 5 c km 1 we used the first 100 years of our run 1900 2000 for analysis on the baseline conditions of the climate characteristics a common approach to evaluate model performance is to regress predicted x axis versus observed values y axis and compare intercept and slope parameters against the 1 1 line pi√±eiro et al 2008 an intercept close to 0 and a slope close to 1 reflects a good fit here we used the linear model function lm of the stats package in r to find the linear regression lines between modelled vic lake output versus observed modis resulting in 5 regression lines 4 with vic lake output generated with the 4 climate models and the last for the model average each regression line was plotted against surface water temperature observations of modis for 216 chinese lakes from the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac 2020 in our analysis we excluded the modelled output during ice coverage periods because there is a mismatch in surface temperature between vic lake which is predicted just below the ice layer and the data from modis which provides the temperature on top of the ice layer besides a general validation we also included some exemplary time series of individual lakes in appendix a to compare the seasonal patterns of vic lake with data sediment characteristics to study the lake sediment characteristics we used estimations from soil maps most soil maps have data on terrestrial systems while lacking the data of aquatic systems since lakes are depressions in the landscape that collect eroded top soil from their surroundings we assumed that the most common sediment type around the lake corresponds with the sediment type in the lake we used the shapefiles of the chinese lakes provided by the hydrolakes database messager et al 2016 in combination with the harmonized world soil database fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2009 to estimate lake sediment characteristics we drew a buffer of 1000 meter around the hydrolakes shapefiles and applied zonal statistics on this buffer to find the most common sediment type around the lake the same method for a set of european lakes resulted in about 71 of the cases in an acceptable classification appendix b grouping lakes by stratification classes the stratification class of a lake depends on the number and duration of stratification periods and ice coverage following the limnologic stratification classification system lakes can be classified as amictic lakes that are continuously ice covered continuous polymictic lakes that are continuously mixed discontinuous polymictic lakes that occasionally stratify each year monomictic lakes that stratify once a year for a longer period dimictic lakes that stratify twice a year for a longer period and meromictic lakes that are continuously stratified lewis jr 1983 woolway and merchant 2019 within this classification lakes can be distinguished by warm lake classes yearly average surface water temperature 4 c and cold lake classes yearly average surface water temperature 4 c warm lake classes are 1 polymictic continuous warm lakes 2 polymictic discontinuous warm lakes 3 monomictic warm lakes 4 dimictic lakes and 5 meromictic lakes cold lake classes are 6 polymictic continuous cold lakes 7 polymictic discontinuous cold lakes 8 monomictic cold lakes and 9 amictic lakes to determine the reference stratification classification of each lake we used the simulated outcomes of the vic lake model for water temperature and ice period for the period 1900 2000 to estimate the period of stratification to do so we first calculated the water density d kg m 3 based on the simulated water temperature td c at each depth d m following the isimip protocol bigg 1967 millero and poisson 1981 d 999 842594 6 793952 10 2 x td 9 095290 10 3 x td 2 1 001685 10 4 x td 3 1 120083 10 6 x td 4 6 536336 10 9 td 5 next the water density gradient Œ¥œÅd was calculated as Œ¥ œÅ d œÅ d œÅ d 1 the depth of the steepest density gradient is taken as the boundary between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion for each day of the year we averaged both the epilimnion and the hypolimnion temperatures to obtain a 100 year averaged time series of the epilimnion and the hypolimnion temperatures when density differences between the epilimnion and hypolimnion exceeded 0 1 kg m 3 we defined the lake as being stratified based on the number and duration of the stratification periods the stratification class for each lake has been determined we chose to exclude salt lakes and fully frozen lakes from our analysis as their characteristics interfere with the thermal stratification dynamics studied here salt lakes can exhibit chemical stratification and are typically endorheic meaning that there is no outflow hence evaporation is larger than the dilution by inflowing rivers or precipitation to our knowledge a comprehensive overview of chinese salt lakes is not available therefore we decided to define all lakes for which the evaporation was larger than the sum of the water inflow and precipitation as salt lakes lakes frozen entirely from the surface to the bottom cannot be thermally stratified as liquid water is required lakes for which vic lake predicted a full frozen lake were characterized as such and together with salt lakes were excluded from our classification and subsequent analyses spatial and statistical analysis globally lake stratification classes typically follow the north south axis yet for the analysis of lakes in china we divided lakes into east and west lakes following the country s two geographically distinct climate regions roughly divided by the hu huanyong line a mountainous and temperate continental climate to the west and a sub tropical monsoon climate to the east next to assess whether the chinese lakes follow the global north south patterns we translocated the lakes by calculating the altitude corrected latitude adjusted latitude following lewis jr 1983 appendix c for each stratification class we calculated the statistical variation within the different lake characteristics since our data were not normally distributed we used an asymptotic k sample fisher pitman permutation test with the function oneway test of the coin library in r hothorn et al 2019 to test whether groups of stratification classes are equal to randomly selected groups of lakes a global p value 0 05 indicates that the stratification classes are not equal to randomly chosen lakes from the entire data set and thus that lake characteristics are unique for each stratification class next we used a pairwise k sample permutation test with the function pairwisepermutationmatrix of the rcompanion in r mangiafico and mangiafico 2017 to conduct permutation tests across groups simulating vulnerability of lakes to algal blooms as a final step we assessed the lake vulnerability to algal blooms for each of the stratification classes lake vulnerability is expressed by two indicators 1 the possible severity of algal blooms expressed here as the maximum chlorophyll a concentration that could emerge in the epilimnion red line fig 2 2 the possible onset of algal blooms expressed as the critical nutrient load which is the amount of nutrient load at which the yearly average epilimnion algal concentrations exceed 20 ¬µg l 1 carlson 1977 blue line fig 2 we assessed the lake vulnerability to algal blooms for 9 representative lakes each reflecting a stratification class with its specific morphometric climate and sediment characteristics through bifurcation analyses using the dynamic ecosystem model pclake janssen et al 2019b a bifurcation analysis is a technique to study the effect of external pressure here phosphorus load on the water quality state here chlorophyll a pclake has been successfully applied for numerous lakes including the chinese lakes taihu janssen et al 2017 chaohu kong et al 2016 and dianchi li et al 2019 a bifurcation analysis results in two load response curves x axis p load y axis chlorophyll a one for the process of eutrophication clear turbid and one for oligotrophication turbid clear fig 2 the vulnerability in terms of the possible severity of algal blooms is measured as the maximum chlorophyll a level within the load response curves which is reached when algae become light limited chang et al 2019 the vulnerability in terms of the onset of algal blooms is measured as the critical nutrient load gp m 2 d 1 at which the load response graph crosses the chlorophyll a concentration of 20 ¬µg l 1 the critical nutrient load for eutrophication can be larger compared to oligotrophication in case alternative stable states are present scheffer and van nes 2007 for more details on the methods to define the vulnerability see appendix d based on the maximum possible epilimnion chlorophyll a concentrations in combination with the height of the critical nutrient load 3 levels can be distinguished 1 low vulnerability maximum chlorophyll a concentrations are below eutrophic levels 20 ¬µg l 1 so lakes do not have a critical nutrient load these lakes have a low vulnerability since algal blooms will be mild 2 medium vulnerability maximum chlorophyll a concentrations above eutrophic levels 20 ¬µg l 1 and critical nutrient loads above 0 0025 gp m 2 d 1 these lakes have a medium vulnerability since an exceedance of the critical nutrient load needs relative high nutrient pollution yet ultimately lead to severe algal blooms 3 high vulnerability maximum chlorophyll a concentrations above eutrophic levels 20 ¬µg l 1 and critical nutrient loads below 0 0025 gp m 2 d 1 these lakes are highly vulnerable since an exceedance of the critical nutrient load occurs at low nutrient pollution and exceedance will lead to severe algal blooms results we first validated the model output of the vic lake model fig 3 the regression lines for the vic lake run were all close to the 1 1 line as can be seen from the intercepts which were close to 0 0 81 to 0 06 and slopes which were close to 1 0 95 0 99 for all 5 regression lines 4 climate models as input and 1 average the goodness of fit r2 adj varies between 0 84 0 87 suggesting a relatively good fit with a slight underestimation of lake temperatures the average of vic lake run with input from 4 climate models reflects the data reasonably well building trust to use the average output of the 4 climate models in our further analysis we identified 19 536 lakes in mainland china 0 1 km2 fig 4 most of these lakes 80 were in the east and fewer in the west of china 20 the majority of the lakes were polymictic continuous warm lakes 54 fig 4a the second largest group consisted of the monomictic warm lakes 32 followed by the polymictic discontinuous warm lakes 7 the amictic and polymictic continuous cold lakes both 3 the discontinuous cold monomictic cold dimictic and meromictic lakes were the least represented all less than 1 of the total number of lakes the spatial distribution of lakes followed the two distinct climate regions found in china with eastern china accommodating typically the warm lake classes and western china the cold lake classes fig 4b also the adjusted latitude showed a clear distribution fig 5 with rising surface temperatures there is a transition from the colder lake classes e g polymictic continuous cold lakes to warmer classes e g monomictic warm lakes the variation around the linear downward trend can be explained by the inter lake variation in other lake characteristics such as depth and area the stratification classes were used to further characterize chinese lakes based on their morphologic climate and sediment characteristics fig 5 the fisher pitman permutation test showed that the stratification groups were significantly different all global p values 0 001 with the pairwise permutation test we identified the significant differences between groups of stratification classes although 96 of the lakes in the presented database were relatively shallow with a depth of less than 10 m we found some differences in morphometry among stratification classes the meromictic and monomictic warm lakes seemed slightly deeper and more irregular in shoreline development than the cold lake classes which was significant for meromictic lakes fig 6 a c the relative deeper warm lakes can be explained by the large proportion of reservoir lakes in the presented database located to the east of china which tend to be deeper than natural lakes polymictic discontinuous cold and monomictic cold lakes were the shallowest lakes followed by the polymictic continuous cold and polymictic continuous warm lakes the polymictic discontinuous warm lakes amictic lakes and dimictic lakes were slightly deeper as the climate parameters were used to group the lakes by stratification class the climate characterization should logically follow the stratification classes for the epilimnion and hypolimnion temperatures the cold lake classes indeed showed the significant lowest temperatures whereas the warm lake classes showed the significant highest temperatures also ice days showed a significant division among all the lakes with amictic lakes having significantly most ice days besides polymictic continuous cold polymictic discontinuous cold and monomictic cold lakes had significantly more ice days than the warm lake classes temperature differences in the polymictic continuous cold and discontinuous cold lakes were minute as these systems are mixed year round the polymictic continuous cold lakes had a significantly lower epilimnion and hypolimnion temperature compared to the polymictic continuous warm lakes also the polymictic discontinuous cold lakes had a significantly lower epilimnion and hypolimnion temperature compared to the polymictic discontinuous warm lakes fig 6d e the amictic lakes were significantly distinguished from all other lakes by being nearly permanently ice covered fig 6f the epilimnion temperatures in amictic lakes were on average 0 5 c lower than the hypolimnion temperatures showing inverse stratification meromictic lakes showed the significant highest epilimnion temperature yet their hypolimnion waters were significantly colder than the dimictic and monomictic warm lakes due to the permanent stratification the monomictic cold lakes were similar in temperature and ice coverage to the polymictic discontinuous cold lakes but they stratified for a longer period also dimictic and monomictic warm lakes did not differ significantly in terms of their average epilimnion and hypolimnion temperatures but the monomictic warm lakes had a single mixing period resulting in higher temperature variation and a larger range in ice days next we analysed sediment characteristics although differences were small the warm lakes tavg 4 c reach higher maxima clay contents than the cold lakes fig 6g which was significant for the meromictic lakes showing the highest clay content amictic lakes had the lowest average clay content though not statistically significant from other lake classes most lakes were more or less equal in sand content fig 6h also the differences between reference bulk densities were minute fig 6i with only a clear pattern for monomictic warm and meromictic lakes which show a low reference bulk density compared to the other lake classes as a final step we assessed the vulnerability of the stratification classes for the maximum possible chlorophyll a severity of algal blooms and the critical nutrient load onset of algal blooms maximum chlorophyll a concentrations were largely dependent on lake temperature fig 7 a whereas critical nutrient loads were dependent on both temperature and depth fig 7b based on the maximum epilimnion chlorophyll a concentrations in combination with the critical nutrient load the lake stratification classes can be grouped in terms of their vulnerability to algal bloom formation from low to medium to high 1 low vulnerability max chlorophyll a 20 ¬µg l 1 no critical nutrient load amictic and meromictic lake class these lakes have low vulnerability as a result of their permanently stratified nature meromictic lakes or the near permanently ice coverage amictic 2 medium vulnerability max chlorophyll a 20 ¬µg l 1 and critical nutrient loads 0 0025 gp m 2 d 1 polymictic continuous warm polymictic discontinuous cold and monomictic cold lake classes these lakes showed medium vulnerability as a result of their relatively low depth 2 m which initially support macrophytes granting resilience to algal blooms when nutrient pollution exceeds critical thresholds though algal blooms will be severe 3 high vulnerability max chlorophyll a 20 ¬µg l 1 and critical nutrient loads 0 0025 gp m 2 d 1 polymictic continuous cold polymictic discontinuous warm dimictic and monomictic warm lake classes except for the polymictic continuous cold these lakes were all highly vulnerable due to their intermediate depth 3 1 5 3 m and summer temperatures t 10 c their depth prevents sufficient macrophyte growth to grant resilience to algal blooms and the summer temperatures are ideal for promoting severe algal blooms despite being shallower 2 m depth polymictic continuous cold lakes also have a high maximum chlorophyll a and a low critical nutrient load due to the low summer temperatures t 10 c the short growing season of polymictic continuous cold lakes favours fast growing algae over slower growing macrophytes discussion lake vulnerability to algal bloom formation we characterized 19 536 chinese freshwater lakes and identified a spatial division between lakes in the east of china that are typically warmer compared to lakes in the west although the majority of the chinese lakes are shallow with a depth typically less than 10 m the lakes found in the east of china are slightly deeper compared to their cooler counterparts in the west although these spatial patterns in depth might seem counterintuitive this pattern can be explained by the presence of a large number of reservoir lakes in hydrolakes in the east of china which are generally deeper than natural lakes for sediment we could not find a clear difference except for meromictic lakes which have significant clay richer sediment compared to other lakes finally our model results suggest that cold lake classes amictic monomictic cold polymictic discontinuous cold typically seem to have a low to medium vulnerability to algal blooms an exception forms the polymictic continuous cold lakes with a high modelled vulnerability possibly due to the absence of stratification and the short growing season promoting algae over macrophytes moreover our model results suggest that the warm lake classes polymictic continuous warm polymictic discontinuous warm dimictic and monomictic warm seem to have a medium to high vulnerability to algal blooms an exception forms the meromictic lakes with their low modelled vulnerability to algal blooms explained by the permanent stratified nature leading to losses of nutrients to the hypolimnion the effect of the different morphometric climate and sediment characteristics on lake vulnerability to the severity and onset of algal blooms is complex because of the various mechanisms through which primary producers are affected yet some general patterns can be derived effect of morphometric characteristics on lake vulnerability morphological characteristics of lakes are important factors determining phytoplankton concentrations h√•kanson 2005 we found that the differences among the morphometric characteristics are most profound for lake depth the lakes in the east of china tend to be slightly deeper because of many deep reservoirs than the cooler lake classes in western china the effect of depth on the lake vulnerability of algae is not straightforward janse et al 2008 and scheffer and van nes 2007 show that increasing depths in shallow lakes with dense macrophyte biomass result in a lower threshold for nutrient loads leading to an earlier onset of algal blooms for deeper lakes however it is shown that the risk of algal blooms decreases with depth h√•kanson 2005 liu et al 2010 our assessment of lake vulnerability follows this pattern first the critical nutrient load was lowest for lakes with the intermediate water level 3 4 m suggesting that these lakes are most vulnerable to the onset of algal blooms both deeper and shallower lakes showed more resilience to the onset of algal blooms compared to lakes with an intermediate water level effect of climate characteristics on lake vulnerability for the climate characteristics we found that the lakes show a clear spatial distribution over china with the warm lake classes in eastern china and the cold lakes in western china our model indicated that warm lake classes seem more vulnerable to severe algal blooms confirming previous research paerl and huisman 2008 for instance low temperatures in polymictic continuous cold and polymictic discontinuous cold lakes lead to less severe algal blooms compared to respectively polymictic continuous warm and polymictic discontinuous warm lakes in addition the vulnerability of lakes to algal blooms also depends on stratification and mixing periods of lakes which could mobilize or block phosphorus release from the sediments affecting algal blooms wetzel 2001 wilhelm and adrian 2008 meromictic lakes hardly mix so that the hypolimnion functions as a nutrient sink making nutrients unavailable for algal growth judd et al 2005 and resulting in a low vulnerability to severe algal blooms monomictic warm lakes mix for longer periods however since stratification mainly occurs during summer nutrients availability during the growing season is blocked leading to less severe algal blooms compared to non stratifying lakes dimictic lakes mix and stratify twice a year supplying algal blooms with sufficient nutrients potentially leading to severe algal blooms also the ice period is important under ice algal growth is typically limited by light especially when covered with snow we showed that the long lasting ice layer in amictic greatly reduces the risk of blooms resulting in a maximum chlorophyll a concentration of 16 ¬µg l 1 this result is in line with hampton et al 2017 who found that summer average chlorophyll a in icy lakes are 13 6 2 84 ¬µg l 1 however in specific cases when light is sufficient the under ice environment can be hospitable for algal growth resulting in higher algal biomasses hampton et al 2017 effect of sediment characteristics on lake vulnerability finer sediments could be expected at low elevated regions due to a process called downward fining paola and seal 1995 we observed a slightly higher maximum clay content in warm lakes than in cold lakes yet this was only significant for meromictic lakes clay is known to bind phosphorus under aerobic conditions and releases phosphorus under anaerobic conditions li et al 2017 s√∏ndergaard et al 2003 lakes with higher clay contents have typically lower critical nutrient loads meaning that lower nutrient input is needed to trigger algal blooms compared to other lakes janse et al 2008 since variation in sediment characteristics was larger within stratification classes than between stratification classes conclusions on the sediment data remained elusive discretizing our world here we discretized the lakes by stratification class discretization improves the understanding of lake ecosystems especially in big data studies kraemer 2020 yet discretization also depends on choices and could in itself create uncertainty here we grouped lakes by stratification classes using 100 years averaged daily epilimnion and hypolimnion temperatures hereafter referred to as averaging method alternatively stratification classes can be based on the most common stratification class among the 100 specific years hereafter we referred to this as the mode method woolway and merchant 2019 whether the mode or averaging method is preferred depends on the goal both methods show most lakes are polymictic and indicate that the warm lakes are mainly located in the east and the cold lakes in the west appendix e the mode method provides information on the dynamics of the stratification class and assigns the most common stratification class even if this occurs only for 25 of the time with the averaging method the stochasticity in weather patterns is averaged out leading to more stable predictions with the averaging method we obtained logical results along with the stratification classes such as reverse stratification in amictic lakes and lower hypolimnion temperatures in meromictic lakes we here think that both methods provide valuable information but we used the averaging method in our study to set a baseline of the average stratification classes of the lakes in china data validity this study provides the first analysis with a comprehensive database that combines morphometric climate and sediment characteristics of lakes in china yet combining data from different databases could introduce uncertainty in the analysis from the different sources 1 the morphometric variables from messager et al 2016 2 the climate variables from vic lake model simulations and 3 the sediment data from fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2009 to analyze the uncertainty in our study we have recalled uncertainties in the morphometric data messager et al 2016 and validated the climate characteristics and sediment characteristics we found the largest uncertainty in the sediment parameters which we validated on a set of european lakes appendix b validation of our method for china specifically was not possible as data to do so are currently unavailable to us similar to europe lake sediment has been disturbed in china due to intensive human activities e g sand dredging li et al 2014 therefore lake sediment layers may be disturbed leading to uncertainty in this data yet we expect that this uncertainty has a limited impact on our main conclusion as variations in sediment characteristics between the stratification groups were smaller compared to variation within stratification groups on the contrary water temperatures showed a relatively low uncertainty the average surface water temperature calculated with vic lake with the 4 climate models demonstrates an acceptable performance of vic lake although single lake estimates could deviate from this average we still saw good agreement for specific lakes appendix a recalling the validity in the morphometric characteristics messager et al 2016 found acceptable uncertainty ranges yet with less predictive power for smaller lakes compared to larger lakes using pclake we assessed the lake vulnerability to algal blooms for representative lakes based on the combined database pclake is a validated model showing generally an acceptable agreement with lake water quality data janse et al 2010 janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 li et al 2019 given the uncertainty of all data sources we deem the presented combined database suitable for studies on a national scale but care should be taken when interpreting the results for individual lakes as single lake estimates could hold relatively large errors future outlook temperature and eutrophication in this study we presented baseline average stratification classes for chinese lakes and their characteristics and showed that the most vulnerable lakes to algal blooms are likely located in the east the east west distribution of chinese lake vulnerability coincides with the human population distribution over china with the densest population in the east and the thinnest populated in the west tong et al 2020 tong et al 2017 human activities tend to cluster in downstream regions fang et al 2018 which are also typically warmer due to the lower elevation the coincidence of lake vulnerability with the highest human population might seem obvious yet they do not necessarily share the same cause as humans seek opportunities for trade transport and natural resources fang et al 2018 whereas lake vulnerability seems to be related to temperature and lake depth the future is likely to change e g due to climate and land use change ma et al 2010 strokal et al 2016 consequently lake characteristics are also likely to change in the future changing the future vulnerability to algal blooms of lakes climate change will affect future algal growth in two ways first lakes are expected to heat up vanderkelen et al 2020 resulting in changes in stratification classes woolway and merchant 2019 the number of ice covered lakes is likely to decrease and lakes will increasingly stratify woolway and merchant 2019 the magnitude of change depends on the lake characteristics kraemer et al 2015 but lake warming is likely to prolong and intensify algal blooms paerl and huisman 2008 tong et al 2021 second it is expected that climate change in china will lead to wetter conditions resulting in lower nutrient retentions on land wang et al 2020 as a result more nutrients will end up in freshwater systems potentially leading to algal blooms at the same time stress from eutrophication is likely to increase due to expected socioeconomic developments eutrophication is a major concern in china and many lakes are already eutrophic and most profound in the east huang et al 2020 liu et al 2010 tong et al 2017 wang et al 2018 food production and urbanization are important sources of nutrient losses to the environment strokal et al 2016 teurlincx et al 2019 future socioeconomic development is expected to allow a further increase in eutrophication strokal et al 2014 besides n p ratios in lakes might increase for instance due to improved wastewater treatment tong et al 2019 tong et al 2020 this is because phosphorus has in contrast to nitrogen no gaseous forms making it easier to remove it elevated n p ratios may favor blooms of potentially toxic non n fixing cyanobacteria van de waal et al 2014 defining future changes in the vulnerability of lakes to algal blooms is beyond the scope of this study yet lake characteristics will likely determine the severity of the algal response whereas increasing nutrient loads and n p ratios together with warmer lake water could result in longer periods of more severe algal blooms stronger stratification could mitigate this process by functioning as an algal sink modeling of future scenarios of socio ecological development could indicate the directions of future algal bloom developments janssen et al 2019a mooij et al 2019 with this characterization of the chinese lakes we aim to contribute to this step conclusions this study provides the first analysis with a comprehensive database that combines morphometric climate and sediment characteristics of lakes including ponds and reservoirs in china with this database we aimed to assess the effect of lake characteristics in chinese lakes on the vulnerability to algal blooms we found in this database that lakes ponds and reservoirs in the east of china are typically warmer and slightly deeper than lakes in the west simulations for representative lakes for each stratification class suggest that the warm lakes in the east of china seem to be generally more vulnerable to algal blooms than the cold lakes in the west with exceptions of the meromictic lakes and polymictic cold lakes the unfortunate coincidence that high lake vulnerability is found in the east of china where nutrient pollution is highest asks for priority in preventing severe algal blooms in

16792,chinese lakes including ponds and reservoirs are increasingly threatened by algal blooms yet each lake is unique leading to large inter lake variation in lake vulnerability to algal blooms here we aim to assess the effects of unique lake characteristics on lake vulnerability to algal blooms to this end we built a novel and comprehensive database of lake morphometric climate and sediment characteristics of 19 536 chinese lakes including ponds and reservoirs 0 1 km2 we assessed lake characteristics for nine stratification classes and show that lakes including ponds and reservoirs in eastern china typically have a warm stratification class tavg 4 c and are slightly deeper than those in western china model results for representative lakes suggest that the most vulnerable lakes to algal blooms are in eastern china where pollution levels are also highest our characterization provides an important baseline to inform policymakers in what regions lakes are potentially most vulnerable to algal blooms graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords eutrophication algal blooms vulnerability stratification vic lake pclake introduction chinese lakes including ponds and reservoirs are of great economic environmental and cultural importance chang et al 2020 huang et al 2020 by providing the world s largest freshwater fish culture facilitating drinking water and supporting tourism gao and zhang 2010 china accommodates over 20 of the world s human population with only 0 5 of the world s lake volume spread over 6 of the global land surface area guan and hubacek 2007 messager et al 2016 world bank 2017 lakes are thus considered a critical natural resource in large parts of the country guan and hubacek 2007 many chinese lakes are currently eutrophic negatively impacting ecosystem services janssen et al 2020 liu et al 2010 with the most pronounced examples of toxic algal blooms in lake taihu janssen et al 2017 wang et al 2019 lake chaohu kong et al 2016 and lake dianchi li et al 2019 however lakes show different levels of resilience to algal blooms despite receiving similar amounts of nutrients janssen et al 2014 liu et al 2010 natural factors such as morphometric climate and sediment characteristics could explain up to 58 of the variance in chlorophyll a and are therefore considered as fundamental properties causing this inter lake variability in vulnerability to algal blooms liu et al 2010 messager et al 2016 sch√§fer et al 2014 morphometric lake characteristics are indicators of lake dimensions such as depth lake area and shoreline development i e a measure of shoreline irregularity defined as shoreline length over lake area for instance lake vulnerability to algal blooms is affected by the depth which increases the nutrient buffer capacity liu et al 2010 qin et al 2020 the lake area which increases wind induced resuspension evans 1994 scheffer 2004 and shoreline development which creates wind shelters for macrophytes andersson 2001 aronow 1984 janssen et al 2014 climate characteristics are long term meteorological conditions such as ice periods and water temperature in the epilimnion and hypolimnion for example climate conditions affect the vulnerability to algal blooms by driving the timing of mixing and stratification of lakes and thereby determining nutrient losses and release processes janssen et al 2019b qin et al 2020 sediment characteristics are indicators of the bottom materials of lakes such as sediment density and clay and sand content sediment characteristics affect the vulnerability to algal blooms by regulating the phosphorus mobility and resuspension processes in lakes s√∏ndergaard et al 2003 here we aim to assess the effects of unique lake characteristics on lake vulnerability to algal blooms we assessed 19 536 lakes larger than 0 1 km2 including glacial ponds and reservoirs in mainland china fig 1 extracted from hydrolakes messager et al 2016 first we group the lakes based on their stratification classes and analyze the spatial variabilities of these stratification classes next we study how lake morphometric climate and sediment characteristics vary among the stratification classes finally we simulate the effect of typical lake characteristics per stratification class on the vulnerability of lakes to algal blooms we define vulnerability as the possibility of being harmed by algal blooms when being exposed to stress from nutrient pollution a lake can thus be highly vulnerable yet if the nutrient pollution remains sufficiently low algal blooms will not occur our characterization provides an important baseline to inform policymakers in what regions lakes are potentially most vulnerable to algal blooms methods in our analysis we 1 group lakes into stratification classes to determine how these classes are spatially distributed 2 identify the morphometric climate and sediment characteristics to assess the variation in lake characteristics among stratification classes and 3 assess the lake vulnerability to algal blooms for representative lakes each reflecting a stratification class below we describe the methods for these steps data collection of lake characteristics morphometric characteristics to study the lake morphometric characteristics we included lake area depth and shoreline development a measure of lake shape calculated as a ratio between shoreline length and circumference of a circle with the same area from the hydrolakes database developed by messager et al 2016 the hydrolakes database is considered the most complete database of lakes around the world the morphometric characteristics are provided with acceptable ranges for uncertainty yet with a better predictive power for larger lakes than smaller lakes messager et al 2016 the hydrolakes database is based on seven different databases canvec swbd modis nhd ecrins glwd and grand that used radar technology long term imagery composites and topographic maps to extract polygons of individual lakes with a surface area larger than 0 1 km2 the extracted polygons are post processed by messager et al 2016 for quality assurance lake area and shoreline development followed from respectively the surface area and circumference of the final set of polygons messager et al 2016 calculated average lake depth using an elevation model validated on 5000 lakes combined with elevation data from earthenv dem90 robinson et al 2014 to study the morphometric characteristics we selected the lakes from the hydrolakes database located in mainland china climate characteristics for the lake climate characteristics we used the vic lake model bowling and lettenmaier 2010 to simulate the daily 1d temperature profile for every single lake within the set of lakes selected from hydrolakes vic lake is a 1 dimensional lake temperature model bowling and lettenmaier 2010 and is based on seminal work on the lake energy balance by hostetler and bartlein 1990 hostetler 1991 and patterson and hamblin 1988 previous studies have used vic lake to simulate water temperatures and ice cover for a variety of lakes bowling and lettenmaier 2010 mishra et al 2011 and the model has been used in isimip inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project for climate impact studies on lakes isimip 2020 we ran vic lake to simulate water temperature for the period 1900 2005 with 0 5 m depth temperature intervals as input we used climate forcing 1900 2005 from four climate models from isimip gfdl esm2m hadgem2 es ipsl cm5a lr and miroc5 this climate data are available on a 0 5 x0 5 lat long grid and includes air temperature precipitation atmospheric pressure incoming short and longwave radiation vapor pressure and wind speed we simulated the lake temperature for each lake using the climate forcing of the grid that coincided with the lake s pour point location i e lake outlet as provided by hydrolakes all temperatures were height corrected to adjust for lower temperatures at higher elevation using a fixed lapse rate of 6 5 c km 1 we used the first 100 years of our run 1900 2000 for analysis on the baseline conditions of the climate characteristics a common approach to evaluate model performance is to regress predicted x axis versus observed values y axis and compare intercept and slope parameters against the 1 1 line pi√±eiro et al 2008 an intercept close to 0 and a slope close to 1 reflects a good fit here we used the linear model function lm of the stats package in r to find the linear regression lines between modelled vic lake output versus observed modis resulting in 5 regression lines 4 with vic lake output generated with the 4 climate models and the last for the model average each regression line was plotted against surface water temperature observations of modis for 216 chinese lakes from the land processes distributed active archive center lp daac 2020 in our analysis we excluded the modelled output during ice coverage periods because there is a mismatch in surface temperature between vic lake which is predicted just below the ice layer and the data from modis which provides the temperature on top of the ice layer besides a general validation we also included some exemplary time series of individual lakes in appendix a to compare the seasonal patterns of vic lake with data sediment characteristics to study the lake sediment characteristics we used estimations from soil maps most soil maps have data on terrestrial systems while lacking the data of aquatic systems since lakes are depressions in the landscape that collect eroded top soil from their surroundings we assumed that the most common sediment type around the lake corresponds with the sediment type in the lake we used the shapefiles of the chinese lakes provided by the hydrolakes database messager et al 2016 in combination with the harmonized world soil database fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2009 to estimate lake sediment characteristics we drew a buffer of 1000 meter around the hydrolakes shapefiles and applied zonal statistics on this buffer to find the most common sediment type around the lake the same method for a set of european lakes resulted in about 71 of the cases in an acceptable classification appendix b grouping lakes by stratification classes the stratification class of a lake depends on the number and duration of stratification periods and ice coverage following the limnologic stratification classification system lakes can be classified as amictic lakes that are continuously ice covered continuous polymictic lakes that are continuously mixed discontinuous polymictic lakes that occasionally stratify each year monomictic lakes that stratify once a year for a longer period dimictic lakes that stratify twice a year for a longer period and meromictic lakes that are continuously stratified lewis jr 1983 woolway and merchant 2019 within this classification lakes can be distinguished by warm lake classes yearly average surface water temperature 4 c and cold lake classes yearly average surface water temperature 4 c warm lake classes are 1 polymictic continuous warm lakes 2 polymictic discontinuous warm lakes 3 monomictic warm lakes 4 dimictic lakes and 5 meromictic lakes cold lake classes are 6 polymictic continuous cold lakes 7 polymictic discontinuous cold lakes 8 monomictic cold lakes and 9 amictic lakes to determine the reference stratification classification of each lake we used the simulated outcomes of the vic lake model for water temperature and ice period for the period 1900 2000 to estimate the period of stratification to do so we first calculated the water density d kg m 3 based on the simulated water temperature td c at each depth d m following the isimip protocol bigg 1967 millero and poisson 1981 d 999 842594 6 793952 10 2 x td 9 095290 10 3 x td 2 1 001685 10 4 x td 3 1 120083 10 6 x td 4 6 536336 10 9 td 5 next the water density gradient Œ¥œÅd was calculated as Œ¥ œÅ d œÅ d œÅ d 1 the depth of the steepest density gradient is taken as the boundary between the epilimnion and the hypolimnion for each day of the year we averaged both the epilimnion and the hypolimnion temperatures to obtain a 100 year averaged time series of the epilimnion and the hypolimnion temperatures when density differences between the epilimnion and hypolimnion exceeded 0 1 kg m 3 we defined the lake as being stratified based on the number and duration of the stratification periods the stratification class for each lake has been determined we chose to exclude salt lakes and fully frozen lakes from our analysis as their characteristics interfere with the thermal stratification dynamics studied here salt lakes can exhibit chemical stratification and are typically endorheic meaning that there is no outflow hence evaporation is larger than the dilution by inflowing rivers or precipitation to our knowledge a comprehensive overview of chinese salt lakes is not available therefore we decided to define all lakes for which the evaporation was larger than the sum of the water inflow and precipitation as salt lakes lakes frozen entirely from the surface to the bottom cannot be thermally stratified as liquid water is required lakes for which vic lake predicted a full frozen lake were characterized as such and together with salt lakes were excluded from our classification and subsequent analyses spatial and statistical analysis globally lake stratification classes typically follow the north south axis yet for the analysis of lakes in china we divided lakes into east and west lakes following the country s two geographically distinct climate regions roughly divided by the hu huanyong line a mountainous and temperate continental climate to the west and a sub tropical monsoon climate to the east next to assess whether the chinese lakes follow the global north south patterns we translocated the lakes by calculating the altitude corrected latitude adjusted latitude following lewis jr 1983 appendix c for each stratification class we calculated the statistical variation within the different lake characteristics since our data were not normally distributed we used an asymptotic k sample fisher pitman permutation test with the function oneway test of the coin library in r hothorn et al 2019 to test whether groups of stratification classes are equal to randomly selected groups of lakes a global p value 0 05 indicates that the stratification classes are not equal to randomly chosen lakes from the entire data set and thus that lake characteristics are unique for each stratification class next we used a pairwise k sample permutation test with the function pairwisepermutationmatrix of the rcompanion in r mangiafico and mangiafico 2017 to conduct permutation tests across groups simulating vulnerability of lakes to algal blooms as a final step we assessed the lake vulnerability to algal blooms for each of the stratification classes lake vulnerability is expressed by two indicators 1 the possible severity of algal blooms expressed here as the maximum chlorophyll a concentration that could emerge in the epilimnion red line fig 2 2 the possible onset of algal blooms expressed as the critical nutrient load which is the amount of nutrient load at which the yearly average epilimnion algal concentrations exceed 20 ¬µg l 1 carlson 1977 blue line fig 2 we assessed the lake vulnerability to algal blooms for 9 representative lakes each reflecting a stratification class with its specific morphometric climate and sediment characteristics through bifurcation analyses using the dynamic ecosystem model pclake janssen et al 2019b a bifurcation analysis is a technique to study the effect of external pressure here phosphorus load on the water quality state here chlorophyll a pclake has been successfully applied for numerous lakes including the chinese lakes taihu janssen et al 2017 chaohu kong et al 2016 and dianchi li et al 2019 a bifurcation analysis results in two load response curves x axis p load y axis chlorophyll a one for the process of eutrophication clear turbid and one for oligotrophication turbid clear fig 2 the vulnerability in terms of the possible severity of algal blooms is measured as the maximum chlorophyll a level within the load response curves which is reached when algae become light limited chang et al 2019 the vulnerability in terms of the onset of algal blooms is measured as the critical nutrient load gp m 2 d 1 at which the load response graph crosses the chlorophyll a concentration of 20 ¬µg l 1 the critical nutrient load for eutrophication can be larger compared to oligotrophication in case alternative stable states are present scheffer and van nes 2007 for more details on the methods to define the vulnerability see appendix d based on the maximum possible epilimnion chlorophyll a concentrations in combination with the height of the critical nutrient load 3 levels can be distinguished 1 low vulnerability maximum chlorophyll a concentrations are below eutrophic levels 20 ¬µg l 1 so lakes do not have a critical nutrient load these lakes have a low vulnerability since algal blooms will be mild 2 medium vulnerability maximum chlorophyll a concentrations above eutrophic levels 20 ¬µg l 1 and critical nutrient loads above 0 0025 gp m 2 d 1 these lakes have a medium vulnerability since an exceedance of the critical nutrient load needs relative high nutrient pollution yet ultimately lead to severe algal blooms 3 high vulnerability maximum chlorophyll a concentrations above eutrophic levels 20 ¬µg l 1 and critical nutrient loads below 0 0025 gp m 2 d 1 these lakes are highly vulnerable since an exceedance of the critical nutrient load occurs at low nutrient pollution and exceedance will lead to severe algal blooms results we first validated the model output of the vic lake model fig 3 the regression lines for the vic lake run were all close to the 1 1 line as can be seen from the intercepts which were close to 0 0 81 to 0 06 and slopes which were close to 1 0 95 0 99 for all 5 regression lines 4 climate models as input and 1 average the goodness of fit r2 adj varies between 0 84 0 87 suggesting a relatively good fit with a slight underestimation of lake temperatures the average of vic lake run with input from 4 climate models reflects the data reasonably well building trust to use the average output of the 4 climate models in our further analysis we identified 19 536 lakes in mainland china 0 1 km2 fig 4 most of these lakes 80 were in the east and fewer in the west of china 20 the majority of the lakes were polymictic continuous warm lakes 54 fig 4a the second largest group consisted of the monomictic warm lakes 32 followed by the polymictic discontinuous warm lakes 7 the amictic and polymictic continuous cold lakes both 3 the discontinuous cold monomictic cold dimictic and meromictic lakes were the least represented all less than 1 of the total number of lakes the spatial distribution of lakes followed the two distinct climate regions found in china with eastern china accommodating typically the warm lake classes and western china the cold lake classes fig 4b also the adjusted latitude showed a clear distribution fig 5 with rising surface temperatures there is a transition from the colder lake classes e g polymictic continuous cold lakes to warmer classes e g monomictic warm lakes the variation around the linear downward trend can be explained by the inter lake variation in other lake characteristics such as depth and area the stratification classes were used to further characterize chinese lakes based on their morphologic climate and sediment characteristics fig 5 the fisher pitman permutation test showed that the stratification groups were significantly different all global p values 0 001 with the pairwise permutation test we identified the significant differences between groups of stratification classes although 96 of the lakes in the presented database were relatively shallow with a depth of less than 10 m we found some differences in morphometry among stratification classes the meromictic and monomictic warm lakes seemed slightly deeper and more irregular in shoreline development than the cold lake classes which was significant for meromictic lakes fig 6 a c the relative deeper warm lakes can be explained by the large proportion of reservoir lakes in the presented database located to the east of china which tend to be deeper than natural lakes polymictic discontinuous cold and monomictic cold lakes were the shallowest lakes followed by the polymictic continuous cold and polymictic continuous warm lakes the polymictic discontinuous warm lakes amictic lakes and dimictic lakes were slightly deeper as the climate parameters were used to group the lakes by stratification class the climate characterization should logically follow the stratification classes for the epilimnion and hypolimnion temperatures the cold lake classes indeed showed the significant lowest temperatures whereas the warm lake classes showed the significant highest temperatures also ice days showed a significant division among all the lakes with amictic lakes having significantly most ice days besides polymictic continuous cold polymictic discontinuous cold and monomictic cold lakes had significantly more ice days than the warm lake classes temperature differences in the polymictic continuous cold and discontinuous cold lakes were minute as these systems are mixed year round the polymictic continuous cold lakes had a significantly lower epilimnion and hypolimnion temperature compared to the polymictic continuous warm lakes also the polymictic discontinuous cold lakes had a significantly lower epilimnion and hypolimnion temperature compared to the polymictic discontinuous warm lakes fig 6d e the amictic lakes were significantly distinguished from all other lakes by being nearly permanently ice covered fig 6f the epilimnion temperatures in amictic lakes were on average 0 5 c lower than the hypolimnion temperatures showing inverse stratification meromictic lakes showed the significant highest epilimnion temperature yet their hypolimnion waters were significantly colder than the dimictic and monomictic warm lakes due to the permanent stratification the monomictic cold lakes were similar in temperature and ice coverage to the polymictic discontinuous cold lakes but they stratified for a longer period also dimictic and monomictic warm lakes did not differ significantly in terms of their average epilimnion and hypolimnion temperatures but the monomictic warm lakes had a single mixing period resulting in higher temperature variation and a larger range in ice days next we analysed sediment characteristics although differences were small the warm lakes tavg 4 c reach higher maxima clay contents than the cold lakes fig 6g which was significant for the meromictic lakes showing the highest clay content amictic lakes had the lowest average clay content though not statistically significant from other lake classes most lakes were more or less equal in sand content fig 6h also the differences between reference bulk densities were minute fig 6i with only a clear pattern for monomictic warm and meromictic lakes which show a low reference bulk density compared to the other lake classes as a final step we assessed the vulnerability of the stratification classes for the maximum possible chlorophyll a severity of algal blooms and the critical nutrient load onset of algal blooms maximum chlorophyll a concentrations were largely dependent on lake temperature fig 7 a whereas critical nutrient loads were dependent on both temperature and depth fig 7b based on the maximum epilimnion chlorophyll a concentrations in combination with the critical nutrient load the lake stratification classes can be grouped in terms of their vulnerability to algal bloom formation from low to medium to high 1 low vulnerability max chlorophyll a 20 ¬µg l 1 no critical nutrient load amictic and meromictic lake class these lakes have low vulnerability as a result of their permanently stratified nature meromictic lakes or the near permanently ice coverage amictic 2 medium vulnerability max chlorophyll a 20 ¬µg l 1 and critical nutrient loads 0 0025 gp m 2 d 1 polymictic continuous warm polymictic discontinuous cold and monomictic cold lake classes these lakes showed medium vulnerability as a result of their relatively low depth 2 m which initially support macrophytes granting resilience to algal blooms when nutrient pollution exceeds critical thresholds though algal blooms will be severe 3 high vulnerability max chlorophyll a 20 ¬µg l 1 and critical nutrient loads 0 0025 gp m 2 d 1 polymictic continuous cold polymictic discontinuous warm dimictic and monomictic warm lake classes except for the polymictic continuous cold these lakes were all highly vulnerable due to their intermediate depth 3 1 5 3 m and summer temperatures t 10 c their depth prevents sufficient macrophyte growth to grant resilience to algal blooms and the summer temperatures are ideal for promoting severe algal blooms despite being shallower 2 m depth polymictic continuous cold lakes also have a high maximum chlorophyll a and a low critical nutrient load due to the low summer temperatures t 10 c the short growing season of polymictic continuous cold lakes favours fast growing algae over slower growing macrophytes discussion lake vulnerability to algal bloom formation we characterized 19 536 chinese freshwater lakes and identified a spatial division between lakes in the east of china that are typically warmer compared to lakes in the west although the majority of the chinese lakes are shallow with a depth typically less than 10 m the lakes found in the east of china are slightly deeper compared to their cooler counterparts in the west although these spatial patterns in depth might seem counterintuitive this pattern can be explained by the presence of a large number of reservoir lakes in hydrolakes in the east of china which are generally deeper than natural lakes for sediment we could not find a clear difference except for meromictic lakes which have significant clay richer sediment compared to other lakes finally our model results suggest that cold lake classes amictic monomictic cold polymictic discontinuous cold typically seem to have a low to medium vulnerability to algal blooms an exception forms the polymictic continuous cold lakes with a high modelled vulnerability possibly due to the absence of stratification and the short growing season promoting algae over macrophytes moreover our model results suggest that the warm lake classes polymictic continuous warm polymictic discontinuous warm dimictic and monomictic warm seem to have a medium to high vulnerability to algal blooms an exception forms the meromictic lakes with their low modelled vulnerability to algal blooms explained by the permanent stratified nature leading to losses of nutrients to the hypolimnion the effect of the different morphometric climate and sediment characteristics on lake vulnerability to the severity and onset of algal blooms is complex because of the various mechanisms through which primary producers are affected yet some general patterns can be derived effect of morphometric characteristics on lake vulnerability morphological characteristics of lakes are important factors determining phytoplankton concentrations h√•kanson 2005 we found that the differences among the morphometric characteristics are most profound for lake depth the lakes in the east of china tend to be slightly deeper because of many deep reservoirs than the cooler lake classes in western china the effect of depth on the lake vulnerability of algae is not straightforward janse et al 2008 and scheffer and van nes 2007 show that increasing depths in shallow lakes with dense macrophyte biomass result in a lower threshold for nutrient loads leading to an earlier onset of algal blooms for deeper lakes however it is shown that the risk of algal blooms decreases with depth h√•kanson 2005 liu et al 2010 our assessment of lake vulnerability follows this pattern first the critical nutrient load was lowest for lakes with the intermediate water level 3 4 m suggesting that these lakes are most vulnerable to the onset of algal blooms both deeper and shallower lakes showed more resilience to the onset of algal blooms compared to lakes with an intermediate water level effect of climate characteristics on lake vulnerability for the climate characteristics we found that the lakes show a clear spatial distribution over china with the warm lake classes in eastern china and the cold lakes in western china our model indicated that warm lake classes seem more vulnerable to severe algal blooms confirming previous research paerl and huisman 2008 for instance low temperatures in polymictic continuous cold and polymictic discontinuous cold lakes lead to less severe algal blooms compared to respectively polymictic continuous warm and polymictic discontinuous warm lakes in addition the vulnerability of lakes to algal blooms also depends on stratification and mixing periods of lakes which could mobilize or block phosphorus release from the sediments affecting algal blooms wetzel 2001 wilhelm and adrian 2008 meromictic lakes hardly mix so that the hypolimnion functions as a nutrient sink making nutrients unavailable for algal growth judd et al 2005 and resulting in a low vulnerability to severe algal blooms monomictic warm lakes mix for longer periods however since stratification mainly occurs during summer nutrients availability during the growing season is blocked leading to less severe algal blooms compared to non stratifying lakes dimictic lakes mix and stratify twice a year supplying algal blooms with sufficient nutrients potentially leading to severe algal blooms also the ice period is important under ice algal growth is typically limited by light especially when covered with snow we showed that the long lasting ice layer in amictic greatly reduces the risk of blooms resulting in a maximum chlorophyll a concentration of 16 ¬µg l 1 this result is in line with hampton et al 2017 who found that summer average chlorophyll a in icy lakes are 13 6 2 84 ¬µg l 1 however in specific cases when light is sufficient the under ice environment can be hospitable for algal growth resulting in higher algal biomasses hampton et al 2017 effect of sediment characteristics on lake vulnerability finer sediments could be expected at low elevated regions due to a process called downward fining paola and seal 1995 we observed a slightly higher maximum clay content in warm lakes than in cold lakes yet this was only significant for meromictic lakes clay is known to bind phosphorus under aerobic conditions and releases phosphorus under anaerobic conditions li et al 2017 s√∏ndergaard et al 2003 lakes with higher clay contents have typically lower critical nutrient loads meaning that lower nutrient input is needed to trigger algal blooms compared to other lakes janse et al 2008 since variation in sediment characteristics was larger within stratification classes than between stratification classes conclusions on the sediment data remained elusive discretizing our world here we discretized the lakes by stratification class discretization improves the understanding of lake ecosystems especially in big data studies kraemer 2020 yet discretization also depends on choices and could in itself create uncertainty here we grouped lakes by stratification classes using 100 years averaged daily epilimnion and hypolimnion temperatures hereafter referred to as averaging method alternatively stratification classes can be based on the most common stratification class among the 100 specific years hereafter we referred to this as the mode method woolway and merchant 2019 whether the mode or averaging method is preferred depends on the goal both methods show most lakes are polymictic and indicate that the warm lakes are mainly located in the east and the cold lakes in the west appendix e the mode method provides information on the dynamics of the stratification class and assigns the most common stratification class even if this occurs only for 25 of the time with the averaging method the stochasticity in weather patterns is averaged out leading to more stable predictions with the averaging method we obtained logical results along with the stratification classes such as reverse stratification in amictic lakes and lower hypolimnion temperatures in meromictic lakes we here think that both methods provide valuable information but we used the averaging method in our study to set a baseline of the average stratification classes of the lakes in china data validity this study provides the first analysis with a comprehensive database that combines morphometric climate and sediment characteristics of lakes in china yet combining data from different databases could introduce uncertainty in the analysis from the different sources 1 the morphometric variables from messager et al 2016 2 the climate variables from vic lake model simulations and 3 the sediment data from fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2009 to analyze the uncertainty in our study we have recalled uncertainties in the morphometric data messager et al 2016 and validated the climate characteristics and sediment characteristics we found the largest uncertainty in the sediment parameters which we validated on a set of european lakes appendix b validation of our method for china specifically was not possible as data to do so are currently unavailable to us similar to europe lake sediment has been disturbed in china due to intensive human activities e g sand dredging li et al 2014 therefore lake sediment layers may be disturbed leading to uncertainty in this data yet we expect that this uncertainty has a limited impact on our main conclusion as variations in sediment characteristics between the stratification groups were smaller compared to variation within stratification groups on the contrary water temperatures showed a relatively low uncertainty the average surface water temperature calculated with vic lake with the 4 climate models demonstrates an acceptable performance of vic lake although single lake estimates could deviate from this average we still saw good agreement for specific lakes appendix a recalling the validity in the morphometric characteristics messager et al 2016 found acceptable uncertainty ranges yet with less predictive power for smaller lakes compared to larger lakes using pclake we assessed the lake vulnerability to algal blooms for representative lakes based on the combined database pclake is a validated model showing generally an acceptable agreement with lake water quality data janse et al 2010 janssen et al 2017 kong et al 2016 li et al 2019 given the uncertainty of all data sources we deem the presented combined database suitable for studies on a national scale but care should be taken when interpreting the results for individual lakes as single lake estimates could hold relatively large errors future outlook temperature and eutrophication in this study we presented baseline average stratification classes for chinese lakes and their characteristics and showed that the most vulnerable lakes to algal blooms are likely located in the east the east west distribution of chinese lake vulnerability coincides with the human population distribution over china with the densest population in the east and the thinnest populated in the west tong et al 2020 tong et al 2017 human activities tend to cluster in downstream regions fang et al 2018 which are also typically warmer due to the lower elevation the coincidence of lake vulnerability with the highest human population might seem obvious yet they do not necessarily share the same cause as humans seek opportunities for trade transport and natural resources fang et al 2018 whereas lake vulnerability seems to be related to temperature and lake depth the future is likely to change e g due to climate and land use change ma et al 2010 strokal et al 2016 consequently lake characteristics are also likely to change in the future changing the future vulnerability to algal blooms of lakes climate change will affect future algal growth in two ways first lakes are expected to heat up vanderkelen et al 2020 resulting in changes in stratification classes woolway and merchant 2019 the number of ice covered lakes is likely to decrease and lakes will increasingly stratify woolway and merchant 2019 the magnitude of change depends on the lake characteristics kraemer et al 2015 but lake warming is likely to prolong and intensify algal blooms paerl and huisman 2008 tong et al 2021 second it is expected that climate change in china will lead to wetter conditions resulting in lower nutrient retentions on land wang et al 2020 as a result more nutrients will end up in freshwater systems potentially leading to algal blooms at the same time stress from eutrophication is likely to increase due to expected socioeconomic developments eutrophication is a major concern in china and many lakes are already eutrophic and most profound in the east huang et al 2020 liu et al 2010 tong et al 2017 wang et al 2018 food production and urbanization are important sources of nutrient losses to the environment strokal et al 2016 teurlincx et al 2019 future socioeconomic development is expected to allow a further increase in eutrophication strokal et al 2014 besides n p ratios in lakes might increase for instance due to improved wastewater treatment tong et al 2019 tong et al 2020 this is because phosphorus has in contrast to nitrogen no gaseous forms making it easier to remove it elevated n p ratios may favor blooms of potentially toxic non n fixing cyanobacteria van de waal et al 2014 defining future changes in the vulnerability of lakes to algal blooms is beyond the scope of this study yet lake characteristics will likely determine the severity of the algal response whereas increasing nutrient loads and n p ratios together with warmer lake water could result in longer periods of more severe algal blooms stronger stratification could mitigate this process by functioning as an algal sink modeling of future scenarios of socio ecological development could indicate the directions of future algal bloom developments janssen et al 2019a mooij et al 2019 with this characterization of the chinese lakes we aim to contribute to this step conclusions this study provides the first analysis with a comprehensive database that combines morphometric climate and sediment characteristics of lakes including ponds and reservoirs in china with this database we aimed to assess the effect of lake characteristics in chinese lakes on the vulnerability to algal blooms we found in this database that lakes ponds and reservoirs in the east of china are typically warmer and slightly deeper than lakes in the west simulations for representative lakes for each stratification class suggest that the warm lakes in the east of china seem to be generally more vulnerable to algal blooms than the cold lakes in the west with exceptions of the meromictic lakes and polymictic cold lakes the unfortunate coincidence that high lake vulnerability is found in the east of china where nutrient pollution is highest asks for priority in preventing severe algal blooms in

16793,the uv chlorine system has been regarded as an efficient oxidation technology for the removal of aqueous micropollutants however the roles of the possible radical species for this system on the elimination under environmentally relevant conditions real waters were still largely unknown herein the specific roles of radical species in the uv chlorine oxidation degradation of gemfibrozil and naproxen as representative micropollutants were quantified by a steady state kinetic prediction model considering the effects of water matrices overall the model predicted results are consistent with the experimental data well oh and reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 contributions to gemfibrozil and naproxen degradation were water matrix specific in pure water both primary reactive species i e oh and cl and secondary species clo dominated gemfibrozil and naproxen degradation and their individual and the sum of the contributions to degradation rates reduced with ph increase of from 5 to 9 in the presence of cl we found that cl2 and in particular clo were responsible for the enhanced degradation with increasing cl concentrations due to the considerable clo reactivity of gemfibrozil 1 93 109 m 1 s 1 and naproxen 9 24 109 m 1 s 1 and the rapid transformation of cl2 to clo the presence of hco3 notably facilitated the degradation in the uv chlorine process because of the generation of co3 co3 showed high reactivity with gemfibrozil and naproxen corresponding to respective second order reaction rate constants of 2 45 107 and 3 50 107 m 1 s 1 dissolved organic matter induced obvious scavenging for oh cl and clo and greatly retarded the degradation the constructed model considering the effects of above water matrix has successfully predicted the oxidation degradation kinetics in real waters and both oh and co3 are the predominant reactive species in the degradation this study is helpful for comprehensive understanding the roles of possible radical species in micropollutant removal by uv chlorine oxidation under real water matrix graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv chlorine oxidation kinetic prediction reactive species water matrix micropollutants 1 introduction currently pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have drawn considerable attention globally as a result of the potential health and ecological effects associated with exposure to these contaminants patel et al 2019 rand weaver et al 2013 environmental residues of ppcps in water matrices were reported as high as ¬µg l patel et al 2019 richardson and ternes 2014 and anti inflammatory drugs sunscreens antibiotics Œ≤ blockers and lipid regulators are the most frequently detected ppcps in surface water seawater and wastewater liu and wong 2013 it has been reported that effluent treatment plants were one of the most important pollution sources of ppcps because existing biological treatment processes cannot eliminate the pollutants completely liu and wong 2013 patel et al 2019 in addition ppcps are of growing concern in downriver drinking water supplies huerta fontela et al 2011 therefore advanced treatment processes are required to eliminate ppcps from wastewater effluents the advanced oxidation processes aop have been proved to be powerful treatment methods in refractory micropollutant elimination because it produces highly reactive species gerrity et al 2013 oh based aops are considered as one of the most commonly utilized techniques including uv h2o2 o3 h2o2 and fe2 h2o2 gong et al 2015 lee et al 2016 romero et al 2016 nevertheless one major disadvantage associated with these aops is that oh is a nonselective oxidant li et al 2018 remucal and manley 2016 oh can react with common organic compounds at nearly diffusion controlled rates and can also be easily scavenged by various aqueous components such as dissolved organic matter dom bicarbonate and chloride gligorovski et al 2015 li et al 2018 luo et al 2015 wols et al 2013 additionally the high cost of these processes limits their further practical application due to the requirement of high h2o2 dosages and the extra chemical reagents used in the quenching of residual h2o2 keen et al 2013 uv chlorine oxidation is a relatively new interested aop which is deemed as an alternative to uv h2o2 process chuang et al 2017 guo et al 2018 sichel et al 2011 zhang and parker 2018 uv chlorine oxidation is an effective method for eliminating a variety of micropollutants such as phenols methylene blue 2 methylisoborneal microborneol microcystin lr pesticides e g atrazine chlortoluron and desethylatrazine ppcps e g ibuprofen gemfibrozil sulfamethoxazole naproxen caffeine 17Œ± ethinylestradiol diclofenac nitroimidazoles triclosan benzophenone 3 surfactants e g benzenesulfonic acid and diethylene glycol cheng et al 2018 guo et al 2017 sichel et al 2011 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 comparison of the oh based aops the uv chlorine process displays more efficient elimination for some ppcps including carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole caffeine acetaminophen and trimethoprim guo et al 2018 taken together the uv chlorine process can be regarded as an efficient aop in water treatment due to the more radical generation and high reaction selectivity of some reactive species the uv chlorine process generates both oh and cl by hocl ocl uv decomposition eqs 1 2 the secondary radicals i e cl2 clo are generated by eqs 3 7 fang et al 2014 zhang and parker 2018 1 hocl hv oh cl 2 ocl hv o cl 3 cl cl cl2 k forward 6 5 109 m 1 s 1 k

oxidizing agent 2 8 v while reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl cl2 and clo are selective oxidizing agents with their respective oxidation potentials of 2 4 2 0 and 1 5 1 8 v fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 cl can react easily with certain aromatic substances including phenols benzoic acid aniline and chlorobenzene and has a higher reactivity than oh martire et al 2001 cl2 is more selective and prefers to react with olefinic compounds and aromatic substances with hydroxyl methoxyl or amino moieties hasegawa and neta 1978 clo can react rapidly with phenolates and methoxybenzenes alfassi et al 1988 considering many ppcps have the above structural features the diverse reactive species of oh and rcs in uv chlorine system can play an important role in the elimination of many structurally diverse ppcps sun et al 2016 investigated n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide and caffeine transformation under uv chlorine condition and observed that n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide degradation was primarily ascribed to both oh and cl and caffeine degradation was ascribed to the rapid reaction with clo but not oh fang and co workers reported that besides oh rcs also play significant role in the removal of many ppcps in uv chlorine system cheng et al 2018 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 yang et al 2016 guo et al 2017 explored the different reactivity of diverse radicals with many ppcps in uv chlorine condition and elucidated structural relationships of certain ppcps reaction with diverse radicals however only a few ppcps removal by uv chlorine oxidation considers the contributions and structural relationships of diverse species for a huge number of ppcps the roles of diverse radicals are still unknown all things taken together constructing kinetic models would be helpful for improving our deeply understanding in the roles of diverse radicals for ppcps degradation by uv chlorine oxidation technology for process application development up to now only a few studies have focused on the kinetic models of radicals in micropollutant degradation by uv chlorine oxidation fang et al 2014 shi et al 2018 wang et al 2017 previous kinetic models mainly focused on oh contribution to the degradation of some micropollutants while rcs contributions to the degradation are ignorable wang et al 2017 watts and linden 2007 recently fang et al 2014 investigated oh and rcs contributions to aqueous benzoic acid removal by uv chlorine oxidation via a steady state kinetic model but in this model clo was not considered due to its low reactivity with benzoic acid it has been reported that in uv chlorine condition clo plays a significant role in removing many ppcps including carbamazepine caffeine gemfibrozil naproxen trimethoprim bisphenol a bezafibrate and substituted benzoic acid compounds guo et al 2017 shi et al 2018 sun et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 shi et al 2018 built a kinetic model that considers oh and rcs i e cl cl2 and clo contributions on bezafibrate abatement but the impacts of water matrix on its degradation were not taken into account in this model which affects the destruction efficiency of pollutants guo et al 2017 developed a kinetic model for predicting the uv chlorine oxidation degradation of 20 ppcps in simulated drinking water considering oh and clo as the major radicals while the predicted values for some ppcps e g diclofenac trimethoprim ractopamine and bisphenol a were not well fitted because of lacking other radical contributions e g cl and cl2 therefore quantitative insight into elimination mechanisms of ppcps by all possible radicals that are involved e g ho and rcs is still insufficient in real water treatment by uv chlorine system the roles of diverse reactive species in uv chlorine system for degrading organic contaminants were reported to be influenced by water matrix e g ph dom alkalinity and halides and thus affect ppcps degradation remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 ye et al 2017 zhang and parker 2018 it is known that ph influences uv chlorine process by impacting free chlorine s dissociation species hocl ocl which dominates the quantum yields of free chlorine photolysis and thereby radical generation remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2016 in addition quenching effects of hocl and ocl towards cl and oh are also different zhang and parker 2018 dom can quench oh and rcs and thereby retard many micropollutions destruction kong et al 2016 hco3 co3 2 can act as oh and cl quenchers causing the inhibitive effect on uv chlorine process and these quenching reactions concurrently produce carbonate radical co3 that prefers to react with aromatics containing electron donating groups relative to oh and cl which may enhance the removal of some micropollutants fang et al 2014 kong et al 2016 cl can influence uv chlorine oxidation by its reactions with oh or cl resulting in the generation of halogen containing radicals e g cl and cl2 wang et al 2016 zhang and parker 2018 overall the conversion of radicals under different water matrices further complicates the uv chlorine process therefore the kinetic model based on oh and rcs for micropollutants degradation should be comprehensively explored considering impacts of real water matrix which could be beneficial for degradation prediction of micropollutants in uv chlorine system the main goal was therefore to build a steady state kinetic model for improving the understanding of all possible radicals governing ppcps removal by uv chlorine oxidation naproxen and gemfibrozil were selected as two ppcp model compounds besides their frequent occurrence in surface waters and municipal wastewater bueno et al 2012 dur√°n √°lvarez et al 2015 they are reactive to oh and many rcs e g clo cl but resistant to chlorination or uv direct photodegradation guo et al 2017 simulated water solutions were employed to explore the roles of radicals for naproxen and gemfibrozil removal in uv chlorine system and to reveal the effects of water matrix including ph chloride dom and alkalinity moreover the overall and individual contributions of reactive species for the removal by experiments and kinetic modeling in uv chlorine system were also studied in real water samples 2 materials and method 2 1 reagents naproxen purity 99 and gemfibrozil purity 99 were obtained from sigma where sodium hypochlorite naclo solution available chlorine 5 was also purchased 2 acetonaphthone purity 98 benzoic acid purity 99 and nitrobenzene purity 99 were purchased from j k scientific of china salbutamol sal and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob were of analytical standard and obtained from sigma suwannee river natural organic matter nom cat no 1r101n was purchased from the international humic substances society nacl naoh and nahco3 were provided by j k scientific beijing china ultrapure water 18 2 mœâ cm at 25 c was prepared by a millipore milli q system three real water samples freshwater seawater and effluent from sewage systems were collected from dianchi lake qinzhou bay and kunming municipal sewage plant in china respectively these samples were filtered through 0 45 Œºm glass membrane and used for the uv chlorine experiments water quality parameters such as total organic carbon ph and inorganic ions were analyzed text s1 and results were shown in table s1 in addition each of 20 l filtered water samples for the three real waters was used for the isolation of organic matter via a reported reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis system vetter et al 2007 zhao et al 2019 2 2 irradiation experiments an xpa 1 merry go round photochemical reactor xujiang electromechanical plant nanjing china equipped with quartz tubes contain reaction solutions was employed in uv exposure experiments a low pressure mercury lamp 10 w emitting 254 nm light placed in reactor center was used as irradiation light source which was surrounded by a water refrigerated system to hold the reaction temperature at around 25 c the uv photon flux rate i 0 at 254 nm received in the center of reaction solution was calculated by iodide iodate chemical actinometry text s2 and the result is 2 28 Œºein l 1 s 1 effective path length was 2 78 cm calculated based on photolytic kinetics analysis of dilute h2o2 text s3 fig s1 the uv chlorine experimental solutions were obtained through adding aliquots of naocl solution into a 25 ml testing solution with or without dissolved components i e cl hco3 and dom and the desired ph was obtained by phosphate buffer 10 mm the contributions of main reactive species such as oh rcs and co3 on the observed degradation of target compounds under uv chlorine system were evaluated by the steady state assumption using chemical probes previous studies also employed similar methods to distinguish the roles of reactive radicals on degradation of many substances wu et al 2017 xiang et al 2016 aliquots 1 ml were periodically sampled from the testing tubes and quenched with sodium sulfite its molar ratio to free chlorine is 1 5 1 control tests of the target compound destruction by direct uv irradiation and dark chlorination bundled tightly with aluminum foil were conducted in a similar process as above description all the tests were performed in triplicate the target compounds under different reaction times were quantified on a reverse phase liquid chromatograph system agilent 1260 coupled with a diode array detector the separation column was a zorbax eclipse xdb c18 4 6 150 mm 5 Œºm particle size agilent the specific analysis conditions were listed in table s2 the degradation products of naproxen and gemfibrozil in the uv chlorine system were identified by an agilent 1290 hplc coupled to an ab sciex 6600 q tof mass spectrometer and the analytic processes are detailed in text s4 2 3 calculation of second order reaction rate constants for oh rcs and co3 the second order reaction rate constants k src of gemfibrozil and naproxen with the radicals oh cl cl2 clo and co3 were obtained through competition kinetics with different reference compounds guo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 for the k rsc values of oh 300 Œºm h2o2 under uv irradiation to create a ho scenario and 10 Œºm nitrobenzene nb was spiked into the scenario as a reference compound k ho nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 meanwhile target compound gemfibrozil or naproxen at the same concentration was added to the system the competition degradation kinetics of the compounds was shown in fig s2 the calculation equation is as following 8 k t k r k o h t k o h r where t and r represented the target compounds and reference compounds and k t and k r represent the respective pseudo first order rate constants k ho t and k ho r were the second order reaction rate constants for ho with target and reference compounds similar method was applied to calculate the k src values for clo and co3 with gemfibrozil or naproxen clo scenario was created by adding hco3 quenching radicals e g ho cl and cl2 into uv cl system containing 5 mg l available chlorine and 10 Œºm micropollutants figs s3 s5 solution ph was adjusted at 8 4 and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob was used as reference compound in order to create a co3 scenario 100 mm hco3 was added to uv h2o2 system with 100 Œºm h2o2 each of 10 Œºm target micropollutant and reference compound salbutamol sal was involved in this reaction system and the ph was adjusted to be 8 4 the respective k src values for clo with dmob and co3 with sal are 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 and 2 1 107 m 1 s 1 alfassi et al 1988 lian et al 2017 in addition 10 Œºm nb benzoic acid ba and target micropollutants were simultaneously added into uv cl system to determine the k src values for cl with the target micropollutants and competition kinetics results were shown in fig s6 the calculation processes were shown as eqs 9 11 the k src values for cl2 with the target micropollutants were determined by adding 30 mm cl into the uv cl system so as to quench cl for the generation of cl2 fig s7 which was expressed as eqs 9 12 and 13 the k src values for ho clo and co3 with dom were determined by competition kinetics wu et al 2017 at uv h2o2 uv cl with 100 mm hco3 and uv h2o2 with 100 mm hco3 systems as well as acetophenone ap dmob and sal as reference compound respectively the competition degradation kinetics of the compounds was shown in figs s8 s10

reaction rate constants for radicals ho clo and co3 with dom or reference compounds dom 0 and r 0 represented the initial concentrations of dom and reference compounds the k src values of cl with the three dom were determined by steady state assumption and the detailed processes are provided in text s5 2 4 degradation kinetic modeling kinetic model was developed by means of the steady state assumption of reactive species in uv chlorine process in this model possible reactive species including oh cl clo and cl2 were considered because of their important contributions in micropollutant destruction the possible reactions and their rate constants in uv chlorine process from previous studies were listed by table s3 model compound degradation conformed to pseudo first order kinetics in

concentrations of quenchers in water matrix in terms of the principal reactions table s3 and the steady state assumption of corresponding radicals the kinetic equations of radicals in uv chlorine process are expressed detailedly in text s6 of supplementary materials 3 results and discussion 3 1 removal of gemfibrozil and naproxen by uv chlorine oxidation fig 1 comparatively depicted the removal of gemfibrozil and naproxen in pure water by dark chlorination direct uv photodegradation and uv chlorine coexposure no obvious degradation of gemfibrozil and naproxen was observed by dark chlorination within 6 min under 2 5 mg l chlorine dosage approximately 15 of these compounds was eliminated by direct uv photodegradation within 6 min previous studies also reported that the two compounds are resistant to direct uv photodegradation and chlorination in dark guo et al 2017 pan et al 2018 nevertheless under uv chlorine system the removal of gemfibrozil and naproxen was up to 77 and 94 respectively which were great higher than those of direct uv photolysis by factors of 5 6 this indicates that the combination exposure of uv and chlorine dominates the elimination of gemfibrozil and naproxen and the contributions of dark chlorination and direct uv photolysis to their removal plays a minor role which agrees with previously reported results guo et al 2017 as reported previously many reactive species are involved in uv chlorine system such as cl clo and cl2 which may significantly affect the degradation of many organic micropollutants remucal and manley 2016 moreover the generation conversion of these reactive species in uv chlorine system were great impacted by water matrix wu et al 2017 zhang and parker 2018 therefore the roles oh and rcs in gemfibrozil and naproxen removal and the effects of water matrix were explored 3 2 effects of water matrix and kinetic modeling 3 2 1 effect of ph fig 2 a and c experimentally depict pseudo first order rate constants k of gemifibrozil and naproxen removal in ph range of 5 9 the k values of gemifibrozil and naproxen elimination significantly decreased from 3 76 7 25 10 3 s 1 to 1 64 2 63 10 3 s 1 as ph increased from 5 to 9 respectively fig 2a and c also show the predicted k values based on steady state radical models eq 15 as a function of ph the model predictions of oh cl and clo contributions matched well with the experimental data which indicates that ph effects are well explained by the prediction results the formation of these radical species was verified by using nitrobenzene and benzoic acid chemical probes in our uv chlorine system nitrobenzene only reacts with oh benzoic acid reacts with oh and cl rapidly but its reaction with clo is negligible wu et al 2017 xiang et al 2016 as shown in fig s11 nitrobenzene degrades significantly in the uv chlorine system which is indicative of the formation of oh the degradation rate of benzoic acid is greatly higher as compared to that of nitrobenzene by a factor of about 10 combined with the slight difference of k src for oh with nitrobenzene 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 or benzoic acid 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 cl was involved in our uv chlorine oxidation system besides oh clo was tested by using trimethoprim as a model wu et al 2016 reported that the enhanced degradation of trimethoprim by uv chlorine oxidation with increasing ph was ascribed to the increase in clo at higher ph more free chlorine is in ocl form that quenches oh and cl which results in clo formation at higher rates than hocl consequently clo can compensate the decreasing contributions of oh and cl causing the increasing degradation of trimethoprim as rising ph in uv chlorine system wu et al 2016 we also observed the increasing degradation of trimethoprim in our uv chlorine system with the increase of ph fig s11 corroborating the formation of clo the contributions of oh and rcs to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation were also evaluated experimentally by the steady state assumption of radical concentrations using nitrobenzene and benzoic acid as probe chemicals xiang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 as shown in fig s12 the contributions of three reactive species on the degradation also decreased with increasing ph values and in general their contributions were consistent with the predicted values under different ph conditions which corroborates the model prediction data of individual contribution of reactive species for the degradation figs 2b and 2d show the predicted individual and total contributions of reactive species i e oh cl and clo to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation at different ph conditions besides primary reactive species oh and cl eqs 1 and 2 secondary radical clo also plays an important role in gemifibrozil and naproxen destruction especially at acidic condition ph 5 the contributions of clo to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation were 24 and 34 respectively overall the individual degradation rates of oh cl and clo reduced with the increase of ph from 5 to 9 oh and rcs contributions were 65 35 at ph 5 and 93 7 at ph 9 for gemifibrozil respectively and those contributions were 47 53 at ph 5 and 79 21 at ph 9 for naproxen respectively the reasons for the ph dependent trend of pollutant elimination by uv chlorine oxidation may be explicated as following i the proportion of hocl ocl is impacted by ph and the quantum yields of hocl under 254 nm irradiation 1 45 is greatly higher as compared to ocl 0 97 fang et al 2014 hence relatively high hocl fraction at low ph is beneficial for radical generation rates i e oh o and cl by eqs 1 and 2 ii the reactivity of hocl with oh 2 109 m 1 s 1 and cl 3 109 m 1 s 1 is lower relative to ocl reacting with oh 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 and cl 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 connick 1947 jayson et al 1973 matthew and anastasio 2006 zehavi and rabani 1972 thus ocl retained at high ph depletes more oh and cl than did hocl at low ph this depletion for oh and cl by free chlorine also produces clo from the reactions of eqs 4 7 which has a good reactivity with gemifibrozil and naproxen as indicated by table s4 although clo is attributable to the degradation of gemifibrozil and naproxen its contribution to the degradation does not compensate the loss of oh and cl from chorine photolysis under different ph conditions in addition ph also affects the dissociation forms of gemifibrozil pk a 4 7 and naproxen pk a 4 15 acero et al 2010 guo et al 2017 westerhoff et al 2005 in our experimental ph range from 5 9 anionic gemifibrozil 66 and naproxen 87 are the dominant forms fig s13 at ph 7 the fractions of anionic forms for the two compounds exceed 95 which indicates that the dissociation forms of the models could not explain the degradation kinetics alteration by uv chlorine oxidation in ph range of 5 9 3 2 2 effect of cl cl plays an important role in the transformation of reactive species in aops grebel et al 2010 thus cl that covers its concentration range of 0 20 mm commonly found in surface water and wastewater effluent was studied in the uv chlorine system fig 3 shows the k values of gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation in the presence of cl ranging from 0 to 20 mm and the predicted results of overall and individual contributions of oh cl clo and cl2 to their removal pan et al 2018 observed that 5 mm cl does not affect naproxen elimination in uv chlorine system but degradation enhancement was observed under our experimental conditions which agrees with the model predicted overall results as shown in fig 3c the predicted individual contribution of oh cl clo and cl2 on the degradation was tested by steady state assumption experiment due to lack of suitable chemical probes for distinguishing the roles of concomitant rcs i e cl clo and cl2 the contributions of oh and overall rcs were studied in the uv chlorine system by using nitrobenzene combining with the results from fig s14 demonstrate that oh and rcs contributions to the observed k values are comparable with the correspondingly predicted ones as indicated from fig 3 the experimental degradation of gemifibrozil and naproxen enhanced by 47 and 91 along with cl concentrations increasing from 0 to 20 mm this increase can be mainly attributed to the contribution of clo based on the overall model predictions that are well agreed with the experimental values figs 3a 3d figs 3b and 3d demonstrate that predicted clo contributions to the degradation increased with the increase of cl concentrations cl reacts rapidly with cl producing cl2 following eq 3 thereby further affects the transformation of micropollutants hou et al 2021 kl√§ning and wolff 1985 zhao et al 2019 in addition cl2 can also be generated from the transformation of secondary radical species cloh by eq s17 table s3 therefore it was postulated that the increased cl2 concentrations might be contributed to the enhanced degradation with increasing cl concentrations figs 3b and 3d show that the contributions of cl2 to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation increased as increasing of cl concentrations at 20 mm cl the fractions of cl2 contributions to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation only account for 8 and 3 respectively which are far below the enhanced degradation 54 and 91 respectively as shown in figs 3a and 3c according to previous studies cl2 can also be transformed by the rapid reaction with clo to clo 5 4 108 m 1 s 1 by eq s14 as listed in table s3 grebel et al 2010 the reactivity of clo and cl2 towards the two compounds was compared by the determined k src values as listed in table s4 the k src values of clo for gemifibrozil and naproxen are 3 4 orders of magnitude higher as compared to those of cl2 additionally the k src value of clo for naproxen was great higher as compared to that of clo for gemifibrozil which explains the higher contribution of clo to naproxen degradation overall these reveal that clo is responsible for degradation enhancement in uv chlorine system containing cl which is verified by the modeling results of clo contributions 3 2 3 effect of hco3 hco3 which is responsible for alkalinity is the most common inorganic anion present in real water due to relatively high hco3 concentrations in real water ranging from 0 3 to 5 mm huang and mabury 2000 oh and cl can collide with hco3 easily to produce co3 by eqs s19 and s20 in the uv chlorine system compared with oh co3 is a more selective oxidant larson and zepp 1988 vione et al 2009 thus co3 steady state concentrations are expected to be higher relative to those of oh and cl in uv chlorine process and it may play a significant role in degrading pollutants with electron donating groups fig 4 shows the experimental degradation rates of gemifibrozil and naproxen and the sum and individual contributions of oh cl clo and co3 base on model predictions to the degradation at various hco3 concentrations the experimental k values for the both compounds notably increased as hco3 concentrations increased from 0 to 5 mm this result agrees with previous study that hco3 did not reduce naproxen degradation rate in uv chlorine process pan et al 2018 fig 4 demonstrates that predicted overall k values considering oh cl clo and co3 also increased with increasing hco3 concentrations agreeing well with the experimental data in additional experiments conducted by spiking nitrobenzene or tert butanol into the uv chlorine system we also evaluated the individual contribution of these reactive species on the oxidation degradation nitrobenzene can only react with oh tert butanol can quench oh cl and clo rapidly but its quenching effect on co3 is negligible wu et al 2017 fig s15 shows that co3 contributions on the degradation increased with increasing hco3 concentrations from 0 to 5 mm and the contributions of co3 rcs and oh on the observed k values are consistent with their respective predicted values which corroborates the predicted contributions of these reactive species on gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation based on the experimental results and model predictions the four radicals i e oh cl clo and co3 dominate gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation in the uv chlorine system containing hco3 with respect to oh hco3 almost did not influence its contributions on the two compounds degradation for the other primary species cl its contributions on gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation decreased by 82 and 79 with addition of 5 mm hco3 figs 4b and 4d this is concordant with reported results that hco3 preferentially reacts with cl 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 while its reactivity with oh is much smaller 8 6 106 m 1 s 1 table s1 although these radicals contribute to the overall degradation co3 produced from the radicals scavenging reaction by eqs s19 s21 plays a crucial role in removal enhancement in the presence of hco3 figs 4b and 4d because of its good reactivity towards the two compounds table s4 all things taken together co3 contribution to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation has compensated the scavenging loss of primary radicals produced in uv chlorine system thereby promoting the elimination 3 2 4 effect of dom since dom is ubiquitous in real waters the effect of dom on uv chlorine system was explored at its environmentally relevant levels nom from suwannee river was applied as a dom proxy to explore its effect on the oxidation degradation fig 5 depicts experimental degradation rates and the predicted sum and individual contributions of primary oh and cl and secondary radicals clo on the degradation of model compounds at different nom concentrations with increasing nom concentrations from 0 to 20 mg l the experimental k values for gemifibrozil and naproxen reduced by 71 and 81 respectively this decrease can be explained by the well fitted results from the prediction model based on the degradation contributions of oh cl clo which considers the inner filter effect of the nom its extinction coefficient at 254 nm is 3 15 l m 1 mg 1 these predicted contributions of individual oh cl and clo were supported by steady state assumption experimental results as shown in fig s16 besides inner filter effect dom can also compete with gemifibrozil and naproxen for oh and rcs consumption which leads to the decrease of the steady state concentrations of these reactive species it has been reported that the respective k src values of the nom with oh cl and clo were 2 5 104 1 3 104 and 4 6 104 l mg 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 wu et al 2017 overall these rate constants are comparable indicating that nom can easily quench these radicals thereby reducing the degradation of gemifibrozil and naproxen in uv chlorine process in addition nom can also react with free chlorine with a rate constant of 3 10 5 s 1 westerhoff et al 2004 in our study the consumption of free chlorine was calculated to be around 4 within the duration irradiation time 6 min which is indicative of a negligible role 3 3 kinetic prediction in real waters three real water samples collected from coastal water effluent of sewage system and freshwater from fuxian lake were employed to test the predicted performance of the constructed kinetic models in real waters the main water components and ph were determined and results are shown by table s2 for dom its structures greatly differ for different environmental sources therefore three local dom isolated from the real waters were employed to calculate the k src values with the relevant radicals under uv chlorine system table s5 so as to predict the degradation kinetics reasonably combined with the determined component results and the effects of the main water components stated above five radicals i e oh cl clo cl2 and co3 were incorporated into the steady state radical predicted model fig 6 shows that the predicted k values of the two compounds in fuxian lake are comparable with the experimental values and those of in seawater and effluent are slightly higher than experimental ones by factors of 1 2 1 4 overall the predicted k values are consistent with the experimental values as show by predicted results from fig 6 in the real waters oh and co3 dominate gemifibrozil and naproxen elimination under uv chlorine system with integral contribution fractions of 94 99 while other radicals play a minor role in the degradation 6 steady state assumption and radical quenching experiments also show that oh and co3 are the dominant species for the uv chlorine oxidation of gemifibrozil and naproxen in the real water matrix fig s17 for oh its contribution on the degradation of the two compounds is notably higher in fuxian lake than that in seawater and effluent samples in terms of the above discussion from figs 3 5 dom contributed much more to oh quenching than did cl and hco3 because of the reversible reaction between cl and oh oh cl cloh and the weak reactivity of hco3 with oh 8 6 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 kl√§ning and wolff 1985 combination with water component results listed in table s1 it can be deduced that the higher oh contribution is attributed to the lower dom concentration in fuxian lake as compared to that of effluent although the dom concentration in seawater is lower than that of fuxian lake the presence of br in seawater may rapidly quench oh due to the higher reactivity between them 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 grebel et al 2010 vione 2018 which was supported by wu et al 2017 who reported that br is not beneficial for the degradation of metronidazole nalidixic acid diethyltoluamide and caffeine in uv chlorine process it deserves mentioning that in the real waters co3 plays an important role in degrading pollutants in real waters especially in coastal water which accounts for 64 and 61 on the overall degradation of gemifibrozil and naproxen respectively this is consistent with the individual hco3 affecting experimental result that hco3 enhanced the degradation in uv chlorine system fig 4 in this oxidation system co3 could be mainly produced by the rapid reaction of hco3 with cl 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 while oh plays a minor role in co3 generation due to its relatively weaker reactivity with hco3 8 6 106 m 1 s 1 table s3 in seawater cl with relatively high concentration 87 5 mm can rapidly react with cl to produce cl2 that has a high reactivity with hco3 8 107 m 1 s 1 resulting in co3 formation matthew and anastasio 2006 combined with the high reactivity of co3 with gemifibrozil and naproxen it is likely to explain the phenomenon of the high co3 contribution to the degradation in seawater matrix in this study a steady state kinetic model that considers possible radicals in uv chlorine process was constructed to predict the removal kinetics of ppcps this model is conducive to deeply understanding the effects of environmentally relevant conditions such halides alkalinity and dom on the roles of radicals in the removal the contributions of radicals i e oh cl clo cl2 co3 under environmentally relevant conditions can be calculated accurately by the model in terms of this affecting mechanism the removal rates of micropollutants in uv chlorine process can be predicted successfully in real waters it is worth mentioning that co3 plays a very important role in gemifibrozil and naproxen elimination in real water matrices while beside oh the direct contributions of other radicals including cl and clo could be negligible co3 is selective and has a higher reactivity than ho and cl towards electron rich contaminants including anilines phenoxides and sulfur containing substances 108 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 larson and zepp 1988 considering that hco3 is on behalf of alkalinity and is ubiquitous in real waters with its concentrations ranging from 0 3 to 5 mm huang and mabury 2000 the importance of co3 on ppcps elimination should be considered in uv chlorine system in our study with 0 3 mm hco3 condition the contributions of co3 on gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation are 20 based on the model prediction but this contribution could be increased in saline water with higher concentration cl because of rapid reaction between hco3 and cl2 cl cl cl2 producing co3 as indicated by table s5 relative to oh cl and clo co3 reactivity with local dom main scavenging components for reactive species was great lower by factors spanning 2 3 orders of magnitude which further suggests the importance of co3 in the degradation of certain micropollutants in the real engineering application of uv chlorine system all things taken together our constructed kinetic model considering the environmentally relevant conditions can be used to predict removal kinetics of ppcps under real water matrix in addition the degradation products especially the formation of halogenated products between rcs and ppcps are a general concern for the uv chlorine process besides its oxidation potential the degradation products of gemifibrozil and naproxen in our system were identified and observed the formation of halogenated products table s6 previous studies reported that despite the possible formation of halogenated products rcs react predominantly by oxidation rather than chlorine addition for some organic pollutants grebel et al 2010 parker and mitch 2016 grebel et al 2010 observed that in the engineered treatment of phenol by oh which can produce halogen radicals in the presence of halides the yield of total halophenols was 0 52 in seawater matrix bromophenols accounting for 93 96 of the total while the total halophenols formed were at only 0 03 yield in wastewater bromophenols accounting for 60 100 of the total the reactions of halogen radicals with organic substances can lead to the formation of halogenated product with low levels and bromophenols are the dominant constituents in the total halogenated products vione et al 2005 reported that compared to brominate radicals chlorine radicals are more apt to be oxidation reaction with phenol therefore in the uv chlorine system halogenated products formation between rcs and ppcps could be at low levels due to the oxidation mechanism of rcs however due to the structural difference of ppcps the reaction processes of rcs towards ppcps may be different hence careful evaluation is required prior to engineered application of uv chlorine technology 4 conclusion this study has successfully developed a kinetic predicted model that may be employed to predict the elimination rates of micropollutants in uv chlorine process in water matrix of varying quality oh and rcs contributions to the elimination are relevant to the impacts of water matrix oh cl and clo contributed to gemfibrozil and naproxen degradation in pure water and the degradation rates decreased with increasing ph cl notably enhanced the degradation of both compounds and clo was the dominant reactive species for the enhancement of the degradation hco3 also facilitated the degradation in uv chorine process because of the contribution of co3 to the degradation dissolved organic matter dom greatly quenched the reactive species leading to the inhibiting effects on the degradation in real waters the model predicted results demonstrated that oh and co3 are the dominant radicals for gemfibrozil and naproxen degradation and the predicted degradation rates agreed with the experimental data well

16793,the uv chlorine system has been regarded as an efficient oxidation technology for the removal of aqueous micropollutants however the roles of the possible radical species for this system on the elimination under environmentally relevant conditions real waters were still largely unknown herein the specific roles of radical species in the uv chlorine oxidation degradation of gemfibrozil and naproxen as representative micropollutants were quantified by a steady state kinetic prediction model considering the effects of water matrices overall the model predicted results are consistent with the experimental data well oh and reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl clo and cl2 contributions to gemfibrozil and naproxen degradation were water matrix specific in pure water both primary reactive species i e oh and cl and secondary species clo dominated gemfibrozil and naproxen degradation and their individual and the sum of the contributions to degradation rates reduced with ph increase of from 5 to 9 in the presence of cl we found that cl2 and in particular clo were responsible for the enhanced degradation with increasing cl concentrations due to the considerable clo reactivity of gemfibrozil 1 93 109 m 1 s 1 and naproxen 9 24 109 m 1 s 1 and the rapid transformation of cl2 to clo the presence of hco3 notably facilitated the degradation in the uv chlorine process because of the generation of co3 co3 showed high reactivity with gemfibrozil and naproxen corresponding to respective second order reaction rate constants of 2 45 107 and 3 50 107 m 1 s 1 dissolved organic matter induced obvious scavenging for oh cl and clo and greatly retarded the degradation the constructed model considering the effects of above water matrix has successfully predicted the oxidation degradation kinetics in real waters and both oh and co3 are the predominant reactive species in the degradation this study is helpful for comprehensive understanding the roles of possible radical species in micropollutant removal by uv chlorine oxidation under real water matrix graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords uv chlorine oxidation kinetic prediction reactive species water matrix micropollutants 1 introduction currently pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps have drawn considerable attention globally as a result of the potential health and ecological effects associated with exposure to these contaminants patel et al 2019 rand weaver et al 2013 environmental residues of ppcps in water matrices were reported as high as ¬µg l patel et al 2019 richardson and ternes 2014 and anti inflammatory drugs sunscreens antibiotics Œ≤ blockers and lipid regulators are the most frequently detected ppcps in surface water seawater and wastewater liu and wong 2013 it has been reported that effluent treatment plants were one of the most important pollution sources of ppcps because existing biological treatment processes cannot eliminate the pollutants completely liu and wong 2013 patel et al 2019 in addition ppcps are of growing concern in downriver drinking water supplies huerta fontela et al 2011 therefore advanced treatment processes are required to eliminate ppcps from wastewater effluents the advanced oxidation processes aop have been proved to be powerful treatment methods in refractory micropollutant elimination because it produces highly reactive species gerrity et al 2013 oh based aops are considered as one of the most commonly utilized techniques including uv h2o2 o3 h2o2 and fe2 h2o2 gong et al 2015 lee et al 2016 romero et al 2016 nevertheless one major disadvantage associated with these aops is that oh is a nonselective oxidant li et al 2018 remucal and manley 2016 oh can react with common organic compounds at nearly diffusion controlled rates and can also be easily scavenged by various aqueous components such as dissolved organic matter dom bicarbonate and chloride gligorovski et al 2015 li et al 2018 luo et al 2015 wols et al 2013 additionally the high cost of these processes limits their further practical application due to the requirement of high h2o2 dosages and the extra chemical reagents used in the quenching of residual h2o2 keen et al 2013 uv chlorine oxidation is a relatively new interested aop which is deemed as an alternative to uv h2o2 process chuang et al 2017 guo et al 2018 sichel et al 2011 zhang and parker 2018 uv chlorine oxidation is an effective method for eliminating a variety of micropollutants such as phenols methylene blue 2 methylisoborneal microborneol microcystin lr

surfactants e g benzenesulfonic acid and diethylene glycol cheng et al 2018 guo et al 2017 sichel et al 2011 yang et al 2016 zhang et al 2018 comparison of the oh based aops the uv chlorine process displays more efficient elimination for some ppcps including carbamazepine sulfamethoxazole caffeine acetaminophen and trimethoprim guo et al 2018 taken together the uv chlorine process can be regarded as an efficient aop in water treatment due to the more radical generation and high reaction selectivity of some reactive species the uv chlorine process generates both oh and cl by hocl ocl uv decomposition eqs 1 2 the secondary radicals i e cl2 clo are generated by eqs 3 7 fang et al 2014 zhang and parker 2018 1 hocl hv oh cl 2 ocl hv o cl 3 cl cl cl2 k forward 6 5 109 m 1 s 1 k

oxidizing agent 2 8 v while reactive chlorine species rcs such as cl cl2 and clo are selective oxidizing agents with their respective oxidation potentials of 2 4 2 0 and 1 5 1 8 v fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 cl can react easily with certain aromatic substances including phenols benzoic acid aniline and chlorobenzene and has a higher reactivity than oh martire et al 2001 cl2 is more selective and prefers to react with olefinic compounds and aromatic substances with hydroxyl methoxyl or amino moieties hasegawa and neta 1978 clo can react rapidly with phenolates and methoxybenzenes alfassi et al 1988 considering many ppcps have the above structural features the diverse reactive species of oh and rcs in uv chlorine system can play an important role in the elimination of many structurally diverse ppcps sun et al 2016 investigated n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide and caffeine transformation under uv chlorine condition and observed that n n diethyl 3 methylbenzamide degradation was primarily ascribed to both oh and cl and caffeine degradation was ascribed to the rapid reaction with clo but not oh fang and co workers reported that besides oh rcs also play significant role in the removal of many ppcps in uv chlorine system cheng et al 2018 fang et al 2014 guo et al 2017 yang et al 2016 guo et al 2017 explored the different reactivity of diverse radicals with many ppcps in uv chlorine condition and elucidated structural relationships of certain ppcps reaction with diverse radicals however only a few ppcps removal by uv chlorine oxidation considers the contributions and structural relationships of diverse species for a huge number of ppcps the roles of diverse radicals are still unknown all things taken together constructing kinetic models would be helpful for improving our deeply understanding in the roles of diverse radicals for ppcps degradation by uv chlorine oxidation technology for process application development up to now only a few studies have focused on the kinetic models of radicals in micropollutant degradation by uv chlorine oxidation fang et al 2014 shi et al 2018 wang et al 2017 previous kinetic models mainly focused on oh contribution to the degradation of some micropollutants while rcs contributions to the degradation are ignorable wang et al 2017 watts and linden 2007 recently fang et al 2014 investigated oh and rcs contributions to aqueous benzoic acid removal by uv chlorine oxidation via a steady state kinetic model but in this model clo was not considered due to its low reactivity with benzoic acid it has been reported that in uv chlorine condition clo plays a significant role in removing many ppcps including carbamazepine caffeine gemfibrozil naproxen trimethoprim bisphenol a bezafibrate and substituted benzoic acid compounds guo et al 2017 shi et al 2018 sun et al 2016 zhou et al 2019 shi et al 2018 built a kinetic model that considers oh and rcs i e cl cl2 and clo contributions on bezafibrate abatement but the impacts of water matrix on its degradation were not taken into account in this model which affects the destruction efficiency of pollutants guo et al 2017 developed a kinetic model for predicting the uv chlorine oxidation degradation of 20 ppcps in simulated drinking water considering oh and clo as the major radicals while the predicted values for some ppcps e g diclofenac trimethoprim ractopamine and bisphenol a were not well fitted because of lacking other radical contributions e g cl and cl2 therefore quantitative insight into elimination mechanisms of ppcps by all possible radicals that are involved e g ho and rcs is still insufficient in real water treatment by uv chlorine system the roles of diverse reactive species in uv chlorine system for degrading organic contaminants were reported to be influenced by water matrix e g ph dom alkalinity and halides and thus affect ppcps degradation remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 ye et al 2017 zhang and parker 2018 it is known that ph influences uv chlorine process by impacting free chlorine s dissociation species hocl ocl which dominates the quantum yields of free chlorine photolysis and thereby radical generation remucal and manley 2016 wang et al 2016 in addition quenching effects of hocl and ocl towards cl and oh are also different zhang and parker 2018 dom can quench oh and rcs and thereby retard many micropollutions destruction kong et al 2016 hco3 co3 2 can act as oh and cl quenchers causing the inhibitive effect on uv chlorine process and these quenching reactions concurrently produce carbonate radical co3 that prefers to react with aromatics containing electron donating groups relative to oh and cl which may enhance the removal of some micropollutants fang et al 2014 kong et al 2016 cl can influence uv chlorine oxidation by its reactions with oh or cl resulting in the generation of halogen containing radicals e g cl and cl2 wang et al 2016 zhang and parker 2018 overall the conversion of radicals under different water matrices further complicates the uv chlorine process therefore the kinetic model based on oh and rcs for micropollutants degradation should be comprehensively explored considering impacts of real water matrix which could be beneficial for degradation prediction of micropollutants in uv chlorine system the main goal was therefore to build a steady state kinetic model for improving the understanding of all possible radicals governing ppcps removal by uv chlorine oxidation naproxen and gemfibrozil were selected as two ppcp model compounds besides their frequent occurrence in surface waters and municipal wastewater bueno et al 2012 dur√°n √°lvarez et al 2015 they are reactive to oh and many rcs e g clo cl but resistant to chlorination or uv direct photodegradation guo et al 2017 simulated water solutions were employed to explore the roles of radicals for naproxen and gemfibrozil removal in uv chlorine system and to reveal the effects of water matrix including ph chloride dom and alkalinity moreover the overall and individual contributions of reactive species for the removal by experiments and kinetic modeling in uv chlorine system were also studied in real water samples 2 materials and method 2 1 reagents naproxen purity 99 and gemfibrozil purity 99 were obtained from sigma where sodium hypochlorite naclo solution available chlorine 5 was also purchased 2 acetonaphthone purity 98 benzoic acid purity 99 and nitrobenzene purity 99 were purchased from j k scientific of china salbutamol sal and 1 4

naoh and nahco3 were provided by j k scientific beijing china ultrapure water 18 2 mœâ cm at 25 c was prepared by a millipore milli q system three real water samples freshwater seawater and effluent from sewage systems were collected from dianchi lake qinzhou bay and kunming municipal sewage plant in china respectively these samples were filtered through 0 45 Œºm glass membrane and used for the uv chlorine experiments water quality parameters such as total organic carbon ph and inorganic ions were analyzed text s1 and results were shown in table s1 in addition each of 20 l filtered water samples for the three real waters was used for the isolation of organic matter via a reported reverse osmosis coupled with electrodialysis system vetter et al 2007 zhao et al 2019 2 2 irradiation experiments an xpa 1 merry go round photochemical reactor xujiang electromechanical plant nanjing china equipped with quartz tubes contain reaction solutions was employed in uv exposure experiments a low pressure mercury lamp 10 w emitting 254 nm light placed in reactor center was used as irradiation light source which was surrounded by a water refrigerated system to hold the reaction temperature at around 25 c the uv photon flux rate i 0 at 254 nm received in the center of reaction solution was calculated by iodide iodate chemical actinometry text s2 and the result is 2 28 Œºein l 1 s 1 effective path length was 2 78 cm calculated based on photolytic kinetics analysis of dilute h2o2 text s3 fig s1 the uv chlorine experimental solutions were obtained through adding aliquots of naocl solution into a 25 ml testing solution with or without dissolved components i e cl hco3 and dom and the desired ph was obtained by phosphate buffer 10 mm the contributions of main reactive species such as oh rcs and co3 on the observed degradation of target compounds under uv chlorine system were evaluated by the steady state assumption using chemical probes previous studies also employed similar methods to distinguish the roles of reactive radicals on degradation of many substances wu et al 2017 xiang et al 2016 aliquots 1 ml were periodically sampled from the testing tubes and quenched with sodium sulfite its molar ratio to free chlorine is 1 5 1 control tests of the target compound destruction by direct uv irradiation and dark chlorination bundled tightly with aluminum foil were conducted in a similar process as above description all the tests were performed in triplicate the target compounds under different reaction times were quantified on a reverse phase liquid chromatograph system agilent 1260 coupled with a diode array detector the separation column was a zorbax eclipse xdb c18 4 6 150 mm 5 Œºm particle size agilent the specific analysis conditions were listed in table s2 the degradation products of naproxen and gemfibrozil in the uv chlorine system were identified by an agilent 1290 hplc coupled to an ab sciex 6600 q tof mass spectrometer and the analytic processes are detailed in text s4 2 3 calculation of second order reaction rate constants for oh rcs and co3 the second order reaction rate constants k src of gemfibrozil and naproxen with the radicals oh cl cl2 clo and co3 were obtained through competition kinetics with different reference compounds guo et al 2017 wu et al 2017 for the k rsc values of oh 300 Œºm h2o2 under uv irradiation to create a ho scenario and 10 Œºm nitrobenzene nb was spiked into the scenario as a reference compound k ho nb 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 meanwhile target compound gemfibrozil or naproxen at the same concentration was added to the system the competition degradation kinetics of the compounds was shown in fig s2 the calculation equation is as following 8 k t k r k o h t k o h r where t and r represented the target compounds and reference compounds and k t and k r represent the respective pseudo first order rate constants k ho t and k ho r were the second order reaction rate constants for ho with target and reference compounds similar method was applied to calculate the k src values for clo and co3 with gemfibrozil or naproxen clo scenario was created by adding hco3 quenching radicals e g ho cl and cl2 into uv cl system containing 5 mg l available chlorine and 10 Œºm micropollutants figs s3 s5 solution ph was adjusted at 8 4 and 1 4 dimethoxybenzene dmob was used as reference compound in order to create a co3 scenario 100 mm hco3 was added to uv h2o2 system with 100 Œºm h2o2 each of 10 Œºm target micropollutant and reference compound salbutamol sal was involved in this reaction system and the ph was adjusted to be 8 4 the respective k src values for clo with dmob and co3 with sal are 2 1 109 m 1 s 1 and 2 1 107 m 1 s 1 alfassi et al 1988 lian et al 2017 in addition 10 Œºm nb benzoic acid ba and target micropollutants were simultaneously added into uv cl system to determine the k src values for cl with the target micropollutants and competition kinetics results were shown in fig s6 the calculation processes were shown as eqs 9 11 the k src values for cl2 with the target micropollutants were determined by adding 30 mm cl into the uv cl system so as to quench cl for the generation of cl2 fig s7 which was expressed as eqs 9 12 and 13 the k src values for ho clo and co3 with dom were determined by competition kinetics wu et al 2017 at uv h2o2 uv cl with 100

removal of gemfibrozil and naproxen in pure water by dark chlorination direct uv photodegradation and uv chlorine coexposure no obvious degradation of gemfibrozil and naproxen was observed by dark chlorination within 6 min under 2 5 mg l chlorine dosage approximately 15 of these compounds was eliminated by direct uv photodegradation within 6 min previous studies also reported that the two compounds are resistant to direct uv photodegradation and chlorination in dark guo et al 2017 pan et al 2018 nevertheless under uv chlorine system the removal of gemfibrozil and naproxen was up to 77 and 94 respectively which were great higher than those of direct uv photolysis by factors of 5 6 this indicates that the combination exposure of uv and chlorine dominates the elimination of gemfibrozil and naproxen and the contributions of dark chlorination and direct uv photolysis to their removal plays a minor role which agrees with previously reported results guo et al 2017 as reported previously many reactive species are involved in uv chlorine system such as cl clo and cl2 which may significantly affect the degradation of many organic micropollutants remucal and manley 2016 moreover the generation conversion of these reactive species in uv chlorine system were great impacted by water matrix wu et al 2017 zhang and parker 2018 therefore the roles oh and rcs in gemfibrozil and naproxen removal and the effects of water matrix were explored 3 2 effects of water matrix and kinetic modeling 3 2 1 effect of ph fig 2 a and c experimentally depict pseudo first order rate constants k of gemifibrozil and naproxen removal in ph range of 5 9 the k values of gemifibrozil and naproxen elimination significantly decreased from 3 76 7 25 10 3 s 1 to 1 64 2 63 10 3 s 1 as ph increased from 5 to 9 respectively fig 2a and c also show the predicted k values based on steady state radical models eq 15 as a function of ph the model predictions of oh cl and clo contributions matched well with the experimental data which indicates that ph effects are well explained by the prediction results the formation of these radical species was verified by using nitrobenzene and benzoic acid chemical probes in our uv chlorine system nitrobenzene only reacts with oh benzoic acid reacts with oh and cl rapidly but its reaction with clo is negligible wu et al 2017 xiang et al 2016 as shown in fig s11 nitrobenzene degrades significantly in the uv chlorine system which is indicative of the formation of oh the degradation rate of benzoic acid is greatly higher as compared to that of nitrobenzene by a factor of about 10 combined with the slight difference of k src for oh with nitrobenzene 3 9 109 m 1 s 1 or benzoic acid 5 9 109 m 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 cl was involved in our uv chlorine oxidation system besides oh clo was tested by using trimethoprim as a model wu et al 2016 reported that the enhanced degradation of trimethoprim by uv chlorine oxidation with increasing ph was ascribed to the increase in clo at higher ph more free chlorine is in ocl form that quenches oh and cl which results in clo formation at higher rates than hocl consequently clo can compensate the decreasing contributions of oh and cl causing the increasing degradation of trimethoprim as rising ph in uv chlorine system wu et al 2016 we also observed the increasing degradation of trimethoprim in our uv chlorine system with the increase of ph fig s11 corroborating the formation of clo the contributions of oh and rcs to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation were also evaluated experimentally by the steady state assumption of radical concentrations using nitrobenzene and benzoic acid as probe chemicals xiang et al 2016 wu et al 2017 as shown in fig s12 the contributions of three reactive species on the degradation also decreased with increasing ph values and in general their contributions were consistent with the predicted values under different ph conditions which corroborates the model prediction data of individual contribution of reactive species for the degradation figs 2b and 2d show the predicted individual and total contributions of reactive species i e oh cl and clo to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation at different ph conditions besides primary reactive species oh and cl eqs 1 and 2 secondary radical clo also plays an important role in gemifibrozil and naproxen destruction especially at acidic condition ph 5 the contributions of clo to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation were 24 and 34 respectively overall the individual degradation rates of oh cl and clo reduced with the increase of ph from 5 to 9 oh and rcs contributions were 65 35 at ph 5 and 93 7 at ph 9 for gemifibrozil respectively and those contributions were 47 53 at ph 5 and 79 21 at ph 9 for naproxen respectively the reasons for the ph dependent trend of pollutant elimination by uv chlorine oxidation may be explicated as following i the proportion of hocl ocl is impacted by ph and the quantum yields of hocl under 254 nm irradiation 1 45 is greatly higher as compared to ocl 0 97 fang et al 2014 hence relatively high hocl fraction at low ph is beneficial for radical generation rates i e oh o and cl by eqs 1 and 2 ii the reactivity of hocl with oh 2 109 m 1 s 1 and cl 3 109 m 1 s 1 is lower relative to ocl reacting with oh 8 8 109 m 1 s 1 and cl 8 2 109 m 1 s 1 connick 1947 jayson et al 1973 matthew and anastasio 2006 zehavi and rabani 1972 thus ocl retained at high ph depletes more oh and cl than did hocl at low ph this depletion for oh and cl by free chlorine also produces clo from the reactions of eqs 4 7 which has a good reactivity with gemifibrozil and naproxen as indicated by table s4 although clo is attributable to the degradation of gemifibrozil and naproxen its contribution to the degradation does not compensate the loss of oh and cl from chorine photolysis under different ph conditions in addition ph also affects the dissociation forms of gemifibrozil pk a 4 7 and naproxen pk a 4 15 acero et al 2010 guo et al 2017 westerhoff et al 2005 in our experimental ph range from 5 9 anionic gemifibrozil 66 and naproxen 87 are the dominant forms fig s13 at ph 7 the fractions of anionic forms for the two compounds exceed 95 which indicates that the dissociation forms of the models could not explain the degradation kinetics alteration by uv chlorine oxidation in ph range of 5 9 3 2 2 effect of cl cl plays an important role in the transformation of reactive species in aops grebel et al 2010 thus cl that covers its concentration range of 0 20 mm commonly found in surface water and wastewater effluent was studied in the uv chlorine system fig 3 shows the k values of gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation in the presence of cl ranging from 0 to 20 mm and the predicted results of overall and individual contributions of oh cl clo and cl2 to their removal pan et al 2018 observed that 5 mm cl does not affect naproxen elimination in uv chlorine system but degradation enhancement was observed under our experimental conditions which agrees with the model predicted overall results as shown in fig 3c the predicted individual contribution of oh cl clo and cl2 on the degradation was tested by steady state assumption experiment due to lack of suitable chemical probes for distinguishing the roles of concomitant rcs i e cl clo and cl2 the contributions of oh and overall rcs were studied in the uv chlorine system by using nitrobenzene combining with the results from fig s14 demonstrate that oh and rcs contributions to the observed k values are comparable with the correspondingly predicted ones as indicated from fig 3 the experimental degradation of gemifibrozil and naproxen enhanced by 47 and 91 along with cl concentrations increasing from 0 to 20 mm this increase can be mainly attributed to the contribution of clo based on the overall model predictions that are well agreed with the experimental values figs 3a 3d figs 3b and 3d demonstrate that predicted clo contributions to the degradation increased with the increase of cl concentrations cl reacts rapidly with cl producing cl2 following eq 3 thereby further affects the transformation of micropollutants hou et al 2021 kl√§ning and wolff 1985 zhao et al 2019 in addition cl2 can also be generated from the transformation of secondary radical species cloh by eq s17 table s3 therefore it was postulated that the increased cl2 concentrations might be contributed to the enhanced degradation with increasing cl concentrations figs 3b and 3d show that the contributions of cl2 to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation increased as increasing of cl concentrations at 20 mm cl the fractions of cl2 contributions to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation only account for 8 and 3 respectively which are far below the enhanced degradation 54 and 91 respectively as shown in figs 3a and 3c according to previous studies cl2 can also be transformed by the rapid reaction with clo to clo 5 4 108 m 1 s 1 by eq s14 as listed in table s3 grebel et al 2010 the reactivity of clo and cl2 towards the two compounds was compared by the determined k src values as listed in table s4 the k src values of clo for gemifibrozil and naproxen are 3 4 orders of magnitude higher as compared to those of cl2 additionally the k src value of clo for naproxen was great higher as compared to that of clo for gemifibrozil which explains the higher contribution of clo to naproxen degradation overall these reveal that clo is responsible for degradation enhancement in uv chlorine system containing cl which is verified by the modeling results of clo contributions 3 2 3 effect of hco3 hco3 which is responsible for alkalinity is the most common inorganic anion present in real water due to relatively high hco3 concentrations in real water ranging from 0 3 to 5 mm huang and mabury 2000 oh and cl can collide with hco3 easily to produce co3 by eqs s19 and s20 in the uv chlorine system compared with oh co3 is a more selective oxidant larson and zepp 1988 vione et al 2009 thus co3 steady state concentrations are expected to be higher relative to those of oh and cl in uv chlorine process and it may play a significant role in degrading pollutants with electron donating groups fig 4 shows the experimental degradation rates of gemifibrozil and naproxen and the sum and individual contributions of oh cl clo and co3 base on model predictions to the degradation at various hco3 concentrations the experimental k values for the both compounds notably increased as hco3 concentrations increased from 0 to 5 mm this result agrees with previous study that hco3 did not reduce naproxen degradation rate in uv chlorine process pan et al 2018 fig 4 demonstrates that predicted overall k values considering oh cl clo and co3 also increased with increasing hco3 concentrations agreeing well with the experimental data in additional experiments conducted by spiking nitrobenzene or tert butanol into the uv chlorine system we also evaluated the individual contribution of these reactive species on the oxidation degradation nitrobenzene can only react with oh tert butanol can quench oh cl and clo rapidly but its quenching effect on co3 is negligible wu et al 2017 fig s15 shows that co3 contributions on the degradation increased with increasing hco3 concentrations from 0 to 5 mm and the contributions of co3 rcs and oh on the observed k values are consistent with their respective predicted values which corroborates the predicted contributions of these reactive species on gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation based on the experimental results and model predictions the four radicals i e oh cl clo and co3 dominate gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation in the uv chlorine system containing hco3 with respect to oh hco3 almost did not influence its contributions on the two compounds degradation for the other primary species cl its contributions on gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation decreased by 82 and 79 with addition of 5 mm hco3 figs 4b and 4d this is concordant with reported results that hco3 preferentially reacts with cl 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 while its reactivity with oh is much smaller 8 6 106 m 1 s 1 table s1 although these radicals contribute to the overall degradation co3 produced from the radicals scavenging reaction by eqs s19 s21 plays a crucial role in removal enhancement in the presence of hco3 figs 4b and 4d because of its good reactivity towards the two compounds table s4 all things taken together co3 contribution to gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation has compensated the scavenging loss of primary radicals produced in uv chlorine system thereby promoting the elimination 3 2 4 effect of dom since dom is ubiquitous in real waters the effect of dom on uv chlorine system was explored at its environmentally relevant levels nom from suwannee river was applied as a dom proxy to explore its effect on the oxidation degradation fig 5 depicts experimental degradation rates and the predicted sum and individual contributions of primary oh and cl and secondary radicals clo on the degradation of model compounds at different nom concentrations with increasing nom concentrations from 0 to 20 mg l the experimental k values for gemifibrozil and naproxen reduced by 71 and 81 respectively this decrease can be explained by the well fitted results from the prediction model based on the degradation contributions of oh cl clo which considers the inner filter effect of the nom its extinction coefficient at 254 nm is 3 15 l m 1 mg 1 these predicted contributions of individual oh cl and clo were supported by steady state assumption experimental results as shown in fig s16 besides inner filter effect dom can also compete with gemifibrozil and naproxen for oh and rcs consumption which leads to the decrease of the steady state concentrations of these reactive species it has been reported that the respective k src values of the nom with oh cl and clo were 2 5 104 1 3 104 and 4 6 104 l mg 1 s 1 fang et al 2014 wu et al 2017 overall these rate constants are comparable indicating that nom can easily quench these radicals thereby reducing the degradation of gemifibrozil and naproxen in uv chlorine process in addition nom can also react with free chlorine with a rate constant of 3 10 5 s 1 westerhoff et al 2004 in our study the consumption of free chlorine was calculated to be around 4 within the duration irradiation time 6 min which is indicative of a negligible role 3 3 kinetic prediction in real waters three real water samples collected from coastal water effluent of sewage system and freshwater from fuxian lake were employed to test the predicted performance of the constructed kinetic models in real waters the main water components and ph were determined and results are shown by table s2 for dom its structures greatly differ for different environmental sources therefore three local dom isolated from the real waters were employed to calculate the k src values with the relevant radicals under uv chlorine system table s5 so as to predict the degradation kinetics reasonably combined with the determined component results and the effects of the main water components stated above five radicals i e oh cl clo cl2 and co3 were incorporated into the steady state radical predicted model fig 6 shows that the predicted k values of the two compounds in fuxian lake are comparable with the experimental values and those of in seawater and effluent are slightly higher than experimental ones by factors of 1 2 1 4 overall the predicted k values are consistent with the experimental values as show by predicted results from fig 6 in the real waters oh and co3 dominate gemifibrozil and naproxen elimination under uv chlorine system with integral contribution fractions of 94 99 while other radicals play a minor role in the degradation 6 steady state assumption and radical quenching experiments also show that oh and co3 are the dominant species for the uv chlorine oxidation of gemifibrozil and naproxen in the real water matrix fig s17 for oh its contribution on the degradation of the two compounds is notably higher in fuxian lake than that in seawater and effluent samples in terms of the above discussion from figs 3 5 dom contributed much more to oh quenching than did cl and hco3 because of the reversible reaction between cl and oh oh cl cloh and the weak reactivity of hco3 with oh 8 6 106 m 1 s 1 buxton et al 1988 kl√§ning and wolff 1985 combination with water component results listed in table s1 it can be deduced that the higher oh contribution is attributed to the lower dom concentration in fuxian lake as compared to that of effluent although the dom concentration in seawater is lower than that of fuxian lake the presence of br in seawater may rapidly quench oh due to the higher reactivity between them 1 1 1010 m 1 s 1 grebel et al 2010 vione 2018 which was supported by wu et al 2017 who reported that br is not beneficial for the degradation of metronidazole nalidixic acid diethyltoluamide and caffeine in uv chlorine process it deserves mentioning that in the real waters co3 plays an important role in degrading pollutants in real waters especially in coastal water which accounts for 64 and 61 on the overall degradation of gemifibrozil and naproxen respectively this is consistent with the individual hco3 affecting experimental result that hco3 enhanced the degradation in uv chlorine system fig 4 in this oxidation system co3 could be mainly produced by the rapid reaction of hco3 with cl 2 2 108 m 1 s 1 while oh plays a minor role in co3 generation due to its relatively weaker reactivity with hco3 8 6 106 m 1 s 1 table s3 in seawater cl with relatively high concentration 87 5 mm can rapidly react with cl to produce cl2 that has a high reactivity with hco3 8 107 m 1 s 1 resulting in co3 formation matthew and anastasio 2006 combined with the high reactivity of co3 with gemifibrozil and naproxen it is likely to explain the phenomenon of the high co3 contribution to the degradation in seawater matrix in this study a steady state kinetic model that considers possible radicals in uv chlorine process was constructed to predict the removal kinetics of ppcps this model is conducive to deeply understanding the effects of environmentally relevant conditions such halides alkalinity and dom on the roles of radicals in the removal the contributions of radicals i e oh cl clo cl2 co3 under environmentally relevant conditions can be calculated accurately by the model in terms of this affecting mechanism the removal rates of micropollutants in uv chlorine process can be predicted successfully in real waters it is worth mentioning that co3 plays a very important role in gemifibrozil and naproxen elimination in real water matrices while beside oh the direct contributions of other radicals including cl and clo could be negligible co3 is selective and has a higher reactivity than ho and cl towards electron rich contaminants including anilines phenoxides and sulfur containing substances 108 m 1 s 1 canonica et al 2005 larson and zepp 1988 considering that hco3 is on behalf of alkalinity and is ubiquitous in real waters with its concentrations ranging from 0 3 to 5 mm huang and mabury 2000 the importance of co3 on ppcps elimination should be considered in uv chlorine system in our study with 0 3 mm hco3 condition the contributions of co3 on gemifibrozil and naproxen degradation are 20 based on the model prediction but this contribution could be increased in saline water with higher concentration cl because of rapid reaction between hco3 and cl2 cl cl cl2 producing co3 as indicated by table s5 relative to oh cl and clo co3 reactivity with local dom main scavenging components for reactive species was great lower by factors spanning 2 3 orders of magnitude which further suggests the importance of co3 in the degradation of certain micropollutants in the real engineering application of uv chlorine system all things taken together our constructed kinetic model considering the environmentally relevant conditions can be used to predict removal kinetics of ppcps under real water matrix in addition the degradation products especially the formation of halogenated products between rcs and ppcps are a general concern for the uv chlorine process besides its oxidation potential the degradation products of gemifibrozil and naproxen in our system were identified and observed the formation of halogenated products table s6 previous studies reported that despite the possible formation of halogenated products rcs react predominantly by oxidation rather than chlorine addition for some organic pollutants grebel et al 2010 parker and mitch 2016 grebel et al 2010 observed that in the engineered treatment of phenol by oh which can produce halogen radicals in the presence of halides the yield of total halophenols was 0 52 in seawater matrix bromophenols accounting for 93 96 of the total while the total halophenols formed were at only 0 03 yield in wastewater bromophenols accounting for 60 100 of the total the reactions of halogen radicals with organic substances can lead to the formation of halogenated product with low levels and bromophenols are the dominant constituents in the total halogenated products vione et al 2005 reported that compared to brominate radicals chlorine radicals are more apt to be oxidation reaction with phenol therefore in the uv chlorine system halogenated products formation between rcs and ppcps could be at low levels due to the oxidation mechanism of rcs however due to the structural difference of ppcps the reaction processes of rcs towards ppcps may be different hence careful evaluation is required prior to engineered application of uv chlorine technology 4 conclusion this study has successfully developed a kinetic predicted model that may be employed to predict the elimination rates of micropollutants in uv chlorine process in water matrix of varying quality oh and rcs contributions to the elimination are relevant to the impacts of water matrix oh cl and clo contributed to gemfibrozil and naproxen degradation in pure water and the degradation rates decreased with increasing ph cl notably enhanced the degradation of both compounds and clo was the dominant reactive species for the enhancement of the degradation hco3 also facilitated the degradation in uv chorine process because of the contribution of co3 to the degradation dissolved organic matter dom greatly quenched the reactive species leading to the inhibiting effects on the degradation in real waters the model predicted results demonstrated that oh and co3 are the dominant radicals for gemfibrozil and naproxen degradation and the predicted degradation rates agreed with the experimental data well

16794,seasonal flooding drought transformation process of lake sediments lead to changes of dissolved oxygen and redox conditions and the resultant generation of hydroxyl radical ho to date information on ho formation and its regulators in seasonal lake sediments is largely unexplored in this study a total of nineteen sediments were collected from lake poyang china with the formation and mechanisms of ho during the oxygenation process exploring via the incubation experiments fe k edge x ray adsorption spectroscopy ultrafiltration and fluorescent spectroscopy results showed that the concentrations of ho generated ranged from 3 75 1 13 to 271 8 22 81 Œºmol kg 1 demonstrating high formation potential and obvious spatial heterogeneity the yield of ho formed was positively correlated with the contents of fe ii sedimentary organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon showing a general contribution of these reduced substances to ho formation furthermore application of fe k edge x ray adsorption spectroscopy revealed the key species of sedimentary fe smectite for ho formation due to its high peroxidase like activity besides inorganic fe ii the sedimentary dissolved organic matters doms represented an important regulator for ho formation which contributed about 2 11 of the total ho generation moreover the dom induced formation potential was found to be highly related to the molecular weight distribution that the low molecular weight lmw 1 kda fraction exhibited higher ho formation potential than the bulk and high molecular weight hmw 1 kda 0 45 Œºm counterparts in addition the omnipresent mineral fe ii dom interaction in sediment matrix exhibited another 2 6 of contribution to the total ho production this study highlighted the importance of contents and species of fe ii and dom in manipulating the ho yield providing new insight into understanding the formation mechanisms of ho in the seasonal lake sediment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords hydroxyl radical lake sediment fe ii dissolved organic matter molecular weight fraction 1 introduction hydroxyl radical ho the strong and nonselective oxidizing agent oxidation potential 2 8 v can react instantaneously with the surrounding compounds which exhibits critical roles in contaminant degradation and element cycling gligorovski et al 2015 wardman 1989 in aquatic ecosystems ho originated mainly from the solar irradiation of some organic and inorganic substances e g dissolved organic ligands and nitrogen oxides gligorovski et al 2015 xu et al 2020a chen et al 2020 however emerging evidences demonstrated that underestimated ho production appeared in environment where the reduced substances were suffered from oxygenation even at dark conditions page et al 2013 trusiak et al 2019 sediments in aquatic ecosystems represent the most important source of reduced substances pointing to the possibility of oxygenation processes regulating such extensive ho production in sediments liao et al 2019 for example recent studies showed that the amount of ho produced by sediment oxygenation was up to orders of magnitude higher than that obtained from photolysis of the overlying waters tong et al 2016 formation of ho in lake sediments under such conditions had received increasing attentions in the past few years among the reduced substances fe ii was the dominant factor for ho formation and the pathways for ho formation included mainly the release of electrons during the oxygenation of fe ii xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 du et al 2020 consequently the potential of ho formation in sediments was considered to be generally related to the content of total fe ii schaefer et al 2018 however recent studies showed that the electron donating abilities of fe ii were highly correlated with the species which were characterized by various sizes shapes morphologies and even structure properties yu and kuzyakov 2021 chi et al 2020 for instance xie et al 2020 found that although fe ii oxidation rate increased with the increase in electron donating ability the ho formation decreased accordingly and fe ii rich minerals which were characterized by a moderate oxidation rate however were found to be more favorable for ho yield tong et al 2016 besides inorganic fe the reduced organics also exhibited important role in ho formation liao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 du et al 2021 dissolved organic matter dom was the most reactive organics which was characterized by a wide range of molecular weight mw distribution from 1 nm to 0 45 Œºm xu and guo 2017 2018 due to the different physicochemical properties doms with varied mws possessed generally distinct environmental effects such as interface adsorption and colloid stabilization yin et al 2015 xu et al 2019a emerging evidence also demonstrated the mw dependent heterogeneities in photochemical formation of ho from doms with different sources xu et al 2020b however doms in these studies were obtained mainly from the natural waters lacking a general conclusion about the associated formation of ho in sediments lake poyang is the largest freshwater lake in china with the total area of about 3500 km2 each year about 2800 km2 of the sediments 4 5 of the total area would be suffered by obvious drought flooding transformation process and changes of dissolved oxygen han et al 2015 xu et al 2020c the water level fluctuations in lake poyang were characterized with 0 14 m for this reason a total of nineteen sediments were collected from the western areas of lake poyang china and a series of well controlled cultivation experiments were conducted to detect the formation of ho under the anoxic oxic transformation process state of the art methodologies including fe k edge x ray adsorption spectroscopy and ultrafiltration enabled comprehensive new characterization of fe species and mw fractions of doms the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the spatial heterogeneities of ho formation in different lake sediments derived from the oxygenation process 2 track the variations in the contents and species of fe and organics and 3 quantitatively evaluate the contributions of fe and organic species to ho formation the results obtained are thus helpful in understanding element cycle of seasonal lake sediments and providing technical guidance for the ecological remediation of contaminated sediments 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection and preparation lake poyang the largest freshwater lake in china was characterized with the typical subtropical monsoon climate

oxygenation of the lake poyang sediment the concentrations of ho detected ranged from 3 75 1 13 to 271 8 22 81 Œºmol kg 1 demonstrating obvious spatial heterogeneities in the formation potential it

the amounts of ho formed exhibited obvious heterogeneities from 73 13 12 25 to 271 8 22 81 Œºmol kg 1 table 1 and fig 2b c the results suggested that the formation potential of ho in lake sediment may be also dependent on the species of these reduced substances 3 3 fe species regulating ho formation in sediments 3 3 1 identifying fe species by x ray absorption fine structure analysis in order to explore the mechanism responsible for ho formation regulated by fe species exafs analysis was applied herein fig 3 obvious differences in peak patterns at the regions k 5 1 6 2 √• and 7 2 9 0 √• were observed for the fe k3 weighted exafs spectra of the selected sediments these peaks could be observed in different fe containing standard samples suggesting the heterogeneities in fe species lcf results of the fe k3 weighted exafs spectra showed that the fe species in the selected sediments were mainly composed of fe oxides e g goethite 31 2 55 8 fe silicates e g fe smectite 18 6 40 6 and a small amount of soluble exchangeable fe fig 3c and detailed in table s1 the pathways for ho formation mainly include the release of electrons during the oxygenation of fe ii xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 compared to fe silicates the fe oxides and soluble exchangeable fe possessed higher electron donating ability resulting in the increase of fe ii oxidation rate during the oxygenation process but the decrease of ho yield xie et al 2020 the fe silicates with special fe ii coordination structure could supply electrons continuously under the oxygenation process which was more conducive to the formation of ho hofstetter et al 2006 latta et al 2017 xie et al 2020 in this study the content of fe smectite in the selected sediments was in the following order s6 s15 s2 s5 s12 s1 which was consistent with the ho formation potential the results indicated that fe smectite would be the key factor to regulate the ho formation tong et al 2016 3 3 2 peroxidase like activity of the selected sediments to further explore the species of fe responsible for the formation of ho h2o2 reduction by using the classic tmb assay in the six selected sediments was detected to evaluate the peroxidase like activity fig 4 the results showed that all the selected sediments exhibited obvious catalytic activity but with different extents fig 4a the average activities in these sediments ranged from 0 013 to 0 034 units with the order of s6 s15 s5 s2 s12 s1 fig 4b the peroxidase like activity of fe species was mainly depended on the donating electrons to promote the charge transfer between oxygen atoms in h2o2 strand et al 2018 yu et al 2020 the values of peroxidase like activity were characterized with same trends with the relative contents of fe smectite suggesting that fe smectite may process the highest peroxidase like activity among all fe species the results further supported the observation that fe smectite regulated the ho formation during sediment oxygenation 3 4 sedimentary doms regulating ho formation 3 4 1 properties of sedimentary doms in terms of mw distribution besides fe species the physicochemical properties of doms such as the mw distribution exhibited also obvious influence on ho formation xu et al 2020b the selected sedimentary doms were thus fractionated into lmw 1 kda and hmw 1 kda 0 45 Œºm fractions investigations on the doc distribution between different mws showed that about 15 36 of the doc were located in the lmw fraction leaving the other 64 85 within the hmw fraction fig s3 it was noted that the molecular sizes of sedimentary doms were slightly higher than those of the river and lake ones which would be due to the predominance of microbial processes that induce obvious molecular aggregation xu et al 2020b in addition the fluorescent eem spectroscopy showed that all dom samples were characterized with four main peaks i e protein tyrosine em ex 320 230 nm peak a tryptophan em ex 320 280 nm peak b fulvic em ex 420 230 nm peak c and humic like em ex 470 340 nm peak d peaks fig 5 as for the mw fractionated samples the fulvic and humic like fluorophores were located mainly in the lmw fraction while the tyrosine and tryptophan like fluorophores became the main components in the hmw fractions which were consistent with other sediment doms xu et al 2019b thus the sedimentary doms were characterized with obvious mw dependent heterogeneities in abundances and compositions 3 4 2 potential of ho formation derived from sedimentary doms to explore the mw dependent heterogeneities of sedimentary doms in ho formation the potential of ho generation derived by the bulk and mw fractionated doms are shown in fig 6 a for each dom sample the lmw fraction was generally characterized with highest ho formation potential followed by the bulk and hmw counterparts taken s6 for example the potential of ho formation derived by lmw fraction 1 58 0 12 Œºmol l 1 was 2 19 and 7 31 times higher than that induced by the bulk 0 72 0 11 Œºmol l 1 and hmw 0 22 0 02 Œºmol l 1 counterparts respectively similar results that lmw fraction benefiting the ho formation can also be found in our previous studies which focused on the photochemical formation of ho from the river and lake waters xu et al 2020b according to the results of fluorescent spectroscopy the lmw fractions for all doms were characterized with the richness of the humic like substances which was considered as the critical components for the enhanced ho formation potential due to the abundant carboxyl groups xu et al 2020b based on the abundance of sedimentary doms and their ho formation potential it can be calculated that sedimentary doms contributed about 2 11 of the total ho production table s2 it should be noted that contribution of sedimentary doms observed herein contained those of doms themselves and impurities such as fe even with a low contribution role of the soluble fe in influencing dom induced ho production merit the further investigation in future studies it was noted that mineral fe ii and dom in sediment matrix can interact each other which can resultantly promote the potential of electron donor and ho formation page et al 2013 2012 trusiak et al 2018 a recent study indicated that the fe ii dom interaction was responsible for h2o2 production the precursor of ho in the aquifers zhang et al 2020 in this study the co oxygenation experiments of dom and fe ii demonstrated that additional ho could be formed due to the fe ii dom interaction fig 6b the addition concentration of ho ranged from 0 21 to 0 72 Œºmol l 1 which contributed about 2 6 of the total ho production table s2 presenting a new insight into the ho formation the results indicated that the contribution of the mineral fe ii dom interaction should not be ignored in the studies of ho formation from sediment oxygenation 3 5 significance of this study to our knowledge this is the first study revealing the simultaneous influences of fe ii and dom species as well as the fe ii dom interaction on sedimentary ho formation during oxygenation processes several implications of this work should be considered for the study of ho in which fe ii and dom are involved first the content of sedimentary fe silicates and or the peroxidase like activity may be an appropriate indicator to indicate ho formation potential for instance compared to other sediment samples the sediments in s6 were characterized with more sedimentary fe smectite that possessed high peroxidase like activity and thus a higher potential of ho formation second for the sedimentary doms heterogeneity in mw distribution within the bulk samples should be considered when explaining the potential of doms on ho formation the low molecular weight lmw 1 kda fraction was characterized with the richness of the humic like substances and exhibited higher ho formation potential than the bulk and high molecular weight hmw 1 kda 0 45 Œºm counterparts another implication is that the mineral fe ii dom interaction which presented an underestimated generation pathway for ho should not be ignored when exploring the factors regulating ho formation in this study the fe ii dom interaction contributed 2 6 to the total ho production it should be noted that only one fe ii species with the fixed concentration was selected in the co incubation experiment fig 6b while the sedimentary fe ii exhibited a wide variation in abundance and species consequently further researches on the contribution of the interactions between fe species and doms to sedimentary ho formation should be considered and quantified for a better understanding of the potential of ho from the oxygenation processes due to the confluence of the five major rivers in jiangxi the contaminants from almost the whole province are concentrated in lake poyang lu et al 2012 shankman and liang 2003 the deteriorated aquatic environment in lake poyang has been received increasing attentions in recent years li et al 2020 as well documented ho possesses high efficiency for the removal of organic contaminants in the ecosystems cheng et al 2020 kilic et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 recent studies also provided direct evidences that ho formed through reduced substrates oxygenation can oxidize contaminants such as arsenic tetracycline and phenol in the sediment tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 the formation of sedimentary ho during the oxygenation processes may thus play an important role in the purification and restoration of the contaminated sediments in lake poyang and other seasonal lakes or rivers 4 conclusions nineteen naturally collected sediment samples in lake poyang were selected for the oxygenation process the sedimentary ho generated by the oxygenation of reduced substances was widespread but with different extents due to different physicochemical properties of sediment samples the sedimentary ho formation potential was highly dependent on not only the contents but also the species of fe ii and dom sedimentary fe smectite was considered as the key species for ho formation due to its high peroxidase like activity the lmw fraction within the sedimentary dom exhibited higher ho formation potential than the bulk and hmw counterparts in addition the omnipresent mineral fe ii dom interaction in the sediment matrix also contributed to ho formation findings in this study provide new insights into the evaluation of the formation potential of sedimentary ho in the seasonal lake which is essential for the understanding of the behavior and

16794,seasonal flooding drought transformation process of lake sediments lead to changes of dissolved oxygen and redox conditions and the resultant generation of hydroxyl radical ho to date information on ho formation and its regulators in seasonal lake sediments is largely unexplored in this study a total of nineteen sediments were collected from lake poyang china with the formation and mechanisms of ho during the oxygenation process exploring via the incubation experiments fe k edge x ray adsorption spectroscopy ultrafiltration and fluorescent spectroscopy results showed that the concentrations of ho generated ranged from 3 75 1 13 to 271 8 22 81 Œºmol kg 1 demonstrating high formation potential and obvious spatial heterogeneity the yield of ho formed was positively correlated with the contents of fe ii sedimentary organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon showing a general contribution of these reduced substances to ho formation furthermore application of fe k edge x ray adsorption spectroscopy revealed the key species of sedimentary fe smectite for ho formation due to its high peroxidase like activity besides inorganic fe ii the sedimentary dissolved organic matters doms represented an important regulator for ho formation which contributed about 2 11 of the total ho generation moreover the dom induced formation potential was found to be highly related to the molecular weight distribution that the low molecular weight lmw 1 kda fraction exhibited higher ho formation potential than the bulk and high molecular weight hmw 1 kda 0 45 Œºm counterparts in addition the omnipresent mineral fe ii dom interaction in sediment matrix exhibited another 2 6 of contribution to the total ho production this study highlighted the importance of contents and species of fe ii and dom in manipulating the ho yield providing new insight into understanding the formation mechanisms of ho in the seasonal lake sediment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords

originated mainly from the solar irradiation of some organic and inorganic substances e g dissolved organic ligands and nitrogen oxides gligorovski et al 2015 xu et al 2020a chen et al 2020 however emerging evidences demonstrated that underestimated ho production appeared in environment where the reduced substances were suffered from oxygenation even at dark conditions page et al 2013 trusiak et al 2019 sediments in aquatic ecosystems represent the most important source of reduced substances pointing to the possibility of oxygenation processes regulating such extensive ho production in sediments liao et al 2019 for example recent studies showed that the amount of ho produced by sediment oxygenation was up to orders of magnitude higher than that obtained from photolysis of the overlying waters tong et al 2016 formation of ho in lake sediments under such conditions had received increasing attentions in the past few years among the reduced substances fe ii was the dominant factor for ho formation and the pathways for ho formation included mainly the release of electrons during the oxygenation of fe ii xie et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 du et al 2020 consequently the potential of ho formation in sediments was considered to be generally related to the content of total fe ii schaefer et al 2018 however recent studies showed that the electron donating abilities of fe ii were highly correlated with the species which were characterized by various sizes shapes morphologies and even structure properties yu and kuzyakov 2021 chi et al 2020 for instance xie et al 2020 found that although fe ii oxidation rate increased with the increase in electron donating ability the ho formation decreased accordingly and fe ii rich minerals which were characterized by a moderate oxidation rate however were found to be more favorable for ho yield tong et al 2016 besides inorganic fe the reduced organics also exhibited important role in ho formation liao et al 2019 zhang et al 2020 du et al 2021 dissolved organic matter dom was the most reactive organics which was characterized by a wide range of molecular weight mw distribution from 1 nm to 0 45 Œºm xu and guo 2017 2018 due to the different physicochemical properties doms with varied mws possessed generally distinct environmental effects such as interface adsorption and colloid stabilization yin et al 2015 xu et al 2019a emerging evidence also demonstrated the mw dependent heterogeneities in photochemical formation of ho from doms with different sources xu et al 2020b however doms in these studies were obtained mainly from the natural waters lacking a general conclusion about the associated formation of ho in sediments lake poyang is the largest freshwater lake in china with the total area of about 3500 km2 each year about 2800 km2 of the sediments 4 5 of the total area would be suffered by obvious drought flooding transformation process and changes of dissolved oxygen han et al 2015 xu et al 2020c the water level fluctuations in lake poyang were characterized with 0 14 m for this reason a total of nineteen sediments were collected from the western areas of lake poyang china and a series of well controlled cultivation experiments were conducted to detect the formation of ho under the anoxic oxic transformation process state of the art methodologies including fe k edge x ray adsorption spectroscopy and ultrafiltration enabled comprehensive new characterization of fe species and mw fractions of doms the objectives of this study were to 1 examine the spatial heterogeneities of ho formation in different lake sediments derived from the oxygenation process 2 track the variations in the contents and species of fe and organics and 3 quantitatively evaluate the contributions of fe

different mws showed that about 15 36 of the doc were located in the lmw fraction leaving the other 64 85 within the hmw fraction fig s3 it was noted that the molecular sizes of sedimentary doms were slightly higher than those of the river and lake ones which would be due to the predominance of microbial processes that induce obvious molecular aggregation xu et al 2020b in addition the fluorescent eem spectroscopy showed that all dom samples were characterized with four main peaks i e protein tyrosine em ex 320 230 nm peak a tryptophan em ex 320 280 nm peak b fulvic em ex 420 230 nm peak c and humic like em ex 470 340 nm peak d peaks fig 5 as for the mw fractionated samples the fulvic and humic like fluorophores were located mainly in the lmw fraction while the tyrosine and tryptophan like fluorophores became the main components in the hmw fractions which were consistent with other sediment doms xu et al 2019b thus the sedimentary doms were characterized with obvious mw dependent heterogeneities in abundances and compositions 3 4 2 potential of ho formation derived from sedimentary doms to explore the mw dependent heterogeneities of sedimentary doms in ho formation the potential of ho generation derived by the bulk and mw fractionated doms are shown in fig 6 a for each dom sample the lmw fraction was generally characterized with highest ho formation potential followed by the bulk and hmw counterparts taken s6 for example the potential of ho formation derived by lmw fraction 1 58 0 12 Œºmol l 1 was 2 19 and 7 31 times higher than that induced by the bulk 0 72 0 11 Œºmol l 1 and hmw 0 22 0 02 Œºmol l 1 counterparts respectively similar results that lmw fraction benefiting the ho formation can also be found in our previous studies which focused on the photochemical formation of ho from the river and lake waters xu et al 2020b according to the results of fluorescent spectroscopy the lmw fractions for all doms were characterized with the richness of the humic like substances which was considered as the critical components for the enhanced ho formation potential due to the abundant carboxyl groups xu et al 2020b based on the abundance of sedimentary doms and their ho formation potential it can be calculated that sedimentary doms contributed about 2 11 of the total ho production table s2 it should be noted that contribution of sedimentary doms observed herein contained those of doms themselves and impurities such as fe even with a low contribution role of the soluble fe in influencing dom induced ho production merit the further investigation in future studies it was noted that mineral fe ii and dom in sediment matrix can interact each other which can resultantly promote the potential of electron donor and ho formation page et al 2013 2012 trusiak et al 2018 a recent study indicated that the fe ii dom interaction was responsible for h2o2 production the precursor of ho in the aquifers zhang et al 2020 in this study the co oxygenation experiments of dom and fe ii demonstrated that additional ho could be formed due to the fe ii dom interaction fig 6b the addition concentration of ho ranged from 0 21 to 0 72 Œºmol l 1 which contributed about 2 6 of the total ho production table s2 presenting a new insight into the ho formation the results indicated that the contribution of the mineral fe ii dom interaction should not be ignored in the studies of ho formation from sediment oxygenation 3 5 significance of this study to our knowledge this is the first study revealing the simultaneous influences of fe ii and dom species as well as the fe ii dom interaction on sedimentary ho formation during oxygenation processes several implications of this work should be considered for the study of ho in which fe ii and dom are involved first the content of sedimentary fe silicates and or the peroxidase like activity may be an appropriate indicator to indicate ho formation potential for instance compared to other sediment samples the sediments in s6 were characterized with more sedimentary fe smectite that possessed high peroxidase like activity and thus a higher potential of ho formation second for the sedimentary doms heterogeneity in mw distribution within the bulk samples should be considered when explaining the potential of doms on ho formation the low molecular weight lmw 1 kda fraction was characterized with the richness of the humic like substances and exhibited higher ho formation potential than the bulk and high molecular weight hmw 1 kda 0 45 Œºm counterparts another implication is that the mineral fe ii dom interaction which presented an underestimated generation pathway for ho should not be ignored when exploring the factors regulating ho formation in this study the fe ii dom interaction contributed 2 6 to the total ho production it should be noted that only one fe ii species with the fixed concentration was selected in the co incubation experiment fig 6b while the sedimentary fe ii exhibited a wide variation in abundance and species consequently further researches on the contribution of the interactions between fe species and doms to sedimentary ho formation should be considered and quantified for a better understanding of the potential of ho from the oxygenation processes due to the confluence of the five major rivers in jiangxi the contaminants from almost the whole province are concentrated in lake poyang lu et al 2012 shankman and liang 2003 the deteriorated aquatic environment in lake poyang has been received increasing attentions in recent years li et al 2020 as well documented ho possesses high efficiency for the removal of organic contaminants in the ecosystems cheng et al 2020 kilic et al 2019 zhang et al 2018 recent studies also provided direct evidences that ho formed through reduced substrates oxygenation can oxidize contaminants such as arsenic tetracycline and phenol in the sediment tong et al 2016 xie et al 2020 the formation of sedimentary ho during the oxygenation processes may thus play an important role in the purification and restoration of the contaminated sediments in lake poyang and other seasonal lakes or rivers 4 conclusions nineteen naturally collected sediment samples in lake poyang were selected for the oxygenation process the sedimentary ho generated by the oxygenation of reduced substances was widespread but with different extents due to different physicochemical properties of sediment samples the sedimentary ho formation potential was highly dependent on not only the contents but also the species of fe ii and dom sedimentary fe smectite was considered as the key species for ho formation due to its high peroxidase like activity the lmw fraction within the sedimentary dom exhibited higher ho formation potential than the bulk and hmw counterparts in addition the omnipresent mineral fe ii dom interaction in the sediment matrix also contributed to ho formation findings in this study provide new insights into the evaluation of the formation potential of sedimentary ho in the seasonal lake which is essential for the understanding of the behavior and
